In awarding aid, IU South Bend recognizes two distinct criteria: (1) scholastic ability, used in the awarding of scholarships; and (2) financial need, used in the awarding of all federal and state financial aid. Financial need is the difference between the expected family contribution and the cost of attendance, and is determined by information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students may qualify for one or more of the following types of financial aid: scholarships, grants, loans, or student employment. IU South Bend recognizes that each student and family is different; if the family situation changes after filing the FAFSA, contact the financial aid office so they can determine if changes should be made. Information provided on any document is held in the highest confidence, according to university policy. To be considered for the maximum available state and federal financial aid, the FAFSA should be completed by March 1 to ensure it is received by the annual March 10 deadline, as established by the State Student Assistance Commission for Indiana (SSACI). Complete applications are processed in date received order. Students must apply for financial aid each year by completing the FAFSA or Renewal FAFSA. Visit www.fafsa.ed.gov to complete the FAFSA or Renewal FAFSA. The FAFSA for the next academic year is available online after January 1.

In addition, all first-time loan borrowers in the Stafford Loan Program must complete an entrance interview before loan funds are disbursed. Go online to https:// studentloans.gov for more information. If financial aid awards are greater than the amount of tuition and fees due, the Office of the Bursar issues refunds no earlier than 10 days before the beginning of each semester. Students have 14 days from the date student loans credit to their bursar account to cancel any loan disbursements. STUDENT STATUS AND MINIMUM REGISTRATION To qualify for most federal financial aid, you must be formally admitted and enrolled in a degree-granting program. Award amounts may vary based on actual enrollment. Some awards require full-time enrollment while Pell Grants may be awarded for less than half-time enrollment. Half-time status for undergraduate students is 6 credit hours per semester; for graduate students, half-time status is 4 credit hours. Full-time status for undergraduate students is 12 credit hours per semester; for graduate students, full-time status is 8 credit hours per semester.

No financial aid funds are disbursed until the verification documents are reviewed. It is recommended that students and parents check the box on the FAFSA to have IRS data imported. This may complete portions of the verification process. lOAN DEFAUlT /P E ll G RANT R EPAYMENT Students are not eligible to receive state or federal financial assistance if they are in default on any Title IV loan (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Ford Direct Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, Federally Insured Loan, or Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students), or owe a repayment on any Title IV grant, such as the Federal Pell Grant or Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant received for attendance at any institution.

GENERA l INFORMATION 417 FEDERA l FINANCIA l AID PROGRAMS Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants Federal Pell Grants are available only to undergraduate students and do not have to be repaid. The grant is based on financial need and the amount received is determined by your family contribution as calculated from your FAFSA data, and your enrollment (full-, three-quarter-, half-, or less than half-time). Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) are funds provided to the institution to award to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. Funding is limited, so students must meet the March 10 priority deadline to be considered. Federal Work-Study Program Federal work-study is on-campus employment or employment at an approved community service work-study site off campus. To be eligible for work-study, students must demonstrate financial need. Students typically work 15-20 hours per week and must be enrolled at least half time (6 credit hours per term for undergraduates or 4 credit hours per term for graduates) to receive this award during the academic year. Full-time work-study is available during summer, even though the student might not be enrolled in courses during either summer session. Federal Family Education loan Program The Federal Family Education Loan Program is the United States Department of Education's major form of self-help aid. Loans may either be subsidized or unsubsidized. Subsidized loans are based on a student's financial need and do not require a student to make any interest payments while in school. Unsubsidized loans are not based on financial need and accrue interest from the time the loan is disbursed. Annual subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts for dependent students are as follows: Students Amount First year $5,500 Second year $6, 500 Third year $7, 500 Fourth year $7, 500 Annual subsidized and unsubsidized loan amounts for independent students are as follows: Maximum Students Amount Subsidized First year $9,500 $3,500 Second year $10,500 $4,500 Third year $12, 500 $5, 500 Fourth year $12, 500 $5, 500 Graduate students may borrow a maximum of $8,500 in subsidized loans annually and $12,000 in unsubsidized loans.Note: These awards are determined by the federal government and are subject to change. Federal Perkins loan The Federal Perkins Loan is awarded on a funds- available basis, providing students complete the FAFSA annually by the March 10 deadline preceding the next academic year of enrollment. The maximum amount of the loan is determined annually and depends upon funding available. The sum of Federal Perkins Loans made to students for both undergraduate and graduate education may not exceed $40,000. Both undergraduate and graduate students must be registered at least half time to receive these funds.

REFUNDS AND REPAYMENT POlICY FOR S TUDENTS R ECEIVING F EDERA l F INANCIA l A SSISTANCE Students receiving federal Title IV assistance are subject to all institutional policies regarding refunds and course enrollment. In addition, if you receive Title IV assistance, you are subject to additional refund and repayment policies mandated by the federal government. Title IV funding includes the following: Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan (subsidized and unsubsidized), Federal PLUS Loan, and other programs. Repayment procedures are applied consistently to all Title IV recipients who withdraw within the designated time frames. Students (or the institution on the student's behalf) who withdraw from courses or do not attend classes for any given term, may be required to return all or a portion of the federal funds received for that term. This is calculated through the Return of Title IV Funds formula determined by the United States Department of Education. The federal formula is applicable to students receiving federal aid, other than Federal Work-Study, if the student withdraws on or before the 60 percent point in the semester. The calculation determines the percentage of Title IV aid to be returned by dividing the number of calendar days remaining in the semester by the total number of calendar days in the semester. Scheduled breaks of five or more consecutive days are excluded. Once the percentage is determined, funds are returned to federal programs in this order: Federal Stafford Loan Unsubsidized, Federal Stafford Loan Subsidized, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, other state or federal programs, institutional aid, and the student. Policies are subject to change as mandated by federal and state law. Examples of calculations and worksheets used to determine the amount of refund or return of Title IV aid are available in the Office of Financial Aid and Student Scholarships. Note: Students receiving an excess aid check because of a credit balance on their account prior to withdrawing from IU South Bend may be required to repay some of the federal funds. Note: All information is correct at the time of publication. Contact the Office of Financial Aid and Student Scholarships regarding financial aid changes.

INDIANA COllEGE NETWOR k The Indiana College Network (ICN) is a cooperative service of Indiana's colleges and universities and their educational partners. It is operated by the Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS), one of the nation's foremost state educational technology organizations. IHETS was established by the Indiana General Assembly in 1967, and under its guidance a statewide higher education leadership committee created the Indiana College Network in 1994, making ICN the first such virtual university consortium in the country. All members are accredited by the North Central Association (NCA) Higher Learning Commission. High school programs are accredited by NCA's Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement. Through the ICN, Indiana colleges and universities work together to help students learn about and enroll in the wide range of programs and courses available at a distance. The ICN process has as its ultimate goal the transfer of courses from one institution to another. Distance learning provides a tremendous opportunity for those whose obligations or schedules prevent them from realizing their educational dreams. ICN member institutions are experienced in helping distant students. All pay close attention to assure that distant students receive quality instruction. They offer individual courses as well as complete certificate and degree programs for students from middle school, high school dual credit, undergraduate, graduate school, and beyond. Any public or private university or college may be an ICN member. Those actively participating include Indiana State University, Indiana Tech, Indiana University and its regional campuses, IPFW, IUPUI, the various Ivy Tech Community College campuses, Purdue University, Taylor University Online, University of Southern Indiana, and Vincennes University.

Students are expected to explain to the instructors the causes of these absences and to make up all work to the satisfaction of the instructors. From Final Examinations A student who fails to attend the final examination of a course and who has a passing grade up to that time may, at the discretion of the instructor, be given a grade of I (Incomplete). ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Students are expected to adhere to the highest ethical standards in all their course work and research. Individuals violating those standards are subject to disciplinary action; such breaches could lead to expulsion of the student from Indiana University or to rescission of a degree already granted. ACADEMIC RENEWA l POlICY General Considerations The academic renewal policy encourages capable, mature, undergraduate students to return to IU South Bend after they were academically unsuccessful during an earlier attempt at higher education within the Indiana University system. This policy pertains only to undergraduate students who do not have a bachelor's degree. Meant to apply campuswide to all IU South Bend academic units, the academic renewal option described here exists only on the IU South Bend campus and not on any other campus of Indiana University. Students who wish to apply for renewal must contact their respective academic units at the time of application for readmission. If renewal is granted, all grades earned prior to the renewal are no longer used in the calculation of the cumulative program grade point average, which is reset to zero. The university grade point average (GPA) is not reset due to the application of academic renewal. Course work from other IU campuses can be considered for academic renewal. Academic Renewal Policy The academic renewal option described here is subject to the following considerations: 1. The IU South Bend academic renewal policy applies to any former Indiana University student who; \u0083has not yet completed a bachelor's degree, and \u0083has not attended any campus of Indiana University for a minimum of the last three years (36 months). 2. Academic renewal applies to all Indiana University course work taken prior to readmission to IU South Bend. A student seeking academic renewal may not exempt certain courses from the application of the renewal policy. Furthermore, this policy is inapplicable to any grades issued owing to academic dishonesty. As a precondition of any student receiving academic renewal, the registrar's office formally evaluates the student's record to identify any grades resulting from academic dishonesty. 3. Academic renewal may be invoked only once over the course of a student's academic career at IU South Bend. 4. Because academic renewal is aimed at academically unsuccessful students, the grade point average (GPA) for the period for which renewal is sought must be lower than 2.0. 5. The policy is applied after a probationary period in which the student earns at least 12 credit hours with a minimum grade of C+ (2.3 GPA) in all courses attempted. 6. Academic renewal does not occur automatically: A student must apply for academic renewal, and the petition must be approved by the student's academic unit. If the petition is approved, all grades earned prior to the renewal are no longer used in the calculation of the program GPA. The GPA earned after academic renewal takes effect is subject to each academic unit's rules regarding academic probation and dismissal. 7. Although the grades in the courses to which academic renewal is applied are not considered in calculating the GPA, the courses themselves may still be used to satisfy credit hour and degree requirements if the original grades earned are C (2.0) or higher. 8. After approval of the req uest for academic renewal, a student must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours (including the 12 credit hour probationary period) on the IU South Bend campus to meet the graduation residency requirement and must complete a minimum of 60 credit hours to merit graduation with academic distinction. 9. Invocation of the academic renewal option does not preclude a student's using other available, course-specific grade replacement options, subject to each academic unit's rules and procedures and the conditions set out in the IU South Bend Grade Replacement Policy. 10. Academic renewal is available only for courses taken at Indiana University. Each academic unit retains the right to consider records of performance from other universities in determining admission to the academic unit, the granting of honors and academic distinction, and other matters.ACADEMIC REGU lATIONS AND PO lICIES 4 29 ACADEMIC STANDING The university has established levels of competency, according to GPA and semesters completed, which determine whether an undergraduate student is making satisfactory academic progress, is on probation, probation with impact, or ineligible to continue studies. Satisfactory Academic Progress A student whose cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is 2.0 or higher is considered to be making satisfactory academic progress. Probation A student who has completed one or more IU South Bend GPA hours and has a CGPA below 2.0 is placed on probation. A probationary student remains on probation until the CGPA reaches 2.0 or higher. Probation with Impact A student who is on probation and fails to achieve a semester (fall, spring, or combined summer session) GPA of at least 2.0 will be placed on probation with impact. Academic units may impose additional enrollment restrictions on such students (e.g., limited to half-time enrollment). Dismissal A student who is on probation with impact and fails to achieve a semester (fall, spring, or combined summer session) GPA of at least 2.0 will be dismissed from the university. Students who are dismissed for the first time cannot enroll until one regular (fall or spring) semester has elapsed and must petition by the established deadline to be reinstated. Students who are dismissed multiple times must remain out of the university for at least two regular semesters and must petition by the established deadline to be reinstated. Reinstatement Reinstatement will be the decision of the academic unit to which the student petitions. A student who is reinstated will be on probation with impact until the CGPA reaches 2.0 or higher. ADDITION OF COURSES /lATE REGISTRATION Undergraduate students are permitted to register late or add courses only during the first two weeks of the semester (first week in summer sessions). Students who register late or add a course during the first week of classes may register online via OneStart. Students who wish to register late or add a course during the second week of classes must get an add slip from the Gateway Information Center or the office of their academic program and secure the signature of the instructor. Note: Special fees are assessed for most late registrations and schedule adjustments.ASSESSING STUDENT OUTCOMES Students are expected to assist in the assessment process as defined by their academic departments and the campus assessment committee. Assessment processes may include activities as varied as opinion surveys, focus groups, portfolios, and capstone courses. \u0083The goal of assessing student outcomes at IU South Bend is to help the university realize its mission for the student body. \u0083The objective of the assessment process is to involve the faculty, the students, and the community in the effort to review student outcomes. \u0083The purpose of assessing student outcomes is to identify program strengths and elements in need of improvement. AUDIT POlICY Courses may be taken on an official audit basis. No credit is given for the courses, but the audited courses are indicated on the student's transcript. Any work required of auditors must be agreed upon by the instructor and the auditor. Any academic program has the option to exclude auditors from a particular course. Changes from audit status to credit status and vice versa can be made only with the permission of the instructor and no later than the deadline for midterm grades. Auditing students pay the same fees as credit students, and incur a program change fee beginning the second week of classes. Contact the Office of the Registrar for details on auditing procedures. CAMPUSWIDE GENERA l-EDUCATION RE q UIREMENTS Refer to pages 35-40 for a description of the campuswide general-education requirements that apply to all bachelor's degree programs for students matriculating in the fall of 2005 and subsequent semesters.

CREDIT BY EXAMINATION Students may receive credit for College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) examinations; and by successful performance on appropriate examinations while at IU South Bend. Students who believe they are eligible for special credit because of superior preparation or independent study are urged to accelerate their degree completion in this manner. Where credit by examination is awarded by the university, that credit is recorded with a grade of S on the student's transcript unless the examination clearly merits an A grade. Failure to pass the examination carries no penalty and is not recorded. The credit hour fee for credit by examination is determined by the Indiana University Board of Trustees.

It is expected, however, that a substantial part of every student's work, especially in the major field of study, be completed at IU South Bend. A maximum of 90 semester hours or 135 quarter hours of transferred credits from four-year institutions, or a maximum of 60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours of transferred credits from two-year institutions can apply towards degree requirements. Ordinarily, a maximum number of transfer credit hours from a bachelor's degree (including credit earned at other Indiana University campuses) may be counted toward the minimum credit hours necessary for graduation (approximately 120). Students wishing to transfer from another Indiana University campus to IU South Bend must present a letter of good standing from that campus. Only courses with a grade of C or above are transferrable. Courses with C- or below do not transfer to IU South Bend. DEAN'S lIST All IU South Bend students who complete at least 6 credit hours of graded course work in a semester are eligible for an academic program's Dean's List. If students complete at least 12 credit hours of graded course work ACADEMIC REGU lATIONS AND PO lICIES 4 31 in a semester they are placed on the Dean's List if they have a GPA of 3.5 or greater in that semester. If they have completed between 6 and 11 credit hours of graded course work in a semester they are placed on the Dean's List if they have a GPA of 3.5 or greater and they have a CGPA of 3.24 or greater. DEFERRED GRADES The deferred grade of R is assigned for research courses in which the student's work is evaluated when the research is completed. It may also be used at the end of the first term of a two-term course or a course that overlaps two terms if the course is announced as a deferred grade course in the Schedule of Classes. If work is interrupted due to extenuating circumstances, a special arrangement between student and instructor must be made on a term-to-term basis. If a student drops out of a course before the work is complete, the instructor assigns a regular grade (A, B, C, W, etc.) for the course. Specific courses in the departments of English and mathematical sciences have an alternate grading policy where the R grade may be used. A student given this alternate grade is subject to having an administrative course adjustment processed at the end of the semester. DEGREE REqUIREMENTS Students are responsible for understanding all requirements for graduation, for completing them by the time they expect to graduate, and for applying for graduation. May, June, and August degree candidates must apply for graduation by October 1; while December degree candidates must apply for graduation by March 1. Requests for deviation from program requirements may be granted only by written approval from the respective chairperson, program director, or dean (or their respective administrative representative). Disposition at each level is final. DRUG-FREE CAMPUS POlICY Students are prohibited by Indiana University from using or possessing alcoholic beverages, any drug or controlled substance, or drug paraphernalia on university property or in the course of a university or student organization activity. Students are responsible for acquainting themselves with this policy and with sanctions for violation of the policy. EMERGENCY ClOSING The primary person responsible for making the decision to close or cancel classes at IU South Bend is the chancellor. In the chancellor's absence, the vice chancellor for academic affairs will make the decision. IU South Bend has aligned itself with the South Bend Community School Corporation (SBCSC) and, in most cases, will cancel all classes at all campuses when the SBCSC cancels classes due to weather conditions.IU South Bend off-campus centers are also aligned with their respective school districts and in most cases will cancel classes in those locations when the local school district cancels classes. This includes the Elkhart and Concord school districts. When the main IU South Bend campus is closed, classes at all sites will be cancelled. The campus is notified of any closing or emergency situation through the IU South Bend IU Notify system which includes telephone calls, e-mail, and text messaging. Information is also delivered by the administration through telephone trees, switchboard messages, the campus electronic bulletin board, the IU South Bend website, and local news media. ENROllMENT RESTRICTION No undergraduate student, except those who declare business as their major, is allowed to take more than 23 percent of his or her course work credit hours in business courses under any circumstances. The undergraduate business program has the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of this requirement. Any minor in business is subject to approval by the undergraduate business program office. FINAl EXAMINATION SCHEDU lING POlICY Students are to be notified by the instructor of any deviation from the published final examination schedule no later than six weeks prior to the beginning of the final examination period. In the event a student is scheduled to take more than two final examinations on the same day, the student may exercise the following options: \u0083Take final examinations as scheduled. \u0083Consult with the instructor or academic program giving the final examination to determine if any make-up examination(s) is or can be scheduled. If no make-up examination is available, then the student must notify the instructor or academic program of the course scheduled for the third (and additional) final examination of the day. That instructor or that academic program is then obligated to adjust the student's final examination schedule, provided the student has notified that instructor or academic program 30 calendar days or more prior to the date on which the final examination scheduling conflict exists. GRADE GRIEVANCES If a student disputes his or her final course grade, the student must obtain a Student Initiated Grade Change Request Form from the Office of the Registrar, prepare a personal statement documenting the reason(s) for the change of grade, and discuss the matter with the faculty member assigning the grade no later than the end of the next regular semester. The student should provide copies of applicable supporting documentation as part of the appeal process. After the student has met with the faculty member and has received their recommendation of yes or no, they will need to obtain recommendations from the faculty member's department chair or area coordinator (if applicable) and dean. Completed Student 323 ACADEMIC REGU lATIONS AND PO lICIES Initiated Grade Change Request Forms, personal statements, and supporting documentation need to returned to the Office of the Registrar for review by the Academic Affairs Committee (AAC). The AAC will review the appeal and forward a recommendation to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for a final decision. GRADE REPlACEMENT POlICY The IU South Bend Grade Replacement Policy modifies the current Indiana University Faculty Council FX policy by broadening the replacement option to courses in which an undergraduate student receives any grade except a W, I, or NC. The purpose of this expansion is to allow an IU South Bend student who has done poorly in a course, even if he or she has not failed the course, to repeat the course and remove the weight of the earlier grade from the student's cumulative grade point average. This modified grade replacement policy applies only to courses taken on the IU South Bend campus. Courses taken on other Indiana University campuses can still be replaced, but only under the old system. That is, only if the original grades in those courses were F's. This grade replacement policy follows the Indiana University system's general rule that a student can replace (i.e., FX) a maximum of three courses or a maximum of 10 credit hours (whichever comes first). Any FX courses prior to the fall of 2004 are included in this 10 credit hour maximum. A student can repeat a course for which grade replacement is sought only once. A student who wishes to apply for grade replacement must obtain the approval of his or her academic unit. Some IU South Bend academic units may not honor the grade replacement policy when they consider, for example, admission to the academic unit, the granting of honors and academic distinction, and other matters. Therefore, each student is advised to check beforehand with his or her academic unit regarding the rules and restrictions that may apply. Furthermore, every student should recognize that other higher education institutions may not honor this grade replacement policy. Some particularly competitive undergraduate programs and most graduate-level programs in medicine, law, and other fields may use the original grades for the purposes of determining the grade point average required for admission. The grade replacement option is subject to the following considerations: 1. The IU South Bend grade replacement policy applies to undergraduate courses taken by students who do not have a bachelor's degree. If a bachelor's degree has been awarded, in no case may a grade be replaced for a course taken prior to the awarding of that degree. 2. This policy merely excludes certain grades from the calculation of the cumulative grade point average (CGPA). All grades remain a part of a student's academic record; a notation on the transcript indicates if a grade is not included in the GPA calculation. In determining admission, the meeting of degree requirements, the granting of honors and academic distinction, and other matters, each academic unit may use a GPA calculation that does not honor grade replacement. The GPA earned after grade replacement is subject to each academic unit's rules regarding academic probation and dismissal. In short, each academic unit retains the right to consider, for internal purposes, a student's complete academic record. 3. Under this policy, a student can replace the grades in any course taken at IU South Bend, except courses in which the student received the grades of W, I, or NC. However, courses taken at any other Indiana University campus can be replaced only if a student received the grade of F. 4. A student may exercise the grade replacement policy for a maximum of three courses or 10 credit hours (whichever comes first). The 10 credit hour limit includes any courses previously replaced under the FX policy prior to 2004 and any previously FX'd courses that were approved for academic renewal. A student may exercise the grade replacement policy only once for any single course. 5. Grade replacement under this policy ordinarily is available for undergraduate courses with fixed credit hours and fixed topics. The course in which the student reenrolls must be the same course for which grade replacement is sought. Grades in courses that have different titles or variable topics may be replaced only if the content in both courses is the same. In such cases, a student may petition to replace a grade in one course with the grade earned in another course, provided the two courses are equivalent. To determine equivalence, a comparison of course descriptions alone is not adequate. In making this determination, the faculty offering the course shall apply the same criteria as used in evaluating courses for transfer purposes. 6. Once invoked, a student may not subsequently request reversal of the grade replacement granted to a particular course. 7. Subject to the restrictions set out in earlier paragraphs, a student who received academic renewals may still use grade replacement for work taken subsequent to the granting of academic renewal. 8. Grade replacement does not happen automatically. It is the responsibility of the student who wishes to repeat a course in order to replace the grade to consult with his or her academic unit regarding its policies. 9. Enforcement of the grade replacement policy is the responsibility of the academic unit that certifies a student's fulfillment of degree requirements. Problems relating to the policy are referred to the academic unit's dean or equivalent. 10. IU South Bend joins all other campuses in honoring the principle that the grade policies on the degree-granting campus are applicable to each student. Hence, if an IU South Bend student transfers to another Indiana University campus, IU South Bend honors requests from that campus, on behalf of the student, to replace a grade earned at IU South Bend. ACADEMIC REGU lATIONS AND PO lICIES 4 33 Were the student to return to IU South Bend for graduation, however, the student must check with their academic unit for their policies regarding grade replacement. 11. This policy is inapplicable to any grades issues owing to academic dishonesty. As a precondition of any student receiving academic renewal, the registrar's office formally evaluates the student's record to identify any grades resulting from academic dishonesty. GRADING CODE The official grade code of the university is as follows: A (highest passing grade), B, C, D (lowest passing grade), F (Fail), I (Incomplete), P (Pass), S (Satisfactory), and W (Withdrawn). I, P, S, and W are not calculated in a student's GPA, but the grade of F is calculated as 0 points. Quality points are assigned for purposes of determining the CGPA as follows: Grading Code Scale A+ = 4.0 C+ = 2.3 A = 4.0 C = 2.0 A- = 3.7 C- = 1.7 B+ = 3.3 D+ = 1.3 B = 3.0 D = 1.0 B- = 2.7 D- = 0.7 F = 0 GRADE POINT AVERAGE A minimum CGPA of 2.0 (C) is required for undergraduates. Transfer students admitted from other institutions with deficiencies in credit points are expected to overcome those deficiencies with IU South Bend grades. GRADUATION REqUIREMENTS It is expected that a substantial part of the course work done by students who intend to graduate from IU South Bend, especially in their major field, be completed on the IU South Bend campus. Candidates ordinarily are not recommended to receive the bachelor's degree from IU South Bend unless they earn 30 hours of credit at this campus. Specific academic program requirements for graduation should also be noted in the respective sections of this publication. Degrees are conferred in December, May, and August. Commencement is conducted in May. Students who intend to complete their degree work within a given year must apply for graduation by the deadline. May, June, and August degree candidates must apply for graduation by October 1, while December degree candidates must apply for graduation by March 1. GRADUATION WITH DISTINCTION Graduates whose minimum GPAs are 3.9 and who complete at least 60 credit hours at IU South Bend are graduated with highest distinction; those whose minimum GPAs are 3.8 and who complete at least 60 credit hours at IU South Bend are graduated with high distinction; and those whose minimum GPAs are 3.65 and who complete at least 60 credit hours at IU South Bend are graduated with distinction. These honors are noted on diplomas and in Commencement programs. Students who earn them are eligible to wear the cream and crimson fourrag\u00e9re at Commencement. Some programs limit the number of students awarded distinction to the top 10 percent of the graduating class. Others may use different criteria for awarding distinction. INCOMP lETE GRADES A grade of I (Incomplete) may be given when a substantial amount of the course work (75 percent) is satisfactorily completed by the end of the semester. The grade of I is given only when the completed portion of the student's work is of passing quality. The grade of I is awarded only under circumstances of hardship, when it is unjust to hold a student to the time limits ordinarily fixed for completion of course work. A student must remove the I within a calendar year from the date of its recording or, if required by the instructor, in a shorter time period. The academic program head may authorize adjustments of this period in exceptional circumstances. If the student fails to remove the I within the time allowed, the grade is changed to F. Students may not register for credit in a course in which they have a grade of I. These regulations do not apply to courses in which completion of the course work is not usually required at the end of the semester. Incomplete work in those courses is denoted by R (deferred grade). INDEPENDENT /CORRESPONDENCE STUDY The Indiana University School of Continuing Studies offers interested individuals the option of taking university courses, both credit and noncredit, at home through the Indiana University independent study division. Credit earned in correspondence courses is not counted toward any graduate degree. It is possible, however, that such work may be used by the student to make up entrance deficiencies. For more information, call continuing education at (877) 462-4872, extension 4261; or off-campus programs at (800) 321-7834.

Official transcripts cannot be sent via fax. PASS /FAI l O PTION During the undergraduate program, a student in good standing (not on probation) may enroll in up to a maximum of eight elective courses to be taken with a grade of P (Pass) or F (Fail). The Pass/Fail option may not be taken when otherwise restricted by academic program regulations. The Pass/Fail option is open for a maximum of two courses per year, including summer sessions; for this option, the year is defined as August 15 to August 14. A course selected for Pass/Fail must be an elective; it may not be used to satisfy academic program requirements. Part-time students may select two Pass/Fail courses per 30 credit hours. A student must file a Pass/Fail option request by the end of the third week of class. This is done by consulting the student's academic program and completing an option form. Once the option request has been processed, it is final and cannot be reversed. At the end of the course, the letter grade given by the instructor is converted by the records office into a final grade of either P (A, B, C, or D) or F. A grade of P cannot be changed subsequently to a grade of A, B, C, or D. A grade of P is not counted in computing GPAs; the grade of F is included. READMISSION In special cases, a student who was dismissed may petition a faculty committee, through the head of the appropriate academic program, for readmission. Because petitions must be submitted sufficiently in advance of the semester or session to which readmission is sought, students must consult with the appropriate academic program head as early as possible. RElEASE OF INFORMATION IN STUDENT R ECORDS An implicit and justifiable assumption of trust is placed in the university as custodian of personal data submitted by a student entering the university or generated during enrollment. This mutual relationship of trust between the university and the individual student requires that such data be held in confidence. The university responds to requests for confidential data (that is, information not normally available to the general public) in compliance with the amended Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974.ACADEMIC REGU lATIONS AND PO lICIES 4 35 RElIGIOUS OBSERVANCES Indiana University respects the right of all students to observe their religious holidays and makes reasonable accommodation, upon request, for such observances. Refer to the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct for details. Visit www. dsa.indiana.edu/code to view a copy on the web. SATISFACTORY /FAI l C OURSES A number of IU South Bend courses are offered with an S/F (Satisfactory/Fail) option. For a given semester, the course is graded either S/F or with regular letter grades (A, B, C, D, F). All students in the course must be graded under one or the other options. A grade of S cannot subsequently be changed to a regular letter grade, nor can a regular letter grade be changed to an S. S/F graded courses are not counted as part of a student's Pass/Fail option. S/F graded courses are noted in the Schedule of Classes. A grade of S is not counted in computing GPAs; the grade of F is included. SECOND DEGREE Normally the holder of a bachelor's degree who wishes to pursue further education is encouraged to become qualified for admission to graduate study. In certain cases, however, a student is admitted to candidacy for a second bachelor's degree. When such admission is granted, candidates normally must earn at least 30 additional credit hours in residence and meet the requirements of the academic program in which they are candidates. SEMESTER lOAD A typical full-time undergraduate academic load is 12 to 18 credit hours with an average of approximately 15 credit hours for the fall or spring semesters. Full-time enrollment in either the fall, spring, or summer semesters is a minimum of 12 credit hours. An undergraduate student expecting to carry more than 18 credit hours should have a CGPA of B (3.0) average or have earned a B (3.0) average in the last full semester. SOCIAl SECURITY NUMBER Students or applicants are advised that the requested disclosure of their Social Security number to designated offices is voluntary except in regard to the financial aid application. Students have the right to refuse disclosure of this number or request its removal from records without penalty. The student's Social Security number is not disclosed to individuals or agencies outside Indiana University except in accordance with the Indiana University policy of release of student information. STUDENT RECORD ACCESS Indiana University's annual notification of student rights: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. These rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's educational records within 45 days of the day the university receives a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The university official makes arrangements for access and notifies the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student' s educational records that they believe are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the university to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They must write the university official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the university decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the university notifies the student of the decision and advises the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedure is provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's educational records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Indiana University Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educational record to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the university may disclose educational records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. Finally, public information may be released freely unless the student files the appropriate form requesting that certain public information not be released. This form is available at the Office of the Registrar. Public information is limited to name; address; telephone; major field of study; dates of attendance; admission or enrollment status; campus; school, or division; class standing; degrees and awards; activities; sports; and athletic information. 4. The right to file a complaint with the United States Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Indiana University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. 363 ACADEMIC REGU lATIONS AND PO lICIES TOBACCO-FREE CAMPUS IU South Bend is a tobacco-free campus. Indiana University has determined that all campuses will be smoke free in order to promote the health and well-being of employees, students, and others on campus. In brief, the policy for IU South Bend states that the use and sale of tobacco and tobacco products is prohibited on university owned-, operated-, or leased-properties. The parking lots and garage owned by the university are included in the ban. However, the use of tobacco products in personal vehicles is allowed, provided users make a reasonable effort to contain smoke and smoking materials inside the vehicle. WITHDRAWA l Withdrawal from the University Students must notify the head of their academic program if they intend to withdraw from school during the semester. Students who fail to officially withdraw receive grades of F in all courses in which they are enrolled at the time of their unofficial withdrawal. Students who withdraw during the first ten weeks of a regular semester or during the first four weeks of a summer session automatically receive a grade of W on the date of withdrawal. The only exceptions are: \u0083Courses dropped during the first week of classes do not show on the student's permanent record. \u0083The automatic withdrawal period for courses that do not meet for the full regular semester or summer session is prorated at approximately 60 percent of the course duration. \u0083Students in music ensembles or applied music should contact the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts for information on withdrawals. After the tenth week in spring and fall semesters and the fourth week in summer sessions withdrawal requires extraordinary situations beyond the student's control. Appropriate forms for processing withdrawals must be obtained by the student from the Gateway Information Center or the office of their academic program. In addition to the signature and assigned grade of W or F by the instructor, the student must obtain the signature of their academic program head. Poor performance in a course is not considered grounds for a late withdrawal. Additional details and dates are outlined in the Schedule of Classes. No withdrawal forms will be processed in the Office of the Registrar after the last day of classes. Requests for withdrawal after the last day of classes must follow the grade appeal process. Students with financial aid must contact the Office of Financial Aid and Student Scholarships prior to withdrawing from any course due to possible financial consequences. Note: Termination of class attendance does not constitute official withdrawal and results in a grade of F. Students must officially withdraw from the course.Withdrawal for Reserves Called to Active Duty Any student called to active duty may withdraw from all courses and receive a 100 percent refund of tuition and fees. Alternatively, with the permission of the instructor(s), a student may receive an incomplete or a final grade in the courses taken. Either alternative may occur anytime during the semester through the end of final examinations. If the withdrawal is processed after the first week of classes, the grade of W is assigned initially. Students receiving financial aid are subject to refund policies as provided for by the agencies sponsoring the aid. The request to withdraw must be made within one week of being called to active duty and may be made by either the student or other responsible party who has the student's military information. Students who wish to withdraw from courses as a result of being called to active duty must provide a copy of their orders to the Office of the Registrar along with a signed note asking to be withdrawn. These materials may be delivered in person, through the mail, or faxed to the Office of the Registrar. The Office of the Registrar notifies the student's instructor, school, and other campus offices. Students or other responsible parties may wish to call the Office of the Registrar first to begin the withdrawal process, with the understanding that a copy of the orders must be forthcoming. WORk DONE AT MORE THAN ONE I NDIANA U NIVERSITY C AMPUS Students who plan to earn a degree through a degree-granting program on one Indiana University campus and who plan to take a substantial number of hours on one or more of the other Indiana University campuses in partial fulfillment of degree requirements must have their programs of study approved in advance by the degree-granting program. The residency requirement must be met on the campus where the degree-granting program is located. GENERA l EDUCATION lINDA CHEN, ASSISTANT VICE CHANCE llOR FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS ADMINISTRATION A247E // (574) CAMPUSWIDE GENERA l-EDUCATION REqUIREMENTS All students matriculating in the fall of 2005 and subsequent semesters are subject to the campuswide general- education requirements. Individual schools and colleges may establish additional general-education requirements for undergraduate degrees. THE PURPOSE OF GENERA l EDUCATION AT IU SOUTH BEND The purpose of general education at IU South Bend is to prepare students to succeed in their chosen professions and to become valued citizens and leaders within their communities, enriched by their studies and stimulated by the spirit of discovery. The general-education curriculum fosters a learning environment that serves the academic, civic, cultural, and career needs of an educated citizen within the global community. The general-education curriculum at IU South Bend complements the depth and focus of our major programs and ensures that graduates have the breadth of experience that enables them to think critically, communicate clearly, act professionally and ethically, and appreciate wisdom and beauty. It provides students with knowledge of the basic tenets of a variety of academic disciplines and the skills to function effectively in positions of responsibility and leadership. It instills in students an appreciation of the interconnectedness of disciplines, an appreciation of the diversity of human cultures and experiences, self-awareness conducive to personal growth, and a love of learning. 383 GENERA l EDUCATION THE GOAlS OF GENERA l EDUCATION Students who complete the general-education curriculum at IU South Bend can: \u0083Retrieve, evaluate, and use information effectively \u0083Write clearly and correctly, and analyze written texts from a variety of disciplines \u0083Understand, construct, and analyze quantitative arguments Such students also: \u0083Understand, construct, and analyze arguments presented in verbal and visual form \u0083Understand and appreciate the variety of cultures and experiences that contribute to American society \u0083Are familiar with a non-Western culture \u0083Understand the power and purpose of a scientific view of the natural world \u0083Appreciate artistic achievement and the creative process \u0083Understand the importance of literary and intellectual traditions in the shaping of Western culture \u0083Understand factors that shape the behavior of human beings as individuals and as groups \u0083Appreciate the importance of ethical behavior and understand the ethical issues associated with a variety of academic disciplines \u0083Value personal growth and learning THE GENERA l-EDUCATION CURRICU lUM The campuswide general-education curriculum is composed of three elements and requires a total of between 33 and 39 credit hours of course work. \u0083Fundamental literacies courses (13-19 cr.) \u0083Common core courses (12 cr.) \u0083Contemporary social values courses (8 cr.) THE CAMPUS THEME COMPONENT In addition, the General-Education Program includes a campus theme component. The campus theme, which changes annually, connects course work and extracurricular learning. It supports instruction by means of a coordinated program of lectures, exhibits, performances, and other events and activities co-sponsored by various campus schools, departments, and organizations. The purpose of the campus theme component is to extend the liberal arts education of all IU South Bend students beyond the classroom experience. Visit www.iusb. edu/~sbtheme/ for information about the campus theme. SUMMARY OF GENERA l-EDUCATION RE q UIREMENTS (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.) All courses certified as meeting the campuswide general-education requirements for the areas listed below are designated appropriately in the Schedule of Classes. The list of approved courses in each category is subject to change. Visit www.iusb.edu/~gened for updated general- education course lists. Consult degree requirements to determine whether completion of a specific course in any category is preferred or required by a department or program. FUNDAMENTA l lITERACIES (13-19 CR.) The development of certain fundamental skills is necessary for success in academic pursuits and also for success and fulfillment in life beyond the university. Fundamental literacies courses provide introductory training in essential academic skills that students are expected to develop more fully through repeated practice in a wide variety of courses throughout their academic careers. Students must complete one course from each of the following seven areas, as designated in the Schedule of Classes. Writing The campuswide general-education curriculum requires students to demonstrate competence in written composition skills, including development of the ability to analyze written texts from a variety of disciplines and to construct clear and convincing written arguments. A grade of C or higher is required.

COMMON CORE COURSES (12 CR.) Common core courses are designed to give greater coherence to the general-education experience at IU South Bend by demonstrating the productive relationships among disciplines and by emphasizing the value of fundamental literacies from the general-education curriculum. The four common core courses, each of which is offered in several disciplines under specific departmental codes, introduce students to many of the essential intellectual themes of Photo courtesy of Michael Banks 403 GENERA l EDUCATION the four broad (and not mutually exclusive) groupings of disciplines. Students must complete one course from each of the following four areas, as designated in the Schedule of Classes. At least one of the areas must be completed at the 300-level. Common core 300-level courses may have as prerequisite the completion of one or more of the fundamental literacies requirements, and in some cases other prerequisites may also apply. The Natural World This core course introduces students to the methods and logic of science and helps students understand the importance of science to the development of civilization and to the contemporary world. It serves to provide a context within which to evaluate the important scientific and technological issues we face in modern society. Although all sections of The Natural World bear the same title, the content and specific focus of the course varies; each section has a specific subtitle that indicates its particular content and focus. Courses at the 100-level bear the designation N 190 (for instance, BIOL-N 190 The Natural World), and the 300-level Natural World courses appear in the Schedule of Classes as N 390 offerings in the specific disciplines. Select N 190 or N 390 from AST, BIOL, CHEM, CSCI, GEOL, MATH, PHYS, or in any other field in which a course in this category may appear, as designated in the Schedule of Classes. Human Behavior and Social Institutions This course introduces students to the distinctive perspectives the social sciences employ in building an understanding of our world. The course also focuses on the individual in relation to and as a product of that social world. It requires students to develop an appreciation of the processes of social interaction and emphasizes the analytic frameworks and techniques social scientists use to explain the causes and patterns of individual and institutional behavior. Although all sections of Human Behavior and Social Institutions bear the same title, the content and specific focus of the course varies; each section has a specific subtitle that indicates its particular content and focus. Courses at the 100-level bear the designation B 190 (for instance, SOC-B 190 Human Behavior and Social Institutions), and the 300-level Human Behavior and Social Institutions courses appear in the Schedule of Classes as B 399 offerings in the specific disciplines. Select B 190 or B 399 from ANTH, BUS, GEOG, POLS, PSY, SOC, WGS, or any other field in which a course in this category may appear, as designated in the Schedule of Classes. literary and Intellectual Traditions The various versions of this course focus on a topic that can be addressed from more than one disciplinary perspective, and explores ways in which the principal disciplinary approach can be augmented and enriched by readings from other disciplines. Although all sections of Literary and Intellectual Traditions bear the same title, the content and specific focus of the course varies; each section has a specific subtitle that indicates its particular content and focus. Courses at the 100-level bear the designation T 190 (for instance, HIST-T 190 Literary and Intellectual Traditions), and the 300-level Literary and Intellectual Traditions courses appear in the Schedule of Classes as T 390 offerings in the specific disciplines. Select T 190 or T 390 from ENG, CMLT, FREN, GER, HIST, HPSC, PHIL, SPAN, or in any other field in which a course in this category may appear, as designated in the Schedule of Classes. Art, Aesthetics, and Creativity This course explores the human need to experience and comprehend the creative process. It encourages students to experience culture and cultural artifacts as makers, performers, and audiences. Students gain familiarity with the discipline and craft by which artists and performers achieve their characteristic effects, as well as the satisfaction inherent in that process. Versions of this course explore the role of art, music, theatre, and other artistic modes in the formation and expression of a particular culture and encourage respect for diverse cultures and the artifacts they produce. Although all sections of Art, Aesthetics, and Creativity bear the same title, the content and specific focus of the course varies. Each section has a specific subtitle that indicates its particular content and focus. Courses at the 100-level bear the designation A 190 (for instance, FINA-A 190 Art, Aesthetics, and Creativity), and the 300-level Art, Aesthetics, and Creativity courses appear in the Schedule of Classes as A 399 offerings in the specific disciplines. Select A 190 or A 399 from CMLT, ENG, FINA, MUS, THTR, or in any other field in which a course in this category may appear, as designated in the Schedule of Classes. CONTEMPORARY SOCIAl VA l UES (8 CR .) Students must complete one course from each of the following three areas, as designated in the Schedule of Classes.

The following statements inform our mission: \u0083Students are the focus of our endeavors. \u0083We are a diverse body of faculty and staff who motivate, lead, and instruct students at the highest possible level and whose active professional lives model the standards we expect of our students. \u0083We serve students with diverse educational and professional goals. \u0083We pursue significant intellectual achievement and excellence through performance. \u0083We create partnerships with our community that provide artistic development, and reach audiences that we might not otherwise serve. 443 ERNESTINE M. RAC lIN SCHOO l OF THE ARTS GENERA l INFORMATION WElCOME TO THE ARTS! The Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts is widely recognized throughout Indiana University for its excellence; attracting attention regionally, nationally, and internationally. Our prestigious faculty and accomplished alumni provide our community with continued dynamic experiences in the arts through their expertise. The school offers five major areas of study: communication arts, music, new media, theatre and dance, and the visual arts. Students are mentored by faculty and enjoy small class size, which provides exceptional educational opportunities within a range of traditional degree programs and professional studies leading to bachelor's degrees. The educational process in the school balances specialization against an interdisciplinary viewpoint. In addition to the increase of knowledge and skills within a chosen area of study, students also develop critical thinking, communication, and self-awareness skills. The school embraces difference and encourages students and faculty alike to explore the value of diversity. A close reading of the mission statement will prove beneficial to students applying to the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts. ADMISSION Students who wish to major in a subject area offered by the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts must take the following steps: \u0083Seek admission to IU South Bend. (See admission section in the front of this publication.) \u0083Incoming freshmen must attend one of the mandatory orientation sessions. Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts majors are directly admitted to the school and need the information presented in this orientation session. All entering freshmen must take university placement examinations in mathematics and reading and complete courses as determined by placement examination results. English placement level and course requirement is determined by the SAT score or by taking an optional placement examination in English. Depending upon program requirements, some students may need to take additional courses. \u0083Students are certified into degree programs only after completion of an entrance procedure as stipulated by each major area. The procedure may be an audition, an interview with a faculty member, a review of high school transcripts, a portfolio review, or some other method as prescribed by the area coordinator of each discipline. (Prospective music students should see the section on bachelor's degrees in music for entrance procedures.) \u0083Transfer students must wait until after they are admitted to IU South Bend and their transcripts are evaluated by the admissions office to be advised. Transfer students must consult with the coordinator of arts student services to determine their placement examination requirements. Transfer course equivalencies and fulfillment of degree requirements in the major are not guaranteed and the number of courses that transfer and count towards an IU South Bend degree is limited (see the specific information listed under each degree). The faculty in each area may require a transfer student to retake courses transferred from another university or Indiana University campus in order to guarantee proficiency. Should questions arise regarding the transfer of general-education courses, transfer students must be prepared to present a syllabus and course description or a portfolio (if appropriate) to facilitate appropriate course transfers.

If requirements are not satisfied, the degree is withheld pending completion. ACADEMIC REGUlATIONS Students in the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts are subject to the regulations and policies of the university in the front section of this publication as well as a number of specialized regulations that apply to the school.

Mu\u00f1iz GENERA l INFORMATION ADMISSION In addition to the general admission requirements for IU South Bend, prospective music students must take the following steps: \u0083Students must audition on their major instrument. A later change of major instrument requires an additional audition. For information about audition dates and repertoire, contact the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts office. \u0083All entering first-time students must complete an assessment process to determine their placement in music theory and music history classes. There is no charge for this examination which is administered during new student orientation. Once the above steps are complete, the student may be certified as a music major. However, up to the time when 45 credit hours are successfully complete, the student may transfer to another academic degree program, either at the student's request or on the recommendation of the music faculty. TRANSFER STUDENTS Transfer students must audition in a major performing area for admission to a particular curriculum. Applicants with cumulative grade point averages below the requirement may petition for admission on probationary status on the basis of musical talent demonstrated by an audition before music faculty members. Transfer students who have completed college course work in a music degree program must take placement examinations in music theory, aural skills, music history, and keyboard proficiency. These examinations usually are given during the week before the first day of classes each semester. All credit hours in music and world languages from an institution other than Indiana University are subject to placement and evaluation in the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts and must be validated upon entrance by examination or audition. Transfer students, especially those transferring for their junior or senior years, must be aware of the possibility that not all credit hours in the above areas are accepted or counted toward degree requirements in the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts. These students may have to spend a longer time to complete their bachelor's degrees. Transfer students may take a music examination to demonstrate their comprehension when they have passed an equivalent course at another institution. (See Credit by Examination within Academic Regulations and Policies of the university in this publication for more information.) CREDIT FOR PROFESSIONA l EXPERIENCE Students seeking credit for equivalent professional experience are evaluated as follows: \u0083In academic courses, on the recommendation of the director of instruction, the student may gain Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts credit by examination. \u0083In applied music, advanced placement in a medium is achieved only through parallel music performance and literature examinations which evaluate the composite level of experience. To acquire music course credit by examination, the test must be conducted by the music faculty at IU South Bend. ENSEMB lE REqUIREMENT All undergraduate music students in the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts must enroll in a major ensemble and earn a passing grade each semester of registration regardless of admission status. Attendance at public performances of the major ensemble is required. To preserve necessary performance balances, no withdrawals from music ensembles are permitted after the second week of the semester. Appeals must be directed to the music faculty. Students should note that absence from a public performance, for any reason other than emergency illness, is regarded with the utmost seriousness, and is grounds for failure in ensemble. Commencement activities and similar ceremonies may require performances by university ensembles after semester classes are over. The music faculty issues grades in such cases pending satisfactory participation by all performers and reserves the right to revise those grades after original issuance where necessary. 503 ERNESTINE M. RAC lIN SCHOO l OF THE ARTS Voice Majors The ensemble requirement for the Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Science in Music, Bachelor of Arts in music, and the Performance minor, all with the specialty in voice (voice majors) is a minimum of four semesters of large ensemble (required), plus an additional four semesters of either large ensemble or chamber choir, MUS-X 420 Small Ensembles, subject to acceptance by audition to the small vocal ensemble. Piano Majors The ensemble requirement for the Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Science in Music, Bachelor of Arts in music, and the Performance minor, all with the specialty in piano (piano majors) is two semesters of MUS-X 70 University Choral Ensembles. This is required as part of the large ensemble requirement. CHECklIST Students who do not return equipment, music, instruments, keys, locks, etc., to the music office or other designated area by the designated date are placed on a checklist. A student on the checklist may neither register in the following semester nor receive honorable dismissal to enter another institution. If the item cannot be returned, the student is charged for its replacement value, plus necessary fines to cover the clerical operation. Keys that are lost or not returned require a complete lock change, and this cost is charged to the student. APPlIED MUSIC PROCEDURES The assignment of students to teachers for applied music lessons is the responsibility of the music area coordinator, and is made on the basis of student request and availability of the preferred teacher. At the time of enrollment, students may indicate their first, second, and third choice of teachers. (It is recommended that major- and concentration-level students contact their preferred teacher(s) before enrollment.) No one may withdraw from an applied music course once the formal assignment list is posted, except by appeal to the music faculty. Because a major portion of a faculty member's time is allocated by the enrollment process to a single student, assignment in these courses must be final. A jury is the assessment method in applied music equivalent to the final examination. Juries are held at the end of each semester for students taking applied music in the enrolled instrument. An applied music fee is assessed, in addition to regular credit hour fees, to all students enrolled in applied music. Consult the current Schedule of Classes for fee information. PERFORMER 'S CERTIFICATE The IU South Bend Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts faculty established the Performer's Certificate to honor those students who exhibit exceptional abilities in music performance. While all applied music students are eligible, the certificate is rarely awarded to those below senior standing. No regular schedule of awards is established nor shall any student receive the certificate twice. A student is nominated for the Performer's Certificate by the student's applied music instructor. If the nomination is agreed to by two-thirds of the full-time music faculty, all full-time music faculty members are thereby obligated to attend the public recital itself, following which a final ballot is taken from a minimum of six full-time faculty members. The certificate is awarded unless two or more negative ballots are cast by those present and voting. COMPOSER 'S CERTIFICATE The faculty also established the Composer's Certificate to honor those composition majors who exhibit exceptional abilities in composition while at IU South Bend. Composition majors are normally considered for this award in conjunction with their senior recital in composition. The criteria for this award are not only the quality of the student's compositions, but also the degree of professionalism exhibited in the preparation of the compositions for public performance. No regular schedule of awards is established. A student who is awarded the Composer's Certificate shall not thereby be prevented from also receiving the Performer's Certificate, and vice versa. The procedures by which a student is nominated for and elected are identical to those established for the Performer's Certificate. BACHE lOR'S DEGREES IN MUSIC kEYBOARD PROFICIENCY All students majoring in music must pass a keyboard proficiency examination before graduation. The proficiency examination tests the student's ability to use the piano as a tool within the framework of professional activities; thus, the requirements vary in emphasis according to the area of major study. The examination is taken with the consent of the instructor with whom the secondary student is studying. Entering students prepared to take the examination may do so. The examination is offered at the end of each fall and spring semester. Examining committees consist of at least one member of the piano faculty plus a representative from either the theory or music history faculties, or both. A student may attempt all or part of the examination in a given semester; any requirements attempted in which the student is deemed to be deficient are subject to reexamination the following semester. Students, except those majoring in a keyboard instrument, are required to enroll in piano class until they pass the piano proficiency or complete the piano class sequence (MUS-P 101 Piano Class 1, MUS-P 102 Piano Class 2, MUS-P 103 Piano Class 3, MUS-P 104 Piano Class 4). Students who reach the fourth semester Applied Music courses listed as MUS-__ are listed in detail on page 366 of this bulletin.MUSIC 451 of piano class, MUS-P 104 Piano Class 4, without having attempted the examination are required to do so during that fourth semester. Students are entitled to enroll in one semester of studio instruction in piano MUS-P 200 Piano upon completion of the piano class sequence (or earlier, with faculty permission). Enrollees in MUS-P 200 Piano take the piano proficiency examination at the end of the semester. Note: All students majoring in a keyboard instrument must take the piano proficiency examination no later than the end of their first semester of study. Students who intend to attempt the examination in a given semester enroll that semester in the noncredit course number MUS-P 105 Keyboard Proficiency. The successful completion of the examination confers the grade of S; the completion of only part of the examination, or failure to pass any part of the examination, results in the grade of I. The refusal to attempt the examination results in the grade of F. Once students pass part of the examination, they must attempt it in each succeeding semester until all are passed. However, they need not reenroll in MUS-P 105 Keyboard Proficiency. REqUIREMENTS FOR kEYBOARD PROFICIENCY Basic examination required for all degree programs in music: \u0083Playing any major scale, two hands together, two octaves. \u0083Reading a melodic line at sight, incorporating a simple accompaniment. \u0083Sight-reading a four-part chorale, hymn, or community song. \u0083Sight-reading as follows: \u2014Voice (B.M., B.S.): an accompaniment to an art song. \u2014Instrumental (B.M., B.S.): an accompaniment to an instrumental solo. \u2014Keyboard (except organ) (B.M., B.S.): the piano part of an ensemble piece such as a Mozart sonata for piano and violin. \u0083Playing a Roman numeral chord progression, such as I IV ii6 V7 I, in a major key (to four sharps or flats). \u0083Perform a prepared repertoire piece from the last semester of the piano class sequence (or similar level for transfer students, such as a movement from a Clementi sonatina. Acceptable repertoire can be found in Alfred's Group Piano for Adults Book 2, pgs. 341-73 or any piece from Easy Classics to Moderns Vol. 17). \u0083Additional requirements (required of students in the degree programs indicated): \u2014Piano and Organ (B.M., B.S.): Scales and arpeggios, major and minor keys, in sixteenth notes, two hands\u2014four octaves, quarter note = M.M. 144. \u2014Organ (B.M., B.S.): Chorale style improvisation, modulation to any key. \u2014Organ (B.M., B.S.): Transposition of a hymn by a half or whole step in either direction. Sight-reading of vocal score. \u2014Voice (B.M., B.S.): Sight-reading a solo vocal part together with the piano accompaniment. \u2014Composition (B.M.): Sight-reading (from score) a portion of a Classical period string quartet (slow movement). Realize in four parts a Roman numeral progression which modulates to a distantly related key, and which may include chord types such as the augmented sixth, Neapolitan sixth, altered dominants, etc. Sight-reading a portion of a twentieth century piano work of moderate difficulty, e.g., Bart\u00f3k Mikrokosmos, Vol. V. Candidates for the Bachelor of Music in keyboard degree must meet all the requirements for their major instrument. The keyboard placement test for graduate and transfer students is: \u0083Play any major scale, two hands together, two octaves. \u0083Play a Roman numeral chord progression (in a major key to four sharps or flats) in left hand with melody in right hand. Play chord progression alone first, then add the melody. \u0083Sight-read a four-part chorale or hymn. BACHE lOR OF ARTS IN MUSIC The Bachelor of Arts in music at IU South Bend is a liberal arts degree program with a major in music and a degree focus that combines general education with studies in musicianship and an area of emphasis in music such as performance, theory and music history, and composition. The degree program will complement undergraduate degrees in music already offered at IU South Bend: Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Science in Music. The Bachelor of Music is aimed to exceptional performers or composers; it has a strong emphasis on performance and recital requirements. The Bachelor of Science in Music has a concentration in an outside field. Its goal is to help students create specific connections with another area of knowledge with the ultimate goal of specialization with 523 ERNESTINE M. RAC lIN SCHOO l OF THE ARTS a multidisciplinary perspective. The Bachelor of Arts in music will complete the gap between these two degrees: it does not have the highest performance orientation and it is open enough to allow students to pursue graduate specialization in diverse areas. It is compatible with the IU South Bend mission of serving students in the area. It fulfills the need for a comprehensive music/liberal arts education.

INTEGRATED NEW MEDIA STUDIES Professors: Ackoff, lasater, Meyer Lecturer: Coordinator: l asater Integrated New Media Studies (INMS) offers students a Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree that combines art, design, and communication with contemporary digital and computer technologies. The core curriculum is built on a solid grounding in graphic design, video and motion media, interactive multimedia and web design, and music/sound production. Students may select from three degree offerings: 643 ERNESTINE M. RAC lIN SCHOO l OF THE ARTS \u0083B.F.A. in INMS \u0083B.F.A. in INMS with a concentration in graphic design \u0083B.F.A. in INMS with a concentration in informatics Students completing the B.F.A. in INMS will be prepared to participate in all phases of new media project development\u2014from conception and planning through design, programming, production, and distribution. New media skills may be applied to many careers, including website and graphic design; theater design; digital filmmaking and animation; interactive and distance education; medical, nursing, and patient education; game design; electronic and computer music; new media art; as well as business applications in product development and training, marketing, sales, and advertising. TRANSFER CREDIT HOURS As applicable within the B.F.A. in INMS degree, students may transfer credit hours earned at other IU campuses or under articulation agreement with Ivy Tech Community College without portfolio review, subject to IU South Bend Transfer of Credit policy (see index of this bulletin). Otherwise, transfer students with studio credit hours from their previous institutions must submit portfolios for faculty evaluation, as well as course descriptions and syllabi, where available. Specific procedures for the submission of transfer credit hours may be found on the INMS area website. UPPER-DIVISIONA l REVIEW All students in the INMS program are considered pre-B.F.A. students until they pass an upper-divisional review. Ordinarily, this review is scheduled when the student has successfully completed 50 to 60 credit hours distributed across all degree categories. Within these credit hours, students need to have completed course work in lower-level studio and production courses sufficient that, on the basis of projects and exercises completed in these courses, the INMS faculty may judge students' probable success in undertaking upper-level course work and completing the degree. INMS faculty members advise appropriate courses and monitor students' progress prior to upper-divisional review. A review is scheduled when the faculty judges that, in consideration of a student's program of study, the student has had sufficient opportunity to produce work demonstrating appropriate progress in the degree. Further information regarding the upper-divisional review process may be found on the INMS website.BACHE lOR OF FINE ARTS IN INTEGRATED N EW M EDIA S TUDIES (122-123 CR .)

These degrees are built on a fundamental core of courses in drawing, two- and three-dimensional design, and art history. Areas of advanced study include painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, printmaking, photography, and the history of art. Students have the opportunity to pursue areas of individual interests through an interdisciplinary course of study. Courses outside of the student's area of concentration fulfill elective requirements. Whether a student takes a single course or chooses to follow one of the degree programs described below, the study of the visual arts offers the opportunity to observe and analyze the world around us and express our intellectual, emotional, and physical relationships to it. TRANSFER STUDENTS Transfer students with studio credit from their previous institutions must submit portfolios for faculty evaluation. Separate portfolios that contain work representative of the course work for transfer must be submitted for each area of study. Students must submit work by the middle of their first semester. Transfer students who do not submit a portfolio do not receive credit for their previous course work. BACHE lOR OF ARTS IN FINE ARTS (122 CR .) The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree offers students a wide range of options, permitting them to combine their study in the visual arts with a well-rounded general education. Graduates of this degree program develop skills in three or more studio areas of their choice as well as a broad familiarity with the basic principles of several academic disciplines in the sciences, humanities, and social sciences.

FINA-S 405 Bachelor of Fine Arts Drawing FINA-S 432 Bachelor of Fine Arts Painting PHOTOGRAPHY (39 CR.) Based on the tradition of fine art photography, this program stresses the formal and conceptual aspects of the medium as well as an aesthetic and cultural understanding of photography in an historical and contemporary context. Students will utilize digital, black and white, and alternative processes in photography. Students interested in graduate study, professional employment, or exploring the use of photography in their personal expression benefit from this program. Students are required to take FINA-A 477 History of Photography as one of the upper-level art history classes. Beginning fall 2012, all Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) photography students will be required to purchase a DSLR camera. The following courses comprise the B.F.A. concentration in photography: FINA-S 291 Fundament als of Photography FINA-S 296 Fundament als of Digital Photography (5 cr.)

RAC lIN SCHOO l OF THE ARTS PRINTMA kING (39 CR.) The Printmaking Program recognizes that all individuals express their art in unique ways. The concentration requires that students become familiar with a set of core technologies, intaglio, silkscreen, lithography, papermaking, and book design. They are asked to specialize in one and encouraged to take additional upper-level course work in one other selected field; choosing from design, photography, or drawing. Bachelor of Fine Arts candidates produce work that synthesizes their areas of expertise.

In this program, students learn to work in many three-dimensional media including clay, ceramics, plaster, jewelry, wood, and stone. With a particular strength in casting, the program emphasizes extensive work in the finishing, patination, and presentation of bronze sculpture. The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree program is a perfect basis for moving on to an Master of Fine Arts degree program. The Bachelor of Fine Arts concentration in sculpture includes the following courses:FINA-S 260 Ceramics 1 FINA-S 270 Sculpture 1 FINA-S 361 Ceramics 2 FINA-S 371 Sculpture 2 (may be taken two times for credit) FINA-S 403 Anatomy for the Artist FINA-S 471 Sculpture 3 (may be taken three times for credit) FINA-S 472 Bachelor of Fine Arts Sculpture (may be taken four times for credit) VISUAl ARTS UPPER -DIVISIONA l REVIEW All students are considered pre-Bachelor of Arts or pre-Bachelor of Fine Arts students until they pass an upper-divisional review. No student may take any Bachelor of Fine Arts courses nor any 400-level studio courses before he or she successfully passes the upper-divisional review. Students are expected to complete this review at the earliest possible point in their academic careers. Once students complete between 50 and 60 credit hours, including at least five of the six fundamental courses listed below, they are scheduled for their upper-divisional review: FINA-A 101 Ancient and Medieval Art FINA-A 102 Renaissance Through Modern Art FINA-F 100 Fundament al Studio -Drawing FINA-F 101 102 Fundament al Studio -2D FINA-P 273 Computer A rt and Design I Students undertaking this review are expected to present a portfolio of work representing their achievements in the studio. Students with transfer credit(s) must have submitted their portfolios prior to the upper-divisional review. This portfolio should show breadth (work in all the areas that a student has studied) and quality (a careful selection of the best work in the student's area of concentration). The faculty expects to see work that demonstrates ability and improvement. The faculty expect students to present their work in good condition and in a manner that expresses their personal development, course of study, or academic goals. Also, students are expected to make a brief, 3-5 minute, opening statement outlining their achievements so far and goals for the future, as well as to address any faculty questions. For Bachelor of Fine Arts students, this should include a statement of proposed concentration. In addition, the faculty expects that students attain a minimum GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken, and a minimum 2.5 GPA in courses in the visual arts. At the conclusion of the review, the faculty may choose to accept a student into the B.A. or Bachelor of Fine Arts degree programs with or without provisions outlined by the faculty. The faculty may also decide to rehear students if work in some areas requires improvement. In certain cases, the faculty may decline to accept a student into the B.A. or Bachelor of Fine Arts degree programs, if the quality of either their classroom or studio work is deemed insufficient. A student may attempt to pass VISUA l ARTS 477 upper-divisional review only two times. Each hearing counts as one attempt; failure to meet provisions within a specified time counts as one attempt. Failure to attend a scheduled review counts as one attempt. MINOR IN ART HISTORY The minor in art history is open to all IU South Bend students. Visual arts B.A. and Bachelor of Fine Arts students can meet minor requirements with only 3 additional credit hours beyond their art history requirements. Except where stated otherwise, 300-level courses have either FINA-A 101 Ancient and Medieval Art or FINA-A 102 Renaissance through Modern Art as prerequisites, 400-level courses have both FINA-A 101 Ancient and Medieval Art or FINA-A 102 Renaissance through Modern Art as prerequisites. Students are encouraged to plan their minor studies under the guidance of an art history faculty member. The minor in art history consists of a total of 18 credit hours, distributed as follows: Survey Courses (6 cr.)

We will achieve this vision by: \u0083Providing rigorous and relevant programs that are intellectually grounded, innovative, integrative, technologically advanced, and global in perspective \u0083Preparing students for successful leadership roles \u0083Collaborating with stakeholders to align our teaching, scholarship, and service to the needs of the community \u0083Serving as a primary source for creating and applying business knowledge to promote regional economic development GENERA l INFORMATION ACCREDITATION The IU South Bend School of Business and Economics measures its quality against the highest standard in business education: AACSB International\u2014The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Established in 1916, AACSB International is the premier accrediting agency for bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs in business administration and management. IU South Bend stands among only 22 percent of national collegiate business degree programs that have achieved the level of excellence necessary to earn AACSB International accreditation. IU South Bend's professional colleagues include AACSB International founders; the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University, and Yale University. THE BUREAU OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC R ESEARCH The Bureau of Business and Economic Research (BBER) supports research activities of the School of Business and Economics and provides business and economic expertise to the public in the Michiana region, including government, business, and nonprofit organizations. The BBER maintains a database of local economic indicators, publishes a quarterly report on the local economy, conducts research on local and regional issues, and serves as a vital source of information on regional economic activity. CTS C ENTER FOR EXPERIENTIA l EDUCATION The vision of the CTS Center for Experiential Education (CTS-CEE) is for every business student at IU South Bend to have an expanded portfolio of experiential learning opportunities during their studies and, in the process, engage the entire business student body, in both South Bend and Elkhart, in serving our community and promoting the healthy growth of the Michiana economy. Field projects, internships, and faculty development are priorities of the CTS-CEE. ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAM The School of Business and Economics maintains an active and high profile role with the small business sector of the economy. In addition to credit courses available to students pursuing business degrees, a symposia series is offered to the community; faculty and students also enjoy regular involvement with the Collegiate Management Assistance Program of the Small Business Development Center. For over ten years, the School of Business and Economics has presented the Entrepreneurship Lecture Series. This series is sponsored by Lake City Bank. The speakers within this series showcase many of the area's premier business organizations and their chief executives. Each speaker delves into an aspect of entrepreneurship. Topics include: strategies, business plans, creating an organization, venture financing, and franchising. This series is part of the undergraduate course BUS-W 311 New Venture Creation and also is part of an Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) seminar course. The most recent development within the Entrepreneurship Program is the Entrepreneurship Competition sponsored by Kem Krest. This competition awards prize money to the most deserving entrepreneurial projects that business students undertake. The competition will also put aspiring entrepreneurs in touch with experts and sources of capital that may further help develop projects. STUDENT ORGANI zATIONS The faculty of the business and economics school recognize that student organizations contribute greatly to its programs. Some of these organizations are honorary in nature and facilitate recognition of outstanding performance. These organizations include Beta Gamma Sigma (the honorary business society), Omicron Delta Epsilon (the honorary economics society), and International Honor Society of the Financial Management Association (the honorary finance society). Organizations such as the Accounting Association, American Advertising Federation, American Marketing Association, Society for Human Resource Management, Economic Forum, Management Information Systems (MIS) Club, and Financial Management Association enable students to develop their interests in various fields through extracurricular programs. BETA GAMMA SIGMA Beta Gamma Sigma is the national honor society for business students. Membership in this organization is the highest scholastic honor that a business student can attain. Membership is restricted to students of high scholarship in institutions with degree programs accredited by AACSB International. To be eligible for membership, business majors of junior standing must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.8 or higher SCHOO l OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS 481 and completion of a minimum of 70 credit hours with at least 45 credit hours at Indiana University; seniors must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.65 or higher and completion of at least 45 credit hours at Indiana University; and graduate students must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.75 and at least 27 graduate credit hours completed. STUDENT AW ARDS The following awards are made to students in the School of Business and Economics: \u0083Excellence Award to one student in each of the major areas: accounting, advertising, banking, economics, finance, health care management, human resource management, international business, general business, marketing, management information systems, and small business and entrepreneurship \u0083Indiana Association of Certified Public Accountants, Inc. Award \u0083Wall Street Journal Award GRADUATION WITH DISTINCTION Honors for excellence in scholarship are awarded at Commencement to a limited number of students graduating with the degree Bachelor of Science in Business and Bachelor of Science in Economics. The number so honored will not exceed 10 percent of the graduating class in the school for that year. Graduates whose minimum grade point averages are 3.9 and who complete at least 60 credit hours at IU South Bend are graduated with highest distinction; those whose minimum grade point averages are 3.8 and who complete at least 60 credit hours at IU South Bend are graduated with high distinction; and those whose minimum grade point averages are 3.65 and who complete at least 60 credit hours at IU South Bend are graduated with distinction. Graduates receiving these honors have them so noted on their diplomas and in the Commencement program and are eligible to wear the cream and crimson fourrag\u00e9re at Commencement. BACHE lOR OF SCIENCE IN BUSINESS The undergraduate degree programs provide opportunities for breadth of education as well as for a reasonable amount of specialization. As a member of AACSB International\u2014The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, IU South Bend's School of Business and Economics subscribes to the principle that a significant portion of a student's academic program should center in general-education subjects. The general-education aspects of the degree program are then complemented by study in the basic areas of business administration. The application of this principle ensures the planning of balanced study programs and, at the same time, enables a student with an interest in one or another professional area of business to specialize in that field.In addition, all undergraduate study programs include courses that ensure the development of a basic understanding of the principles and practices involved in the management of business firms in the dynamic, social, and political environment of the world today. Consideration is also given to basic trends of development that are likely to shape the patterns of the world in the years ahead. Beyond these basic requirements, students are given an opportunity to pursue studies in a general program or to select a major from a wide variety of subject areas. Upon admission to senior standing, the student enjoys a number of privileges and opportunities. The range of elective courses is wider than at any other stage of the program. Special opportunities are provided for discussion and counseling with senior members of the faculty. Courses on this level assure widespread participation by students in the discussion and solution of cases, projects, and special problems drawn from the contemporary business scene. Also, seniors typically hold responsible offices in professional student organizations, affording them unusual extracurricular opportunities for development. The course BUS-X 310 Business Career Planning and Placement prepares students for transition to the world of business and helps them locate and select employment opportunities that hold greatest promise for them. The study program does not end with graduation. In recognition of the importance of continuing education beyond the classroom and after completion of formal courses, the school's faculty encourages all seniors to pursue a program of guided reading and general development following graduation. Undergraduate students in the school may pursue curricula in: \u0083A general degree program \u0083Specialized subject-matter fields \u0083Combined programs based on selected courses in the school and in various other academic programs of the university 823 SCHOO l OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS ADMISSION Students eligible to apply for admission to the undergraduate degree program in the School of Business and Economics must: \u0083Have completed a minimum of 56 credit hours that count toward graduation on the college level either at IU South Bend or elsewhere (have completed their freshman and sophomore years) \u0083Have earned a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 over all courses taken (averages are computed on the basis of all course enrollments in which grades A, B, C, D, and F were awarded; all WF and FN grades are counted as F in determining the grade point average) \u0083Have completed the following courses (or their equivalents) either at IU South Bend or elsewhere with a minimum grade point average of 2.0 (C) and a minimum grade of C in any of those courses marked with an asterisk (*) BUS-A 201 Introduction to Financial Accounting* BUS-A 202 Introduction to Managerial Accounting* BUS-B 190 Human Behavior and Social Institutions* VT: Principles o f Business Administration BUS-K 201 The Compu ter in Business* ECON-E 103 Introduction to Microeconomics* ECON-E 104 Introduction to Macroeconomics* ECON-E 270 Introduction to Statistical Theory in Economics and Business* ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition 1* ENG-W 232 Writing* MATH-M 118 Finite ematics* MATH-M 119 Brief Survey of Calculus 1* SPCH-S 121 Public Spea king Select from B 399 offerings, page 38 Select one of the following: BUS-L 201 Legal Environment of Business* BUS-L 203 Commercial Law I*1 ElIGIBIlITY FOR ENROllMENT IN BUSINESS AND E CONOMICS C OURSES N UMBERED 301 AND A BOVE Business and economics courses numbered 301 and above are offered only to students who meet one of the following criteria: \u0083Students officially certified to the School of Business and Economics as Bachelor of Science degree majors (provided the student has accomplished a minimum of 56 credit hours, junior-class standing) \u0083Students officially registered in the minor in business (provided the student has accomplished a minimum of 56 credit hours, junior-class standing) \u0083Students registered for other university programs that specifically require upper-division business or economics courses (provided the student has accomplished a minimum of 56 credit hours, junior-class standing) \u0083Other students who have obtained specific permission from the School of Business and Economics (provided the student has accomplished a minimum of 56 credit hours, junior-class standing) Freshmen, sophomores, and prebusiness students are not permitted to enroll in business and economics courses numbered 301 or above. ENROllMENT RESTRICTION No undergraduate student, except those who declare business as their major, is allowed to take more than 23 percent of their course work credit in business courses under any circumstances. The undergraduate business program has the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of this requirement. Any minor in business is subject to approval by the undergraduate business program office. TRANSFER CREDIT POlICY Students of approved colleges who transfer to undergraduate study in the School of Business and Economics must take the courses required in the freshman and sophomore years by the School of Business and Economics if they have not had equivalent courses in the school from which they transfer. Courses taken at other institutions that appear similar in either title or objective to the 300- or 400-level (junior and senior) courses offered by the School of Business and Economics are transferred as undistributed electives and are not regarded as equivalent unless at least one of the following validation processes is performed: \u0083Completion of a course review with documented evaluation of the content, level, method of instruction, objectives, etc., used in the course(s) validated. The evaluation must be performed by an appropriate member of the school's faculty; or \u0083Successful completion of an examination based upon the material covered in that course. At least one of the validation processes must be completed and documented before any administrative action can be taken to officially equate a transferred course with a course offered by the school. The validation process can be completed prior to a student's certifying to the school; but no actual transfer course equivalency can be effected until after the student has officially certified to the school. The validation process cannot take place prior to receipt of an official IU South Bend credit transfer report or if the student is registered in a course offered by another institution. Courses in advanced business subjects (not open to freshmen and sophomores) which have been taken at other institutions in the freshman and sophomore years, are not accepted as equivalents of the courses offered VT: = Variable title * Grade of C (C- does not count) or higher is required for each course. 1 Accounting majors should take BUS-L 203 in lieu of BUS-L 201SCHOO l OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS 483 at Indiana University unless the student passes special examinations of the School of Business and Economics in such subjects. Additionally, courses in advanced business subjects (not open to freshmen and sophomores) which have been taken at two-year institutions, are not accepted as equivalents of the courses offered at IU South Bend. Credit hours earned through junior and community colleges are limited to a maximum of 60 credit hours. Only credit hours earned at Indiana University count toward a student's grade point average. Grades from other universities transfer as credit only, although transfer grades appear on the credit transfer report. The school accepts transfer students as late as the senior year. STUDENT 'S RESPONSIBI lITY All colleges establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. Advisors, directors, and deans always help a student meet these requirements; but each student is individually responsible for fulfilling them. If requirements are not satisfied, the degree is withheld pending adequate fulfillment. For this reason, it is important for each student to be well acquainted with all requirements described in this publication. CREDIT HOUR REqUIREMENTS The minimum number of credit hours required for the bachelor's degree is 123 credit hours in courses meeting the various requirements stated in this publication. Of these, at least 48 credit hours shall be in business and economics courses, and at least 53 credit hours shall be in courses other than business and economics. PASS /FAI l O PTION Business students may elect to take one course each semester with a grade of P (Pass) or F (Fail), with a maximum of two such courses each school year, including summer sessions. The election of this option must be exercised by the student within the first three weeks of the semester. Limitations on use of the Pass/Fail policy are as follows: business students may not take any business course Pass/Fail. Also, the Pass/Fail option cannot be used for courses that satisfy the campuswide general-education requirements. The option can be used for courses that are pure electives taken outside the School of Business and Economics. A grade of P is not counted in the cumulative grade point average, but a grade of F is included. A grade of P cannot be changed subsequently to a grade of A, B, C, or D. CORRESPONDENCE STUDY Business, economics, and speech courses may not be taken by correspondence to count toward degree requirements. All students wishing to apply credit from correspondence study toward a degree must secure the advisor's signature on the enrollment application before submitting it to the correspondence study program. Any exceptions to the above policy must have the approval of the dean.REPEATING A COURSE lIMITATION POlICY Business majors are not permitted to retake a course in which they have received a grade of B- (2.7) or higher. Independent study courses and all other courses that allow students to obtain additional credit by retaking the same course number are exceptions, as would any other extraordinary situations. All business majors are restricted to three attempts to complete a credit course. Viable exceptions may be accepted by petitioning the school. The word attempts is intended to mean a transcript record of W, F, FN, or a completed course letter grade. In particular, WX is excluded (dropping a class within the first week). REPEATING A FAI l ED C OURSE The School of Business and Economics, for its own internal purposes (e.g., admission, probation, graduation, etc.), calculates grade point averages where a failed course is involved using both the original grade of F and the makeup grade. This policy applies to all courses taken by undergraduate students admitted to the school. GENERA l SCHOlARSHIP RUlE Any student who does not possess the necessary preliminary training, or who lacks other qualifications, may be required by the Committee on Admission and Probation to enroll in such courses as the committee may designate or to take such other corrective action as is necessary or desirable. The committee may review a student's record at any time and take whatever action seems necessary for the student's best interests or for the best interests of the school. GRADE REqUIREMENTS To graduate with an undergraduate degree from the School of Business and Economics, students must attain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 (C) in all business and economics courses, earn a minimum grade of C in each course in their concentration and basic administration core requirements (a grade of C- does not satisfy this requirement), and a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (C). Transfer students admitted from other institutions with deficiencies in credit points are expected to overcome those deficiencies with Indiana University grades. ENGlISH REqUIREMENT Students must demonstrate their ability to use correct, clear, effective English. The student must satisfy this requirement by completing ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition 1 and ENG-W 232 Introduction to Business Writing, or equivalent transfer credit, with a minimum grade of C (a grade of C- does not satisfy this requirement). Students whose records indicate serious writing deficiencies are required to enroll in ENG-W 31 Pre-Composition and ENG-W 130 Principles of Composition, which are specially designed for their needs.843 SCHOO l OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS DISMISSA l AND READMISSION The Committee on Admission, Probation, and Withdrawal has the authority to order dismissal and to entertain applications for readmission, according to university regulations as carried out in the Academic Regulations and Policies section of this publication. PHYSICA l EDUCATION COURSES Students may select a maximum of 4 credit hours of special elective Health, Physical Education, and Recreation (HPER) courses. Physical education courses carry regular credit and count as general-education electives (students cannot enroll in the same course twice and receive credit). Grades earned in these courses are not included in the student's cumulative grade point average. CAREER SERVICES All undergraduate students are urged to register with the Office of Career Services. BUS-X 310 Business Career Planning and Placement should be completed satisfactorily during the junior year. Information about employment in specific career fields is available in the Office of Career Services. SPECIA l CREDIT EXAMINATIONS The School of Business and Economics does not accept transfer of credit from other institutions for business courses if the credit was awarded on the basis of self-acquired competency. For nonbusiness courses, the school accepts course-specific credit awarded on the basis of self-acquired competency by other degree-granting divisions/schools of Indiana University and by other institutions accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges or comparable regional associations. The school does not accept general (non-course-specific) self-acquired competency credit awarded by other divisions/schools of Indiana University or by other institutions. CONCENTRATION DEClARATION Students declare a concentration once they are admitted to the upper-level business program and are expected to meet the requirements for that concentration beginning that semester. Any student who has not selected a specific concentration is classified as a general business major and is expected to follow the program of that concentration. SENIOR RESIDENCE REqUIREMENT The senior year (the last 30 credit hours) must be completed at Indiana University. Students are certified for graduation by the Indiana University campus on which they complete the last two semesters (30 or more credit hours). In addition, at least 50 percent of all business course credit hours must be taken at IU South Bend. Permission to take credit during the senior year at another institution, or by correspondence study courses, may be procured to a maximum of 6 credit hours by petitioning the dean. APPlICATION FOR D EGREE Candidates for the Bachelor of Science in Business or Bachelor of Science in Economics must file a degree application by March 1 if they are graduating in December or by October 1 if they are graduating in May or August. Degree application forms are available at the school's undergraduate office. Unless the application has been completed and submitted to the school, the student's academic records will not be audited for degree certification. Without this audit, the student cannot be recommended for the conferral of the degree.

Such careers include work in the management of advertising; advertising sales; product management with those firms where strong emphasis is placed on advertising; or specialized areas of copy, layout, design, or production. Employment in these careers may be with advertising departments of manufacturing, distributing, or retailing firms; with media, including television, radio, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, or the Internet; with advertising agencies; or with companies dealing in specialized aspects of advertising and sales promotion. Because the advertising function in a business firm constitutes part of a total marketing program, the advertising curriculum provides, first of all, a base of general business and marketing studies. The capstone of this degree program is a modest degree of specialization in advertising courses. CONCENTRATION REqUIREMENTS (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)

Electives in advertising include 400-level marketing courses. BANkING This degree program provides a solid financial background along with entrepreneurial skills to service this growing market. The need for specialized education arises from the increased competitiveness within the financial services industry. Many banks make tremendous efforts to serve not only the budding entrepreneur, but also those entrepreneurs successful in growing to new heights in sales and market expansion. Growing entrepreneurial businesses have significant funding needs. As is often the case with a growing business, there are insufficient internally generated cash flows to finance expansion. Firms can choose to go public, seek private equity, or turn to their banker to supply the funds needed to stoke future growth. Banks need skilled employees with the ability to recognize those entrepreneurial opportunities, who possess the depth of finance knowledge to evaluate the deal's potential, and who have the ability to close the sale. The program offers a wide variety of courses in finance, entrepreneurship, and sales management to ensure that graduates possess the skills necessary to be successful in this growing industry.

Students who graduate with a finance concentration are prepared for entry-level positions in finance. This includes positions in financial institutions such as commercial banks, savings and loans, credit unions, brokerage and investment banking firms, investment advisory organizations, insurance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds. In addition to opportunities in the financial services industry, extensive employment opportunities exist in the corporate sector as well as in government. Courses on financial institutions, financial decision making, business financial management, investments, security analysis, and portfolio management enable students to acquire a depth of understanding in areas of particular interest. The field of finance traditionally is divided into three subfields: financial markets and institutions, investments, and business financial management. Financial markets and institutions examine the ways in which financial intermediaries such as commercial banks, insurance companies, and pension funds facilitate the transfer of funds from savers/investors to demanders of funds who engage in the production and consumption of real economic goods and services. Services provided by financial institutions include the evaluation and bearing of risk and the repackaging of funds in terms of maturity and size of investment. Also examined, on a macro basis, are the markets for financial securities created by corporations and financial intermediaries. Typical questions would be what sectors of government and the economy are the foremost demanders of funds in different segments of the business cycle and, in aggregate, what proportion of corporate financing has been provided by debt over time. Investments is the study of how individuals and institutions allocate funds to financial assets such as stocks, bonds, options and futures contracts and, to a lesser extent, real assets such as real estate and precious metals. Investments is itself divided into two areas: security analysis, concerned with the valuation of individual securities; and portfolio management, concerned with the selection of combinations of assets such that return is maximized given the level of risk that is borne. Business financial management concentrates on the management of a firm's assets, both short-term working capital and longer-term capital projects, and on the financing of these assets. Financing considerations include the choice of capital structure (proportions of debt and equity used in the financing mix) and dividend policy.CONCENTRATION REqUIREMENTS (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)

GENERA l BUSINESS For students wishing to pursue a broad, general degree program, this curriculum provides a vehicle for organizing their studies. The integrating focus is the responsibility for administering the multiple operations of the business firm in a rapidly changing environment. Emphasis is on the process involved in setting goals for corporate effort, coordinating and controlling multiple programs, and regulating inputs and outputs with varied environments. * Credit not given for both BUS-A 312 and BUS-A 325SCHOO l OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS 489 Objectives at the undergraduate level are to provide a broad, liberal education as a base and to develop proficiency in understanding and solving interrelated business problems.

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT The Human Resource (HR) Management Program is designed for students whose career objectives encompass the field of human resources. From its early beginnings as a staff function involving the maintenance of records and the administration of benefit programs, personnel administration has grown and expanded to encompass the total development and utilization of human resources in organizations. While company titles may vary from vice president of strategic human resources to vice president for organization planning and development, there are few firms of any size or consequence today that do not have a human resources specialist reporting directly to the company's highest level. This practice reflects the awareness that its human resources are an organization's greatest asset. For this reason, the curriculum is designed to acquaint the student with modern human resources management in its broadest sense. Included are the traditional areas of HR administration and labor relations such as employment, management development, wage and salary administration, organization planning, and contract negotiations, as well as developments in the behavioral sciences and the implications for a complete human resources program. The objectives at the undergraduate level are to provide the student with a broad spectrum of knowledge for career preparation in organizational leadership; to prepare the student for a career in modern, professional human resources management; and to encourage and develop interest in further study and research in the area of human resources development and utilization. An internship is required to allow the student to fully embody the role of a human resource professional. CONCENTRATION REqUIREMENTS (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)

INTERNATIONA l BUSINESS The international business concentration provides students with extensive backgrounds in international business issues such as finance, law, marketing, accounting, and economics. Students have numerous curriculum choices so may tailor their degree to their own area of emphasis. The faculty has designed the concentration to facilitate students wishing to double major in an existing business discipline and in international business. Students who concentrate in international business are also required to take international courses outside the school of business to help them develop an expertise in a particular geographic area or culture. This major provides business students with the kind of cultural grounding so significant to success in global business.

It deals, for example, with customer behavior; the development of product offerings to meet consumer needs; pricing policies; the institutions and channels of distribution, including retailers and wholesalers; advertising; selling; sales promotion; research; and the management of marketing to provide for business a profitable and expanding operation. The marketing curriculum endeavors to provide the business community with broadly trained people who can approach problems with a clear understanding both of marketing and of the interrelationships of marketing with other functions of the firm. Students planning careers in marketing research and information systems, advertising, retailing, or sales management normally major in marketing and then may pursue within the curriculum additional specialization in the area of their vocational interest.

SMAll BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP The concentration in small business and entrepreneurship prepares graduates to start and manage their own organizations. This concentration also prepares graduates for management positions in the many small businesses of the United States and, increasingly, of the entire global community. Over 90 percent of all businesses in the United States can be classified as small; and with downsizing, outsourcing, and reorganizing among larger companies, the percentage of small businesses is increasing. Future careers and jobs are with smaller organizations.In addition to credit courses, the concentration in small business and entrepreneurship offers a speaker series to the local community and to students. Faculty and students participate in a variety of research projects that investigate issues of significance to the small business community. Students also enjoy regular involvement with north central Indiana's Small Business Development Center. Curriculum requirements are similar to other concentrations offered in the School of Business and Economics with regard to general-education, prebusiness courses, and business courses.

Watson, Senior Practice: YoungDirector of the Child Development Center: Wilham-CountwayDirector of the Center for Global Education: OkrahAdministrative Operations Manager: Ogden MISSION The School of Education prepares professionals to be leaders in and beyond P-12 classrooms. In our initial programs, future teachers become classroom leaders who are competent, ethical, reflective, and ready to promote learning for a diverse student population. In our advanced programs, teachers, counselors, and principals build on these classroom leadership responsibilities to become advocates, decision makers, researchers, and partners in school and community settings. SCHOO l OF EDUCATION 497 Welcome to IU South Bend and the School of Education. We are happy that you have joined us as a new candidate (our term for a student in the School of Education). Our programs are designed to meet the licensing requirements of the Indiana Department of Education and to be completed in four years with summer course work. All of our programs require spending time during the day in school settings in area classrooms. Our culminating experience requires a full-time student teaching experience. Candidates' progress is monitored at three critical checkpoints during their programs. More information about these critical checkpoints is provided later in this section of the IU South Bend Bulletin. ADMISSIONS PO lICIES AND PROCEDURES ADMISSION TO IU SOUTH BEND AND THE S CHOO l OF E DUCATION Individuals must first be admitted to IU South Bend to be eligible to register for classes. To learn more about admission requirements at IU South Bend visit the admissions website at www.admissions.iusb.edu , or contact the Office of Admissions. For questions regarding undergraduate degree programs or campus visitations, contact the Office of Admissions at (574) 520-4839. If you have a disability and need assistance, special arrangements can be made to accommodate most needs; contact Disability Support Services at (574) 520-4832. Freshmen who apply to the School of Education must plan to attend a new student orientation to obtain information about policies and procedures and specific classes. Candidates admitted after new student orientation must schedule an appointment to meet individually with an academic advisor. In addition to the requirements outlined by the candidate's advisor, all freshmen must complete EDUC-F 100 Introduction to Teaching during one of their first two semesters in the School of Education. ADMISSION FROM OTHER SCHOO lS WITHIN I NDIANA U NIVERSITY A S W E ll A S O THER E DUCATIONA l I NSTITUTIONS Candidates, other than freshmen, registered in any other academic program of Indiana University or another educational institution, may apply for permission to transfer to the School of Education provided they are in good standing, have a minimum average of C (2.0 on a 4.0 scale), and have made arrangements to complete the specific courses required by the School of Education. All candidates are assessed according to the Unit Assessment System at three critical checkpoints. ADMISSION TO THE TEACHER EDUCATION P ROGRAM As candidates approach the end of their education foundations courses and Checkpoint One, they must file a separate form for admission to the Teacher Education Program (TEP). These forms will be distributed in EDUC-M 311 Methodology for Kindergarten/Elementary Teachers and EDUC-M 314 General Methods for Senior High-Junior High/Middle School Teachers by the Office of Education Student Services in Greenlawn Hall 120. In addition to the academic requirements described later in this section of the IU South Bend Bulletin, Checkpoint One assessments involve a review of various artifacts. These documents may be reviewed by faculty to determine if each candidate meets the standards necessary for admission into the Teacher Education Program. EDUCATION STUDENT SERVICES ACADEMIC ADVISING AND PROGRAM PlANNING Academic advising is available from the Office of Education Student Services in Greenlawn Hall 120. Many advising options are available to education majors. Advisors meet with students during scheduled walk-in times to address small issues. Individual appointments may be made with advisors for an individual program review, group sessions are held as scheduled, and many materials are available at www.education.iusb.edu , the School of Education website. Candidates are strongly encouraged to meet with advisors frequently because degree programs are complex and subject to change. Entering candidates must attend a group or individual orientation session before they are allowed to register for classes. Candidates in another academic program who wish to seek teacher certification must meet with an advisor in Greenlawn. lICENSING Rules for Educator Preparation and Accountability (REPA) is Indiana's newest licensing system. REPA makes changes for how new educators will be prepared, and it also affects how currently licensed educators can renew, add to, and professionalize their license. Students who complete all course work prior to and all other licensing requirements prior to August 31, 2013, will be licensed under the previous rules known as Rules 2002. Students who complete courses or any licensing requirements at any point after August 31, 2013, will be required to meet requirements under REPA. The earliest a license can be renewed is 60 days prior to the license expiring. An expired license can be renewed at any time. Starting May 2, 2011 there will be a new online licensing system called \"License Verification and Information System\" (LVIS). Instructions for completing an online application and payment beginning May 2 will be posted on the state's website at www.doe.in.gov/educatorlicensing. PlACEMENT Complete placement files are an essential part of any successful job search. Candidates are advised to complete their placement file during their senior year so the file is available upon request at graduation.983 SCHOO l OF EDUCATION Personnel in the Office of Education Student Services advise candidates concerning the subject area concentrations most in demand by employers and serve as contact persons for employers, candidates, and alumni seeking positions in education. There is no charge for compiling, registering, or updating credentials. Interviews with employers are arranged at IU South Bend each spring. Local school corporations within a 60-mile radius are invited to interview with graduating seniors and certification students. IU South Bend candidates may also participate in interviews at the Bloomington campus with school corporations from all over the country. The Office of Education Student Services posts listings of job vacancies on the job board. Candidates are also eligible to receive a weekly national listing compiled by the Bloomington campus. Candidates may be contracted by the office about vacancies. Education candidates are encouraged to seek placement information and service from the IU South Bend Office of Career Services, located in the Administration Building. OFFICE OF FIElD EXPERIENCE AND ClINICA l P RACTICE Candidates complete a variety of field and clinical experiences as part of their required courses. These experiences require candidates to spend time in a variety of settings that serve diverse students and students with exceptionalities. All placements are made by the director of field and clinical practice in consultation with area schools. The director's first priority is to obtain the best placements with master teachers. For some placements, candidates are given the opportunity to state preferences for placements although preferred locations cannot be guaranteed. Appointments can be made to meet with the director by visiting Greenlawn Hall 101. BACHE lOR OF SCIENCE IN EDUCATION E l EMENTARY EDUCATION All degree programs in the School of Education are under revision. Students must meet with an academic advisor to determine current requirements. PROGRAM REqUIREMENTS The degree program has several distinct elements: \u0083A recommended sequence of general-education courses \u0083A professional education component \u0083Student teaching or other supervised practicum experience \u0083Students who will complete their student teaching in spring 2013 will also be required to have either a minor, concentration, or attain dual licensure GENERA l EDUCATION General education refers to courses and other experiences that lay the foundation for IU South Bend's Teacher Education Program. There is a focus on building skills in written and oral communication, information technology, inquiry, science, literature, quantitative reasoning, and both global and democratic perspectives. The general-education requirements for elementary education and early childhood education define the strong generalist preparation that is imperative for elementary teachers at the primary and middle child-hood levels. Candidates are encouraged to complete a program of general education by enrolling in courses designated for education majors whenever they are available. In particular, candidates are urged to follow the general-education template for the first 30 credit hours of their degree program. The sequence has been planned to provide the strongest foundation in learning and to build the most powerful connections between the content of the individual courses. PROFESSIONA l EDUCATION The professional education component of the Teacher Education Program develops the knowledge, dispositions, and skills required for entry to the teaching profession. Some courses focus on knowledge, dispositions, and skills that underlie all teacher education regardless of the developmental focus. Other courses and field experiences focus on what it takes to promote effective teaching and learning at a particular developmental level or in a particular school setting. At IU South Bend, the professional education component (72 credit hours) is not a collection of isolated courses, but rather a carefully articulated program of study. Courses are taken in a prescribed order. Some must be taken in blocks, which is a sequence of course work. STUDENT TEACHING The 12 credit hours of student teaching and the accompanying integrated seminar represent the culminating experience in the Teacher Education Program. By assuming full responsibility for a class of students, candidates demonstrate their achievement of standards, and reflect both on student learning and on their own effectiveness as teachers. At IU South Bend, most candidates are prepared to teach at two developmental levels and can expect to complete two separate student teaching assignments. Student teaching takes one full semester. SCHOO l OF EDUCATION 499 ElEMENTARY MINORS, CONCENTRATIONS, AND DUA l l ICENSURE Currently, students who will be licensed under the new REPA guidelines (spring 2013) will add either concentrations, a minor or prepare for dual licensure. Check with the Office of Education Student Services for upcoming information. Elementary education majors may also complete the requirements for licenses in English as a new language, mild interventions (special education), and preschool. BACHE lOR OF SCIENCE IN EDUCATION SECONDAR Y EDUCATION The IU South Bend School of Education offers several degree programs in secondary education. Successful secondary education graduates are licensed in one or more content areas for grades 5-12. Each candidate's degree program is aligned with the developmental standards for both the middle school/junior high and high school levels as defined by the Indiana Professional Standards Board. Candidates may select one or more of the following content areas: \u0083English/language arts \u0083Mathematics \u0083Science (candidate selects one or more areas from the following: life science, Earth/space science, physical science, physics, or chemistry) \u0083Social studies (candidate selects three areas from the following six options: historical perspectives, government and citizenship, geographical perspectives, economics, psychology, and sociology) \u0083World languages (French, Spanish, or German) Candidates may choose to add to any of the above content areas: \u0083English as a new language \u0083Special education\u2014mild interventions A license in any of the areas listed above requires the completion of specified general-education courses, professional education courses, and content area courses for a minimum total of 124 credit hours for the Bachelor of Science degree. Candidates are advised that there are very few elective courses in the secondary education degree programs and that early program selection and advising is important for timely graduation. As of July 2010, programs in the School of Education leading to teacher licensure are undergoing extensive revision to conform to Indiana's new teacher licensure requirements known as Rules for Educator Preparation and Accountability (REPA). While these rules became effective in July 2010, students who complete all course work and all other licensing requirements prior to August 31, 2013, will be licensed under the previous rules known as Rules 2002. Students who complete courses or any licensing requirements at any point after August 31, 2013, will be required to meet requirements under REPA.For specific courses and advising information, candidates must contact the Office of Education Student Services to speak with an undergraduate advisor. For general program information, candidates may also request to speak with the department head. SPECIA l EDUCATION PROGRAM All teacher education candidates seeking a teaching license in special education major in either elementary or secondary education and complete the requirements for licensure in their major area. Candidates also complete a series of courses for an additional license in mild interventions. The special education course sequence is designed to prepare teacher education candidates to work with students with special needs who participate in the general-education curriculum and who require mild levels of support or mild interventions to be successful. Teacher education candidates who complete the mild interventions license should be well prepared to work with a variety of students with special needs. This background, in combination with their elementary or secondary teaching credentials, will serve them well as they pursue future teaching opportunities. A Bachelor of Science in Education with a major in special education is currently being revised and may be available for students interested in majoring in special education in the near future. INDIANA lICENSE TYPES AND COVERAGE IU South Bend's Teacher Education Program at both the graduate and undergraduate levels was developed to meet the license framework adopted by the state. The new framework established requirements not in terms of courses to be taken, but rather in terms of the standards that degree program graduates are expected to meet. The license framework addresses the principles set forth by the accrediting bodies for each degree program, and includes both content standards for different subjects and teaching areas, and developmental standards associated with particular educational grade levels; \u0083Preschool (P) \u0083Preschool-12 grade (P-12) \u0083Kindergarten-6 grade (K-6) \u00835-12 grades IU South Bend offers degree programs leading to the following licenses: Elementary \u0083Preparation to teach kindergarten through sixth grades utilizing developmental standards; early childhood and middle childhood \u0083Grade Levels: K-6 \u0083Content standards: elementary, primary generalist and elementary, intermediate generalist1003 SCHOO l OF EDUCATION Secondary \u0083Preparation to teach area Special Education: Mild Interventions \u0083Preparation to teach either preschool through sixth grades or middle school/junior high/high school \u0083Developmental standards: early childhood and middle childhood or early adolescent and young adult \u0083Grade Levels: P-12 \u0083Content standards: teacher of students with exceptional needs Preschool \u0083Preparation to teach preschool English as a New language \u0083Preparation to teach students learning English as a new language \u0083Grade level: K-6 or 5-12 \u0083Content standards: English as a new language Candidates who would like more information about IU South Bend's licensure programs contact the Office of Education Student Services located in Greenlawn Hall 120. Fine Arts: Vocal and General Music or Fine Arts: Instrumental and General Music Preparation to teach vocal and general music or instrumental and general music is through the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts and the School of Education. Students must meet with advisors from both academic divisions during their program. \u0083Grade Levels: P-12 \u0083Content standards: fine arts vocal and general music or fine arts instrumental and general music Candidates who would like more information about IU South Bend's licensure programs should contact the Office of Education Student Services located in Greenlawn Hall 120. SCHOO l OF EDUCATION PO lICIES E-MAIl COMMUNICATION Electronic mail (e-mail) is the official means of communication with candidates at IU South Bend. A candidate's failure to receive or read official university communications sent to the candidate's official e-mail address does not absolve the candidate from knowing and complying with the content of the official communication. It is recommended that candidates check e-mail messages at least once daily. The university provides a simple mechanism for candidates to forward e-mail from the official university e-mail address to another e-mail address of the candidate's choice. However, candidates who choose to have e-mail forwarded to another e-mail address do so at their own risk. REqUIRED GRADES AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE In order to be a candidate in good standing at IU South Bend, candidates must earn a cumulative grade point average of 2.0. However, to be admitted into the Teacher Education Program candidates must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.75 and earn a C or higher in every required course. If a candidate earns a grade of C- or lower in a required course, the course must be retaken until a grade of C is earned. Candidates must also have a grade point average of 2.5 in their content courses. For example, if a candidate is earning a license in physics, the overall grade point average for all physics courses must be at least a 2.5. PRAXIS \u00ae REqUIREMENTS Required Praxis I\u00ae Scores Board approved licensing assessment changes for Praxis I\u00ae alternatives (effective May 10, 2011). For more information on these changes, visit the website at www.doe.in.gov/educatorlicensing. Visit the Educational Testing Service (ETS) website at www.ets.org/praxis to view specific dates of the Praxis I\u00ae and registration deadlines. The registration deadline for the examination is usually four to five weeks in advance of the test. It can take up to six weeks for test results to be posted; candidates must plan ahead to meet deadlines. Beginning May 2011, alternate assessments will be accepted in place of the Praxis I\u00ae scores listed below. Students should check with the Office of Education Student Services for information about other acceptable assessments. Praxis I\u00ae Passing Scores Mathematics 175 or above Reading 176 or above Writing 172 or above The Praxis I\u00ae must be taken and passed before candidates may register for EDUC-F 201 Exploring the Personal Demands of Teaching: Laboratory Experience and EDUC-F 202 Exploring the Personal Demands of Teaching: Field Experience.

School corporations may deny a field placement or student teaching assignment based on a misdemeanor or felony conviction that is on the limited criminal history check. Students may visit http://www.in.gov/ai/appfiles/isp-lch/ to obtain a limited criminal history check from the Indiana State Police website. All searches conducted using this website's online service will be considered a completed request and are subject to associated fees regardless of whether or not a detailed record is found. A response of No Records Found is an official search result. Follow the directions on the website to complete the limited criminal history check, print out the response from the website, and take a copy with you on the first day of your field placement or student teaching. ISSUES RESOlUTIONS Issues Resolutions is a process followed when a candidate has a concern that cannot be resolved at a meeting with the appropriate professional in the School of Education. If a candidate has a concern about a class or instruction, advising, or a School of Education policy, the candidate should meet individually to discuss the concern in an attempt to resolve it in a satisfactory manner. If the issue/concern is not resolved by the end of the meeting, the candidate should be advised that he or she can follow a process to seek resolution at other levels. The candidate should ask for an Issues Resolution form and cover sheet from the Office of Education Student Services. The candidate should follow the directions on the cover sheet. All steps should be documented. Certain issues follow university policies. For example, any grade grievances follow IU South Bend procedures. PROFESSIONA l CONDUCT AND lETTERS OF CONCERN In addition to academic performance, IU South Bend's teacher certification candidates are evaluated on the basis of their professional conduct, dispositions, and teaching performance. It is particularly important that IU South Bend education candidates demonstrate professional behavior and dispositions in host schools since they represent the university. Improper conduct on their part can adversely affect the lives of children. Unsatisfactory professional conduct or performance on the part of an IU South Bend education candidate, whether on campus or in host schools, may result in that candidate's separation from the Teacher Education Program. The process by which unprofessional performance or concerns regarding dispositions is documented is the Letter of Concern. The letter may be used by any professional connected with the Teacher Education Program to identify a candidate in the program whose professional performance or approach is questionable. 1023 SCHOO l OF EDUCATION Because grades reflect the candidate's academic performance, this letter is not used to report academic problems. Rather, it is used when there is a strong concern about a candidate's ability to become a professional educator. For example, a candidate may exhibit a genuine dislike for children, frequently miss class or be tardy, or have behaviors that would seem inconsistent with the requirements of the education profession. The intent of this system is to add professional judgment to the teacher education process. When a Letter of Concern is filed, the candidate, the dean, and the advising office receive copies. Confirmation of this notification is sent to the person who filed the Letter of Concern. Except in very serious situations, two Letters of Concern must be received before a candidate's case is reviewed by the dean, an advisor, and a faculty member. It is assumed corrective action will be taken and candidate performance will be monitored. However, such a review can result in termination of the candidate's involvement in the program. PlAGIARISM Plagiarism is a serious infraction. All procedures in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct are followed in all cases of plagiarism. Plagiarism and academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Copying any other person's work and submitting it as one's own, whether as a written document or an oral presentation. 2. Copying or paraphrasing passages, sentences, phrases, data, statistics, isolated formulas, and visual aids from print, oral, or Internet sources without proper acknowledgment. 3. Using someone else' s ideas without giving credit to the source. 4. Submitting a professionally prepared research paper as one's own work. 5. Submitting work that resulted from an unauthorized collaborative effort as individual work. 6. Reusing or recycling a paper or research done for credit in a previous course without the permission and approval of all the professors involved. 7. Offering material assembled or collected by others as one's own project or collection. 8. Fabricating or creating material (statistics, text, etc.) to cite as a legitimate source. 9. Documenting a source inaccurately. Visit www.iusb.edu/~sbwrite/plagiarism.shtml for further information .TRANSFER CREDIT Candidates transferring from other degree programs and/or schools must meet with an advisor who determines whether prior courses meet the requirements of their desired degree program. Candidates who transfer may not be able to complete the degree program in the usual number of hours and semesters. If candidates wish to complete courses at other institutions, they should obtain approval for these transfers prior to registering for the course. Advisors in the Office of Education Student Services can assist with this process. PASS /FAI l O PTION The university regulations for this option apply in the School of Education. A candidate may elect to receive a Pass/Fail rating in classes to fulfill general-education requirements, providing they are not in the major teaching areas or part of the requirements in professional education. The request for a Pass/Fail option must be completed during the first three weeks of fall and spring semesters, and during the first two weeks of a summer session by processing the prescribed request in the Office of Education Student Services. This election is not reversible. The limitation on Pass/Fail options described on page 32 of this publication applies. Note: Students should realize that an F in a credit-bearing course will be calculated in the GPA. Also, Pass/Fail courses do not count toward the required credit hours for the Dean's List. If a passing grade is earned through this option, a grade of P is posted to the transcript. PROBATION , DISMISSA l, AND R EINSTATEMENT : BEFORE ADMISSION TO T EACHER E DUCATION P ROGRAM Candidates may be placed on probation or be dismissed at any point in the program when the academic criteria for education candidates and for continuing in the Teacher Education Program as outlined in the following sections are not met. Candidates may also be dismissed if the required artifacts are not submitted or if they provide evidence that candidates are not meeting standards nor making progress toward meeting standards. PROBATION AND DISMISSA l Satisfactory Academic Progress A student whose cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is 2.0 or higher is considered to be making satisfactory academic progress at IU South Bend. Probation A student who has completed one or more IU South Bend GPA hours and has a CGPA below 2.0 is placed on probation. A probationary student remains on probation until the CGPA reaches 2.0 or higher.SCHOO l OF EDUCATION 4103 Probation with Impact A student who is on probation and fails to achieve a semester (fall, spring, or combined summer sessions) GPA of at least 2.0 will be placed on probation with impact. Academic units may impose additional enrollment restrictions on such students (e.g. limited to half-time enrollment). Dismissal A student who is on probation with impact and fails to achieve a semester (fall, spring, or combined summer sessions) GPA of at least 2.0 will be dismissed from the university. Students who are dismissed for the first time cannot enroll until one regular (fall or spring) semester has elapsed and must petition by the established deadline to be reinstated. Students who are dismissed multiple times must remain out of the university for at least two regular semesters and must petition by the established deadline to be reinstated. Reinstatement Reinstatement will be the decision of the academic unit to which the student petitions. A student who is reinstated will be on probation with impact until the CGPA reaches 2.0 or higher. APPEA l AND READMISSION A candidate may follow the issues resolution process to be readmitted to the School of Education. Once dismissed, the candidate must wait for at least one fall or one spring semester before applying for readmission.

For secondary majors this includes submitting passing scores on Praxis II\u00ae examinations along with other requirements. 2. Complete all required courses for their specific degree program with grades posted on the transcript which meet the following standards: a. A minimum overall GPA of 2.75 b. A minimum GPA in professional education courses of 2.5 with no grade in these courses less than C (2.0) 3. Meet the following requirements for specific degree program or major areas: a. Elementary education candidates must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.0 in each of the following general-education areas: fine arts, language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. In addition, candidates must obtain a grade of C (2.0) or better in all required courses. b. Secondary education majors and secondary graduate certification candidates must attain a minimum overall GPA of 2.75 in education and content courses with all grades of at least a C (2.0).4. Resolve all courses with I (Incomplete) prior to beginning the student teaching experience. Course grades must meet the above standards. 5. Complete all correspondence courses with grades posted to the transcript prior to beginning the candidate's student teaching experience. Correspondence courses must be completed by the last week of July if candidates applied to student teach in the fall semester and by the last week in November if candidates applied to student teach in the spring semester. 6. Attend an informational session explaining eligibility requirements and the application process for student teaching and practica. Notification of these sessions is made via e-mail to candidates. 7. Submit, after attending one of the informational sessions, a student teaching application packet to the director of student teaching and clinical practice. This packet must be submitted by the deadline posted on the student teaching bulletin board in the south hall of Greenlawn Hall. This deadline is in early December of the academic year prior to the student teaching semester. For example, candidates planning to student teach during the fall 2012 or spring 2013 semester must submit applications by the end of the fall 2011 semester. Late applications are considered on a case-by-case basis if accompanied by a letter of explanation; however, student teaching placements are not guaranteed for late applicants. Applications are only valid for the academic year listed on the application. If a student teaching experience must be postponed beyond that academic year, a new set of application materials will be required. 8. Provide with the application, the names of two IU South Bend full-time faculty, at least one of whom is from the School of Education, who can be contacted for recommendations. Prior to requesting student teaching placements, a list of candidates applying to student teach is circulated to the faculty for review. Positive evaluations are required for placement. 9. Candidates must provide evidence of successful completion of a certified course in first aid and in CPR. See departmental guidelines for each area. 10. Attend a student teaching orientation session within the last week of July or first two weeks of August for fall student teachers and within the first two weeks of December for spring student teachers. Candidates are notified by letter of these scheduled sessions. 11. Meet with academic advisors to be sure all course requirements are completed prior to student teaching. If it is determined that a candidate has not met degree program requirements, the candidate may be removed at any time from the student teaching or practicum experience. A student teaching placement is not a guarantee that requirements have been met, nor is the process of determining eligibility to be considered a substitute for meeting with an advisor. Candidates found ineligible for student teaching or practica because they did not meet the above criteria may appeal these decisions in writing directly to the dean of the School of Education.SCHOO l OF EDUCATION 4105 12. Candidates are allowed to state preferences for student teaching placements, but the first priority is to place according to availability of qualified classroom supervising teachers. The following restrictions apply to student teaching placements. Candidates may not student teach at schools (and in some instances in school corporations): a. beyond a 20 mile radius of IU South Bend. b. where they have been employed; however, candidates may student teach where they have been substitute teachers. c. where they have been school board members or are related to a school board member. d. out-of-state, except in certain school districts in southern Michigan which have a contractual agreement with Indiana University. e. attended by their children or where a relativ e is employed. If a relative is employed in a central administrative position, candidates may not be allowed to student teach in the school corporation. f. where they hav e attended as a student. It is the candidate's responsibility to complete forms accurately. If it is discovered that a candidate did not provide accurate information and is placed in a school where one of the above limitations applies, the individual may be removed from the student teaching assignment. To ensure that the student teaching office has accurate information, candidates must notify the director of student teaching and clinical practice via e-mail if any changes (name, address, phone number, etc.) occur between the time of application and the start of student teaching. REMOVA l FROM STUDENT TEACHING , P RACTICUM E XPERIENCES , AND I NTERNSHIPS In conjunction with the supervising classroom teacher and university supervisor, the director of student teaching and clinical practice determines if a candidate should be removed from a student teaching placement. The director of student teaching and clinical practice notifies the candidate, school, and school corporation. When a student teacher is removed from a placement, the reasons are explained to the candidate. If the candidate wishes to attempt a second placement, the candidate is required to develop and satisfactorily complete a professional improvement plan before he or she is assigned a second placement. The professional improvement plan is a written document created collaboratively between the student teacher and the director of student teaching and clinical practice. The department head is involved as needed and must sign the plan. The director of student teaching and clinical practice may enlist the assistance of the department head, dean, or a designee in determining if the student teacher's progress is satisfactory and warrants a second placement. Written professional development plans must adequately address all areas of concern and be aligned with IU South Bend standards. The director of student teaching and clinical practice determines if the candidate is to receive an Incomplete or Fail for the semester according to grading policies, or if the candidate is to withdraw from the course. Candidates are only provided two opportunities for successful placements. The second placement is in the next spring or fall semester following the semester in which the candidate is withdrawn from the first placement. APPlYING FOR G RADUATION Resident candidates must file an application for graduation with the Office of Education Student Services. Deadline dates are as follows: T entative l ist Graduation Deadline Posted by May October 1 February 15 August October 1 February 15 December March 1 September 15 Candidates completing work for degrees in the School of Education in absentia must notify the advising office of the School of Education at least two months prior to the time the degree is granted. Candidates not in the School of Education must obtain an application from the dean of the school in which they are enrolled. No education degrees are conferred, nor teaching licenses recommended, without the candidate's successful completion of all certification requirements, including satisfactory performance in student teaching and successfully completing Checkpoint Three. ACCREDITATION , STANDARDS , AND C RITICA l C HEC k POINTS ACCREDITATION The School of Education was granted continuing accreditation by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the Indiana Department of Education Division of Professional Standards through 2012. CONCEPTUA l FRAMEWOR k The members of the faculty and staff in the School of Education have a commitment to preparing future teachers who are classroom leaders. These teachers are competent professionals, display ethical dispositions, and engage in reflective practice. Further, we are committed to preparing educators who can teach learners from diverse backgrounds and who can use technology to enhance instruction and support student learning. These values are the foundation for the School of Education's conceptual framework, which serves as a guide for all program decisions. The following sections summarize the conceptual framework for the School of Education. The term candidate is used to refer to IU South Bend School of Education students. The term student(s) refers to children and youth in P-12 grade levels.1063 SCHOO l OF EDUCATION COMPETENT PROFESSIONA lS Graduates from IU South Bend education degree programs are well versed in the knowledge of the subject matter and how to teach that subject matter to diverse learners. Education candidates have extensive knowledge of learners, instructional pedagogy, diversity, and technology. IU South Bend education candidates know how to apply this knowledge in educational settings. ETHICA l DISPOSITIONS Graduates from IU South Bend teacher education programs are caring and ethical teachers able to support learning and development in all students. Professional dispositions, as defined by the School of Education, are based on the Indiana Professional Standards Board's principles and the code of ethics from the National Education Association. Education candidates must demonstrate their commitment to attaining excellence in teaching and learning. Through their performance in the university classroom and in the field, all education candidates demonstrate their ability to be collaborative, caring professionals dedicated to meeting the needs of diverse learners. A specific list of dispositions is included in our conceptual framework. REFlECTIVE PRACTICE All candidates in the School of Education are reflective practitioners and decision makers able to analyze and grow from their individual professional experience throughout their careers. Education candidates develop habits of reflection as they proceed through their teacher education programs. COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY Teachers prepared at IU South Bend are able to support learning for all students. Our graduates have the knowledge, disposition, and skills necessary to meet the needs of students in today's diverse classrooms. lEADERSHIP Leadership is the newest theme in our conceptual framework. For candidates, leadership is demonstrated through attending class regularly, meeting deadlines, and being a reliable and respectful class participant. As candidates progress through the program, they begin to self-assess strengths and weaknesses in order to set goals for improvement. They take greater responsibility for student learning and incorporate instructive feedback into their field experience and class assignments. By the end of the program, they willingly collaborate with peers and professionals in the school setting with the realization that they can be models for students and other educators. COMMITMENT TO THE INTEGRATION OF T ECHNO l OGY Teachers prepared at IU South Bend have the knowledge, dispositions, and skills necessary to effectively use technology to help all students learn. Education candidates are expected to incorporate technology throughout their course work and clinical experiences in order to facilitate student learning. STANDARDS Programs in the School of Education are aligned with a variety of national and state standards. Candidates must demonstrate that they have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions associated with appropriate standards related to their major. MONITORING OF CANDIDATE PROGRESS TOW ARD M EETING S TANDARDS AT C RITICA l C HEC k POINTS In addition to reviewing grades and cumulative grade point averages, candidate progress is monitored carefully at three critical checkpoints. At these checkpoints candidates are required to submit designated artifacts, aligned with state and national standards, in an Oncourse pseudo course. These artifacts are reviewed by faculty to determine if the candidate is meeting the standards or making progress toward meeting the standards. If the artifact provides evidence that the candidate is meeting the standards a grade of S is assigned for the pseudo course. If the artifact does not meet the standards, the candidate is contacted and a remedial plan is developed. In such cases, the candidate may receive a grade of R, or I. If after participation in the remedial plan, the candidate's artifacts still do not provide evidence of meeting standards or making progress toward meeting standards, a grade of F is assigned for the pseudo course. Additional information about required artifacts is given to candidates in classes taken at the three critical checkpoints, in group advising sessions, and when enrolled in EDUC-F 100 Introduction to Education. The three critical checkpoints are listed below. CHECkPOINT ONE\u2014ADMISSION INTO TEACHER E DUCATION P ROGRAM (TEP) Candidates are administratively enrolled in a pseudo course when they are enrolled in either of the following classes: SCHOO l OF EDUCATION 4107 EDUC-M 311 Methodolog Kindergarten/ Elementary Teachers EDUC-M 314 General Me thods for Senior High- Junior High/Middle School Teachers Candidates must complete specific courses according to major, pass all three sections of Praxis I\u00ae or meet minimum passing scores on alternate assessments, have a 2.5 CGPA, demonstrate professional dispositions as measured in the following classes: EDUC-F 201 Exploring th e Personal Demands of Teaching: Laboratory Experience (2 cr.)

Admission to the university is required and tuition is the same as for classes held in the classroom. Throughout the year, new courses are being developed and several continue to be offered every semester. At IU South Bend, DL classes may require the following: \u0083Attendance at one class at the beginning of the semester for students to become familiar with the requirements of the course, to meet the instructor, and have questions answered \u0083Examinations to be taken on campus; but do not meet for classes Other online courses, referred to as hybrid or blended, require students to be on campus several days during the semester with the rest of the course fulfilling requirements online. While there are clear deadlines to meet for each DL course, for instance, to submit assignments, many students have found it convenient to do the readings, listen to lectures, and fulfill the requirements of the course after work or on weekends. Taking an online course may be different from what a student may be used to; but once students have done well with an online course, more than likely they will take another online course and do as well. Before you register for an online course, take the Student Readiness Survey found at www.distance.iusb.edu/ Student-survey.shtml?file=quiz.js to find out what you should be ready for and expect in an online course. Visit the DL website for up-to-date information on DL courses as well as information on what faculty are requiring of students before taking a DL courses.

Applications for admission into the degree program are available online and from the general studies office. Prior to admission to General Studies, you will meet with a General Studies academic advisor who will work in partnership with you to plan an appropriate academic program. In addition, the 1 credit hour course EDUC-F 203 Topical Exploration in Education: Introduction to General Studies is offered to assist students in the development of a personalized program of study and a schedule to complete the General Studies degree. This course is required of all bachelor's degree students who lack senior standing and is recommended for associate degree students. GRADUATION DEADlINES An application for graduation must be filed in the general studies office no later than March 1 for December graduation or October 1 for May and August graduation. All credit hours of candidates for degrees, except those of the current semester, must be on record at least six weeks prior to the conferring of degrees. Credit hours by correspondence must be on record at least three weeks prior to the conferring of degrees. The school is not responsible for the graduation of students who fail to meet these deadlines. BASIC STRUCTURE General Studies degrees consist of required credit hours in the three subject fields in the College of Arts and Sciences and elective credit hours in any of the academic units of the university. The three subject fields in the College of Arts and Sciences are generally organized as follows. (Schools and divisions not specifically listed here are considered professional schools.) A. ARTS AND HUMANITIES African American Studies History and Philosophy Classical Studies of Science Comparative Literature Philosophy English Religious Studies Fine Arts Speech Folklore Theatre and Dance History World Languages B. SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS Anatomy Mathematics Astronomy Microbiology Biology Physics Chemistry Physiology Computer Science Plant Sciences Geology Zoology C. SOCIAl AND BEHAVIORA l SCIENCES Anthropology Psychology Criminal Justice Political Science Economics Sociology Geography ASSOCIATE OF ARTS IN GENERA l STUDIES At the time of the printing of this publication, the specific date for closing admission to the Associate of Arts in General Studies degree program was under discussion. Any student who has interest in the Associate of Arts in General Studies degree should contact the IU South Bend general studies director or advisor to learn the current specific status for admission to the program.

Academic advisors are available from the Office of Nursing Student Services to assist students in understanding degree requirements. It is important for students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain properly informed throughout their studies.SCHOO l OF NURSING 4129 All provisions of this publication are in effect as soon as a nursing student begins the Nursing Program. This includes both prenursing students newly admitted to IU South Bend and those changing their major to nursing. Students interrupting their studies, students pursuing part-time study, or full-time students who take more than two years to complete prerequisite requirements are subject to policy and curriculum changes as they occur. Curriculum changes during progress toward the degree may result in revision of degree requirements. THE CODE OF ETHICS FOR NURSES Students preparing to enter the profession of nursing are expected to follow the Code of Ethics for Nurses. Each person, upon entering the profession, inherits a measure of responsibility and trust in the profession and the corresponding obligation to adhere to standards of ethical practice and conduct set by the profession. The code was adopted by the American Nurses' Association in 1950 and most recently revised in 2001. It is the student's responsibility to know, understand, and follow the Code of Ethics for Nurses. 1. The nurse, in all professional relationships, practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and uniqueness of every individual, unrestricted by considerations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems. 2. The nurse' s primary commitment is to the patient, whether an individual, family, group, or community. 3. The nurse promotes, advocates for, and strives to protect the health, safety, and rights of the patient. 4. The nurse is responsible and accountable for individual nursing practice and determines the appropriate delegation of tasks consistent with the nurse's obligation to provide optimal patient care. 5. The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to preserve integrity and safety, to maintain competence, and to continue personal and professional growth. 6. The nurse participates in establishing, maintaining, and improving health care environments and conditions of employment conducive to the provision of quality health care and consistent with the values of the profession through individual and collective action. 7. The nurse participates in the advancement of the profession through contributions to practice, education, administration, and knowledge development. 8. The nurse collaborates with other health professionals and the public in promoting community, national, and international efforts to meet health needs. 9. The profession of nursing, as represented by associations and their members, is responsible for articulating nursing values, for maintaining the integrity of the profession and its practice, and for shaping social policy.STATEMENT OF ESSENTIA l ABIlITIES Approved by the Indiana University School of Nursing, University Council of Nursing Faculty, April 26, 1993, and updated March 2004. The School of Nursing faculty has specified essential abilities (technical standards) critical to the success of students in any IU Nursing Program. Students must demonstrate these essential abilities to succeed in their program of study. Qualified applicants are expected to meet all admission criteria and matriculating students are expected to meet all progression criteria, as well as these essential abilities (technical standards) with or without reasonable accommodations. 1. Essential judgment skills to include: ability to identify, assess, and comprehend conditions surrounding patient situations for the purpose of problem solving around patient conditions and coming to appropriate conclusions and/or course of actions. 2. Essential physical/neurological functions to include: ability to use the senses of seeing, hearing, touch, and smell to make correct judgments regarding patient conditions and meet physical expectations to perform required interventions for the purpose of demonstrating competence to safely engage in the practice of nursing. Behaviors that demonstrate essential neurological and physical functions include, but are not limited to, observation, listening, understanding relationships, writing, and psychomotor abilities consistent with course and program expectations. 3. Essential communication skills to include: ability to communicate effectively with fellow students, faculty, patients, and all members of the health care team. Skills include verbal, written, and nonverbal abilities as well as information technology skills consistent with effective communication. 4. Essential emotional coping skills: ability to demonstrate the mental health necessary to safely engage in the practice of nursing as determined by professional standards of practice. 5. Essential intellectual/conceptual skills to include: ability to measure, calculate, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate to engage competently in the safe practice of nursing. 6.

The student must demonstrate responsibility and accountability for actions as a student in the School of Nursing and as a developing professional nurse consistent with accepted standards of practice. Failure to meet one or more of the essential abilities may hinder progression or result in dismissal from the Nursing Program. Any student who is questioning their ability to meet one or more of the essential abilities should contact the disability services officer at (574) 520-4479 prior to enrollment in nursing courses. Documentation 1303 COllEGE OF HEA lTH SCIENCES of any requested accommodation must be submitted to the Admission, Progression, and Graduation Committee in the School of Nursing for review at least two months prior to matriculation into the nursing major. STUDENTS WITH DISABI lITIES The university is committed to helping temporarily and permanently disabled students make the transition to student life. Students with physical, mental, or learning impairments are encouraged to consult with advisors from the School of Nursing and Disability Support Services for assistance in meeting degree requirements. Students with disabilities must meet all academic and technical skill requirements as outlined in the Statement of Essential Abilities and any other standards related to professional licensure. Modifications in the learning environment to assist students in meeting these requirements are made in accordance with federal and university guidelines and in consideration of individual needs. Disability Support Services is located on the first floor of the Administration Building. ElIGIBIlITY FOR lICENSURE Any person who makes application for examination and registration as a registered nurse in the state of Indiana shall submit to the Indiana State Board of Nursing at the Health Professions Service Bureau written evidence, verified by oath, that he or she: \u0083Completed an approved high school course of study or the equivalent, as approved by the appropriate educational agency \u0083Completed the prescribed curriculum in a state-accredited school of nursing and holds a diploma or certificate therefrom \u0083Has not been convicted of any act that would constitute a ground for disciplinary sanction under the state board rules and regulations or of any felony that has direct bearing on the individual's ability to practice competently International students and graduates of schools of nursing that are outside the United States must meet the requirements of the Indiana State Board of Nursing for eligibility to sit for the National Council Licensing Examination (NCLEX).ClINICA l REGUlATIONS B.S.N. S TUDENT POlICY HANDBOO k All nursing students are provided with a B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook at the clinical orientation beginning with the sophomore semester. This document is updated (at least) annually to reflect ongoing changes in clinical and program requirements and policies. While the School of Nursing provides these updates, it is the student's responsibility to maintain the currency of the handbook and refer to the most current regulations. CPR R EqUIREMENT All nursing major students enrolled in clinical classes must present evidence of current health care provider certification prior to the beginning of each semester. Two options are available: \u0083American Heart Association's Basic Life Support for Health Care Provider level (preferred) \u0083American Red Cross CPR/AED for the Professional Rescuer OSHA R EGUlATIONS Health requirements and OSHA regulations include annual education on blood borne pathogens. See the B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook for annual regulatory requirements. Clinical agencies may have additional requirements which must be met. HEAlTH R E q UIREMENTS All nursing students must show annual proof that they have met the immunization, physical examination, and laboratory examination requirements of hospitals and other health agencies used for clinical experiences. Specific instructions are distributed prior to clinical assignment. Special circumstances may arise which require additional action. Failure to meet health requirements and their deadlines makes the student ineligible for clinical classes and the student is administratively withdrawn from all nursing courses. The student is then considered to be out-of-progression in the Nursing Program. Detailed requirements and descriptions are provided in the B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook. CRIMINA l CHECkS Federal mandates for clinical agencies require criminal history inquiries through certified background checks or designated alternate state or federal inquiry program. Students are responsible for applying for the criminal check and all fees associated with the check upon application to the major and prior to the seventh semester courses. SCHOO l OF NURSING 4131 HEAlTH AND CPR R E q UIREMENTS Upon Admission to the Nursing Program In accordance with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations and local health facilities requirements, nursing students are required to provide: \u0083Immunization verification for Hepatitis B \u0083Immunization verification for TDap (Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertusis) (within 10 years) \u0083MMR (two doses of MMR or two doses of ProQuad or mumps titer of 1:10 is required) \u0083Varicella vaccine or history of the disease \u0083Tuberculosis (TB) testing \u0083Up-to-date completed health evaluation (within one year) \u0083CPR (professional level) certification Titers are acceptable forms of documentation. Any international student or student whose country of origin where TB is considered endemic must be tested at the IU South Bend Health and Wellness Center. Those testing positive will be required to have a blood test confirming their TB status. Requirements may change as recommendations of the CDC indicate. Specific, current information and guidelines can be found in the B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook. The deadlines for submitting the health and safety requirements for students entering the fourth semester are: Semester Date Fall semester July 15 Spring semester October 15 Summer semester May 1 Failure to do so results in the student being automatically withdrawn from all clinical nursing courses for which they are registered and the student is considered to be out-of-progression in the Nursing Program. Students who come to class and are in noncompliance are not allowed to enter the clinical setting. Students admitted late to the Nursing Program are handled on a case-by-case basis. All applicants are encouraged to begin gathering the necessary documentation to avoid delays upon admission. Even students admitted late must have all documentation on file with the School of Nursing prior to beginning the clinical nursing courses. Failure to do so results in the student being automatically withdrawn from all clinical nursing courses for which they are registered and the student is considered to be out-of-progression in the Nursing Program. For Continuing Nursing Students Nursing students are responsible for making sure they receive annual TB testing and annual CPR recertification. In addition, immunization status must be updated as necessary. It is the student's responsibility to monitor the status of these and to submit proper documentation to the School of Nursing in a timely manner. If any of these items expire during the course of the semester, certification must occur before the student may enroll in any clinical courses that semester. Additional requirements may be added as clinical regulations are updated. Clinical agencies have the right to request additional health and safety stipulations. Documentation of annual TB testing, annual CPR recertification, and up-to-date immunization status must be submitted to the School of Nursing's student services office no later than August 1 for students enrolled in clinical nursing courses in the fall semester. If the student is enrolled in clinical nursing courses during the fall semester, documentation of CPR recertification, TB testing, and immunizations must be valid through December 20. If the student is enrolled for the spring semester, CPR recertification, immunizations, and TB testing documentation must be submitted to the School of Nursing's student services office no later than December 1 and must be valid through May 15. For summer these must be valid May 1 to August 20. (For example, if a student's CPR certification expired on March 1, 2011, the student must successfully complete CPR recertification before he or she is allowed to begin spring 2011 semester classes.) Students who come to class, and are in noncompliance, are not allowed to enter the clinical setting. For students finishing an incomplete grade in a nursing course with a clinical component, the CPR recertification, immunizations, and TB testing must be valid until the course requirements are complete. STUDENT INJURIES If a student is injured in a clinical agency, the student must report to the clinical instructor and follow the policy of the agency where the injury occurred. Students should also contact their primary care provider. Follow-up care may be required from the student's primary care provider at the student's expense. UNIFORMS Strict uniform and appearance code regulations are enforced throughout the student's clinical experience. Guidelines for uniforms, agency dress codes, and professional appearance are located in the B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook. NAME PIN/IU SOUTH BEND PA TCH Name pins are required for all clinical experiences, along with individual agency requirements for personal identification. Students are additionally identified as an IU South Bend student by a school patch or embroidery on their uniform. More information can be found in the B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook. SUPPlIES AND EqUIPMENT Students are required to purchase a laboratory skills supply pack and basic assessment equipment for the sophomore-year laboratories and clinicals. See B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook for details and estimated prices.1323 COllEGE OF HEA lTH SCIENCES HEAlTH I NSURANCE The School of Nursing encourages students to carry health insurance and is not liable for any health problems requiring medical treatment. Health insurance information is available upon request. PROFESSIONA l lIABI l ITY I NSURANCE All students in the School of Nursing having patient/client contact are covered under the malpractice contract for Indiana University. This liability insurance does not extend to employment outside of course-related activities. The student should know that failure to pay course and other fees results in noncoverage under Indiana University's malpractice contract. Such noncoverage makes the student ineligible to attend clinical classes. APA F ORMAT The most recent American Psychological Association (APA) format is the standard used for all written work in all nursing courses. Students should consult course syllabi for specific details. REMEDIA l COURSE REqUIREMENTS Applicants to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program must successfully complete all developmental courses in which they place, including the following: EDUC-X 100 Practical Reading and Study for Self Improvement EDUC-X 101 Techniques in Textbook Reading ENG-W 31 Pre-Composition ENG-W 130 Principles o f Composition MATH-M 4 Introduction to Algebra MATH-M 14 Basic Algeb ra (4 cr.) MATH-M 107 College Alge bra Students interested in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program should complete courses in mathematics as early as possible to facilitate completion of science prerequisite courses. CORRESPONDENCE /INDEPENDENT STUDY C OURSES All required and elective courses for the nursing major, other than public speaking, available through the Indiana University Independent Study Program, must be taken for credit. Students should contact a School of Nursing academic advisor before enrollment. Students are required to have the academic advisor's signature for all correspondence courses used to satisfy degree requirements. Correspondence courses with nursing numbers do not satisfy residency requirements. Final examinations in all correspondence courses must be taken no later than six weeks prior to the expected graduation date. Nursing students shall have completed any correspondence or independent study courses prior to enrollment in their final semester of the program, or register for the on-campus course in that final semester.PORTFO lIO OPTION The portfolio review process is available to all students who believe that their prior experience can meet the learning objectives/competencies required of a specific nursing course within their program of study, subject to faculty approval. The portfolio is a mechanism used to validate the acquisition of knowledge and skills congruent with course expectations and student learning outcomes. Students may exercise the portfolio option for all B.S.N. major courses listed for the degree as long as it does not interfere with other standing university or school course/credit hour policies related to progression or graduation. Undergraduate students must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours on the campus awarding the degree. Courses/credit hours which are reviewed for portfolio credit do not count toward undergraduate residency requirements. Contact the School of Nursing for portfolio guidelines. SATISFACTORY /FAI l O PTION The School of Nursing, in grading undergraduate clinical nursing courses, uses the Satisfactory/Fail option. Grades are recorded as S or F. Students must demonstrate a satisfactory level of clinical competence and skill to receive a satisfactory grade in these courses. Satisfactory performance standards are stated in each course syllabus and faculty evaluate the quality of student clinical performances by these standards. Inability to receive a grade of S constitutes failure. An S indicates a grade of A, B, or C (2.0). Students receiving an F cannot progress in their Nursing Program until this deficiency is corrected. Note: This is a School of Nursing policy for nursing courses and is not the same as the IU South Bend policy for the Pass/Fail option located in the beginning of this publication . RESIDENCY REqUIREMENTS A student must complete a minimum of 30 upper- division credit hours in the Indiana University School of Nursing Bachelor of Science in Nursing to be eligible for graduation. A maximum of 6 lower-division nursing credit hours may apply toward this residency requirement. Students must petition the appropriate academic officer to apply those lower-division nursing credit hours toward the residency requirement. Credit for correspondence courses and advanced standing by the validation process may not be used to meet residency requirements. ASSOCIATE OF SCIENCE IN NURSING PROGRAM A RTICU l ATION Students wishing to pursue an Associate of Science in Nursing have several local options. IU South Bend and Ivy Tech Community College (South Bend) work closely to provide seamless educational choices. Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend can be contacted at (574) 289-7001, extension 5721, for additional information.SCHOO l OF NURSING 4133 IU South Bend School of Nursing and Southwestern Michigan College have also agreed to work together to make the transfer process as smooth as possible. Students may complete prerequisite courses at IU South Bend, transfer to Southwestern Michigan College for the associate nursing degree, and return to IU South Bend for their Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Students interested in this option should contact the nursing department at Southwestern Michigan College at (269) 782-1000. COMPlEMENTARY HEAlTH Northside Hall 446 (574) 520-4336www.iusb.edu/~sbnurse/complementaryhlth.shtml Coordinator: Sofhauser Lay and professional discourse surrounding complementary therapies abounds and consumers are seeking out and using them. Therefore, it is critical that all interested students, particularly future health care providers, be given the academic opportunity to learn about and explore complementary therapies and the issues surrounding their use. Students achieving a minor in complementary health gain a thorough understanding of a number of complementary therapies. This understanding involves exploring the foundational belief systems of these therapies and the cultures from which they are derived. Students critically examine complementary therapies in light of the disease processes for which they are prescribed as well as explore the inherent political, economic, and ethical issues surrounding these therapies. Any interested IU South Bend student may complete a minor in complementary health. Students interested in pursuing a minor must register their intentions with the School of Nursing and consult with a faculty advisor prior to enrollment in required core courses. MINOR IN COMPlEMENTARY HEAlTH The minor in complementary health consists of 15 credit hours and is awarded by the School of Nursing on the IU South Bend campus. Students are required to take a core of two required courses for a total of 6 credit hours and a 1 credit hour capstone course. The two required courses may be taken in any order to facilitate student completion of the minor. However, it is recommended that students take NURS-K 301 Complementary Health Therapies before NURS-K 401 Integrative Health. Students may select a total of 8 credit hours of electives to fulfill the requirements of the minor. Elective courses enable the student to expand and build upon knowledge acquired in the core courses. Selection of electives permits the student to personalize the minor in a way that proves most helpful in their chosen field. Acceptance of elective courses for credit toward the minor is granted by the IU South Bend School of Nursing Admission, Progression, and Graduation (APG) Committee.REqUIREMENTS (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)

The curriculum prepares a generalist in professional nursing and serves as a basis for graduate study. The B.S.N. degree program is offered at several Indiana University campuses. All campuses share similar admission standards, program outcomes, and courses. Admission and transfer policies are set by individual campuses and course sequencing may vary. BACHE lOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM OUTCOMES The purpose of the bachelor's degree program is to produce graduates who think critically; are culturally, ethically, and legally competent; are effective, politically aware, communicators and coordinators of community resources; and are competent providers of health care, professional role models, and responsible managers. The curriculum focuses on health and wellness as well as alterations in states of wellness and viewing persons as part of their environments. \u0083Critical thinker who is able to demonstrate intellectual curiosity, rational inquiry, problem-solving skills, and creativity in framing problems \u0083Culturally competent person who provides holistic nursing care to a variety of individuals, families, and communities \u0083Knowledgeable care coordinator who facilitates access to resources necessary to meet the health care needs of individuals, families, and communities \u0083An individual who understands the political dynamics in various settings and participates in the change process to shape health care policy \u0083An individual who practices within an ethical and legal framework for the nursing profession and demonstrates ethical behavior related to the privacy, security, and confidentiality of patient information \u0083Effective communicator who is able to share accurate information \u0083Competent provider of nursing care who functions in various professional nurse roles in structured and semi-structured health care settings \u0083Professional role model who promotes a positive public image of nursing \u0083A responsible manager who balances human, fiscal, and material resources to achieve quality health care outcomes ACADEMIC POlICIES Students admitted to the clinical nursing major should consult the current IU South Bend Bulletin, B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook and School of Nursing policy updates for additional policies governing their academic standing.ADMISSION , PROGRESSION , AND GRADUATION C OMMITTEE Comprised of nursing faculty, the Admission, Progression, and Graduation (APG) Committee addresses student concerns and issues related to admission, progression through, and graduation from the degree programs offered by the School of Nursing. ACADEMIC DISTINCTION To graduate with academic distinction, bachelor's degree candidates must complete a minimum of 60 credit hours at Indiana University. Academic distinction is conferred on graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, and is based on grades earned through the eighth semester. Academic Distinction Highest Distinction 3.83-4.00 GPA High Distinction 3.66-3.82 GPA Distinction 3.50-3.65 GPA ACADEMIC STANDING OF PRENURSING STUDENTS The following academic standards apply regarding retention, probation, and dismissal.

See program admission policies. Cumulative Grade Point Average Cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is a reflection of all work completed at Indiana University. Courses transferred from another institution are not used in calculating this average. Transfer course grade point average (GPA) is calculated in AGPA for B.S.N. application for admission. See B.S.N. degree program admission. Nursing Grade Point Average Nursing grade point average (NGPA) is a reflection of all work completed; including grades earned in initial and repeat enrollment (FX policy applies) that apply toward the requirements of appropriate programs. Courses transferred from other institutions are included in calculating this average. PROBATION Academic Probation A prenursing student is placed on academic probation according to the policies of IU South Bend. A nursing student is placed on academic probation when the CGPA falls below 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Academic probation is removed following the semester in which the cumulative and semester grade point averages are 2.0 or higher. Nursing students should also see progression policies listed under Clinical Progression in the School of Nursing Program. Disciplinary Probation Disciplinary probation is administered under the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, the Statement of Essential Abilities and Code of Ethics for Nurses.DISMISSA l A prenursing student is dismissed based upon the dismissal policies of IU South Bend, found earlier in this publication. A nursing student is dismissed from the program when, in the judgment of the APG Committee, there is a lack of progress toward the degree. Lack of progress includes, but is not limited to the following: \u0083Failure to achieve a 2.0 semester GPA in any two consecutive semesters \u0083Failure to achieve a CGPA of 2.0 in any two semesters \u0083Failure to achieve a minimum grade of C (2.0) or S (Satisfactory) in any one nursing course (didactic or practicum/clinical) by the second attempt, or any two nursing courses (didactic or practicum/clinical) on the first attempt \u0083Failure to meet Indiana University School of Nursing essential abilities expectations (refer to the Statement of Essential Abilities listed under General Policies of the School of Nursing in this section of this publication) Dismissal may occur without prior probation. Any student who is academically dismissed at one Indiana University campus is also in dismissal status at all other Indiana University campuses. Falsification of records and reports, plagiarism, or cheating on an examination, quiz, or any other assignment is cause for dismissal (see Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct). The faculty reserves the right to dismiss any nursing student whose personal integrity, health, or conduct demonstrates unfitness to continue preparation for the profession of nursing. Integrity and conduct is judged according to the standards of the most recent Code of Ethics for Nurses as adopted by the American Nurses' Association and the IU School of Nursing Statement of Essential Abilities. The dismissal of any nursing student is contingent upon review by the APG Committee on the campus of enrollment. Nursing student dismissal is subject to the appeal process on the campus of enrollment. REINSTATEMENT Students who have been dismissed and desire reinstatement must submit a written request for reinstatement to the APG Committee. The written request must be submitted by July 1 for fall reinstatement, October 1 for spring reinstatement, and February 1 for summer session reinstatement. This request requires a list of the specific courses in which the student wishes to enroll and, as appropriate, an explanation of any extenuating circumstances that may have hindered academic performance, and a Plan for Success addressing areas of deficiency. Reinstatement requests are evaluated individually by the APG Committee on the basis of academic standing, potential for progress toward the degree, availability of resources, and satisfactory completion of any conditions and/or faculty recommendations existing at the time of dismissal. Reinstatement to the School of Nursing is not automatic.1363 COllEGE OF HEA lTH SCIENCES Appeals for immediate reinstatement are not considered except as warranted by extraordinary circumstances. In such cases, students reinstated by the APG Committee have prescribed standards of performance for the semester for which they are reinstated. Failure to meet these standards results in an irrevocable dismissal. Students who are reinstated must adhere to policies in effect at the time of reinstatement. (See B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook, the IU South Bend Bulletin, and policy updates.) A nursing student is reinstated only one time. A reinstated nursing student is dismissed from the School of Nursing upon failure of one additional nursing course, breach of the Code of Ethics for Nurses, the Statement of Essential Abilities, or the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (see dismissal policy). For reinstatement priority, refer to Clinical Progression in the Nursing Program section of this publication. PROGRAM ADMISSION Courses required for admission may be taken at any Indiana University campus or may be accepted as transfer credit hours from other accredited institutions. However, admission is campus specific and priority consideration is given to those students completing the majority of their course work at IU South Bend. Admission to the major is highly competitive. Contact a student services advisor for more information. Specific admission requirements vary from campus to campus at Indiana University. When choosing courses to meet curriculum requirements, students who begin their prenursing course work on one campus of Indiana University but plan to apply for admission on another campus of Indiana University should be in close contact with the School of Nursing advisor on the campus to which they plan to apply. Submission of an official credit transfer report (CTR) to the School of Nursing is required for all work being transferred from another university by established deadlines. To obtain an official CTR, the student must request an official transcript from the other institution(s) to be forwarded to the IU South Bend Office of Admissions for evaluation.Admission to the university as a prenursing student and successful completion of the prerequisite course work do not guarantee admission to the nursing major. The number of admitted students is limited to those who can be accommodated given available resources. APPlICATION AND ADMISSION REqUIREMENTS \u0083Admission to Indiana University as a degree-seeking student. \u0083Maintenance of a cumulative grade point average of no less than 2.5 on a 4.0 scale. \u0083Maintenance of an admission GPA of no less than 2.7 on a 4.0 scale. Although a 2.7 AGPA is the minimum required for application, admission is competitive and a higher AGPA may be required in a given application pool. \u0083Completion of chemistry (a one-year high school course, or CHEM-C 101 Elementary Chemistry 1, CHEM-C 121 Elementary Chemistry Laboratory 1 equivalent) with a grade of C (2.0) or higher within the past five years. \u0083Passing a comprehensive criminal background check. \u0083Completion of the following required courses with a grade of C or higher by the second attempt: CHEM-C 102 Elementary Chemistry 2 ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition 1 MICR-M 250 Microbial Cell Biology MICR-M 255 Microbiolog y Laboratory (2 cr.) PHSL-P 261 Human Anatomy and Physiology 1 (5 cr.) PHSL-P 262 Human Anatomy and Physiology 2 (5 cr.) PSY-P 103 General Psy chology PSY-P 2 16 L ife Span Developmental Psychology SOC-S 161 Principles o f Sociology Application and admission are valid only for the semester designated. Students offered admission to the nursing major must enroll in nursing course work at a time designated by the School of Nursing. Failure to enroll in nursing course work in the designated semester necessitates reapplying to the program. Students admitted to the nursing major must formally accept or decline admission to the degree program, in writing, prior to the beginning of the semester to which they are admitted. Students accepted to the program but decline acceptance must reapply to the program of choice and compete with the applicant pool for the semester in which they request entrance. Students have only two opportunities to decline admission in writing prior to losing their eligibility to apply. Students admitted to the nursing major who withdraw from course work within the first semester must reapply for admission to the program. These students have one opportunity for readmission, must reapply within a time frame that would allow the student timely completion of the program considering the seven-year limit of specific courses, and must adhere to the published dates for application on their campuses. SCHOO l OF NURSING 4137 REPEAT POlICY The School of Nursing policy requires students to achieve a grade of C (2.0) in each required course. Students who earn a grade of less than C in a required course must earn a grade of C by the second completed attempt. Students who earn a grade of less than C in a required course are strongly urged to successfully complete the course in the next semester of enrollment, providing the course is offered. Both prenursing and nursing students who do not successfully complete all required general-education courses with a minimum grade of C by the second completed attempt are ineligible for admission to the Nursing Program or are dismissed from the School of Nursing. Students may repeat only three courses, or a maximum of 11 credit hours, of the required general-education courses in an effort to achieve a C or higher in each course (two science or three general-education electives). The School of Nursing follows the IU South Bend grade replacement policy . SEVEN -YEAR lIMIT Courses in life span development, required sciences, and statistics must have been completed within seven (7) years prior to the semester in which a student begins the nursing major. This policy does not apply to registered nurses in the R.N. to B.S.N. program. TRANSFER STUDENTS Intercampus Transfer Nursing students in good academic standing may seek intercampus transfer by petitioning the APG Committee at least one semester in advance of the requested transfer. Due to the difference in course sequencing, students seeking an intercampus transfer should do so only at the completion of all nursing courses required in the sophomore or junior year. Intercampus transfer requests submitted to the APG Committee that ask for mid-year transfer consideration is discouraged. Intercampus transfer requests are evaluated individually on the basis of the student's academic record, the availability of space in the required courses, and faculty and facility resources. Nursing students who wish to transfer between campuses should check for the process on the campus to which they are transferring. To transfer to the South Bend campus, the student must submit a written request for intercampus transfer to the APG Committee by July 1 for fall transfer, October 1 for spring transfer, and February 1 for summer session transfer. Transfer from Non-Indiana University Nursing Program Nursing students in good academic standing at another university who wish to transfer should contact the School of Nursing director of student services. Nursing courses completed at other universities must be evaluated by the IU South Bend School of Nursing APG Committee for transfer equivalency and for student placement. Students must pass the skills validation examinations and supply extensive documentation, including copies of the syllabi for each nursing course completed at another university and a release of information form. These syllabi must be evaluated in comparison to the IU South Bend nursing courses. This process can take time; therefore, students are encouraged to contact the IU South Bend School of Nursing at least three months prior to the semester they wish to begin at IU South Bend. A.S.N./A.D.N. nursing courses are nontransferable to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program. Dismissed Transfer Students IU South Bend School of Nursing does not accept students into the nursing major if the student has been dismissed or has a failing record from another nursing program, including Indiana University programs, in the past five years. If the five years have been exceeded an individual record review occurs. ClINICA l PROGRESSION IN THE NURSING PROGRAM After admission to the Nursing Program, placement in nursing courses is based upon the following priority ranking: 1. Full-time, regularly progressing students. 2. Part-time, regularly progressing students. 3. Students who interrupted their studies but are in good academic standing. 4. Students who failed and successfully repeated a nursing course. 5. Students who need to repeat a nursing course. 6. Students who were dismissed and are reinstated. 7. Intercampus transfers. 8. Transfers from other nursing programs according to APG guidelines. If additional criteria are needed to determine placement, the date of becoming out-of-progression and CGPA is used. 1383 COllEGE OF HEA lTH SCIENCES OUT-OF -P ROGRESSION Nursing students who withdrew from the second sophomore semester, junior year, or senior year of course work, or have failed a nursing course are considered to be out-of-progression. Students who do not meet health and safety requirement deadlines are considered to be out-of-progression. Nursing students who withdraw from all or part of the fourth semester of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program must reapply to the program. RESUMING PROGRESSION Prenursing students who interrupt their studies and are in good standing may reenter at any time without prior approval of the School of Nursing. These students are subject to the policies in effect at the time of reentry and space availability. Prenursing and nursing students in poor standing (or dismissed) must request approval to continue from the APG Committee. Students must include in their request a Plan for Success addressing areas of deficiency. Nursing students who wish to reenter or progress must submit a written request for reentry to the APG Committee by July 1 for fall reinstatement, October 1 for spring reinstatement, and February 1 for summer session reinstatement. This request requires a list of the specific courses in which the student wishes to enroll and, as appropriate, an explanation of any extenuating circumstances that may have hindered academic performance, and a Plan for Success addressing areas of deficiency. All requests for progression are evaluated on the basis of available resources, and, if appropriate, on the satisfactory completion of any conditions and/or faculty recommendations existing at the time progression was disrupted. Students who reenter must adhere to the academic policies in effect at the time of resuming studies. For progression priority, refer to the previous section on Clinical Progression in this publication. SkIllS VA l IDATION P O l ICY Students who interrupt their studies are required to demonstrate validation of clinical skills to reenter the clinical courses. Also, transfer students who completed clinical courses in another program must successfully complete a clinical skills validation and mathematics proficiency examination prior to acceptance into the program. (See B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook for current skills validation requirements.) ClINICA l HOURS REqUIREMENTS Clinical hour requirements are carefully calculated to meet academic and accreditation standards. Therefore, all clinical hours are mandatory and all missed time must be made up. See the B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook and/or course syllabus for specific clinical requirements and policies regarding missed time. Insufficient clinical hours results in course failure. WITHDRAWA l POlICIES Withdrawals (grade of W) are issued to students wishing to withdraw from any or all courses if the official withdrawal forms are completed by the deadline dates established by the registrar's office for each semester. A grade of W appears on student transcripts when students complete the official withdrawal forms and obtain the appropriate signature(s). \u0083Students enrolled in a modular (half-semester) nursing course must withdraw from that course before the course meets for the sixth time. \u0083After the ninth week of a sixteen-week course, the grade awarded is an F unless the student petitions the faculty for an exception to the policy. An exception may be granted only if the student has a didactic grade of at least C (2.0) or a clinical grade of S (Satisfactory), and has compelling reasons for withdrawing. The faculty and campus dean (or designee) determine if the grade of W is issued. \u0083A grade of F is recorded on the official transcript if a student stops attending but does not officially withdraw from a class. \u0083Students may be withdrawn from (a) nursing course(s) until a required prerequisite general-education course is satisfactorily completed. \u0083Students withdrawing from nursing course work must complete this work prior to progression in the program. \u0083Withdrawal from a required nursing didactic course requires withdrawal from corequisite nursing clinical course(s). Students who withdraw from the nursing major in the first semester must seek readmission to the program. Admission is subject to competitive review. Withdrawal from Nursing Program courses constitutes a disruption in progression and requires that a student seek reinstatement or reentry to the program. (Refer to reinstatement and/or progression policies.) Students withdrawing from required nursing course work are considered to be out-of-progression students. The date of graduation for out-of-progression students is not guaranteed. More than three academic withdrawals in a semester is considered lack of progress toward the degree. If a student withdraws from a didactic course that requires automatic withdraw from a corequisite course, this withdrawal from the two courses is counted as one withdrawal. A pattern of withdrawals may influence a request for consideration of progression, reinstatement, or reentry to the Nursing Program. GRADUATION REqUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S.N. Students assume responsibility for meeting degree requirements and for filing an official application for a degree. Application for the degree must be made at the time of program planning for the final semester. The student must file the degree application with the School of Nursing recorder by September 15 for December graduation and by January 15 for May, June, or August SCHOO l OF NURSING 4139 graduation. Minors are declared and approved on the official application for degree and require the signature of the appropriate department chair to confirm completion of the minor. Students in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program are responsible for meeting the following degree requirements. Though the School of Nursing makes every attempt to provide students with academic advising and program planning assistance, students are accountable for complying with all published academic policies related to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program. To be eligible for graduation from the program students must: \u0083Complete a minimum of 123 credit hours with a grade of C or higher in each course required for the degree. Of the 123 credit hours, 63 credit hours must reflect nursing major courses. Credit hours earned in remedial learning skill courses and repeated courses do not count in the 123 credit hour total, nor in the 63 nursing credit hour total. \u0083Achieve a grade of C or higher in all didactic courses applied to the B.S.N. degree and an S (Satisfactory) in all clinical/practicum courses. \u0083Achieve an Indiana University CGPA of at least a 2.0 (C). This includes all transfer course work applied to the degree. \u0083Complete at least 30 credit hours of required nursing major courses on the Indiana University campus awarding the B.S.N. degree. \u0083Complete all B.S.N. degree requirements within six years of enrolling in the first nursing course in the nursing major. \u0083Apply for degree candidacy the semester prior to completing all degree requirements, following the published procedures on the campus awarding degree. \u0083Nonlicensed students are required to complete an NCLEX readiness examination. COMPlETION OF DEGREE REqUIREMENTS The registrar must receive all removal of Incompletes, deferred grades, special credit, and independent study grades no later than three weeks prior to the end of classes of the student's last semester or summer session before graduation. APPlICATION FOR lICENSURE EXAMINATION The School of Nursing makes available the necessary forms to take the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) in Indiana. Those students taking the examination in other states are responsible for obtaining the appropriate forms from those states. It is the student's responsibility to complete the application procedure and meet the mailing and payment deadlines for taking the NCLEX. The School of Nursing administers required assessment tools for preparation for the NCLEX in the last semester of the program. These are outlined in the current B.S.N. Student Policy Handbook and/or the final semester courses.CURRICU lUM DESIGN Course work in the B.S.N. curriculum is divided into two separate areas: general education and nursing. GENERA l EDUCATION For a more detailed description of the IU South Bend general-education curriculum, including lists of approved courses, see pages 35-40 in this publication. All courses certified as meeting the campuswide general- education requirements are designated in the Schedule of Classes. General-education courses help lay the foundation for the nursing courses and also serve to provide the student with a well-rounded education. The general-education portion of the B.S.N. curriculum consists of approximately 60 credit hours, divided into area or course clusters. The campuswide general-education requirements are incorporated into the program of study. Although some courses may meet the requirements of more than one cluster, a single course can only be used to meet one requirement. All courses required for the degree must be taken for a grade. Certain courses require prerequisite or developmental courses, which are not listed here. CAMPUSWIDE CURRICU lUM (33-39 CR.) (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.)

Program track. BACHE lOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING P ROGRAM FOR R EGISTERED N URSES (R.N. TO B.S.N. / R.N.\u2014B.S.N.) The IU South Bend School of Nursing degree program for Registered Nurses (R.N.) continuing their education through a B.S.N. degree strives to involve the R.N.'s talents, experiences, and expertise in the curriculum. As such, the curriculum prepares a generalist in professional nursing and serves as the basis for graduate studies. The purpose of the bachelor's degree program is to offer a creative curriculum for the education of professional nurses competent in meeting the current and future health needs of society. For the R.N., the curriculum builds on the nurse's basic preparation and is designed to maximize their completed formal education and experiences in nursing. A bachelor's degree education begins with an ample foundation in the sciences and humanities to assist the graduate expand their appreciation for, and participation in, the broader community and culture. These general-education courses are typically offered in the traditional semester format in the evenings or during the day. The upper-division nursing courses prepare nurses for career enhancement and transitions in the changing health care system and world. Efforts are made to alternate these courses so that several courses are offered either on a single day or in the evenings. Interactions in the classroom and clinical sites with other B.S.N. students and faculty benefit everyone in their professional development. Following a thorough self-assessment of past experiences, education and professional goals, the R.N. can design an individual course plan to best meet his or her needs and aspirations. (While every effort is made to develop a plan to meet requirements in a timely manner, interruptions in study plans do not guarantee the courses for the initial plan or the graduation date.) Nurses with clinical and/or management work experience can exchange this background for clinical courses through special credits or the portfolio option. Nurses may also request course substitutions for content offered by other disciplines which may be a part of their career plans. To help the R.N. meet the curriculum requirements in a flexible and individual manner, an advisor can clarify curriculum requirements as well as assist with the progression assessment and plan of study. Students must also meet the requirements for admission to IU South Bend.

RADIOGRAPHY AND AllIED HEAlTH Northside Hall 405 (574) 520-5570radahlt@iusb.edu Joy RADIOGRAPHY PROGRAM Radiography is an art and science which involves the medical imaging of patients to produce a radiograph for the diagnosis of disease. The main goal of the radiographer is to produce the highest quality diagnostic image using ALARA (As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable) Radiation Standards with a minimum amount of patient discomfort. A radiographer's job duties involve multiple areas of expertise\u2014trauma, surgery, fluoroscopy, portable/mobiles, and general diagnostic radiography. Constant growth in the field has created many new and exciting careers in Ultrasound (US), Pet Scan, Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), cardiovascular/interventional radiography, radiation therapy, and nuclear medicine. The radiographer functions in many different roles within the health profession. They may work independently or interact with other members of the health care team such as radiologists, surgeons, emergency medicine physicians, cardiologists, and nurses. Radiographers are employed in hospitals and out-patient facilities such as occupational and urgent care centers, clinics, imaging centers, and doctors' offices. MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the Radiography Program is to provide students with a comprehensive education in radiography and to prepare them to enter the radiographic profession as a competent entry-level diagnostic radiographer. The student is to be exposed to all available methods of instruction in both didactic and clinical radiography, including the cognitive (problem solving and critical thinking) psychomotor, and affective domains. Upon graduation from the degree program the student is to be sufficiently prepared to pass the National Registry Examination. 1443 COllEGE OF HEA lTH SCIENCES GRADUATES OF THE PROGRAM Graduates receive an Associate of Science degree and are eligible to take the certification examination of the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists\u00ae (ARRT) to become certified as a Registered Technologist R.T.(R). Every candidate for certification must, according to the ARRT governing documents, \"be a person of good moral character and must not have engaged in conduct that is inconsistent with the ARRT Rules of Ethics,\" and they must \"agree to comply with the ARRT Rules and Regulations and the ARRT Standards of Ethics.\" ARRT investigates all potential violations in order to determine eligibility. Issues addressed by the ARRT Rules of Ethics include convictions, criminal procedures, or military court martials as described below: \u0083Felony \u0083Misdemeanor \u0083Criminal procedure resulting in a plea of guilty or nolo contendere (no contest), a verdict of guilty, withheld or deferred adjudication, suspended or stay of sentence, or pre-trial diversion. Juvenile convictions processed in juvenile court and minor traffic citations not involving drugs or alcohol do not need to be reported. Additionally, candidates for certification are required to disclose any honor code violations that may have occurred while attending school (i.e. probation, suspension, dismissal). If any of these situations apply or if a student is uncertain about a potential probable cause (i.e. drunk driving, possession of alcohol, possession or use of an illegal substance), it is recommended that they contact the ARRT at (651) 687-0048 to discuss their particular case. This process is to prevent the student from having completed the Associate of Science degree program only to be found ineligible to take the ARRT examination. INDIANA CERTIFICATION R E q UIREMENTS TO P RACTICE State certification is required to operate a unit that produces ionizing radiation. The state accepts the ARRT registry for certification. CREDENTIA lS REqUIRED TO PRACTICE R.T(R) Radiologic Technologist. Educational Program lENGTH OF THE PROGRAM The Radiography Program is a 34+ month program.STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM The Radiography Program is a systemwide program offered at several Indiana University campuses. Although the campuses may have comparable admission standards, program outcomes, and courses, each is individually accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology. Additional admission and transfer policies are set by individual units. Course content and sequencing may vary. The general-education courses may be taken on a part- time basis; the clinical/professional program is presented in a full-time, day format, with minimal weekend and evening clinical education. DESIGN OF THE PROFESSIONA l CURRICU lUM The curriculum follows a pattern designed to educate the radiographer to become adept in the performance of any medical diagnostic radiographic procedure. Courses in radiographic principles, radiographic procedures, clinical application of theory, digital imaging, radiation protection, radiobiology, pathology, and general education are included in the curriculum. Students also receive instruction in the theory and practice of other specialty diagnostic imaging modalities. PROGRAM FACI l ITIES Program facilities of the Radiography Program are located on the campus of IU South Bend. Clinical education classes are conducted in the radiology departments of area institutions: Memorial Hospital; St. Joseph Regional Medical Center campuses in Plymouth and Mishawaka; Elkhart General Hospital; and Goshen General Hospital. ACCREDITATION The Radiography Program is accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology. GENERA l POlICIES PROGRAM PlANNING Program advisors are available to assist students in planning for their program and for meeting degree requirements. It is the student's responsibility to acquaint themselves with all the regulations and policies and to remain properly informed throughout their studies. All provisions of this publication are in effect as soon as a student begins the Radiography Program. Preradiography and clinical/professional students, however, are subject to policy and curriculum changes as they occur. Curriculum changes during progress toward the degree may result in the revision of degree requirements.RADIOGRAPHY AND A llIED HEA lTH 4145 CODE OF ETHICS Students preparing to enter the profession of radiography are expected to follow the Code of Ethics for the Radiologic Technologist. Each person, upon entering the profession, inherits a measure of responsibility and trust in the profession and the corresponding obligation to adhere to standards of ethical practice and conduct set by the profession. The code was adopted by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists. It is the clinical/professional student's responsibility to know, understand, and follow the Code of Ethics for the Radiologic Technologist. \u0083The radiologic technologist conducts himself or herself in a professional manner, responds to patient needs, and supports colleagues and associates in providing quality patient care. \u0083The radiologic technologist acts to advance the principle objective of the profession to provide services to humanity with full respect for the dignity of mankind. \u0083The radiologic technologist delivers patient care and service unrestricted by concerns of personal attributes or the nature of the disease or illness, and without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, creed, religion, or socio-economic status. \u0083The radiologic technologist practices technology founded upon theoretical knowledge and concepts, uses equipment and accessories consistent with the purpose for which they were designed, and employs procedures and techniques appropriately. \u0083The radiologic technologist assesses situations; exercises care, discretion, and judgment; assumes responsibility for professional decisions; and acts in the best interest of the patient. \u0083The radiologic technologist acts as an agent through observation and communication to obtain pertinent information for the physician to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient and recognizes that interpretation and diagnosis are outside the scope of practice for the profession. \u0083The radiologic technologist uses equipment and accessories; employs techniques and procedures; performs services in accordance with an accepted standard of practice; and demonstrates expertise in minimizing radiation exposure to the patient, self, and other members of the health care team. \u0083The radiologic technologist respects confidences entrusted in the course of professional practice, respects that patient's right to privacy, and reveals confidential information only as required by law or to protect the welfare of the individual or the community. \u0083The radiologic technologist continually strives to improve knowledge and skills by participating in continuing education and professional activities, sharing knowledge with colleagues, and investigating new aspects of professional practice.ADMISSION GENERA l INFORMATION Students may apply for admission to the Preradiography Program after qualifying for regular admission to Indiana University. Upon acceptance to the program, students enrolled in general-education courses required for the Associate of Science degree are classified as preradiography. If students have a disability and need assistance, special arrangements can be made to accommodate most needs. For the hearing impaired, SPRINT provides services at (800) 743-3333. For more information, contact the program director. Admission to the Clinical/Professional Program is based upon each applicant's admission grade point average (AGPA) of the completed preradiography general-education courses, a personal interview, and a rating point system. A maximum of 21 students are admitted each fall semester. Students must be certified by their academic advisor as eligible to apply for the Clinical/Professional Program and must submit a formal application for admission consideration by February 1 of the year of anticipated entry. ACADEMIC STANDARDS Students enrolled in the Preradiography or Clinical/Professional Program are subject to academic standards as established by IU South Bend. Failure to maintain these standards could lead to academic probation or dismissal from the program. The standards are explained to students during their initial orientation/advising session.

A copy of the Technical Standards Form is sent to each applicant to review and sign, certifying that they can meet those standards. PROGRAM PROFESSIONA l STANDARDS A student entering the IU South Bend radiography Clinical/Professional Program must understand that they are entering a field of medicine that requires certain professional standards that other career choices may not. Professional dress, appearance, and modes of communication must be of certain standards to maintain the confidence and care of the patient. Patients present themselves in all ages, cultures, and of various ethnic origins; therefore, trendy modes of dress and appearance are not allowed. The program has an established dress code and a code of conduct that students must follow throughout their clinical experience. A copy of the IU South Bend Radiography Program Professional Standards is sent to each applicant to review and sign, certifying that they understand the requirements of the program and that they agree to abide by these standards. INTERVIEW An interview is required for admission consideration and is scheduled during the months of April, May, and June if needed. VOlUNTEER EXPERIENCE Although not a requirement, volunteer experience is recommended and is very helpful in making a career choice. ClINICA l/PROFESSIONA l PROGRAM GENERA l INFORMATION Admission to the university as a preradiography student, and successful completion of the general-education course work, does not guarantee admission to the Associate of Science degree program. The number of clinical/professional students admitted each fall is dependent upon the number of openings available in the radiology departments in the area health care institutions designated as clinical education sites (Memorial Hospital of South Bend, St. Joseph Regional Medical Center campuses in Plymouth and Mishawaka, Elkhart General Hospital, and Goshen General Hospital).ADMISSION CRITERIA At the conclusion of the spring semester of program application, students in the applicant pool are scored to determine their rank order. The criteria for admission consideration is based on a 137 point weighted scale as follows: \u00830-75 points: AGPA (Admission Grade Point Average) of the preradiography general-education course work completed by the end of the spring semester of application \u00830-30 points: Interview scores \u00830-32 points: Students can earn rating points (maximum 32) which are added to their overall combined score as follows: \u2014One point given for each credit hour of a required general-education course completed with a C or higher by the end of the spring semester of program application. Points available: 0-27 \u2014Five points given for completion of PHSL-P 261 Human Anatomy and Physiology 1 and PHSL-P 262 Human Anatomy and Physiology 2 with a C or higher by the end of the spring semester of program application. Points available: 5 Students offered a clinical position within the associate degree degree program must formally accept or decline admission, in writing, to the program prior to the beginning of the semester to which they are admitted. Students offered a position in the Clinical/Professional Program but decline acceptance or become academically ineligible can reapply to the program the following year. They must compete with the applicant pool for the semester in which they request entrance with no preference or wait listing given. Students have only two opportunities to decline admission in writing prior to losing their eligibility to apply.

TRANSFER STUDENTS Intercampus Transfer Students wishing to transfer between campuses should check for the process on the campus to which they are transferring. To transfer to the IU South Bend campus, the student must submit an intercampus transfer request through the registrar's office. Intercampus transfer requests are evaluated individually by the program advisor or program director on the basis of the student's academic record in general-education course work and didactic, clinical laboratory, and clinical experience courses (if applicable). Transfer from Non-Indiana University Radiography Program Students in good academic standing at another university who wish to transfer should contact the program advisor or program director. Radiography courses completed at another university or clinical education institution must be evaluated by the program director for transfer equivalents and student placement. Students must supply documentation, including an official transcript or validation of course completion, and copies of the syllabi for each radiography course completed at another university or clinical education institution. These syllabi will be evaluated in comparison to the IU South Bend radiography courses. Students are encouraged to contact the IU South Bend Radiography Program at least three months prior to the semester they wish to begin at IU South Bend.

Grades from developmental courses are not calculated into the grade point average of the prerequisite courses. \u0083A minimum mathematics/science grade point average may also be required to apply for admission into a specific Clinical/Professional Program. This requirement is applied at the time of program application and must be maintained. If a student is unable to meet the required standards for the desired Allied Health Program, they are advised of alternate educational programs available to them on the IU South Bend campus and throughout Indiana University. lABOR STUDIES PROGRAM RIVERSIDE HAll 127 // (574) 520-4595 GENERA l INFORMATION The program in Labor Studies is a unit of the statewide School of Social Work, based at Indiana University\u2014Purdue University Indianapolis. IU South Bend students majoring in Labor Studies receive their degrees from IU South Bend. Labor Studies is an interdisciplinary field that explores issues of work and the work place, social inequality and class structure, and the struggles of workers and their organizations. In this context Labor Studies explores the ways racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia impact on working people, their families, and communities. As a field, it was originally developed to educate union members and leaders, and Labor Studies sees labor organizations, especially trade unions, as basic organizations for the maintenance and expansion of a democratic society. Labor Studies faculty come from academic disciplines such as political science, economics, history, legal studies, sociology, and anthropology, and classes in this program focus on the experience of workers (of all kinds) and their efforts to achieve a greater voice in society. lABOR STUDIES PROGRAM 4153 CERTIFICATE AND DEGREES The Labor Studies Program offers a certificate, minor, Associate of Science in Labor Studies, and Bachelor of Science in Labor Studies. The program has a long history of working with unions in the state of Indiana to develop and deliver educational courses. These courses are coordinated and taught by Labor Studies faculty. They and associate faculty members also teach the courses. Faculty qualifications typically combine academic credentials with union background. MINOR IN lABOR STUDIES A minor in Labor Studies requires the completion of 15 credit hours in Labor Studies courses consisting of 6 credit hours from the list of core courses and 9 additional credit hours to be determined through consultation with the campus faculty. ADDITIONA l REqUIREMENTS For the Associate of Science in Labor Studies, at least 12 credit hours must be earned from Indiana University, 10 credit hours of these after admission to the Labor Studies Program. No more than 15 credit hours may be earned within a single subject other than Labor Studies. For the Bachelor of Science in Labor Studies, at least 24 credit hours must be earned from Indiana University; 20 of these after admission to the Labor Studies Program. No more than 21 credit hours may be earned within a single subject other than Labor Studies.

These groupings are Labor Studies courses, major areas of learning, and electives. The accompanying chart shows the credit hour distribution required for each certificate and degree in Labor Studies.hours must be earned in 300- or 400-level courses, and at least 12 of the 30 credit hours must be earned in Labor Studies courses. For the certificate in Labor Studies and both the associate and bachelor's degrees, an overall 2.0 (C) grade point average must be maintained. Courses in which grades below C- are received may be counted only as electives. For the associate and bachelor's degrees, courses within a major area must be in at least two different subjects. For additional standards, see the section of this publication on Academic Policies. MAJOR AREAS OF lEARNING Following are representative subjects and courses falling under each of the three major areas of learning listed under certificate and degree requirements. For information about subjects not listed here and about specific courses, contact the Office of Labor Studies. Arts and Humanities African American Studies Journalism Classical Studies Music Comparative Literature Philosophy English Religious Studies Fine Arts Speech and Folklore Communications History Theatre and Dance History and Philosophy Women's and Gender of Science Studies All language courses1543 lABOR STUDIES PROGRAM Sciences and Mathematics Astronomy Geology Biology Mathematics Chemistry Physics Computer Science/ Zoology Technology Social and Behavioral Sciences Anthropology Political Science Economics Psychology Geography Sociology Linguistics ElECTIVES Students may select any of the courses offered by IU South Bend to fulfill elective requirements. Students are encouraged to consult with their academic advisor and to concentrate their elective course work in related subjects. APPlICATION AND ADMISSION The certificate and degree programs in the Labor Studies Program are open to all qualified high school graduates or persons with the General Educational Development (GED) certificate. Adults over 21 who do not meet these requirements may be admitted on a provisional basis and may apply for regular admission upon successful completion of 12 credit hours. Applicants must submit the following: \u0083A completed application for admission to the Labor Studies Program \u0083A nonrefundable application fee payable to IU South Bend\u2014if you have not previously been admitted to IU South Bend \u0083A high school transcript \u0083An official transcript of previous college work, mailed by the college All application materials must be forwarded to the Labor Studies Program office on the campus where the applicant intends to enroll. International students should request the international application for admission and related materials from the Labor Studies program on the Indiana University\u2014Purdue University Indianapolis campus. The contact information for the Labor Studies program is: Labor Studies ProgramIU School of Social Work902 West New York StreetIndianapolis, IN 46202-5156 iulabor@iupui.edu 800-822-4743CREDIT TRANSFERS Official transcripts, when received, will be forwarded to the admissions office for evaluation. Within a few weeks, applicants should receive an official notice of admission status and a credit transfer report indicating which courses are accepted at Indiana University. The Office of Labor Studies will then prepare a summary of how these courses apply to the Labor Studies certificate and degree requirements. At this point, if they have not already done so, students should proceed to plan their program in consultation with their advisor and enroll in courses. Check with the Office of Labor Studies for schedules and directions. PROGRESS OPTIONS One or more of the methods listed in this section may provide the Labor Studies participant a means of receiving Indiana University credit without taking conventional classroom-based courses. This allows accelerated progress towards a Labor Studies degree. COllEGE-lEVEl EXAMINATION PROGRAM College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) has available tests in a variety of subject areas. If a student's score exceeds a certain level on an Indiana University accepted test, they receive credit (3 credit hours for most examinations). CLEP brochures are available at the Labor Studies Program office. CREDIT FOR MIlITARY SERVICE Depending on the length and type of training received, a student may receive up to 6 credit hours based on military service. Additional credit hours may be awarded for special training programs in the military. This credit can only be applied as elective credit for Labor Studies degrees. To apply, a DD-214 form and training completion certificates (if applicable) must be presented to the Office of Labor Studies. CREDIT FOR SElF-ACqUIRED COMPETENCIES Labor Studies Program participants may apply up to 15 credit hours of Self-Acquired Competencies (SAC) to the Associate of Science degree and up to 30 credit hours (including any applied to the associate degree) to the Bachelor of Science degree. SAC credit can be awarded for learning gained outside the university and may be based on a wide variety of experiences. Labor Studies students can apply for SAC credit on the basis of learning derived from their union activities. Self-Acquired Competencies refer to learning or competency that can be documented. SAC credit is not granted simply for time served. Thus, it is not granted on the basis of the number of terms served as a union officer. Nor is it multiplied by the number of times the same experience has been repeated. A secretary-treasurer who has performed the same functions for four terms is not likely to receive significantly more credit hours than one who has performed the same functions, and has learned as much, from one or two terms.lABOR STUDIES PROGRAM 4155 SAC credit is of two types: \u0083Course-specific credit hours are granted where the applicant's competency is substantially equivalent to the competency that is expected in an Indiana University course. Credit hours for the specific course is awarded. \u0083General credit hours are granted for competencies that are not the full equivalent of individual courses but are nevertheless the equivalent of college learning. This is the only form of SAC credit hours available outside of the Labor Studies Program. In general, the following procedures and limitations govern the award of credit hours for SAC: \u0083A student must be admitted to the Labor Studies Program and be in good standing before any credit for SAC is awarded. \u0083A maximum of 15 credit hours of SAC credit may be applied to the Associate of Science in Labor Studies and a maximum of 30 credit hours to the Bachelor of Science in Labor Studies. HOW TO APPlY FOR S E l F -A C q UIRED C OMPETENCIES The process of building the SAC portfolio is time consuming. It begins with the development of a resume and the listing of experiences that may have led to college-level competencies. The competencies are then organized and phrased to demonstrate the connection to specific Labor Studies courses or to general areas of knowledge in Labor Studies. Finally, appropriate documentation is added. Each portfolio is evaluated by two members of the Labor Studies Program faculty, who also conduct an interview with the applicant. Supplementary materials and counseling are available from Labor Studies faculty on campuses offering the program. TRANSFER OF SElF-ACqUIRED COMPETENCIES C REDIT WITHIN THE I NDIANA U NIVERSITY S YSTEM Self-Acquired Competencies credit awarded by the faculty of one Indiana University campus is recorded and explained on the student's permanent record. Such credit will be honored on any other Indiana University campus to which the student may transfer in order to complete the associate or bachelor's degree in Labor Studies. The student should be aware that such credit will not necessarily be honored by other degree programs of Indiana University or by other institutions.ACADEMIC POlICIES Institutional academic policies are stated in the front section of this publication. All these policies pertain to students enrolled in Labor Studies; however, the following policies are particularly relevant. ACADEMIC FORGIVENESS POlICY FOR FORMER I NDIANA U NIVERSITY S TUDENTS Students with academic deficiencies (cumulative grade point average below 2.0 or C average) in course work done within the Indiana University system may be admitted to the Labor Studies Program on probation. The student must achieve a 2.0 grade point average for all courses taken at Indiana University before and after admission to the program in order to obtain a degree. Students who have been dismissed from another academic program of Indiana University may not be admitted to the Labor Studies Program until at least one calendar year has passed from the date of dismissal. A student prevented from attaining a cumulative 2.0 grade point average because of poor work in a semester at Indiana University that was completed five or more years before enrollment in the Labor Studies Program may request the removal of the poor semester from the Labor Studies Program records. In general, such a request is granted automatically, particularly in those cases where the student would be prevented from graduating because of the one poor semester. All credit earned during this one semester is also removed from the grade point average by the Labor Studies Program under this forgiveness policy. A similar request may be made for the forgiveness of a poor semester completed at Indiana University within five years prior to admission to the Labor Studies Program. Approval of such requests is usually dependent, however, upon the successful completion of 12 credit hours in the Labor Studies Program. Because all credit earned during the forgiven semester is removed from the grade point average, students are encouraged to consult with their advisor concerning the advisability of this procedure. This policy is designed to avoid placing an excessive burden on students who, in the past, have made a poor start at Indiana University. It is not intended to permit students with chronically poor performance in the university to stay in school, nor to raise false hopes for students who are not making progress toward a degree. ACADEMIC FORGIVENESS POlICY FOR STUDENTS D ISMISSED FROM O THER I NSTITUTIONS Students who have been dismissed from another postsecondary institution may not be admitted to the Labor Studies Program until at least one calendar year has passed since the date of the dismissal. University regulations require that the admissions office indicate any deficiencies in grade point average (average grade below 2.0 on a 4.0 scale) at another institution on the credit transfer report. The policy is to maintain a student's grade point average based only on work done at 1563 lABOR STUDIES PROGRAM Indiana University. These grades must be of average, or C quality (2.0 on 4.0 scale) in order to earn a degree. If a student's cumulative grade point average from another institution is below 2.0, however, the student is admitted on probation. GRADUATION Degrees are awarded every December, May, and August. Participants expecting to graduate must file written notice of intent, citing the degree and expected date of graduation, with the Office of Labor Studies at least three months prior to graduation. GRADUATION WITH HONORS Students completing a minimum of 30 credit hours for the Associate of Science in Labor Studies or 60 credit hours for the Bachelor of Science in Labor Studies at Indiana University will be graduated with honors if they have attained the appropriate grade averages: 3.90, highest distinction; 3.75, high distinction; 3.50, distinction. UNION EDUCATION PROGRAM The Labor Studies Program also offers an extensive noncredit program\u2014the Union Education Program (UEP). UEP open enrollment courses and conferences are available to workers in communities throughout the state. They are offered in local union halls, on the various campuses of Indiana University, and on the campuses of other educational institutions.Classes usually meet weekly for 4-10 weeks. They are open to participants from both large and small unions, craft and industrial unions, and public and private sector unions. Typical topics for these classes are labor law, collective bargaining, steward training, communications, OSHA, and arbitration. Other programs are designed to meet the educational needs of individual unions. Local or international unions may contract with the Labor Studies Program to conduct these programs. Enrollments are limited to members of the contracting union. There are no special entrance requirements, tests, or grades. Participants who complete a class or conference are awarded a Certificate of Achievement from the Labor Studies Program. Upon completion of 150 classroom hours in the UEP, the participant is awarded a Certificate of Recognition. Upon completion of 300 classroom hours in the UEP, the participant will be awarded a Certificate of Recognition and a plaque. There is a nominal charge for UEP classes and conferences. ORGANI zATION AND FACU lTY The Labor Studies faculty are made up of people with both union experience and academic credentials. The faculty uses a variety of teaching methods, including videotape recording, case studies, films, group discussion, and role playing to promote student interest and participation. A Statewide Advisory Committee advises the program on educational courses offered to Indiana union members. Similarly, the LaPorte, Michiana, and Warsaw Area Labor Education Advisory Committees advise the program at IU South Bend. COllEGE OF lIBERA l ARTS AND SCIENCES ElIzABETH E. DUNN, DEAN WIEkAMP HAll 3300 // (574) 520-4214 // WWW VioliCoordinator of Student Services: M. Nurenberg GENERA l INFORMATION The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is the nucleus of IU South Bend. Through studies with the faculties of the humanities, social and behavioral sciences, mathematics, and natural sciences departments, students have the opportunity to broaden their awareness and knowledge of the major areas of human activity. By selecting an area of study in one of the Liberal Arts and Sciences disciplines, students acquire in-depth understanding of a single field of investigation. Through their academic experiences, students also sharpen critical thinking skills, develop an appreciation for the literary arts, learn to communicate more effectively, enhance their self knowledge, and increase their tolerance for differences. Consequently, students graduate prepared for a lifetime of learning and are better able to cope with and enjoy the rapidly changing world in which we live. Faculty in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences advise all students with a declared major in the college, or leaning toward a Liberal Arts and Sciences major. In addition, faculty have accepted the responsibility of advising and welcoming all incoming freshmen students who are still deciding about their major. Regular advising sessions are scheduled during summer orientation and by appointment throughout the year in Wiekamp Hall 3300B. The advising telephone number for students still exploring options regarding a major is (574) 520-4537. 1583 COllEGE OF lIBERA l ARTS AND SCIENCES probation. A probationary student remains on probation until the CGPA reaches 2.0 or higher. If a student who is on probation fails to achieve a semester (fall, spring, or combined summer session) GPA of at least 2.0, he or she will be placed on probation with impact and restricted to half-time enrolment for the following semester. If a student who is on probation with impact fails to achieve a semester (fall, spring, or combined summer session) GPA of at least 2.0, he or she will be dismissed from the university. Students who are dismissed for the first time cannot enroll until one regular (fall or spring) semester has elapsed and must petition the CLAS probation committee by the established deadline to be considered for reinstatement. Students who are dismissed multiple times must remain out of the university for at least two regular semesters and must petition by the established deadline to be considered for reinstatement. ACADEMIC RENEWA l Academic renewal for prior Indiana University course work may be requested by students who did not register for courses at any Indiana University campus for at least three consecutive calendar years after the period for which academic renewal is requested. Contact a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences advisor for more information. CERTIFICATES The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at IU South Bend offers instruction leading to certificates in the following: \u0083Basic Applied Behavior Analysis \u0083Applied Informatics \u0083Computer Applications Programming, and Supervision \u0083International Studies \u0083Professional Writing \u0083Social and Cultural Diversity \u0083Technology for Administration See the departmental sections of this publication for more information.

BACHE lOR'S DEGREES ACADEMIC ADVISING REqUIREMENTS Academic advising by a faculty member from the student's major area(s) is required at least once each year and, in some departments, prior to each semester's enrollment.GENERA l INFORMATION The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) offers programs of study that lead to certificates, the Bachelor of Arts, the Bachelor of Science, or master's degrees. Minors are available in a large number of disciplines as well as several interdisciplinary programs. Courses are offered in a variety of areas in which degrees are not presently offered. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences shelters the General Studies degree program. General Studies degrees are granted by the School of Continuing Studies; local governance is by a committee of the IU South Bend Academic Senate. General Studies information is available in this publication and by calling (574) 520-4260. Along with the programs leading to the bachelor's and master's degrees, the college offers courses that are the general-education component of all IU South Bend undergraduate degrees. THE STUDENT 'S RESPONSIBI lITY All colleges establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These regulations concern such things as curricula and courses; the requirements for majors and minors, and university procedures. Advisors, directors, and deans are available to advise students on how to meet these requirements; each student is individually responsible for fulfilling them. If requirements are not satisfied, the degree is withheld pending adequate fulfillment. For this reason, it is important for each student to be well acquainted with all requirements described in this publication. ACADEMIC REGUlATIONS All students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences should familiarize themselves with the Academic Regulations and Policies in the front section of this publication. A number of specialized regulations apply to the college. Occasional changes in the graduation requirements for liberal arts and sciences majors may lead to uncertainty as to which IU South Bend Bulletin is applicable for a given graduating student. For the general-education requirements and other academic matters, the student may choose either the IU South Bend Bulletin in effect at the time of matriculation to IU South Bend or the IU South Bend Bulletin in effect at the time of graduation. For meeting requirements of the major, the choice is between the IU South Bend Bulletin in effect when the student certifies into the college and the IU South Bend Bulletin in effect when the student graduates. ACADEMIC PROBATION A student who has completed one or more IU South Bend grade point average (GPA) hours and has a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) below 2.0 is placed on COllEGE OF lIBERA l ARTS AND SCIENCES 4159 Academic advising for each student in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is available prior to each semester's enrollment by a faculty member from the student's major area(s) or from an advisor in the college's advising center. Although academic advising is intended to provide effective guidance and every student is required to seek the advice of a faculty advisor, students individually are responsible for planning their own programs and for meeting the degree requirements by the time they expect to graduate. GRADES Students must have a minimum CGPA of 2.0 and complete all requirements in their major and/or minor departments with a C- or higher. (A minimum CGPA of 2.0 is required in the student's major and minor departments.) Any course in which the student receives a grade of F does not count in the credit hours accumulated for graduation. Any course in which a letter grade of D is received does not count in a student's major or minor. CREDIT HOUR REqUIREMENTS A candidate for a bachelor's degree in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences must satisfactorily complete a minimum of 122 credit hours in courses offered by the college or by other academic programs of the university offering bachelor's degree programs. TRANSFER CREDIT HOURS Ordinarily, the maximum number of transfer credit hours that may be counted toward graduation in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is 96, including credit(s) earned at other campuses of Indiana University. Not more than 60 credit hours earned at accredited junior colleges may be applied toward a degree. TESTING OUT OF REqUIREMENTS Students may test out of the general-education requirements Quantitative Reasoning and Computer Literacy by passing appropriate proficiency tests. For testing out of part of world languages, see World Languages Placement Examination information on page 204. UPPER -lEVEl COURSE WORk A minimum of 30 credit hours must be completed in 300- or 400-level (junior-senior) courses. To satisfy campus general-education requirements, students must pass at least one 300-level core course (i.e., A 399, B 399, N 390, or T 390). RESIDENCY REqUIREMENT At least 26 credit hours of the work taken as a senior and at least 10 credit hours above the first-level courses in the major subject (not necessarily during the senior year) normally must be completed while in residence at IU South Bend. The 10 credit hours in the major subject must be taken in courses approved by the major department.CORRESPONDENCE AND SPECIA l CREDIT By special permission of the dean, a maximum of 12 credit hours may be earned toward a degree through correspondence study or by special credit examination. Ordinarily students in residence in the college are permitted to enroll concurrently in courses offered through the Indiana University School of Continuing Studies Independent Study Program (correspondence courses). Any correspondence courses in the student's major must also have the approval of the departmental chairperson. (SPCH-S 121 Public Speaking may not be taken by correspondence.) TIME lIMIT FOR COMPlETION OF REqUIREMENTS A student is expected to complete the work for a degree within 10 years. Failure to do so may require passing of comprehensive examinations on the subjects in the area(s) of concentration and fulfilling the general requirements in the current IU South Bend Bulletin. GRADUATION DEADlINES An application for a degree or certificate must be filed in the office of the coordinator of student services, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, not later than October 1 for May and August graduations, or March 1 for December graduation. All credit hours of candidates for degrees, except those of the current semester, must be on record at least six weeks prior to the conferring of degrees. Credit hours by correspondence must be on record at least three weeks prior to the conferring of degrees. BACHE lOR OF ARTS The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) at IU South Bend offers instruction leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree in the following majors: Anthropology Philosophy Biological Sciences Physics Chemistry Political Science English Psychology French Sociology German Spanish History Women's and Gender Studies Mathematics The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences curriculum for the Bachelor of Arts degree is designed to give students a broad acquaintance with the various ways scholars study and interpret the world in which we live. It is also intended to enable students to understand, and to communicate their understanding of, the richly varied and changing contexts of our lives. Within this general-educational framework students choose one or more areas for in-depth study.1603 COllEGE OF lIBERA l ARTS AND SCIENCES Every student at IU South Bend must complete campuswide general-education requirements. Students within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences must also complete requirements for bachelor's degrees, and the following concentration requirements. Students are strongly encouraged to meet with their academic advisors every semester to help them select the optimal course of study. In many cases, courses can be selected that satisfy both the college and the campuswide general-education requirements. A bachelor's degree in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at IU South Bend comprises three parts: Part One Campus and colle ge requirements (I, II and III) together encourage breadth of general knowledge and skills. Part Two A minor encourages depth of knowledge in an area outside the major, perhaps even outside the college Part Three A major encourages deep and coherent knowledge and skills development in a particular field of study within the college. Part One and Part Two together make up the college's liberal education requirements, summarized below.

Bachelor of Arts students must also satisfy the following College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requirements: Junior/Senior- level Writing (3 cr.) Writing clear English is one of the defining characteristics of a liberal arts graduate. All Bachelor of Arts students are required to complete a junior/senior-level writing course with a grade of C or higher. This course must be taken after completing at least 56 credit hours. Visit the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences web page at www. iusb.edu/~lasi for courses satisfying this requirement. World languages (3-12 cr.) The study of languages other than English is essential to understanding and appreciating the global community. In recognition of this fact, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requires that its Bachelor of Arts majors attain an intermediate-level proficiency in a second language. This requirement can be met in one of three ways: \u0083Successful completion of a fourth-semester language class, designated as 204 in the IU South Bend Bulletin. The 204 course is the last class in a four-semester sequence (101, 102, 203, and 204). \u0083Successful completion of a 300- or 400-level course in which the primary instruction is in a language other than English. \u0083Formal training, as evidenced by secondary or university diplomas, in a language other than English. World languages Placement Examination The Department of World Language Studies (W.L.S.) offers a placement examination to: \u0083Determine in which semester a student should enroll \u0083Qualify students for credit by examination Students may earn up to 6 credit hours for testing out of any two of these language classes (101, 102, 203, or 204). For more details, see the world language studies web page. Western Culture before 1800 (3 cr.) College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Bachelor of Arts students should attain an awareness of the historical, literary, artistic, or philosophical achievements that contributed to the construction of the idea of the West, its culture, and institutions. Bachelor of Arts majors must take one course in which the primary subject matter treats aspects of the ancient, medieval, and/or early modern world and gives the student a sense of the historical and geographical origins of modern societies. This requirement can be met by taking any course or section designated as approved for Western Culture before 1800. See the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences web page for details.Science Course and laboratory (5 cr.) Natural science laboratory (2 cr.) Additional natural science course (Select from anatomy, astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, microbiology, physiology, physics, or plant sciences) These requirements can also be satisfied by a single 5 credit hour integrated lecture/laboratory course. To prepare students for a world profoundly influenced by rapid changes in science and technology, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requires that Bachelor of Arts students take 5 credit hours in the natural sciences, in addition to N 190 The Natural World. To understand science, students must learn the experimental method. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requires that Bachelor of Arts students take a science course with a formal laboratory component. This may be a laboratory course linked to a lecture course or it may be an integrated lecture/laboratory course, in either case totaling 5 credit hours. PART T WO T HE R E q UIRED M INOR (15-18 CR .) May be taken in any IU South Bend school, college, division or interdisciplinary program. See program information for requirements. While the campuswide general-education requirements expose students to a broad array of topics and methods, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Bachelor of Arts students should also explore at least one area outside their major in some depth. Bachelor of Arts students must complete a minor offered by any IU South Bend school, college, division, or approved interdisciplinary program. Bachelor of Arts students must also complete a minor in an area outside their major. For the minor requirements of specific departments and interdisciplinary programs, consult those sections of this publication. Students must declare their minor in a timely manner by meeting with an advisor for the department or program offering the minor early in their career at IU South Bend. Students are encouraged to consult with an advisor for the minor regularly. Any student who completes a double major within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences or a second major from outside the college is deemed to have met this requirement. 1623 COllEGE OF lIBERA l ARTS AND SCIENCES Departmental Minors Students must earn a minor in conjunction with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Some Bachelor of Science degrees also require minors. See departmental pages. All minors consist of at least 15 credit hours, with a grade of C- or higher, in one department or in an approved interdepartmental program (a minimum of two courses, totaling at least 6 credit hours, must be taken while in residence at IU South Bend). A GPA of 2.0 is required in the student's minor department(s). World language majors may minor in second languages; others must choose minors outside of their major departments. Each minor program must be approved by an advisor in the department or interdepartmental committee offering the minor and must be filed with the coordinator of student services. For the minor requirements of specific departments and interdepartmental programs, consult those sections of this publication. See list of minors on pages 8-9 of this publication.

Concentration Requirement Many concentrations require careful planning starting with the freshman year. Students are advised to consult early in their college career with the departmental advisor for any department in which they may wish to concentrate.Single Major Area of Concentration The following are minimum requirements for the concentration requirement. Additional and/or detailed requirements are to be found in the departmental statements in this publication. The specific departmental requirements that must be fulfilled are those published in the IU South Bend Bulletin that is current at the time the student certifies into the college (but not longer than 10 years), or those in the IU South Bend Bulletin current at the time of graduation. The following rules pertain to the concentration group: \u0083At least 25 credit hours must be taken in the major subject area. This is a minimum. See specific departmental requirements. \u0083Any course in which the student receives a letter grade below C- may not be used to fulfill the concentration area requirement. However, courses in which the student receives a D or higher count toward the 122 credit hour total that is required for graduation. \u0083A GPA of 2.0 is required in the student's major department(s). Double Major A student may major in more than one discipline. A double major requires that the major requirements in both departments be fully met, as well as general-education and other general requirements of the college. The student should consult regularly with advisors from both departments if this option is chosen. REqUIREMENTS FOR A S ECOND B ACHE l OR ' S D EGREE Normally the holder of a bachelor's degree who wishes to pursue a further educational goal is encouraged to become qualified for admission to a graduate degree program.

The high academic standards of the program are established in recognition of the fact that good writing is difficult to produce. The program requires students to advance beyond mere competence and strives to enable them to perform well in professional settings, where the ability to plan and execute work independently is sometimes crucial. TOTAl HOURS REqUIRED Completion of the certificate program requires 18 credit hours of course work from the following list of approved courses.

Approval of an internship or practicum is based on the strength of the proposal and the value of the proposed work experience. APPROVA l OF SUBSTITUTE COURSES Certificate students may petition (only once, and in advance) to have an unlisted second-level writing course from another department applied to their certificate. ACADEMIC STANDARDS A candidate for the certificate must earn a grade of B or higher in any course for which he or she seeks credit within the certificate program. MEANS OF ENROllMENT IN THE PROGRAM At the time of enrollment in the certificate program, each candidate for the certificate must submit to the Writing Certificate Committee or the chair of the English department a brief formal declaration of intention, including a statement of professional goals and an explanation of how the certificate program aids in the achievement of those goals. ENROllMENT ElIGIBIlITY For Undergraduate Students A grade of B or higher in ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition 1 or in any IU South Bend course approved for the certificate is the prerequisite for enrolling in the program. Because the Certificate in Professional Writing is a directed program and not merely a collection of writing courses, candidates for the program must officially enroll and be assigned an advisor prior to receiving credit for any course beyond the first 6 credit hours that are eligible to be counted toward completion of the certificate. A student may initiate an appeal of this rule by submitting a portfolio of writing from the previous courses he or she wishes to have counted toward the certificate, along with a cover letter in which the student makes a persuasive case for the coherence of his or her previous course work in the context of specific career or educational goals. For Returning IU South Bend Graduates Returning IU South Bend graduates seeking to enroll in the certificate program must submit to the Writing Certificate Committee a brief formal declaration of intention, including a statement of professional goals and an explanation of how the certificate program aids in the achievement of those goals, no later than the end of the second week of classes in the semester or session in which the student is taking his or her first class in the program. Returning IU South Bend graduates may petition to have up to 6 credit hours of prior eligible course work at IU South Bend (for which they received a grade of B or higher) counted toward the certificate if the course work in question was completed no more than two (calendar) years prior to the date of enrollment in the certificate program. Enrollment may be granted to such students when the declaration of intention is accompanied by a successful petition. Any returning IU South Bend graduate may count 3 credit hours of prior eligible course work at IU South Bend (at a grade of B or higher) toward completion of the certificate, but enrollment is considered probationary until the student has successfully completed 6 credit hours within the program. For Other Graduate Students Students who have at least a bachelor's degree from another accredited university may enroll in the certificate program on a probationary basis. To qualify for probationary enrollment, the candidate must submit to the Writing Certificate Committee a brief formal declaration of intention, including a statement of professional goals and an explanation of how the certificate program aids in the achievement of those goals. Enrollment is considered probationary until the student has successfully completed 6 credit hours within the program.1803 COllEGE OF lIBERA l ARTS AND SCIENCES Note: MATH-M 14 Basic Algebra is a prerequisite for all certificate programs in liberal arts and sciences at IU South Bend. TRANSFER CREDIT HOURS Students may, with committee approval, transfer one course of no more than 4 credit hours from another university. They must supply the committee with copies of the course syllabus and their papers written for the course. Such course credit may not serve as the prerequisite for enrollment in the program. ENGlISH PlACEMENT Students entering IU South Bend with a verbal SAT score of 590 or above place automatically into ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition 1. Some students, on the basis of their high school record or performance on the reading placement examination, may place into ENG-W 31 Pre-Composition. All other students place automatically into ENG-W 130 Principles of Composition. All students, however, may challenge their placement by taking the English placement examination. During the examination period, they have one hour to compose an essay on one of two topics provided. Their score on the examination determines which first-year writing class the student is placed into. As of February 2010, a score of 10 places them in ENG-W 31 Pre-Composition, a score of 20 places them in an enhanced, 4 credit hour version of ENG-W 130 Principles of Composition, a score of 30 places them in ENG-W 130 Principles of Composition, and a score of 4 places them in ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition 1. ENGlISH AS A SECOND lANGUAGE Wiekamp Hall 3159 (574) 520-4559www.iusb.edu/~sbeng/esl Director: Magnan-Park Students whose native language is not English may be placed into the English as a Second Language (ESL) Program for additional support. Students whose native language is not English are required to take placement examinations prior to registration. The ESL placement examinations include an oral and a written examination and determine whether special English instruction will be required as part of the regular student course load. Students must take any supplemental English language courses prescribed from the results of this examination. Fees for supplemental English courses are the same as for other courses, but no credits are earned towards meeting degree requirements. If students are required to take English course(s), they must begin them during their first semester of study, and complete any remaining course(s) during consecutive subsequent semester(s). No interruption in the sequence of prescribed ESL courses will be permitted; students must enroll in the prescribed ELS courses every semester until they are done with the sequence. Exceptions will be made in the summer, if classes are not offered at that time. The ESL Program offers the following composition courses for nonnative speakers: ENG-G 13 Academic Writing Graduate Students (International Students) ENG-W 31 Pre-Composition/ESL (4 cr.) ENG-W 130 Principles o The ESL ENG-W 31 Pre-Composition/ESL and ESL ENG-W 130 Principles of Composition/ESL courses (above) offer instruction to students who need to develop the composition skills necessary for ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition 1, required for all IU South Bend degrees. Finally, a research-oriented graduate-level ESL composition course, similar to the undergraduate ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition 1 course, is available as ENG-G 13 Academic Writing for Graduate Students in the general course list (ENG).

VT: = Variable title1843 COllEGE OF lIBERA l ARTS AND l amon, Marti, Scherer, Schreiber, Tull The study of history encompasses all recorded expressions of human activity from the earliest times to the present. In history classes, students analyze historical data, search for patterns and relationships, and discover the meaning of the past and its relationship to the modern world. History is the foundation of a liberal arts education in that it introduces students to their own culture and to world cultures. Ultimately, studying history encourages students to gain an understanding of themselves and their world while becoming informed and engaged citizens. The Department of History faculty members are committed to teaching, research, and community outreach. The Department of History has a close partnership with the Civil Rights Heritage Center, which uses local and national history to promote social change through individual responsibility. BACHE lOR OF ARTS IN HISTORY (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.) Students earning the Bachelor of Arts in history degree must complete the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requirements and fulfill the following concentration requirements: History majors must earn at least 30 credit hours in history courses. These should include 6 credit hours at the 100-level; but all other history courses must be at the 200-level or above, including 6 credit hours of American history, 6 credit hours of European history, 6 credit hours in other areas such as Latin American or Asian history. As soon as possible after declaring a major in history, students should enroll in HIST-H 217 The Nature of History. Because HIST-J 495 Proseminar for History Majors is the capstone of the major program, no history major is allowed to take it without demonstrating thorough preparation. That is done by submitting a portfolio of written work to the department chairperson at least 60 days before the seminar begins. A portfolio is a collection of written materials that documents a student's individual progress through the history major. It encourages students to reflect critically on their course work and experiences as history majors as they get ready to take HIST-J 495 Proseminar for History Majors. Contents of the portfolio: \u0083Formal job resume \u0083Five essays (students should include the original copies with the course instructor's comments and grade) \u0083Two research papers that include systematic documentation \u0083Three essay examinations \u0083 Self-analysis essay (What do the materials included in my portfolio say about my learning experience as a history major?) No more than three items in any portfolio may come from any one course. WORlD lANGUAGES Students are encouraged to continue their world languages study beyond the two years required by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Graduate schools generally require mastery of one world language for the INFORMATICS 4 185 study of American history and of two or more world languages for study of other fields of history. Students with appropriate language competence are encouraged to participate in the university's various programs of international study. MINOR IN HISTORY A minor in history consists of a 15 credit hour program to be arranged in consultation with a departmental advisor, and filed with the departmental office. The program for a minor must be arranged at least one semester before graduation. At least 9 of these credit hours must be at the 200-level or above. History minors must take five courses in at least two geographic areas. HIST-H 217 The Nature of History is strongly recommended for all history minors. A minimum of two courses (6 credit hours) must be taken while in attendance at IU South Informatics is the study of the science and application of information technology to various disciplines. This cross-disciplinary program is distinct from computer science and information systems. Those programs cover the theory of a particular discipline in depth. Informatics covers a breadth of issues in various disciplines including the social and ethical issues facing our information society. Any student who wishes to major or minor in Informatics should contact the director of informatics as soon as possible to arrange for academic advising.

INTERNATIONA l STUDIES (574) 520-4402www.iusb.edu/~sbintl Director: Sernau The Office of International Programs promotes international education at IU South Bend and strives to foster international understanding and awareness on campus and within the community. 1883 COllEGE OF lIBERA l ARTS AND SCIENCES CERTIFICATE IN INTERNATIONA l STUDIES The Certificate in International Studies allows students from all disciplines to add international breadth to their program. In an increasingly interdependent world, it is vital to develop expertise in this area. Evidence of focused international study is looked upon as a key distinction by employers in business, government, education, the arts, human services, and other areas, as well as by graduate and professional schools. The certificate consists of a minimum of 15 credit hours of courses designated as having an international focus, and two semesters of a world language. Although not required, a study abroad experience is recommended. All study abroad counts toward the certificate, and if it involves another language, it also counts toward the language requirement. The 21 hours must be distributed as follows: \u0083 6 credit hours in a world language \u0083 15 credit hours must include no more than one 100-level and at least one 400-level course (world language courses do not count toward the remaining 15 credit hours) The 21 credit hours must include courses from three academic units in a program that focuses either on a topic or a geographic area. The courses can also satisfy other liberal arts and sciences requirements. If you wish to earn a Certificate of International Studies, contact the director of international programs. INTERNATIONA l STUDIES MINOR International studies is the cross-national interdisciplinary study of contemporary global issues and world regions. It combines the social sciences, humanities, and professional fields to create an interdisciplinary approach to understanding our increasingly interconnected world. The minor consists of a minimum of 15 credit hours in at least three different disciplines including a mandatory capstone course, and at leastLevel 2 competency in a world language.

Actuaries may work for insurance companies, employee benefits, consulting firms, or the benefits department of general business and government agencies. The competitive actuarial profession requires mathematics graduates to have analytical, statistical, and computational skills, which allow them to solve industrial problems, predict the financial effects of uncertain future events, and carry out decision-making analyses. Students graduating from the program who plan to pursue careers in actuarial science can expect to succeed on the first one or two actuarial science examinations, and thus be ready to enter the actuarial profession. Students graduating from the program who choose not to become actuaries are well prepared to enter industry and work in such areas as quality control, computational analysis, information management, forecasting, risk analysis, simulation, and finance. A student wishing to pursue graduate study in mathematics or business is certainly prepared for either discipline.

Students in the program take advanced courses in both applied mathematics and computer science, with emphasis on real-world problems and applications. A complete description of this program begins on page 259 in this publication. PHIlOSOPHY Wiekamp Hall 3248 (574) 520-4491www.iusb.edu/~sbphil Associate Professors: Shrader Faculty Emeriti: Naylor, Robbins, Washburn Philosophy emphasizes clear, critical, and logical thinking about philosophical problems by locating these problems in everyday experience and in the writings of the great philosophers. Philosophy also stresses reflection on established beliefs and values so that we can achieve a better understanding of ourselves and the world in which we live. The curriculum in philosophy is designed to contribute to the intellectual training of all undergraduates and to acquaint students with some of the most important developments in intellectual history. The curriculum is structured to meet the needs not only of those who want to become professional philosophers, but also of those who want to pursue philosophy as a personal interest or as a concentration area to complement study in another field. The department offers courses both in philosophy and in the history and philosophy of science. It is one of several IU South Bend departments that offers courses in religious studies and in cognitive science. Students who wish to focus their study on philosophy and a related area (e.g., art, religion, women's studies, a social or behavioral science, mathematics, a physical or biological science, or law) are invited to talk with any member of the department about the possible benefits of such options as a double major or a minor in philosophy, religious studies, cognitive science, or women's studies.BACHE lOR OF ARTS IN PHIlOSOPHY (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.) The Bachelor of Arts in philosophy requires at least 27 credit hours in courses offered by the department. One of these courses may be a 100-level course.

POlITICA l SCIENCE Wiekamp Popescu, Faculty Emeriti: Bonn, Hamburg, Herr, l ewis, Penikis Courses offered by the department introduce students to the study of government and politics, including an understanding of public affairs, different political systems, and political ideas. This program intends to educate citizens who can think critically about politics and its place in their lives and in society; to provide a general liberal arts education for students continuing on to a wide variety of careers, including public service; and to help prepare those students who choose to continue on to graduate school or law school. Through their course work, students also come to understand some of the ways in which political scientists study politics; and learn to express themselves cogently in writing and orally. The department seeks to achieve these goals through its instructional program: a master's degree, three graduate certificates, a major, a minor, and the political science courses taken by students majoring in other disciplines as part of the general education requirement.

SOCIOlOGY AND ANTHROPO lOGY Wiekamp (Chairperson) Assistant James, Randall, VanderVeen, Wells Faculty Emeriti: Brandewie, Fritschner The Department of Sociology and Anthropology at IU South Bend is dedicated to fostering a critical understanding of the social and cultural diversity and dynamics of the human condition through education and discovery. The faculty is committed to excellence in teaching and concern for the welfare of students, scholarly and professional creativity, and campus and community service. Within the context of a liberal arts education, the department cultivates in its students a sociological imagination intended to prepare them to be active contributors to their communities and to live fruitful lives as informed citizens of a global society. Through their education and training in theoretical analysis and the development of research skills, students gain a solid practical basis for pursuing careers in law, social work, business, public administration, and many human services professions. They are also well equipped to pursue graduate study in sociology or anthropology in preparation for careers in teaching, administration, and research. Current information on the department and degrees offered can be found on the departmental website. BACHE lOR OF ARTS IN SOCIOlOGY The sociology major is intended to introduce students to the intellectual and methodological perspectives and practices characteristic of the discipline, within the context of a liberal arts education.

The Sustainability Studies Program is carefully designed to help students understand and respond to these complicated issues and to lead the way in the creation of a sustainable future, while preparing them for the new jobs of the emerging green economy. Sustainability is generally characterized as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It requires the integration of natural scientific understanding of the threat of environmental degradation with social and behavioral scientific understanding of the social, economic, cultural and political factors driving the human contributions to the problem, as well as to its solution. It also draws upon the historical perspective, ethical sensibilities, and creative imagination of the arts and humanities to help understand what led us to this point, and to map out alternative futures. The Sustainability Studies Program provides an interdisciplinary framework within which students can study the foundations of sustainability and learn how to apply this knowledge to the development and implementation of sustainable values, innovations, practices, and technologies, in our homes, in business, on campus, and in our communities. It emphasizes connections between environment, economy, and society; and builds a community of faculty and students committed to tackling the complex socio-environmental problems confronting our communities and the world. In addition to the traditional classroom, sustainability studies bridges the gap between campus and community through civic engagement and experiential, project-based, and service learning. MINOR IN SUSTAINABI lITY STUDIES (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.) REqUIREMENTS (15 CR.) Fifteen credit hours, at least 9 of which must be taken at the 200-level or above. In some cases, special topics courses, internships, independent studies, or other courses not listed below may qualify to count toward the minor based on the approval of the director of the minor in sustainability studies. Students interested in completing the minor should consult the director prior to completing three courses in the program. Core Course SUST S-201 Foundations of Sustainability Electives (9 cr.)

The interdisciplinary perspective of the field expands our intellectual vision and our capacity to resolve problems. The Women's and Gender Studies Program is committed to an expanding recognition of the impact and strength of difference and diversity in people's lives. The Women's and Gender Studies major, minor, and four-year degree programs enable students to analyze how gender, in its dynamic interrelationship with race and class, has shaped and given meaning to people's lives. The Women's and Gender Studies Program is administered by the director and the Women's Studies Governing Board. The following faculty serve on the Women's Studies Governing Board: Bennion, Borshuk, Colanese, L. Collins, Davis, Gerken, S. Joyce, Lucal, McGuire, Roth, Rusnock, Sage, L. Walker, and Zwicker. Current information on the department and degrees offered can be found on the departmental website.

The department is committed to preparing students for the complex, multicultural, and transnational environment of life and work. Students are encouraged to consider taking a minor in a foreign language as a complement to their major in another discipline, remembering that a minor is now a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requirement. Students may pursue, in addition to WLS, the Certificate in International Studies, or a minor in an interdisciplinary program at IU South Bend, such as Latin American/Latino Studies, European Studies, or Film Studies. Contact an advisor in the department for further information. lANGUAGE REqUIREMENT The study of languages other than English is essential to understand and appreciate our global community. In recognition of this fact, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requires that its Bachelor of Arts majors attain an intermediate-level proficiency in a second languageThis requirement can be met in one of three ways: \u0083Successful completion of a fourth-semester language course designated in the IU South Bend Schedule of Classes as 204. (204 is the last class in a four-semester sequence: 101, 102, 203, and 204) \u0083Successful completion of a 300- or 400-level course in which the primary instruction is in a language other than English. \u0083Formal training, as evidenced by a secondary or university diploma, in a language other than English. Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree should consult with their major department to determine the language requirement. Students from other academic programs on campus may take world language courses as electives and may earn world language credits by placement examination or advanced course placement as described below. PlACEMENT Students with no prior foreign language experience should enroll in 101; students with one to two years of foreign language study in high school should enroll in 102; students with three or more years of foreign language study should enroll in 203 and consider taking the placement examination. Students with three or more years of foreign language study also may qualify to register for upper-level courses in the department. To determine placement in department courses, students take a department placement examination. CREDITS BY EXAMINATION FOR PRIOR lANGUAGE S TUDY The Department of World Language Studies offers a placement examination in French, German, Japanese, and Spanish to: \u0083Determine in which semester a student should enroll \u0083Qualify for special credit by examination Students may earn up to 6 credit hours for testing out of any two of these language classes: 101, 102, 203, or 204. If a student tests into and completes a 300- or 400-level course with a grade of B or higher, he or she is eligible to receive 6 additional credit hours for 203 and 204 which appear as 298 on the transcript. Placement examinations are offered frequently; contact the department for exact times and dates. In addition to credit earned by placement examinations, students may arrange for credit by examination in other department courses at the 300- or 400-level by contacting the department chairperson. Students should consult with their major advisor to determine the limit on the number of credit hours that may be earned by such examinations. More detailed information on credit by examination is available from the department.WORlD lANGUAGE STUDIES 4 207 TRANSFER STUDENTS Students transferring to IU South Bend from other institutions should consult the placement policies above and the department chairperson for advising. INTERNATIONA l STUDENTS International students may be exempt from the liberal arts and sciences world languages requirement by demonstrating formal proficiency, as evidenced by a secondary or university diploma, in their native language. They may earn credit by examination if the language is offered for instruction at IU South Bend. International students majoring in their native language are required to take a minimum of 18 credit hours in world languages, of which at least 9 must be at the 400-level (6 credit hours in literature courses).

The department has dual-degree arrangements with engineering departments at other institutions, under which students can earn both a Bachelor of Science in Physics from IU South Bend and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering from the partnering institution, following at least three years of study at IU South Bend and two years of study at the partnering institution. More information about these 3/2 dual-degree arrangements can be found in the Physics and Astronomy section of the listing of undergraduate programs in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Students interested in transferring to an engineering degree program without pursuing a physics degree from IU South Bend should consult the admissions office at the institution to which they hope to transfer. While specific requirements for transfer admission vary by institution, the courses listed below are required in most engineering degree programs. Specifically, they are required of students transferring into one of the professional engineering schools at the West Lafayette campus of Purdue University.

Following diverse paths to prepare themselves for law school, successful students come from all walks of life with diverse experiences and different courses of study. Students attend law school for three to four years and, when they complete their studies, most earn a juris doctor (J.D.) degree and then take a written bar examination in the state(s) or regions(s) in which they wish to practice law. Some common undergraduate degrees of students currently in law schools are political science, history, English, philosophy, psychology, criminal justice, and business. Many IU South Bend students also take a certificate or minor in paralegal studies, which further prepares them for law school admission and the legal profession. These, and many other majors and minors, help develop students' analytical and communication skills, including critical thinking, reasoning, writing and oral communication\u2014all important skills for success in law school. To be admitted to law school, students must have a strong undergraduate cumulative grade point average and an acceptable score on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). The very best schools will only accept the top students. Indiana University has two law schools: Indiana University School of Law-Bloomington and Indiana University School of Law-Indianapolis; each has its own admissions requirements.

All students interested in pursuing graduate education must fulfill the following initial requirements: \u0083Earn a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university \u0083Earn a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) as required by the individual graduate programs, listed in the program descriptions \u0083Complete all program prerequisites and appropriate undergraduate course work \u0083Submit all required documentation for full consideration of admission Students who intend to enroll in graduate course work as part of a degree program at IU South Bend must have their admission approved in advance by the specific graduate program director. Students who register for graduate credit without such approval do so without assurance that course credit will be applied to meet requirements for advanced degrees. Applications and program information can be obtained from the individual graduate program offices listed on page 211 of this publication. Students who possess a bachelor's degree and wish to pursue academic course work as a nondegree graduate student may obtain the nondegree graduate application from the Office of Admissions.

Nondegree Seeking Applicants \u0083Nondegree status application \u0083Application fee, where applicable \u0083Evidence of an earned bachelor's degree from an accredited college or universityADMISSION ClASSIFICATIONS Formal Admission Formal admission indicates that the student has received full admission to a graduate program. This also verifies that all program prerequisites, entrance examinations, and application processes have been reviewed and completed. Note: Formal admission is required for student loan approval and disbursement. Provisional/Conditional Students have met basic requirements for entrance to a graduate program, but have additional requirements to meet. Each graduate program has specific and varied requirements for admission. All requirements for the specific program must be met prior to formal admission. Provisional/conditional students are allowed to take certain and specific courses at the discretion of the university, deans, and graduate program directors. Students may be limited to the number of credit hours accumulated prior to matriculation. Program director approval is necessary for courses taken and their applicability to specific graduate programs. Student loans are not available to students in a provisional/conditional status. Guest/Nondegree Students enrolled in other graduate programs within the Indiana University system or at another university may seek permission to register for course work as a part of their specific graduate program. These students must obtain approval to take the desired course work from the graduate program director and from their home university advisor. Denied Those applicants who do not meet minimum and/or specific requirements for graduate program acceptance and are not eligible for provisional status are denied admission. The graduate program that denied admission provides the applicant with reason(s) for denial and the reapplication process, where appropriate. Nondegree Students with a completed undergraduate degree may take undergraduate course work and some graduate course work without seeking a graduate degree. Nondegree students must also meet all course prerequisites prior to registering for any course work. Nondegree students wishing to register for graduate course work must obtain approval from the specific graduate program director. Registration for graduate course work is at the discretion of the university, deans, and graduate program directors. Students seek the nondegree status for a variety of reasons. The following list addresses the majority of nondegree classifications:GRADUATE PROGRAMS 4 215 Prerequisites Graduate programs often have prerequisites and require course work that students must complete prior to being formally admitted as a graduate student. These prerequisites vary greatly with each graduate program and, in many cases, are at the undergraduate level and cannot be counted towards the graduate degree. Graduate students should make an appointment to meet with a program advisor regarding prerequisites. Teaching/ licensing Requirements Licensed teachers are required to meet educational goals through course work at regular intervals to maintain and/or renew teacher licensing. The School of Education certification officer provides advising for these students. Professional and Personal Development Many professions require continuing education for maintaining licensure and credentialling or to remain current within educational and professional disciplines. Individuals wishing to enroll in course work must meet necessary prerequisites, obtain permission from the graduate program director prior to enrolling, and provide sufficient documentation of academic competence. GRADUATE STUDY SCHOlARSHIPS AND FINANCIA l AID Financial aid programs at IU South Bend that support graduate education are the Stafford Loan (subsidized and unsubsidized), the Federal Perkins Loan, and the Federal Work-Study Program. The Federal Work-Study Program is available to graduate students after all undergraduate students applying by the priority date have received their awards. Graduate students are encouraged to seek tuition funding sources through philanthropic organizations, the student's place of employment (if available), and other service and foundation organizations. THE GRADGRANTS CENTER (812) 855-5281 gradgrnt@indiana.eduwww.indiana.edu/~gradgrnt The GradGrants Center (GGC) in Bloomington is a free service that provides Indiana University graduate students with one-on-one assistance with grant proposal writing (by appointment) and a centralized area to access funding information. The GradGrants Center is located in the Wells Library 1052E, Bloomington, Indiana. GGC services are free to IU graduate students on all campuses. Services include: \u0083 Access to several online funding information databases as well as campus-specific funding resources \u0083Free grant workshops \u0083The Grad GrantLine newsletter \u0083Student academic appointment vacancies listings \u0083Guidance for finding additional funding Call the GradGrants Center to schedule an appointment for personalized assistance. ACADEMIC REGUlATIONS AND POlICIES ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Students are expected to adhere to the highest ethical standards in all their course work and research. Individuals violating that code of conduct are subject to disciplinary action; such breaches could lead to expulsion of the student from Indiana University or to rescission of a degree already granted. The Indiana University Graduate School has prepared a document entitled Integrity in Graduate Study, which, among other topics, deals with plagiarism, fraud, and conflicts of interest. ACADEMIC STANDING The university has established levels of competency, according to grade point average and semesters completed, which determine whether a graduate student is in good standing, on probation, or ineligible to continue studies. Good Standing Those students who consistently maintain a minimum GPA on their cumulative and semester records as defined by the graduate program in which the student is formally admitted. Probation Students are on probation for the duration of the next regular semester or summer session following one in which the minimum GPA was not obtained and/or maintained. Dismissal Students may be dismissed from graduate programs if they do not maintain satisfactory academic standing as defined by the student's program of study. ADDITION OF COURSES A graduate student who wishes to enroll in additional course work after the first two weeks of a regular semester, or after the first week of a summer session, may do so if the instructor of the course, the graduate advisor, and the graduate program director recommend to the dean that this be done. Note: Special fees are assessed for most late registrations. CREDIT TRANSFER Graduate Course Transfer and Academic Residency Each graduate degree offered through IU South Bend outlines specific requirements and course work for successful completion of a graduate degree. Some course work obtained at other accredited institutions may 2163 GRADUATE PROGRAMS transfer to a particular degree program. Any transfer of course work must be reviewed and approved by the degree program. Each of the graduate programs has guidelines regarding the number of credit hours that can be taken at other universities and counted towards a graduate degree. The graduate program directors determine the number and content of courses and credit (taken outside of the established program of study) which may be counted towards a particular graduate degree. The graduate program director makes any and all determinations of course work transferred and accepted based on their academic discipline and program requirements. Any course work taken outside of the graduate program in which you are formally admitted must receive advisor approval. GRADE POINT AVERAGE A minimum grade point average (GPA) must be maintained to remain in good academic standing in the master's degree program. There are differences among the master's programs. At no time may an earned grade of D or F be counted towards a master's degree. The individual master's programs have minimum standards with some using a grade of B (3.0) as a minimum standard. Review the graduate program GPA requirements for remaining in good academic standing. INDEPENDENT /CORRESPONDENCE STUDY Credit earned in correspondence courses may not be counted towards any graduate degree. It is possible, however, that such work may be used by the student to make up entrance deficiencies. For more information, contact an academic advisor. SEMESTER lOAD Graduate students shall be considered full time if they are registered for 8 credit hours (4 credit hours during each summer session) and their programs of study meet with the approval of the academic programs. Courses taken as an auditor may not be counted in the definition of full-time study; however, courses taken to remove undergraduate deficiencies for admission may be counted. Graduate students may take no more than 16 hours of credit in any semester, nor more than a total of 16 credit hours in all the summer sessions in any one year without permission of their graduate advisor. Students who are employed are advised to take into account the demands that such activities make on their time and to reduce their course loads accordingly. TIME lIMITS FOR GRADUATE STUDY The age of course work and/or degrees earned may impact the number of transfer credit hours, courses, and number of hours needed to complete educational objectives. The age of credit hours and changes in course work vary in each graduate program. There are also time limits imposed for completion of graduate degrees. These limits vary; however, most programs require completion within five years from the start of graduate course work. Students are required to work closely with their program advisor to plan their course work and the completion of their degree. WITHDRAWA l Withdrawals prior to the last day to drop a course (see official calendar for each semester) are automatically marked W. According to university regulations, withdrawal after this date is permitted only with the approval of the dean of the student's school for urgent reasons related to the student's health or equivalent distress. In all such cases, the student must submit a request for late withdrawal to the advisor or to the graduate program director. This request must be supported by the instructor of the course, the graduate advisor, and the graduate program director, and then be forwarded to the dean with an accompanying statement outlining the reasons for the request. If the dean approves the request, the student's mark in the course shall be W, if the work completed up to the point of withdrawal is passing; otherwise a grade of F shall be recorded. Failure to complete a course without an authorized withdrawal results in the grade of F. Note: Termination of class attendance does not constitute official withdrawal and results in a grade of F. Students must officially withdraw from the course.MISSION STATEMENT The Ernestine M.

RAC lIN SCHOO l OF THE ARTS MUSIC DEGREE PROGRAMS Graduate students with a bachelor's degree in music from an accredited college or university or its demonstrated equivalent may undertake: \u0083Master of Music \u0083One of the special diploma programs ADMISSION All preliminary inquiries about graduate study in music at IU South Bend are to be referred to the graduate admissions and retention office. Applications for admission to the Master of Music degree program are available online at www.iusb.edu/~graduate or from the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts. Applicants must also submit official transcripts from all previous colleges and universities as well as the application fee. ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS During the week before the beginning of each semester, all new graduate students, including graduates of Indiana University, are required to take examinations that serve as placement examinations or prerequisites for entrance to graduate courses. These examinations will cover the areas of music theory, aural skills, keyboard skills, and music history. Courses to remedy deficiencies indicated by these examinations must be taken at the earliest opportunity. A student is presumed deficient in any area in which the entrance examination is not taken. Credit for any needed remedial courses in these areas is not applied against the 36 credit hour minimum. APPlIED MUSIC All candidates for graduate degrees in music are required to demonstrate to a faculty auditioning committee, as a minimum level of performance, ability in at least one applied music area equivalent to the end of the fourth year for concentrations in that area. Failure to meet the required level automatically indicates probationary admission and requires additional applied music study as a prerequisite to the desired degree. For composition, the audition portfolio will consist of an undergraduate paper on theory or composition, a portfolio of four to six works for different ensembles, including at least one for orchestra, recordings on CD or tapes (cued to the sections desired) and an interview with the faculty. THEORY This examination is based on the assumption that the candidate has had at least two years of undergraduate theory study. The examination includes topics in writing and analysis of music from sixteenth century and eighteenth century counterpoint, diatonic and chromatic harmony to twentieth century music. Note: Students who fail this examination must enroll in and pass MUS-T 508 Written Theory Review for Graduate Students.MUSIC HISTORY This examination has an essay format. It covers each era of music history (medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and twentieth century) with emphasis on major genres of music and composers of those eras. Note: Students who fail all or part of this examination must enroll in MUS-M 541 Music History Review for Graduate Students I and/or MUS-M 542 Music History Review for Graduate Students II. Graduate remedial courses in history, literature, and theory may be taken only twice. Failure in any of these remedial courses for the second time results in the student's dismissal. kEYBOARD AND AURAl SkIllS The keyboard skills placement covers playing any major scale, two hands together, two octaves, playing a Roman numeral chord progression (in a major key to four sharps or flats) in left hand with melody in right hand, playing a chord progression alone first, then adding the melody, and sight-reading a four-part chorale or hymn. The aural skills placement covers singing diatonic, chromatic, and atonal melodies, taking a dictation for two voices with Roman numeral and chord-quality recognition, and aural analysis. kEYBOARD PROFICIENCY The keyboard examination is given at the end of each semester. Students who fail the examination must register in piano until the requirement is met. Designed to ensure the student's ability to use the piano as a tool within the framework of professional activities, the requirements vary according to level and area of music study. Students are to discuss specific requirements with their music advisors. Other examinations pertaining to specific degrees may be required as appropriate. ENSEMB lE REqUIREMENTS Each student must participate in a major music ensemble during each of the first three semesters of the degree program. Students enroll in MUS-X 003 Graduate Music Ensemble, the noncredit, nonspecific ensemble, and are assigned to specific responsibilities by the music area coordinator of the Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts. ADVISING Either prior to or during the week of registration, entering students are urged to consult the graduate programs coordinator or music advisor to determine the most suitable cognate field for their master's degree. Although a bachelor's degree with the same major is a prerequisite for each master's degree, the demonstrated equivalent of the bachelor's degree may be offered instead, thus allowing a change of major at the graduate ERNESTINE M. RAC lIN SCHOO l OF THE ARTS4GRADUATE DEGREES 4 219 level. Only after results of the entrance examinations and auditions are known and after careful consideration of the prerequisites, requirements, and ultimate goals of each degree plan can the major and cognate fields be approved. Advising conferences are held near the end of each semester. Students currently enrolled should have their programs planned at that time to speed the registration process. Students failing to attend these conferences may be required to register after classes have begun.

RAC lIN SCHOO l OF THE ARTS4GRADUATE DEGREES 4 221 Final Writing Project The student must complete a final writing project prior to the graduate recital. This project may take one of three forms: a thesis, extended program notes, or a performance-lecture. Each is explained in detail below. Students must present a proposal for their project by October 1 for completion in the spring semester and by March 1 for completion in the fall semester. Proposals should include the student's name, degree program, a working title for the project, a 1-2 page single-spaced narrative providing background and significance of the project, and the semester in which the project will be completed. Master's Thesis The master's thesis is an extended research paper on a subject in music history or music theory chosen in consultation with and under the direction of a member of the academic faculty. The thesis must present an original idea and argument that is supported by extensive research in a document generally 50-75 pages in length. Extended Program Notes With this option, the student will prepare extended, comprehensive program notes that address the repertoire chosen for the student's graduate recital. The notes must be based on substantive research in order to provide contextualization and analysis for each piece on the program. This project has two parts: extended program notes for review by the advisor (approximately 15 pages) and condensed program notes for printing in the recital program (approximately 5 pages). lecture-Recital The student will prepare a 45-60 minute performance lecture that will be given immediately before the recital program. During the lecture, the student should provide the audience with historical contextualization and analysis of the pieces to be performed and demonstrate musical examples where appropriate. Graduate qualifying Examinations Students must pass final examinations in music history, theory, and major area before the graduate recital. A student may attempt the examinations at any time during the degree program but must successfully complete each segment within a maximum of two attempts or be dismissed from the program. \u0083Each oral examination will be about 50 minutes. \u0083There will be a committee of three faculty members \u2014including the studio teacher\u2014and at least one academic faculty member. \u0083Two questions will be asked four weeks prior to the oral examination. One question will relate specifically to the area of study, and one question will relate to the final writing project, with a focus on music history and music theory. The student will prepare a 15 minute answer for each question, with additional time allotted for follow-up.Sample question: Composers often engage with political and social issues through their music. Choose two pieces, one choral and one symphonic, by two different American composers and compare and contrast the ways in which each addresses a specific contemporary problem. Be prepared to discuss and cite relevant scholarly literature.

We will achieve this vision by: \u0083Providing rigorous and relevant programs that are intellectually grounded, innovative, integrative, technologically advanced and global in perspective \u0083Preparing students for successful leadership roles \u0083Collaborating with stakeholders to align our teaching, scholarship, and service to the needs of the community \u0083Serving as a primary source for creating and applying business knowledge to promote regional economic development. GRADUATE BUSINESS PROGRAMS Administration Building 203C (574) 520-4138gradbus@iusb.edu www.iusb.edu/~buse/grad The School of Business and Economics' master's degree programs prepare students for a lifetime of learning. Successful people know that to remain viable in the work place they must train for the future. Each graduate is better prepared to take leadership positions because of the knowledge, analytical, and critical thinking skills developed in the graduate business program. The master's degree programs cater to the part-time student; offering a wide variety of courses during the evening hours, making it possible for students to continue in their present position while attending classes after work. The programs help students polish and accentuate their existing business skills and develop new ones. A master's degree can help students achieve career advancement in their current field or help prepare them for a new career in the business world. Most domestic students already hold responsible business management positions. The majority of domestic business graduate students hold full-time jobs while pursuing their master's degree. The typical candidate enters the program because either their present or future position requires increased managerial competence. The faculty considers the candidate's work experience an integral part of the total educational program and uses both theory and practice as tools to build a broad foundation to enhance the skills of the professional manager. While there is some opportunity for specialization, the graduate business program emphasizes development of the candidate's breadth of focus, imagination, and creativity. By selecting students who demonstrate a potential for assuming increasing responsibilities as managers, and by providing a degree that meets the highest national standards of accreditation, the School of Business and Economics serves the needs of regional employers that compete in an international marketplace. ADMISSION Graduate business programs admit only those students who demonstrate aptitude, ability, and scholarship. Applicants must hold a bachelor's degree and take the standardized Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). For the Admissions Committee to consider a candidate for admission into one of the graduate business programs, the applicant must submit the following materials: \u0083Completed and signed application form and data sheet. Contact the graduate business office for an application and data sheet. Visit www.iusb.edu/apply for an online application. \u0083Official transcripts of every college or university attended. The graduate business office obtains Indiana University transcripts. \u0083Two letters of recommendation (forms and envelopes provided). E-mail forms are available for those applying online. \u0083Official score report from the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). \u0083A nonrefundable application fee. Admission standards into graduate business programs are maintained by selecting only those candidates who can successfully complete a rigorous and competitive academic program. The program is accessible only to those students of demonstrated aptitude, ability, and scholarship. Admission decisions are based on a composite evaluation of the applicant's: \u0083GMAT scores \u0083Undergraduate academic performance measured by GPA \u0083Two letters of recommendation \u0083Personal essays \u0083Professional work experience The committee encourages submission of additional supporting information. Applicants whose native language is not English must submit an acceptable Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score or successfully complete Level 9 of The Language Company program. Interested students must submit all application materials on or before the following deadlines: Semester Deadline Fall semester July 1 Spring semester November 1 Summer sessions April 1 Admitted candidates may enter the program at the beginning of any regular semester.SCHOO l OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS4GRADUATE DEGREES 4 225 ENROllMENT RESTRICTION No graduate student (except those officially admitted to graduate business programs) is allowed to take more than 20 percent of his or her course work credit hours in graduate business courses under any circumstances. The Office of Graduate Business Programs monitors the implementation of this requirement. ACADEMIC STANDING Graduate business students whose grade point average (GPA) falls below the 2.75 requirement are placed on academic probation for one semester. If the student's GPA is not raised to the 2.75 level, the student may be placed on additional probation, or may be dismissed from the program. If at any time a student's GPA falls below 2.25, automatic dismissal takes place. CREDIT TRANSFER Graduate business students may transfer a maximum of 12 credit hours into their graduate program. For course work to be eligible for transfer, the class must be taken at another AACSB accredited college or university. All classes must be preapproved. The approval process requires the submission of the course syllabus and possibly other course-specific materials. The student is notified in writing if the approval is granted. Only those courses in which a student receives a grade of B or higher transfers. Upon successful completion of a preapproved course at another institution, the student must request that an official transcript be sent to the Office of Graduate Business Programs showing a grade of B or higher. Upon receipt of said transcript the Office of Graduate Business Programs will complete the transfer and notify the student. MASTER OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION Our master's degree in business administration prepares students to assume leadership roles in their organization. Paced to suit the needs of career-oriented candidates, the program is tailored to the demands of students preparing for greater professional challenges. The curriculum for the Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) reflects the school's mission to emphasize functional knowledge, skills, and capabilities. The various influences of ethics, global community, politics, society, and diversity are interwoven throughout the school's graduate courses. Faculty use case studies in many courses to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Small class size gives students important one-on-one experience with faculty members whose research, teaching, and consulting experience puts them on the cutting edge of regional, national, and global business issues. To accommodate students from a broad spectrum of north central Indiana and southwestern Michigan locations, master's degree classes are taught on both the South Bend and Elkhart campuses. Some online and hybrid courses are also offered.PROGRAM REqUIREMENTS (36-57 CR .) (All courses are 3 credit hours, unless otherwise designated.) Students who took specific business courses within the last five years and meet the minimum grade requirement, may qualify for automatic exemption from part of Phase I. If the specific business classes were taken over five years ago or if the minimum grade requirement was not met, the Office of Graduate Business Programs may use placement examinations to establish possible exemption from any of these courses. In addition, each candidate must pass a computer skills test prior to beginning their graduate course work. Students who do not pass this test must take BUS-K 501 Computer Skills for Management.

COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION REqUIREMENT Each graduate business student, as a condition for graduation, must pass a comprehensive examination during his or her final year. The examination is given near the end of each semester. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ACCOUNTING The Master of Science in Accounting (M.S.A.) provides advanced academic work for those with specialized interest in the field of accounting. The degree develops the conceptual and technical skills of those whose undergraduate academic performances were above average, and who may be preparing to sit for the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination. Indiana law requires 150 hours of college credit for a person to be eligible for this examination. To meet this need, IU South Bend is offering a 30 graduate credit hour (10 courses) Master of Science in Accounting degree. Besides being tailored to meet these new demands, the degree is equally well suited for practicing accountants preparing for greater professional challenges. The curriculum for the M.S.A. reflects the school's mission to emphasize functional knowledge, skills, and capabilities. The program prepares individuals for professional certification, not only as a C.P.A., but also as a Certified Management Accountant (C.M.A.), Certified Fraud Examiner (C.F.E.), or Certified Internal Auditor (C.I.A.). The degree requires 30 credit hours beyond the accounting major bachelor's degree. If an applicant lacks an undergraduate accounting degree, the attainment of an M.S.A. degree requires additional course work.

MASTER OF SCIENCE IN MANAGEMENT OF I NFORMATION of Science in Management of Information Technologies (M.S.-M.I.T.) degree, the first of its kind in Michiana, enables graduates to effectively plan and manage complex information technologies for their firms and to successfully advance their manufacturing/service organizations into the twenty-first century. Given the burgeoning influence of information technology in almost all organizations, Michiana businesses must learn to manage information technology to their best advantage. The M.S.-M.I.T. degree is one of the best professional career investments for area managers. This degree significantly enhances the information technology management capabilities of our graduates and their organizations. To manage information effectively, organizations need employees proficient in information systems and management. This program provides expertise in both. Graduates can assume a variety of responsibilities, from the development of electronic commerce, to the management of large-scale business process reengineering and enterprise resource planning. Graduates gain proficiency in areas such as: electronic commerce, managerial decision support systems, enterprise resource planning, business process reengineering, database management systems, telecommunication systems, web design, object oriented programming, supply chain management, and artificial intelligence systems. Upon graduation, students receive a certificate of completion of SAP courses. The M.S.- M.I.T. Program may be completed in two years full or part-time, and all courses are offered in the evening.

The Indiana principal licensure is a PK-12 license and the IU South Bend cohort program addresses the knowledge, dispositions, and performances required of school leaders. There are two methods for obtaining the necessary course work to complete the program: \u0083For those who already possess a master's degree and prerequisites, there is a 27 credit hour cohort program. \u0083For those who do not yet have a master's degree, there is a combined Master of Science in Education with an emphasis in elementary or secondary education, combined with the 27 credit hour Educational Leadership Program to obtain licensure for the principalship. IU South Bend's Educational Leadership Program utilizes extensive field experiences, authentic learning, and problem solving as major ingredients for each course; leaving students informed, skilled, and well prepared for successful completion of the state licensing examination. The two-year cohort structure ensures a consistently small class size and promotes the development of close and supportive collegial bonds. At the time students graduate, they have not only acquired the essential skills for successful schools, but they have also established a strong professional network, essential to success as an administrator.

The Educational Leadership Program is aligned with standards from the Educational Leadership Constituent Council. All programs in Counseling and Human Services are aligned with standards from the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. MONITORING PROGRESS OF STUDENTS AT C RITICA l C HEC k POINTS In addition to reviewing grades and cumulative grade point averages, candidate progress is monitored carefully at three critical checkpoints. At these checkpoints candidates are required to submit designated artifacts, aligned with state and national standards, in an Oncourse pseudo course. These artifacts are reviewed by faculty to determine if the candidate is meeting the standards or making progress toward meeting the standards. If the artifact provides evidence that the candidate is meeting the standards a grade of S is assigned for the pseudo course. If the artifact does not meet the standards, the candidate is contacted and a remedial plan is developed. In such cases, the candidate may receive a grade of R or I. If after participation in the remedial plan, the candidate's artifacts still do not provide evidence of meeting standards or making progress toward meeting standards, a grade of F is assigned for the pseudo course. These pseudo courses are 0 credit hour courses so an F grade would not alter a cumulative grade point average, but pseudo course grades appear on candidates' transcripts.

The goal of the M.S.N. is to develop nurses with the advanced practice nursing skills to increase the potential of our regional health care delivery system to improve the health of our communities. Program graduates will be eligible to seek certification as a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP). The M.S.N. Family Nurse Practitioner Program is a 45 credit hour, postbaccalaureate graduate degree. Applicants to the program must hold a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from an accredited institution. The curriculum is roughly divided into two major sections: preclinical and clinical course work. The preclinical courses provide the student with a core foundation for advanced practice. Clinical courses build upon that foundation, adding knowledge and its application in the direct clinical experience of advanced practice nursing. 2543 GRADUATE DEGREES3 CO llEGE OF HEA lTH SCIENCES All degree requirements must be completed within six years of initial program enrollment. The program is designed to meet the educational needs of working Registered Nurses, and is structured as a cohort-based, year-round, part-time study model. Degree requirements may be met through a combination of distance accessible and campus-based course work. Clinical work is arranged in consultation and is undertaken under the guidance of a faculty member and a preceptor. Clinical placements are designed to meet individual goals as well as overall learning objectives. PROGRAM OUTCOMES The graduate of the M.S.N. degree program will be prepared to do the following: \u0083Model excellence in nursing leadership to improve nursing practice within a complex health care system \u0083Perform advanced nursing practice within ethical-legal guidelines, professional policies and regulations, and standards of practice associated with a specialty area of practice \u0083Synthesize knowledge from nursing as well as biological, behavioral, social, administrative, educational, and communication sciences for application to a chosen domain of advanced practice nursing \u0083Demonstrate scholarly inquiry and reflection that exemplifies critical, creative, and systems thinking to advance the practice of nursing \u0083Frame problems, design interventions, specify outcomes and measure outcome achievement while balancing human, fiscal, and material resources to achieve quality health outcomes \u0083Use information technology and knowledge-based resources to manage and transform data that informs clinical practice \u0083Systematically apply knowledge from research findings and best evidence to answer clinical questions, solve clinical problems, and develop innovative nursing interventions and health policies for selected patient populations. \u0083Demonstrate collaborative practice and interpret nursing science within an interdisciplinary context \u0083Articulate the effects of culture, diversity, values, and globalization in the design, delivery, and evaluation of health services \u0083Engage in life-long learning activities that contribute to professional development as well as the advancement of nursing PROGRAM ADMISSION Admission to the IU South Bend School of Nursing M.S.N.

ACADEMIC STANDING GOOD STANDING A student is in good academic standing when his or her cumulative grade point average is 3.0 or higher. DISCIP lINARY PROBATION Disciplinary probation is administered under the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct. The faculty reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a student when problems related to personal integrity, health, maturity, or safety in the practice of nursing demonstrate the student's unfitness to continue preparation for professional nursing. ACADEMIC PROBATION A student is placed on academic probation when the cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 or if he or she earns a C+ or lower in a required course. The probationary status is removed within one full-time semester or its equivalent (9 credit hours). Students who do not regain good academic standing after three semesters of probation will be dismissed from the program. MAINTAINING STATUS Students who do not register for a period of three consecutive semesters will be dismissed from the program. Students admitted on probation who fail to remove the conditions of admission within the time frame specified are subject to dismissal. 2563 GRADUATE DEGREES3 CO llEGE OF HEA lTH SCIENCES Students attaining an unsatisfactory grade (below B-) in any clinical course may repeat the course only once; nonclinical courses may be repeated more than once if approved by the Graduate Faculty Council. If a course must be repeated, the department may specify additional conditions relating to progression in the program until the course is successfully completed. Evidence of lack of progress toward the degree is described as failure to successfully attain a B- or higher in a course in which an unsatisfactory grade has been previously received. Students who do not complete all degree requirements within six years following initial registration will be dismissed. GRADING SCAlE All courses in the IU South Bend School of Nursing M.S.N. degree program utilize the following grading scale in all nursing courses. An attainment of at least a B-, or 80 percent, is required to successfully pass a course. Failure to receive a final grade of B- will require the student to retake the course. The official grade code of Indiana University includes quality points for the purpose of determining the cumulative grade point average. See page 31 for the grading code scale. HEAlTH R E q UIREMENTS Students must meet the same immunization and health requirements as stated for undergraduate nursing students. STATEMENT OF ESSENTIA l ABIlITIES Graduate students must meet the same essential abilities as stated for undergraduate nursing students. PROFESSIONA l NURSING REqUIREMENTS Students must maintain active health care provider level CPR status and Indiana R.N. licensure. Two years of relevant clinical practice as an R.N. in the past five years are required. Application may be made during the cycle when the two years of experience as an R.N. will be reached. CRIMINA l BACkGROUND CHECk Criminal history background checks are required of all graduate nursing students in compliance with state and federal (House Bill 1633) regulations for individuals in clinical settings and working with patients and individuals who are vulnerable or minors. Licensure is also contingent upon the absence of most felony and some misdemeanor charges. An updated check for an enrolled student might have a bearing on the clinical site in which the student will be placed. Students will be asked to complete a criminal disclosure form each year in the fall. A past criminal history may become a significant barrier to clinical practicum rotation placements. In addition, current Indiana law states that individuals who have been convicted of certain crimes may not be employed by or operate a home health facility or work in the Indiana public school system. While a conviction of a crime does not automatically disqualify a student from participation in community-based clinical, a criminal history may be grounds for denying progression depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual case. OTHER POlICIES In addition to policies described under the general statement of the School of Nursing, the following policies govern master's study in particular. CREDIT TRANSFERS Students must obtain the consent of the graduate program director before credit earned at other institutions may be added to the official transcript. A maximum of 6 credit hours with a minimum grade of B in courses that fulfill the curriculum requirements may be transferred from an accredited college or university with the consent of the graduate program director. Credit hours used to meet requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing may not be used toward the Master of Science in Nursing. Students wishing to take graduate-level courses at another university to transfer to IU South Bend are highly encouraged to seek advising regarding credit transferability. Requests to transfer courses are reviewed on an individual basis. Specific information regarding transfer of credit hours can be obtained from the graduate program director. GRADUATE FACU lTY C OUNCI l The Graduate Faculty Council is a group of nursing faculty and administration who have the primary function of overseeing the development, delivery and assessment of the curriculum and program.

Such practitioners are committed to the alleviation of poverty, oppression, and discrimination. The school is dedicated to the enhancement of the quality of life for all people, particularly the citizens of Indiana, and to the advancement of just social, political, and economic conditions through excellence in teaching, scholarship, and service. Within the context of a diverse, multicultural, urbanized, global, and technologically oriented society, the school prepares social workers who shape solutions to a wide range of interpersonal and social problems by developing and using knowledge critically, while upholding the traditions, values, and ethics of the social work profession. TEACHING The teaching mission is to educate students to become professional social workers equipped for a lifetime of learning, scholarship, and service. Graduates embrace person-in-environment and strengths; perspectives that are linked to the welfare of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. They learn to keep abreast of advances in knowledge and technology, be self-reflective, and apply best practice and accountable models of intervention. The school prepares social work practitioners and scholars ready to assume leadership roles at the Master of Social Work level. SCHOlARSHIP The scholarship mission includes the discovery, integration, application, dissemination, and evaluation of client-centered and solution-focused knowledge for and with social work professionals and other consumers. Innovative forms of scholarship are encouraged in developing knowledge for use in practice, education, and service concerning social needs and social problems. SERVICE The service mission is dedicated to the promotion of the general welfare of all segments of society. Service includes work in the school, university, profession, and community and reflects the school's expertise in teaching, scholarship, and social work practice. Service in the interest of persons at greatest risk is consistent with the social work profession's attention to social justice. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Social work is a dynamic profession concerned with the changing needs of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and society. For those interested in this professional commitment, social work offers a broad range of practice settings: community mental health agencies, nursing homes, hospitals, schools, employee assistance programs, family service agencies, and community service agencies. In addition, professional social workers serve as administrators of various social service agencies. They also work in all levels of government, education, and a number of social workers have assumed political or legislative careers. The education and training they receive in a Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) degree program provides them with the skills they need to choose a career within the broad area of social work. ADMISSION REqUIREMENTS Professional social work education requires the ability to undertake a rigorous program of classroom and field study. The school seeks to admit persons who demonstrate competency through their academic and work achievements and who give evidence of commitment to working toward the well-being of others and the betterment of social conditions. It also seeks to provide an ethnically and regionally diversified student body. Admission to the Indiana University School of Social Work is program specific. The Indiana University Master of Social Work degree program at the South Bend campus offers a part-time evening program culminating in the Master of Social Work degree. The entire 60 credit hours are available on the South Bend campus for those interested in the interpersonal practice concentration. Transfer to the Indiana University\u2014Purdue University Indianapolis campus is available to those wishing to finish the last 30 concentration credit hours in macro practice or other concentrations not offered on this campus.

THREE -YEAR, PART-T IME , E VENING P ROGRAM The part-time evening program allows students the flexibility of evening classes and of progressing at a slower pace than the more traditional, full-time program. This program begins in the second summer session of each year, and students first complete the foundation year courses. Following completion of the foundation year, students move to the concentration year sequence. The Master of Social W ork degree program consists of 60 credit hours of study and field work. The last 27 credit hours provide a concentration in mental health and addictions.Although the school values the knowledge gained from life experience, no credit can be given for this. Thus, the overall objectives of the first (foundation) year of the Master of Social Work degree program include development of: \u0083Basic, generic, competence applicable to the broad range of social work practice \u0083Basic competence in both interpersonal practice and planning and management practice \u0083Basic competence for practice in social-service delivery systems The overall objectives of the second (concentration) year include development of more advanced competence in interpersonal practice, mental health, and addictions practice. FIElD PRACTICUM Both the foundation and the concentration years of the Master of Social Work degree program include field practicum courses with field instructors who meet the standards of the school. A student in the program is required to have field instruction in two different agency settings. Placements are made in South Bend and various locations throughout the state. Field practicum is construed as a continuing process. Students in placement agencies are expected to meet professional service responsibilities. Students in field practicum follow the work schedule of their field agencies during holiday periods and/or semester recess. The school arranges the field placements for the students. Attention is given to the student's learning needs, professional goals, and interests. Field instruction is available only to students admitted as candidates for the Master of Social Work degree. A total of 960 clock hours of practicum are required, with 320 hours in the foundation year, and 640 hours in the concentration year. Practica are concurrent with course work.

This degree program provides students with a broad range of exciting experiences in: computer graphics technology; computer and information technology; electrical engineering technology; industrial technology; mechanical engineering technology; and organizational leadership and supervision. The United States Department of Education recognizes ET as a field that is primarily focused on engineering values and ideas, along with the technical skills necessary for typical engineering development projects. ET involves functions for research, production, operations, and programs that are designed for specific engineering fields. Engineering technologists can use their education and application of STEM, for example, to help make and/or manage the production and related processes of roads/bridges, buildings, power distribution systems, racing teams, computers, software, electronic instruments, environment, and transportation systems that are used daily. The ET graduate is prepared to immediately begin technical assignments, since many technology programs stress current industrial practices and design procedures. The ET graduate can apply established procedures which utilize current state-of-the-industry practice. The ET graduate is more likely to get hands-on jobs in technical sales, as a team leader, working in a laboratory, or field position. * = Purdue University course number + = IU South Bend course number PURDUE UNIVERSITY CO llEGE OF TECHNO lOGY 4 409 Graduates work for companies across the technological, construction, distribution, health care, and engineering spectrum; but they are best suited to areas that deal with application, production, implementation, engineering operation, sales, and distribution, as opposed to the conceptual design and research functions performed by typical engineering graduates.
