Inthe presence ofanelectric field, these charged particles migrate at different velocities toward the oppositely charged electrode. Because the particles migrate atdifferent rates, they can be separated from one another; the process is known as electrophoresis. Inthe low-gravity environment, thermal convec- tive effects (attributed tothe generated bythe electric field) and sedimentation effects (attributed tothe settling of high density particles out ofthe sample medium) are greatly reduced. Thus, more efficient separation isexpected. Inaneffort toexplore such separation, electrophoresis experi- ments were performed on the Apollo 14 mission. The electrophoresis chamber contained two electrodes (one configured ateach end) and three glass separation tubes. Amixture oftwo dyes (\"Brilliant Blue and Amaranth Red\") was selected for the first separation tube. Itwas suspected that while the intense color ofthe dyes would facilitate separation detection, the mobility ofeach would permit separation within the limited confines ofthe tube. Hemoglobin was selected for the second separation tube.

This method of separation, known aselectrophoresis, should be enhanced inthe low-gravity environment where thermal convection and cell sedimentation effects are reduced. This Apollo 16 experiment, which was an extension ofan electrophoresis investigation performed during Apollo 14 (see McKannan, Apollo 14(this chapter)), was the first inaseries of experiments designed bySnyder etal. tostudy reduced gravity electrophoresis. The specific objective ofthe investigation was to electrophoretically separate monodisperse polystyrene latex particles (0.8 microns and 0.2 microns). The electrophoresis chamber contained platinum electrodes three 0.64 cm diameter, i0cm long polycarbonate tubes. Prior tothe launch ofthe Apollo 16mission, polystyrene latex particles were retained incontainers atone end ofeach ofthe tubes.

OnEarth, such separation ishampered bygravitational affects. For ex- ample, heat produced bythe electric field can initiate and sus- tain thermal convection inthe fluid system. Further, cells of highest density settle tothe bottom ofsystem before separation can occur. Both ofthese gravity-induced phenomena result ina mixing ofthe sample within the buffer fluid. Thus, the separa- tion ofthe cells onthe basis oftheir electrical charge is defeated. Inalow-gravity environment, such convective and sedimentary effects are greatly reduced and improved separation oftarget cells should bepossible. This STS-003 experiment was the second inaseries ofexperiments designed by Snyder et al. to study reduced gravity electrophoresis (see Snyder, Apollo 16). Electrophoresis hardware, previously employed on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission (see Allen, ASTP (this chapter) was reused onthe 1-10 STS-003 flight to (i) repeat the most promising aspects ofthe original ASTP investigations and (2) determine \"...the limiting concentration ofcells that can beseparated byfree fluid zone electrophoresis.\" (2, p.4) The experimental setup consisted of \"...an electrophoresis processing unit with [coated] glass columns tion takes place; film todocument the process, and acryogenic freezer tofreeze and store the samples after separa- tion.\" (i, p.64) During the shuttle mission, cell samples, which were inserted into the electrophoresis unit byacrew member, were allowed to separate for 1hour. After separation, the fluid columns were frozen topreserve the samples for post-flight analysis. Atotal ofeight columns were processed: two containing fixed red blood cells (RBC) and six containing human kidney cells. \"The astronauts did not report any difficulties inconducting the experiments, and their descriptions ofthe RBC migrations yielded the predicted displacements ofthe leading edges ofthe bands. All columns were recovered and returned toJSC where column slic- ing and analyses were tohave been done. The intent was toslice the frozen columns using procedures developed during ASTP, and then tomeasure and compare the significant particle and fluid properties within narrow slices ofboth the low and high con- centration columns.\" (2, p.6) Itwas reported that \"Because the columns were not maintained in afrozen state after return toEarth, itwas 3) \"The [STS-003] photographs ofthe [two] RBC migrations became the only source of data from the space experiments.\" (2, p.6) Inthe first (RBC) column, ahigh concentration ofcells were to beseparated. \"As the sample ofRBC first became visible atthe ofthe column, there appeared tobeabubble ofgas oc- cupying the nose of the sample mass.., the sequence of photographs shows abroad band ofcells moving along the column with no apparant [sic] separation. This could be due to electroosmosis, concentration effects or distortion of the electric field bythe bubble...\" (2, p.6) Inthe second (RBC) column alow concentration ofcells was ex- amined. \"The observed band structure was narrow, and noclear trailing band was seen. Densitometry measurements ofthe flight negatives indicated that atrailing band could have been present.., but the densitometric evidence isnot conclusive due 1-11 tothe distribution ofglare and shadows photographed inthe columns.\" (2, p.6) It was concluded that despite (i) post-flight procedural anomalies, (2) abubble preceding the leading edge ofthe high concentration RBC column, and (3) aquestionable trailing band in the low concentration RBC column, detailed analyses ofRBC cell migration from photographs taken during STS-3 affirmed \"...that particle electrophoresis inspace isnot Separation ofComponents, Particle Dispersion, Suspension ofParticles, Particle Migration, Particle Distribution, Density Difference, Liquid Transfer, Liquid Injec- tion, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Electric Field, Electrodes, Surface Charge, Electroosmosis, Wall Effect, Thermal Convection, Sedimentation, Bubbles, CoatedSurfaces, Biological Cells, Model Systems, ContainedFluids, CellPreserva- tion, Freezing, Cell Storage, Thermal Environment More Extreme Than Predicted, Photographic Difficulties, Illumination Dif- ficulties, Medical Applications, Pharmaceutical Applications, Biological Materials Processing, Deterioration ofSamples After Low-G Flight NumberofSamples: eight separating columns Sample Materials: (I) live human kidney cells; (2) human and rab- bit red were performed onSTS-003 to reduce convective and sedimentation effects during the separation ofbiological cells. Fixed red blood cells are considered agood model system when testing the separation capabilities ofanelectrophoresis unit. An actual pharmaceutical product could be obtained from the separation ofkidney cells. Specifically, kidney cells which produce urokinase were targeted for separation from the rest of the kidney cells inthe sample medium. 1-12 Because electrophoretic separation does not result in cell damage, target cells are used for avariety ofendeavors includ- ing immunology studies and cell-biology research.

Since there are three phases ofmatter, there are nine possible types ofdispersions. For example, milk isacolloidal suspen- sion offat, protein, lactose, minerals, and vitamins inwater (a liquid dispersed phase within aliquid dispersion medium). More importantly, the human body isprimarily composedofcolloidal matter; substances such asdigestive fluids, body fluids, and blood are colloidal systems. This Skylab student experiment was designed tostudy several ef- fects oflow gravity oncolloidal chemistry. Four investigations incolloidal chemistry were proposed: (I) the formation ofsol from two solutions, (2) the formation ofagel from two solu- tions, (which cause the formation ofseveral suspen- sions inasingle tube byusing electrodes placed incontact suspension (electrophoresis). These investigations were to beperformed inanapparatus consisting of (i) four rectangular chambers with transparent ports for viewing and photography, (2) heaters for temperature control, (3) apower supply for electric field generation, and (4) acontrol system. 1-14 This experiment was initially selected asafeasible investiga- tion for the Skylab student experiment program. However, inMay 1971, \"It was determined during Preliminary Design Reviews atthe Marshall Space Flight Center...that the experiment asoriginally proposed would beextremely difficult, ifnot impossible, toper- form asaSkylab Student Project experiment because oftime, weight, and volume constraints.\" (3, p. i0) Therefore, the ex- periment was not performed during the Skylab program. Because the proposed experiment included electrophoresis, the student be- came involved with an Apollo 16 electrophoresis demonstration (see Snyder, Apollo 16(this chapter)).

The experiment was quickly prepared when the opportunity arose toinclude asimple electrophoresis experiment onthe last Skylab mission. 1-17 Reportedly, the experiment was subject to three major limitations: (i) the small amount oftime toprepare the experi- ment, (2) the limited power available tothe experiment (28 volts) and (3) the \"...requirement for the whole package tofit a volume defined byacylinder of3.5\" diameter, 3.5\" long.\" (i, p. 740) The primary objectives ofthe research were to (i) establish if living red blood cells would form ITP zones inthe absence of gravity, and (2) compare the resulting low-gravity resolution of two proteins infree solution with the resulting terrestrial resolution oftwo proteins ingel medium. The Skylab experiments were conducted incylindrical Plexiglas TM test cells. At one end ofeach cell, the leader buffer and leader electrode were housed. Atthe other end ofeach cell, a terminator buffer and asmaller terminal electrode were housed. The two buffers were separated byamovable partition which also contained the test specimen. Once the appropriate voltage was applied, the manually operated partition was removed and the sample advanced into the leader buffer. Componentseparation due tothe electric field was monitored via anobservation window in the cell. Two such experimental cells were employed: the first toexamine the fractioning oftwo colored proteins (horse spleen ferritin and human hemoglobin) and the second toexamine the fractioning ofhuman blood cells. During the space experiment, unexpected air bubbles were observed inboth ofthe experiment cells. Itwas estimated that these bubbles were aresult offluid leakage. Nevertheless, forward migration was observed in the second cell (human red blood cells): \"...the advancing front showed alittle bowing, the view being partially obstructed byair bubbles... Uponcompletion of forward migration, the current polarity was reversed, and the astronauts then repeated the frontal migration asecond time.\" (i, p.741) During the second run, avery sharp profile was ob- served, although itwas not known ifthe profile was due to electroosmosis alone. Itwas also noted that mixing ofthe buff- ers may have taken place during the second run. Reportedly, after the partition was removed inthe first cell and the colored proteins released, noobservable migration was noted. Post-flight investigation indicated that the appropriate current was not produced inthe cell. Itwas thought that the unexpected air bubbles may have hindered the current flow. Itwas concluded that while the experiment was somewhat flawed by the procedures used during Skylab, itdid prove the feasibility ofITP. 1-18 Key Words: Biotechnology, Isotachophoresis, Electrophoresis, Aqueous Solutions, Electric Field, Electrodes, Surface Charge, Particle Dispersion, Particle Mobility, Particle Migration, Separation ofComponents, Suspension ofParticles, Density Dif- ference, Convection, Sedimentation, Bubbles, Liquid Transfer, Liquid Injection, Liquid Mixing, Liquid Leakage, Biological Cells,Electroosmosis, Wall Effect, Contained Fluids, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Biological Materials Processing, Medical Applications, \"Because ofthe longtime delay between launch and performance of the experiment, necessitating anoptional medium p.676) The horse spleen ferritin/human hemoglobin mixture was chosen be- cause \"Extensive terrestrial trials had been conducted onthis mixture showing that itseparated well ongels InWorkshop Proceeding ofthe Measurement and Charac- terization of the Acceleration Environment on Board the Space Station, August 11-14, 1986, Guntersville, Alabama, p. 9-1.

Ifthe between biological species issmall, separation can beenhanced byincreasing the length of the [separation] column. Electrophoresis can be conducted in liquid media, orfree solutions, but problems arise because of disturbances inthe bulk ofthe fluid. Two major causes ofthese disturbances are sedimentation ofthe particles orsolute being separated and thermal convection generated byJoule heating of the column during electrophoresis. Although various techniques have been developed toovercome these problems onEarth, the elimination ofgravity-induced aries between species ofdifferent mobility are sharply defined and stabilized byelectrical forces. Adjacent compartments of sample components that may not be distinguishable by zone electrophoresis may beresolved byisotachophoresis. The bound- aries highly self-recuperative will or disrupted byother factors, including convection. The concentra- tion of each substance within acompartment isuniform and remains constant throughout the run once the separation has been achieved. Because ofthis uniformity, higher concentrations of components can behandled with nodeterioration ofthe sharp boundaries.\" (i, p.309) The specific objectives ofthis Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) experiment were to separate biological cells by (i) electrophoresis and (2) isotachophoresis. Prior tothe flight (a) eight, 6-inch long glass columns were filled with anappropriate buffer solution and (2) slides con- taining afrozen sample ofeither red blood cells, human lym- phocytes, orhuman fetal kidney cells were prepared. Six ofthe columns (numbered 1,2,3,5,6, and 7)were prepared for zonal electrophoresis two ofthe columns (numbered 4and 8)were prepared for isotachophoresis. (See Sample Materials section for (i) adescription ofthe buffer ineach column and (2) the number ofcells loaded onasample slide.) The ASTP Electrophoresis Unit (EU) was capable ofprocessing one column atatime. During the mission, each ofthe glass columns was configured into the EUand the appropriate sample slide in- serted into the column. Zonal examinations included: fixed rab- bit, human, and horse red blood cells (columns 1and5), human lymphocytes (columns 2and 6), and human fetal kidney cells (columns 3and 7). Isotachophoresis examinations included fresh human and rabbit blood cells (column 4)and fixed rabbit and human red blood cells (column 8). A70mm camera documented each column separation. After separation, electrophoresis columns were frozen byathermoelectric module and placed ina cryogenic freezer for return toEarth. Isotachophoresis columns were not frozen for post-flight analysis. <Note: Itappears that column 7was not subjected to electrophoresis in orbit as planned: the processing ofcolumn 7.\" (i, p.324)> Inthe ground-based laboratory, frozen samples were sliced and analyzed to determine the number and type ofseparated cells.

The angle ofdeflection for aparticular particle was determined by the separation buffer flow rate and the field gradient.\" (I, p.340) \"The electrophoresis equipment was designed for the separation of [the] four mixtures ofbiological cells with variable sample flow rates, buffer flow rates, and electric field gradients.\" (i, p. 335) Four experimental steps for each sample were performed: (i) the apparatus was filled with the sample fluid such that any pos- sible remainders of the previous sample were removed from the separation chamber, (2) i_itial settings were applied: 60V/cm field strength, 0.275 cm_/s buffer throughput, and 5cm3/hr sample flow rate, (3) the flow rate was decreased from 5to1 cm3/hr while the field strength and buffer throughput remained the same (as in (2)), and (4) the field strength and buffer throughput were reduced totwo-thirds their initial value with the sample flow rate kept at1ml/hr. The separated biomaterial fractions were not collected. Instead, \"The separation was evaluated byoptoelectronic methods. Bythis method, anarrow slit across the downstream end ofthe separation chamber, parallel tothe electric field isilluminated. The light passes through the quartz plates ofthe separation chamber and isattenuated asafunction ofthe density ofthe sively scanned and digitally recorded on magnetic tape. Reportedly, the data collection rate was approximately 2.5 kilobits/sec with abrightness resolution of1%per step. After the ASTP mission itwas reported that all systems ofthe continuous flow electrophoresis apparatus worked well except for the illumination system. \"During development work, ahalogen lamp was introduced into the system tosave energy and itwas not taken into account that the lack ofgravity would cause alack of thermal convection ofthe gasfilling lamp. This resulted inahigher temperature and therefore ingreater lamp brilliance than under Igconditions. Unfortunately the measuring range ofthe analog-to-digital converter was limited from 70to 100% oftransmission inorder touse the full accuracy. As a consequence, the ADC was overranged bythe high brilliance ofthe lamp and no normal absorption pattern could be found onthe tapes.\" (4, p.138) \"In the entire separation process, no 'true' cell distribution curve was obtained. The baseline ofregistration inall cases was above the maximum absorption obtained inthe peaks. Because ofthis finding, ananalysis ofthe experiment seemed impossible atfirst. However, during the stationary phase ofthe separation (after adjustments toconstant experimental conditions), i.e., during 90-second separation time, irregularly occurring pulses (called 'events') were recorded. This pattern reflected the ex- pected course ofthe separation curves...[see Reference (i) for these curves] separation bands.\" (i, p.350) Toinvestigate the above assumption, ground tests were conducted and itwas discovered that clusters ofcells (5toi0innumber) migrate along the same flow paths assingle cells (see Reference (4) for complete explanation). Therefore, only the first ex- perimental step was evaluated (the lack ofsample throughput in the other experimental steps did not produce enough clusters for evaluation). Based on this evaluation, the following was reported: (i) For rat bone marrow: Only 73'events' were observed because these cells tend not to aggregate. However, the distribution pattern shows good separation. (2) For rat spleen cells: Ahigh quality separation occurred (358 events recorded). The results indicated a1.5 times higher resolution atsix-fold higher sample throughput for low-gravity electrophoresis. (3) For human and rabbit erythrocyte mixture: Because these cells have aweaktendency toaggregate, no information could beob- 1-37 tained. (4) For rat lymph node cells: Ahigh quality separation occurred (549 events recorded). The following conclusions were among those reported: (i) The applicability of free-flow electrophoresis under low- gravity conditions was confirmed. (2) The possibility ofseparating living cells under low-gravity conditions was demonstrated. (3) \"Asample throughput greater than tenfold was achieved bythe expansion ofthe separation chamber cross section, possible in space flight, and with other similar chamber dimensions.\" (i, p. 352) (4) \"Despite the error that occurred inthe optical detection system, itwas demonstrated that the separation sharpness cor- responded atleast Liquid Injection, Liquid Transfer, Aqueous Solu- tions, Electric Field, Electrodes, Separation ofComponents, Par- ticle Dispersion, Suspension of Particles, Particle Mobility, Particle Migration, Particle Aggregation, Particle Distribution, Surface Charge,Biological Cells, Thermal Convection, Thermal Gradient, Sedimentation, Flow Rates, Wall Effect, Electroosmosis, Container Shape, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Contained Fluids, Halogen Lamps, Illumination Difficulties, Biological Materials Processing, Medical Applications, Thermal Environment More Extreme Than Predicted NumberofSamples: Four set ofcells were separated.

Trans- formation and differentiation processes are often accompanied by changes ofthe cell surface charge density. Chargedensity, however, determines the electrophoretic behavior; i.e., the electrophoretic mobility. Therefore, electrophoresis isahighly efficient method of separating cells or other biological par- ticles according to functional criteria. Furthermore, cell electrophoresis isone ofthe few physicochemical processes that of MSFC Final conditions (see Hannig, ASTP). Very little information concerning this experiment could be lo- cated inthe available publications. The following brief summary was detailed inReference (i). \"Anew free flow electrophoresis apparatus was developed proceed- ing from the ACE 710, which had been designed inthe department ofProf. Hannig between 1978 and was adapted for use under microgravity .... Its separation chamber has alength of 20cm and awidth of 7cm. During the first test experiments the thickness ofthe buffer film was 0.5 mm. Under these conditions the machine could beoperated atelectrical field strengths upto 120 V/cm. The The aim ofthe test was tofind out whether the new machine operates well under microgravity. For this purpose amixture of rabbit, rat and guinea pig erythrocytes was electrophoresed .... [The results from the TEXUS 18experiment].., demonstrated that the new electrophoresis machine is very suitable for cell electrophoresis under microgravity.\" (i, p. 92) <Note: The ACE 710 device was not further detailed inthe reference.> Noother information concerning this experiment could belocated. 1-41 Key Words: Biotechnology, Electrophoresis, Continuous Flow Electrophoresis, Liquid Injection, Liquid Transfer, Aqueous Solu- tions, Electric Field, Electrodes, Separation ofComponents, Par- ticle Dispersion, Suspension of Particles, Particle Mobility, Particle Migration, Surface Charge,Biological Cells,Thermal Convection, Sedimentation, Flow Rates, Container Shape, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Contained Fluids, Biological Materials Processing, Medical Applications Number ofSamples: unknown, possibly one sample Sample Materiel: mixture ofrabbit, and guinea pig eryth-rocytes ContainerMaterials: unknown Experlment/Materlal Applications: SeeHannig,ASTP The reasons why the sample materials were selected for this ex- periment were not detailed inthe available publications.

Because itwas expected that higher volumes and higher concentrations ofsamples could beprocessed inthe low- gravity environment, CFE experiments were performed during this STS-004 mission. 1-43 The experiment was the first inaseries of investigations designed byLanham etal. and McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. (MDAC) tostudy CFE inthe space environment. The experimental setup consisted ofacooled separation unit, anexperiment con- trol and monitoring unit, and asmall refrigerator for sample storage. The separation unit was larger than its corresponding ground-based laboratory version, allowing for increased volume sample separation. During the mission, acrewman placed \"...the sample materials into the unit... [started] the flow ofthe carrier fluid, and put incollection cassettes .... The system then automatically in- jected samples into the chamber, starting the separation process. When the process was complete...

Wehad been concerned that the highly concentrated proteins used onthe space tests might get ineach others way and not separate effectively. But this did not happen; the degree [i.e. purity] ofseparation was the same for space and ground tests.\" (i, pp. 141-142) <Note: Not all ofthe references listed below were available at the time this experiment summary was prepared.> Key Words: Biotechnology, Continuous Flow Electrophoresis, Electrophoresis, Separation ofComponents, Biological Cells, Aqueous Solutions, Particle Dispersion, ofParticles, Electric Field, Electrodes, Surface Charge,Particle Mobility, Convection, Sedimentation, Liquid Expulsion Through aSmall Orifice, Liquid Injection, Liquid Transfer, Flow Rates, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Contained Fluids, CellStorage, CellPreservation, Refrigeration, Medical Applications, Biological Materials Processing Number ofSamples: Six samples were separated.

Individual samples were collected and stored invinyl receptacles within the collection cassettes. Experiment/Material Applications: Terrestrial continuous flow electrophoresis experiments are hampered by anumber ofdifficulties. For example, because \"...most proteins are more dense than the carrier fluid, gravity causes the sample tocollapse inablob around the inlet port...\" (i, p. 141) Thus, \"...most samples must behighly diluted to flow properly.\" (i, p.141) This dilution results inalower con- centration of the protein within the carrier available for separation. Inaddition, ,,...convection currents within the cham- ber cause the particle streams towaver back and forth. When this happens, the streams exit through each other's outlets, a result that degrades the purity ofthe separation. Toovercome this problem, avery thin separation chamber isused .... Unfor- tunately, athin chamber restricts the size ofthe sample inlet, and this, inturn, restricts the amount ofthe sample that can be injected and separated.\" (i, p.141) In contrast to these Earth-based difficulties which limit the amount ofmaterial separated, space electrophoresis should allow amuch higher quantity ofmaterial separation. For example, the space concentration levels are ,,..limited only bythe solubility ofthe proteins and the carrier fluid.\" (i, p.141) Inaddition, space processing should result inthe reduction of convective currents, thus allowing larger cross-sectional diameter chambers and sample inlets. The mixtures ofrat albumin and egg albumin separated during the the experiments were chosen ,,...because the two albumins are fairly close inmobility and because, inusing this pure mix- ture...\" (i, p.142) the machine's References/Applicable Publications: Operations InSpace--A InManufacturing in Space, Proceedings Ofthe Winter Annual Massachusetts, November 13-18, 139-142.

Because earlier STS-004 experiments indicated that amuch higher quantity ofbiological material could beseparated inthe shuttle environment without degrading sample purity, the primary (McDonnell Douglas) goal ofthis shuttle mission was toincrease the purity ofthe separated samples. Inorder toachieve this goal, modification ofthe STS-004 CFES unit was necessary. This modification, which included the addition ofaPump Accumulator Module (located inone middeck locker), improved ofthe CFESand allowed dissipation ofupto l-kW ofheat (generated during the separation process) through the orbiter payload cooling loop. Asaresult ofthe heat reduction, a higher voltage could be placed across the separation chamber. This higher voltage, coupled with alonger time during which 1-48 sample materials were subjected tothe electric field, resulted inthe migration ofparticles togreater lateral distances. Reportedly_\"The internal dimensions of [the] space CFES...[Lexan _'] separation (flow) chamber is16cmwide, 120 cm long, and 0.3 cmthick .... [The] cooling jacket covers each broad chamber face with one electrode ineach cooling chamber positioned diagonally across from each other to provide the electric field across the length ofthe chamber. The platinum electrodes are incontact with the separation chamber via slots cut into the chamber plates and are covered with aproprietary, porous membrane. The circulation ofcooled electrolyte, from the bottom (flow entrance) ofthe chamber tothe top through aser- pentine passageway, establishes auniform lateral temperature gradient and removes the bubbles formed ateach electrode. Rec- tangular struts used to form the coolant passage also provide some support tothe thin separation chamber plates. The sample enters the chamber through athin-wall glass tube (0.I cminside diameter) located Iicmfrom the curtain buffer entrance ofthe chamber. The buffer and separated sample fractions exit atthe top ofthe chamber through which span the width ofthe chamber.\" (2, p. 2) (Further descriptions of the CFES apparatus and experimental operation are detailed under Lanham, STS-004.) During this mission, the investigators achieved ,,...more than four times better resolution orpurity [in separation ofboth a mixture ofrat albumin ispossible onEarth.\" (i, p.142) Under aNASA/McDonnell Douglas Joint Endeavor Agreement, NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center was able tosubmit two oftheir own samples for processing inthe McDonnell Douglas CFES.Among the primary (NASA) goals ofthese experiments were to (i) validate sample concentration effects reported byMcDonnell Douglas from STS-004 and (2) evaluate the continuous flow electrophoretic separation ofamaterial ofhigh concentration and compare it with ground-based CFE attempts. NASA, being subject tothe constraints ofthe McDonnell Douglas CFES system and the choice offluid buffer (2mMbarbital), opted tohave the following two samples processed: and hemoglobin (1.9%). Reportedly, \"The band behavior obtained from processing the single species was used todefine the performance ofthe space instrument. The low concentration mixture..., although still higher than can beprocessed athigh resolution onEarth, would permit acomparison ofthe separations achieved before flight in 1-49 the various laboratory units.\"(2, p.4) Photographs taken during processing of the high concentrations sample indicated extensive band spreading which was attributed to \"...the mismatch of electrical conductivity between the sample and buffer.\" (2, abstract) Photographs taken during processing ofthe lower concentration hemoglobin-polysaccharide sample il- lustrated that \"...the stream was more compact with little in- dication ofspreading.,, (2, p.5) Post-flight analysis ofthe separated materials from the collec- tion tubes indicated that the separation of the hemoglobin/polysaccharide mixture was not as distinct as that achieved during similar ground-based laboratory testing (see Reference (2), p.5). <Note: Not all ofthe references listed below were available to aid inthe preparation ofthis experiment summary.> Key Words: Biotechnology, Continuous Flow Electrophoresis, ofComponents, Biological Cells, Aqueous Solutions, Particle Dispersion, Suspension ofParticles, Particle Mobility, Particle Migration, Electric Field, Electrodes, Electrical Conductivity, Electrolytes, Surface Charge,Convection, Sedimentation, Liquid Expulsion Through a Small Orifice, Liquid Injection, Liquid Transfer, Flow Rates, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Contained Fluids, Container Shape, Sample Purity, Bubble Formation, Porous Material, Membranes, Heat Transfer, Thermal Gradient, Cell Preservation, CellStorage, Medical Applications, Biological Materials Processing, Processing Difficulties NumberofSamples: During the mission six samples were separated.

Under aNASA/McDonnell Douglas Joint Endeavor Agreement, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center was able tosubmit two oftheir own samples for processing inthe McDonnell Douglas CFES. Originally, the goals ofthe NASA STS-007 experiments were to 1-53 build onthe NASA results observed onSTS-006. However, \"Because MDAC changed the curtain buffer onSTS-7 from abarbital buffer (pH 8.3) toanpropionate buffer (pH 5.2), itwas not possible to perform afollow-up experiment using hemoglobin and polysac- charide asprocessed onSTS-6. The change inpHwould have resulted inboth hemoglobin and polysaccharide becoming posi- tively charged and migrating toward the cathode. Polystyrene latex particles (PSL) were, therefore, chosen for separation on STS-7 since they are known tobenegatively charged atpH5.2 and are produced inarange ofsizes with different surface charge groups and surface charge densities.\" (i, p.2) The primary (NASA) goal for this mission was, therefore, \"...to evaluate the influence ofthe electrical properties ofthe sample constituents onthe resolution ofthe continuous flow electrophoresis device.\" (2, abstract) Three PSL particle sizes were chosen. Those with the highest mobility were dyed red, those with the lowest mobility were dyed blue, while those with an intermediate mobility were not dyed. For both ofthe NASA samples, volumes ofeach particle size were combined toyield equal concentrations. However, the conduc- tivity ofthe first sample tobeprocessed was three times that ofthe second sample tobeprocessed. Descriptions ofthe CFES apparatus and experimental are detailed Lanham, STS-004 and Lanham, STS-006. Post-flight, collected fractions ofthe samples and photographs ofthe separation were analyzed. \"As expected, the polystyrene latex microspheres dispersed insolution with three times the electrical conductivity ofthe curtain buffer[,] separated with significantly larger band spread than inthe second experiment under matched conductivity conditions.\" (i, abstract) Further detailed information concerning the experimental results ofthe NASA experiments could not belocated atthis time. <Note: Not all ofthe references listed below were available at the time this experiment summary was prepared.> Key Words: Biotechnology, Continuous Flow Electrophoresis, Electrophoresis, ofCom- ponents, Biological Cells, Aqueous Latex Polystyrene Microspheres, Particle Size Dis- tribution, Particle Dispersion, Suspension ofParticles, Particle Mobility, Electric Field, Electrodes, Surface Charge,Convection, Sedimentation, Liquid Expulsion Through aSmall Orifice, Liquid 1-54 Injection, Liquid Transfer, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Sample Purity, Contained Fluids, CellStorage, Cell Preservation, Medical Applications, Pharmaceutical Applications, Biological Materials Processing Number ofSamples: During the mission six samples were separated.

Twoseparate electrophoretic runs this experiment. Prior toarun, acrewman removed syringes containing the prepared cell samples from a4\u00b0Ccooling storage facility, \"...shook itvigorously, and rapidly passed a bar magnet back and forth over the syringe barrel tosuspend the cells uniformly.\" (I, p. 68) After the crewman inserted the syringe into the CFES unit, the sample was automatically ejected from the syringe into the buffer liquid. The sample, which was exposed toanelectric field strength ofapproximately 26V/cm, resided 4\u00b0Cstorage facility. Reportedly, problems associated with the automatic, sample- injection mechanism resulted in areduction of cells actually separated during each run.

However, it was reported that \"The pituitary cells were separated into 48 fractions ineach of the two electrophoretic runs, and the amounts ofgrowth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) released into the medium for each cell fraction were determined.

Cell candidates for research bythis method are human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. These cells can produce urokinase, which isanenzyme used for treating thrombosis. The survival of the cells isdependent on their attachment and spreading onasubstrate after electrophoretic separation. (The HEK cells are called anchorage-dependent cells.) The primary objective ofthis STS-008 experiment was todetermine ifanchorage-dependent, HEK cells would beads under low-gravity conditions. Reportedly, the inves- tigators were concerned that cell attachment would be lessened under low-gravity conditions since cell/bead contact would be based onrandom collisions. Because the electrophoretic separation ofHEK cells (a) was being performed on this shuttle flight during aseparate experiment (see Morrison, Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System: Kidney CellSeparation) and (b) could, inthe long term, beperformed on the Space Station, this experiment was designed todetermine (i) the efficiency ofthe reduced gravity cell attachment, (2) the degree ofcell survivability, and (3) the extent towhich the at- tached cells could be further processed inthe low-gravity en- vironment (during extended duration missions). Ifthe cells did not attach tothe beads, only short-term missions would prove ap- propriate to insure the survival ofthe cells after reduced gravity electrophoretic separation. Secondary objectives ofthe 1-78 experiment included (a) observing fluids mixing inspace and (b) evaluating the performance ofacarry-on incubator to be used during afuture Spacelab mission. The following materials were used for the experiment: Cells and Medium: Frozen suspensions ofHEK cells were grown in amedium consisting of(a) one part Medium 199, (b) one part MEM alpha, and (c) Dulbeco's Modified Eagle Medium. The medium was supplemented with (a) 1.2 g/l ofbactopeptone, (b) 0.02 mg/ml of streptomycin sulfate. (See Reference (i) for manufacturers of these materials.) Buffer and Enzyme Solutions: Calcium- and magnesium-free, phosphate-buffered saline mMKCI, (b) 1.46 mMKH2HPO 4, (c) 136.9 mMNaCI, and (d) 8.0 mM Na2HPO (a) 0.05% trypsin ofthese materials.) Fixative: The glutaraldehyde solution used was 50% aqueous, ultra-pure TEM grade. This solution was further diluted with toaconcentration of2.5%. in70% beads were washed three times inCMF-PBSand once inthe culture medium. They were then suspended inthe culture medium with aconcentra- tion of30mg/ml. The flight experiment was performed inacarry-on incubator. The incubator was mounted inaninstrument panel onthe Space Shuttle port flight deck. The apparatus was capable ofmaintaining a temperature of 37\u00b0C using either batteries or onboard power. The incubator contained (a) four cell culture chambers sealed with apiston, (b) four syringes loaded with the microcarrier beads, and (c) four syringes loaded with the glutaraldehyde fixa- tive. (See Reference (2) for further details concerning the ap- paratus.) Five days prior tostowage onthe shuttle, live HEK cells were (a) thawed, (b) suspended inthe culture medium, and (c) placed in75cm2surface growth flasks (Corning 25110). The cells sub- sequently attached tothe flasks and grew. Fourteen hours prior tolaunch, the cells (approximately 90% confluent) were removed from the flask surfaces with trypsin-EDTA. The free floating 1-79 Controlcells for ground-based studies were prepared using the same procedure. After launch, the temperature ofthe incubator was maintained at 37\u00b0Cusing aspacecraft power source. The experiment was in- itiated 7.5 hours after launch by injecting the beads into the cell culture chambers. Glutaraldehyde fixative was then injected into samples i,2, 3,and 4at5minutes, 3hours, 13.5 hours, and 24.5 hours, respectively. The incubator was switched off and the samples remained inthe chambers until the end ofthe mission (6days later). Six hours after landing, the samples were returned tothe investigators. Post-flight examination of the cells attached to the beads revealed that \"...the amount ofcells adhering tothe beads in- creases with increasing incubation time inboth the flight and ground control... [samples]. This clearly demonstrates that in microgravity attachment and spreading occurred normally.\" (I, p. 291) Infact, even though itwas originally speculated that cell attachment would be lessened under low-gravity conditions, the attachment was slightly more efficient inthe flight samples. This increase inattachment efficiency ofthe flight material was attributed tothe increased bead surface area available for at- tachment. (Suspended beads (low-gravity conditions) provide a greater surface area than sedimented beads (l-g conditions).) Most ofthe cell attachment occurred during the first 3hours. Cellgrowth and appeared tobenormal within 24.5 h.... Ifthe attachment would have been unspecific there would not beadifference between the samples atdifferent times.\" (I, p.292) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (see Reference (i) for sample preparation details) revealed nosignificant morphological dif- ferences between the low-gravity and l-g samples. \"The fact that the cells are showing inthe SEM pictures aclear spreading at 25.5... [hours]... led ustothe assumption that the cells were functionally intact. More than 50% ofthe cells [estimated value from population data] were bound atthis tobeads The not pos- sible for technical reasons tocount the free cells and the cells adhered tothe walls ofthe cell culture chambers. Moreover the population ofthe cells used inthis experiment isarather in- homogeneous one and therefore wecannot assume that they adhere 1-80 all inthe same manner and atthe same Since the cells are able toattach tomicrocarriers much more cells would remain viable until they are returned toearth. This technique should avoid the 65-80% decrease inviability observed after electrophoretic separation on STS-8 [see for example Morrison et al., Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System: Kidney Cell Separation] and other through aSmall Orifice, Liquid Mixing, Aqueous Solutions, Solid/Liquid Interface, Contained Fluids, In- cubator, Piston System, Electrophoresis, Medical Applications NumberofSamples: four SampleMaterials: See Experiment section Container Materials: unknown Experiment/Material Applications: HEK cells were used for this experiment since they (I) produce theimportant enzymeurokinase, (2)weresimultaneously inBiochemical Engineering, Vol. 22, pp. 1-50, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1982.

The experimental setup also consisted of (i) ablood kit (to enable the drawing and storing ofblood), (2) two incubators (one at37\u00b0Cand one at22 \u00b0C), and (3) cell culture containers. \"On the ground, 3culture flasks were prepared for each donor and for each withdrawal, one without and two with [mitogen concanavalin a, (con A)]. In flight, two cultures per donor were prepared, both with con A, one maintained under microg conditions, the other atiXg inthe centrifuge.\" (i, p.367) Cultures which were exposed tocon A, were exposed for 72hours, then treated with 3H-thymidine. Other treatments were described inReference (I), p. 367. The extent of the activation was measured by the amount of tritiated thymidine incorporated into DNA. Reportedly, the activation ofthe lymphocytes from the four crew members was significantly depressed immediately following the flight. Lymphocyte activation returned tonormal 7days after landing. Thus, itwas surmised that the reduced lymphocyte ac- tivation was due tophysical and psychological stress rather than tomicrogravity conditions. \"From acellular point ofview the most important implication of our findings isthat lymphocytes atO-g inflight are not activated incontrast tothe l-g controls.

Therefore, amajor objective ofthis low- gravity phase partitioning experiment was todetermine ifthe two polymer phase systems would indeed \"...demix and become localized inanacceptable length oftime.\" (4, p.9) The experiment was performed inasmall plastic box which con- tained 15transparent chambers. Each chamber (1.5 X1.8 X1.0 cm) contained astainless steel mixing ball and either (a) a dextran/PEG system or (b) an isopycnic system of dextran/PEG/Ficoll (this mixture was used as areference material). Itappears that six systems were examined during the mission. (See the sample materials section below for details, or for more information, Reference (5), p.132.) Reportedly, \"At the beginning ofthe experiment, the box was shaken manually, the action ofthe steel balls being sufficient toemulsify each sample. The box was then taped toafluorescent light box and photographed atappropriate times over aperiod of ii0 minutes torecord the evolution ofthe demixing.\" (5, p.134) After the shuttle mission, photos taken during the space experi- ment were compared with photos taken during similarly performed ground-based control experiments. Theground control experiments (which employed isopycnic mixtures ofdextran/PEG/Ficoll) demixed within approximately I0minutes following mechanical mixing (at constant temperature). \"Microscopically, domains ofeach phase could bedetected 2safter mixing.

[Plexiglas _'_] body plate into which 18chambers were machined .... Offset fill ports and O-rings allowed for clear photo visualiza- tion between the [partitioned] phases and the chamber wall. Each chamber contained amixing ball .... A... [+or-]1\u00b0Cliquid crystal temperature strip was imbedded inthe unit aspart ofthe photo field. Chambers 1to4,6,and 9to12were the same shape ason... [STS-023]. They had dimensions of 1.90 cmby 1.57 cm wide by0.91 cmdeep and held 3.4 ml. Chamber 5was 1.40 cmdeep held 4.2 ml. Chambers 1.40 cmcubes to allow the non-wetting demixed phase to form asphere .... The latter six chambers held quartz cuvettes which were fully or half-coated with dextran.., orpolyacrylamide .... \"(4, p. 401) Sixteen of the chambers contained mixtures of dextran (D), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and ficoll. The remaining two cham- bers contained mixtures ofFC43 fluorocarbon oil and water. (A complete listing ofthe material systems flown during this ex- periment can belocated inReference (4).) 1-101 The phase partitioning experiment was performed atotal offour times during the STS-026 Mission. During each ofthese four runs, \"The unit was mixed bymanual agitation and then mounted with a light diffuser onanorbiter middeck fluorescent light box via velcro standoffs also tothermally isolate the unit.\" (4, p.401) Video recording, 35mmphotography, and voice recordings provided data. Reportedly, \"Although the experiment was designed tobeperformed at 22\u00b0C itwas actually performed at27_C to 31\u00b0Cdue to problems with the shuttle cooling system. However, during each experiment the temperature varied atmost... [+or-]2\u00b0C. ,,(4 p.403) Post-flight visual inspection ofthe photographs indicated that material systems demixed atrates which varied with the polymer composition and chamber dimensions. This behavior was somewhat analogous to similar l-g experiments. \"In both environments when the more viscous phase wet the container wall the demixing took place more slowly. The viscosity ofthe non-wetting, dis- persed phase appeared toplay very little role inthe process, at least when itwas the more viscous ofthe two.\" (4, p.405) This was illustrated inchambers 7and 8where the system which demixed more rapidly had the higher dispersed phase viscosity and lower suspending phase viscosity. Chambersize became critical later inthe demixing process, when domain size became significant with respect tothe chamber dimen- sions. \"Chambers 4,5and 8contained the same system had different aspect ratios. Inone g, chamber 5(1.9 cmheight x 1.57 most rapidly inthe latter stages. This occurred because locally the domains grew atthe same nominal rate inall three chambers. Asthe thickness ofthe wetting layer contacting the wall increased[,] the interior D-rich phase collected and in- dividual regions increased insize, accumulating into asingle central 'yoke'. than inthe non-cubical geometries because the linear dimensions through which the interior regions had togrow before interacting were minimized inthis shape.\" (4, p.405) ofvolume tigated. Itwas reported that, the material \"...in viscosity, wall wetting phase dominated involume fraction[,] demixed faster than that inwhich the more viscous interior phase was atthe higher volume ratio.\" <Note: Itisnot clear from the available references what the lower &higher vis- cous materials were.> (4, p.405) This result was under low-gravity conditions. Inspace, this type ofsystem 1-102 demixed faster than one with aI:I ratio. OnEarth, the I:i ratio sample separated faster than any other system. \"Again it would seem that the thickness and viscosity ofthe phase incon- tact with the walls can berate limiting. Whatever the mechanism bywhich the domains ofinterior phase accumulate into asingle central volume, viscous dissipation inthe suspending medium evi- dently plays animportant role.\" (4, p.405) Plots of acharacteristic dimension vs. time were constructed for quantitative analysis (see Reference (4) for analysis details). Alog-log plot ofthis data revealed alinear depen- dence ofaverage domain size with demixing time. Results from a single (earlier) STS-023 experiment ,,...supported acoalescence mechanism, based largely onthe increased rate seen when the in- terior phase was atahigher volume concentration than the [wall] wetting phase. This was interpreted asproducing an increased collision frequency and coalescence rate between interior drops. That result was not repeated during multiple experiments onSTS- 26... perhaps due toheating artifacts inthe original experi- ment. Hence, although the viscosity dependencies suggest that the viscous dissipation inthe continuous, wetting isa strong determinant wecan asyet operating.\" (4, p.406) Itwas also reported that \"STS-26 were somewhat com- promised bysmall accelerations (evidenced byslow [mixing] ball movement...) the unexpected experimental temperature and lack of an expected photo showing the completely demixed state of the unit.\" (4, p.406) Key Words: Biotechnology, Phase Partitioning, Phase Separation, Vis- cosity, Biological Cells,Acceleration Effects, Thermal Environ- ment More Extreme than Predicted, Contained Fluids, Liquid Crys- tals NumberofSamples: eighteen SampleMaterials: See above 3,Reference (4)] were chosen to reproduce and augment...

The specific contents ofthe facility are unclear based onReferences (I) and (2). It appears that the temperature controlled con- tainer housed six helix chambers_]_d either (i) acapillary fu- sion or (2) aPlexiglas _'\"control vessel holding non- fused protoplast mixture. Reference (3) indicates that the module was improved post TEXUS iitoallow movement ofthe Zimmer- mann, TEXUS ii). The specific objectives ofthe research were similar tothose outlined under Zimmermann, TEXUS ii. While Reference (i) indicates that the TEXUS 13experimental setup was very similar tothe TEXUS iisetup, Reference (2) indi- cates that asomewhat different setup was used. For example, Reference (i) indicates that the fusion process took place inthe TEXUS experiment module TEM 06-5 which held six temperature- controlled helix chambers and one capillary chamber. The cell fu- sion inthe capillary chamber was observedvia amicroscope lens and documented byatelevision camera. The camera image was transmitted tothe ground during flight. Incontrast, Reference (2) indicates that the fusion process took place insix chambers, but nomention ismade ofthe capillary chamber. Instead, the reference details aPlexiglas TMcontrol vessel which held the protoplast mixture but did not electrically fuse the material. Although the field intensity and frequency ofthe current during dielectrophoresis was different from that ofTEXUS ii (here 300 V/cm, 2MHz), the rest ofthe experimental fusion conditions were 1-108 similar tothose employed onTEXUS Ii. New ground-based hardware, which had not been available during the earlier TEXUS iiflight, allowed identical, parallel, flight/ground experiments tobeper- formed. Post-flight, the protoplasts were placed onselection media so the cell wall could regenerate. However, areversion ofthe genetic marker ofone fusion partner resulted in\"...a definite background growth ofregenerating yeast protoplasts onthe Petri dishes that were ready for evaluation.\" (i, p.35 (translation)) Therefore, acount ofthe fusion products was impossible.

Aground-based experimental module similarly processed cell preparations from the same protoplast and cell batches as had been placed inthe rocket. <Note: Further details ofthe specific processing procedures for each of the helix chambers were presented intable form (see Reference (2), p.i00).> i.Yeast Protoplasts ofthe nine indi- cated that the absolute yield ofyeast hybrids produced during the TEXUS 14b experiment was much higher than previous TEXUS ex- periments. This higher yield was attributed to\"...the develop- ment of suitable preliminary incubation media, to keep the 'fusiogenity' ofthe cells constant for more than 24hours.\" (2, p.i01 (translation)) Analysis showed, however, that itwas not possible todetermine the exact increase inrelative hybrid yield under low-gravity conditions, due tothe followingconditions: fusions experiment have led tostatis- tical fluctuations yield .... Possibly, the rela- tively brief _gphase, considering the biological variability, is responsible for this. \"2. Analysis furthermore showed that temperature changes did ap- pear inthe chambers. The heating of the chambers was ac- complished byvirtue ofthe output introduction ofthe electrical fields that were applied and insufficient heat evacuation. Be- 1-114 sides, transition resistances onthe sliding contacts presumably led todifferences inthe voltage supply ofthe chambers and thus to fluctuations inthe yields within comparable fusion cham- bers .... With all due scientific caution, one can ofcourse say that onthe basis ofthese experiments that the hybrid yield was increased under _gconditions.\" (2, p.102 (translation)) <Note: More detailed results ofthese electrofusion experiments were not presented.> 2.Mammalian Cell Results Post-flight of the mammalian cell electrofusion indi- cated that alarge degree ofmultiple fusion had occurred when compared tothe control (l-g) experiments. Itwas reported that the presence ofmultiple fusion could indicate that \"...the melt- ing process ofthe (boundary surfaces) isaltered inadielectrophoretically arranged cell.\" (2, p. i00 (translation)) When these results were compared to extensive post-flight ground experiments, the following conclu- sions were reached: (i) \"The hybrid yield decreases drastically in[the] case of longer storage time inweak conducting solutions. Because of this decline, flight and ground experiments must be performed simultaneously.\" (2, p.i00 (translation)) (2) \"The appearance ofmultiple fusion could possibly betraced back indirectly toanintracellular ATP (and/or calcium level?) which was altered under _g conditions.\" (2, p. i01 (translation)) ChangesinATP and/or calcium can alter membrane fluidity and the mixing ofthe membrane components (fluidity and mixing are afunction ofgravity levels). (3) \"Under terrestrial conditions, the probability ofthe fusion ofacell pair within achain isconstant sothat one can explain that, inspite of differing cell length, fusion takes place preferably between two (and, to alesser extent, three) cells .... \"(2, p. I01 (translation)) Therefore, since multiple fusion ispresent, itmust beassumed that this law isnot valid under low-gravity (4) Inorder toprove that low-gravity conditions influence the electrofusion process, \"...the simultaneous investigation ofthe fusion products and fusion yield aswell asthe determination of the hybrid yield...\" isrequired. 1-115 <Note: electrical transfection portion ofthe experiment. Although, for technical reasons, optimum conditions for this work could not beachieved, itwas still shown that anincrease inthe yield ofstable trans- formants (by one order ofmagnitude) could berealized.

Electrofusion ofMammalian Cells The fusion place rotary-seated helical chambers: three containing low conductive (LCM) and three containing high conductive medium (HCM). \"The fusion was performed during the low-gravity phase ofthe rocket's trajectory using programmed electrical field conditions as follows: dielectrophoretic alignment was performed by application of an alternating current with field strength of 250 V/cm atafrequency of2MHz applied for 30 seconds pre- and post-fusion pulse administration. The alignment field was switched off for 5msbefore and after each pulse to prevent current flow through the permeabilized [sic] cells .... Fusion was achieved byapplication of2.25 kV/cm of15_sat1second intervals. The ground-based experiments malian cell fusion experiments indicated that the reduced gravity hybrid yields were greater byafactor slightly greater than 2 over the l-g experiments. This was true for both the low and high conducting mediums. Itwas also evident that the efficiency ofhybrid generation was greater for the HCM (for both l-g and low-gravity conditions). Analysis of\"control\" chambers onboard the sounding rocket which were not exposed tothe electric fields indicated that \"...the frequency ofspontaneous fusion inthis system was zero.\" (i, p.7) Because the cells had been incubated intheir respective media (a) 3.0 hours prior towhen the fusion actually took place (during launch operations) and (b) 1.5 hours after fusion was complete (during rocket recovery operations), subsequent ground- based experiments were performed todetermine the effect ofthe extended incubation time onthe cell viability the LCM supplemented with 4.0 mMpotassium acetate.

The investigators determined that 3 min ofthe increased gravity would not result inany significant, additional sedimentation ofthe cells. The samples stored on Earth, therefore, were not subjected toanidentical launch ac- celeration profile. Also, the bags containing platelets were specifically oriented inthe IBSE hardware sothat the prelaunch 1-121 and launch ofthe bags. This orientation minimized the number ofcells which would come incontact with the \"lower\" boundaries ofthe bag during the period ofincreased acceleration. \"Launch also subjected the mid-deck lockers inthe orbiter toa vibration environment that was not experienced by the lockers stored onEarth. The IBSE module was designed tofloat ina block ofPyrell... foam that fully filled the space between the module and the interior walls ofthe locker. The launch vibra- tions felt bythe IBSE hardware were, therefore, significantly attenuated. The random vibration level during launch begins at 20Hzand isatits highest levels of0.04 g_/Hz between 150 and I000 Hz. The first mode, isolated frequency ofthe IBSE, within the foam, inany direction, trans- missibility at150 Hzisabout Asaresult, the vibration levels experienced by the IBSE spaceflight hardware and blood samples were extremely low. Noadditional effort was expended to either reduce further the vibration levels experienced by the blood samples on board the orbiter or to subject the blood samples stored on Earth toasimilar transient, vibration en- vironment.,, (i) Samples within the STS IBSE modules were carefully compared to identically controlled sets ofblood cells contained onthe ground. Toeliminate bias, blind assignment was used toallocate blood cell samples tothe low-g and l-g experiments. Toassure blind assessment ofthe experimental findings, post-experiment samples for measurement were identified only incode. Toop- timize the chances ofdetecting possible gravitational effects, a array ofmeasurements ofcellular, function, morphology, me- tabolism, and immunology were made. Analysis ofvariance was used inanalyzing the data. Reportedly, \"The most striking result was the finding that platelets displayed markedly superior structural and functional integrity atmicrogravity. Granulocytes held onthe ground were preserved slightly better than those that orbited inthe shuttle, whereas red cells displayed few effects that were attributable to the gravitational variable.

The cell type chosen was chameleon skin, suspended in amphibian Ringer's solution, and stimulated with 1-128 melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH).\" (4, p.i)) The goals ofthe experiment included determining \"(a) how long... the [chameleon] skin [can] bestored and still retain ahormone response; (b) long.., melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) [can] be stored; (c) [if]... skin can be fixed by diffusion-driven processes (without active injection of solutions); and (d) 1(two experiments, Chapter i)). While most ofthe investigative teams (including this one) used the MDA toconduct aliquid-liquid or liquid-solid diffusion study (ii experiments), the apparatus was also used to(a) determine the role offluid physics onthe for- mation offilms and the casting ofmembranes (five experiments) and (b) determine the effect ofre-entry loads onterrestrial- grown crystals (one experiment). The MDA was fashioned (in part) from two blocks of inert material. Each block had over i00 sample wells strategically drilled into its surface. Awell was capable ofholding 100-500 mloffluid. After all ofthe wells had been filled with the ap- propriate sample materials (depending oneach investigator's specific objectives), the blocks were joined together. Twice during the mission, the upper block moved relative tothe bottom block. Each movement ofthe block either (a) aligned or (b) misaligned wells onthe top block with wells onthe bottom. When the wells were aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could take place. When the wells were not aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could not take place. Appropriate positioning ofthe wells onthe top block to those onthe used exclusively byCassanto for aprotein crystal stability experiment which investigated the effect of re-entry loads on terrestrial-grown crystals (see Cassanto, Consort i). The \"Type 2\"and wells were either the liquid-liquid orliquid-solid diffusion experiments. The \"Type 4\"test wells were used exclusively for the film formation and membrane casting experiments with one data point. The well-type used three sample wells. <Note: itappears that one of these sample wells was inthe top block and two ofthe sample wells were inthe bottom block.> Reportedly, the wells inthe bottom block ofeach well type were filled prior toflight either(i) buffer dye p. 3)), (2) melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and RAB (pink in color), or(3) glutaraldehyde (clear). Thirty minutes prior toloading the upper block, the flank skin was removed from chameleon lizards. The skin was then floated on RAB inapetri dish until itcould becut into small-sized pieces (15 mm). Green sections ofskin were loaded into the upper wells. These upper wells were then \"...filled with RAB taking careto expel all air.', (4, p. 4) The blocks were joined together such that the wells inthe upper block were purposely misaligned with the wells inthe lower block. This prevented materials within the wells from coming into contact prior tothe initiation ofthe experiment. Once the rocket had been launched and the low-gravity phase had been achieved, amotor and cam mechanism moved the upper block to the right, aligning the skin/RAB wells with one ofthe three solutions contained inthe bottom wells. Once the wells were in contact, material diffusion was realized across the liquid-liquid interface. Just prior tothe termination ofthe low-gravity phase, the upper block again moved tothe right, aligning the well (which originally contained only the skin/RAB mixture) with another well onthe lower block (which contained glutaraldehyde tostop the reaction). The fluids inthese wells remained in contact throughout the re-entry period ofthe rocket. Three ground-based control experiments were performed for com- parative purposes. One ground experiment was performed atnearly the same time asthe flight experiment and used chameleon skin tissue from the \"same pool.\" The other two ground experiments were performed toinvestigate how long the skin tissue could be held and still retain MSH responsiveness. \"The first was started about 12-h before the true control (to test for an extended tissue hold ifthe rocket launch were [sic] tobepostponed) while the second was started 16hafter the true control (to test for responsiveness inamuch fresher tissue).,, (4, p.4) <Editor's Note: Presumably the \"true control,, was the ground- based control experiment which was performed atnearly the same time asthe Consort1flight.> 1-130 The procedure for these ground-control experiments was somewhat different than the actual Consort1flight (see 4,p.5). Post-flight evaluation ofthe operation ofthe MDA indicated that the moved asexpected allowing diffusion totake place inthe \"Type 3\"test wells. Examination ofthe contents ofeach well associated with the Con- sort experiment was initiated about 6hours after the flight. Lengthy descriptions ofthe flight and ground-control wells were presented inReference (4). The following comments/conclusions were made: \"(a) About three-quarters [of] the wells used were compromised orcontamination problems. \"(b) This resulted inalimited [number of]replicates ineach treatment group, tothe point where noabsolute can be made regarding responsiveness ofthe tissues inmicrogravity. itwould by gratuitous donation ofunwanted fluids .... \"(e) Ground based control experiments established that: \"(I) Chameleons killed atT-36 hretained their green color but avery muted response toMSH stimulation. \"(2) MSH prepared atT-48 hand tested ata500-fold level above that needed for minimal levels of MSH stimulation adequately stimulated color change atthe time offlight. Ex- periments are under way toestablish hretained toMSH stimulation. \"(4) Chameleons killed atT-12 halso retained their green .... ,'(f) Flight experiments can besummarized asfollows: \"(i) Tissues that were moved atthe start were situated over anequal volume of30% glutaral- dehyde and held there for the six minute flight were still green and contained sufficient (0.6-5%) glutaraldehyde by the end of the period sothat fixation should have been achieved. The geometry ofthe chamber issuch that the important unknown is where the tissue was relative tothe interface, ashighest fixa- 1-131 tive concentrations at the earliest times would have been achieved atthe interface. Because the MDA was installed sothat the g-force ofspin vector was oriented tomove tissues away from the interface, it is likely that the tissues were at the peripheral end ofthe chamber. Some microscopic characterization has been done, with the interpretation difficult. The tissue was still intact after launch and at the point of entry into microgravity. Many morphological details look ok but doubts remain about the others. \"(2) Tissues that were moved atthe start ofmicrogravity so that they were situated over an equal volume of amphibian Ringer's solution (no MSH), held there for six minutes and then moved toanequal volume of20% glutaraldehyde were recovered as amixture ofgreen and brown.

[the wells inthis experiment] that caused the color change; [2] microgravity experience results inamovement ofmelanosomes in the tissue that causes color change independent ofMSH; or [3] very high glutaraldehyde concentrations cause artifacts with regard to color changes.

The MDA was fashioned (in part) from two Teflon TMblocks. Each block had over i00 sample wells strategically drilled into its surface. Awell was capable ofholding 100-500 mlof fluid. After all of the wells had been filled with the appropriate sample materials (depending oneach investigator,s specific objectives), the blocks were joined together. Twice during the mission, the upper block moved relative tothe bottom block. Each movement ofthe block either (a) aligned or (b) misaligned wells onthe top block with wells onthe bottom.

The \"Type 4\"test wells were used exclusively for the film formation and membrane casting experiments (see Pellegrino, Consorti;Vera, Consort i). This experiment was allotted two ofthis specific well-type isdetailed here. 1-136 Each \"Type 3\"test well provided the investigator with one ex- perimental opportunity. The well-type used three sample wells, two inthe top block and one inthe bottom block. Thirty-six hours prior tothe rocket launch, the well inthe lower block of each well-type was filled with solubilized collagen. Twelve hours later, one upper well ofeach well-type was filled with initiation buffer and the second upper well ofeach well-type was filled with 2%glutaraldehyde fixative. The long delay inthe filling ofthe upper and lower wells \"...was primarily due tothe relatively large number of wells that had to be precisely loaded.\" (i, p.3) Reportedly, the fluids used inthe investigation were chosen to match the opportunities/restraints of the Consort 1rocket and the MDA. \"Early\" sample loading ofthe MDA (24-48 hours prior to launch), processing temperature ofthe samples (approximately 22 \u00b0C), high gloads experienced b_ the vehicle during takeoff and landing (up to 20g's) ,i0 -10-6g low-gravity duration (approximately 7minutes), and \"late\" retrieval of samples (approximately 4hours post-flight) limited fluid selection and investigative objectives. Prior tothe rocket flight, the blocks were joined together such that the wells inthe upper block were purposely misaligned with the wells inthe lower block. This prevented materials within the wells from coming into contact prior tothe initiation ofthe experiment. Once the rocket had been launched and the low- gravity phase had been achieved, amotor and cam mechanism moved the upper block tothe right, aligning the wells containing liq- uid solubilized collagen and the initiation buffer. Once the wells were incontact, material diffusion was realized across the liquid-liquid interface. Just prior tothe termination ofthe low-gravity phase, the upper block again moved tothe right, aligning the well which originally contained only solubilized collagen (but now contained amixture ofsolubilized collagen and buffer) with the well containing the liquid glutaraldehyde fixa- tive. These wells remained incontact throughout the ofthe rocket. Post-flight evaluation ofthe operation ofthe MDA indicated that the upper moved asexpected allowing diffusion totake place inthe \"Type 3\"test wells. Although itwas reported that minor fluid leakage inthe top and bottom blocks ofthe MDA resulted incontamination ofsome ofthe test wells allotted 17investigations, itwas not clear ifthis particular ex- periment was affected bythe contamination. Post-flight analysis ofthe contents ofthe wells was performed. Reportedly, \"Because ofsteep concentration gradients across the interface ofthe precursor and initiator solutions, diffusion was 1-137 expected tooccur atrelatively high rates. High rates ofdiffu- sion were essential to maximize the amount of material polymerized fibers toremain inthe precursor well since fibers would exhibit very high molecular weights and thus would not dif- fuse away from the assembly location. \"As expected, plugs ofcollagen.., materials.., were localized to the well originally containing the precursor solutions. Plugs extended toapproximately half ofthe 16-mm depth suggesting that this was the depth reached by diffusion initiator components. The plugs ofmaterial most importantly, were ofsufficient size and quality topermit subsequent analysis steps .... Since the plugs have depths that are quite large compared tofiber lengths, animportant series ofquestions can beaddressed. These ques- tions relate to the diffusion distances supported by these periods ofhigh quality low gravity and toany intrinsic effect that diffusion may have onthe polymerization process inthese sensitive reactions.\" (3, p.6) Gross observations ofthe opacity ofthe collagen indicated that significant assembly of the three-dimensional lattice had oc- curred(the assembly did not appear tobecomplete). Itwas further noted that: (i) mixing was dependent upon small convective forces induced by positioning reactants adjacent toeach other (2) diffusion accounted for the remaining interfacial mixing (3) the collagen materials, soformed vary from those prepared in ground control experiments.

The MDA was fashioned (in part) from two blocks of inert material. Each block had over i00 sample wells strategically drilled into its surface. Awell was capable ofholding 100-500 mloffluid. After all ofthe wells had been filled with the ap- propriate sample materials (depending oneach investigator,s specific objectives), the blocks were joined together. Twice during the mission, the upper block moved relative tothe bottom block. Each movement ofthe block either (a) aligned or (b) misaligned wells onthe top block with wells onthe bottom. When the wells were aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could take place. When the wells were not aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could not take place.

Each capillary tube module contained (i)three capillary tubes(of graduated sizes) and (2) afluid reservoir (composedof aforce-free bladder).

(All fluids used for this experiment contained acoloring agent for photographic contrast.) The valve inthe capillary wick module was opened first. Little ornowicking action was observed inthe module for more than 2.5 hours. Atthis time, itwas necessary tomove the module. The agitation from this movement apparently initiated some minor wicking action. Several days later, the capillary tube modules were activated. However, nocapillary action was observed aneffort tofind the cause for such alack ofaction, the crew discovered evidence of fluid leakage from the reser- voirs .... ,,(4, p.85) Apparently, this leakage occurred prior to the beginning ofthe experiment. \"The loss [of fluid] could have been caused byvibrations ofthe Saturn [rocket] during launch or bythe excessive temperatures and reduced pressure [resulting in aboiling ofthe Reference Surface Tension, Wetting ofContainer, Wetting Agent, Liquid Reservoir, Liquid Transfer, Liquid/Gas Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Liquid Leakage, Thermal Environment More Extreme Than Predicted, Rocket Motion, Liquid Vibration, Boiling, Gas Pres- sure, Rocket Vibration, Processing Difficulties NumberofSamples: nine capillary tubes Sample Materials: Fluid reservoirs ofthe applications ofthis experiment include (i) substantiat- ing theoretical capillary rise fluid flow models with experimen- tal data, and (2) understanding and predicting fluid behavior un- der low-gravity conditions (e.g., rocket propellant motion).

Foams collapse primarily asaresult ofthe gravity-induced drainage of liquid inthe bubble walls. As the liquid drains from the bubble, the film walls become increasingly thin until, ata thickness ofapproximately i0nanometers (i00 angstroms), they are ruptured by random molecular motion. Thus, the foam gradually dissipates asmore ofthe liquid drains away tobulk form and leaves less tosupport the bubble walls. environment there- fore, alonger lasting foam isprovided. Drainage, however, is only one of the mechanisms contributing to the dissipation of foams. Evaporation and liquid spreading also act todissipate bubble walls. Thus, the full extent offoam stability isstill uncertain. \"Forming afoam inspace yields avery large surface area-to- ratio ofthe liquid that should beretained for arela- tively long period. This large, stable surface area should enable surface-sensitive chemical reactions tooccur differently than they would onEarth.

(Thymol blue ofpH2.8 will turn from brown topink when foamed byshaking.) During the ASTP experiment, acrew member shook the tubes and the resulting pink foams were recorded onmotion picture film. The contrast ofthe brightly colored pink foam against the gold bulk solution was clearly visible tothe crewman asthe foam dis- sipated. Itwas reported that (a) the foams created under low-gravity con- ditions were very stable while those foams created onEarth col- lapsed within afew seconds, and (b) because the \"...16 mil- limeter motion picture was out offocus, detailed knowledge of the foam dissipation [time] inthe pink foam has not been deter- mined.\"(3, p.31-4) Noother results from this experiment were Words: Capillarity, Foams, Foam Stability, Aqueous Solutions, Reactant Solutions, Liquid Mixing, Bubbles, Bubble Dispersion, Surface Tension, Liquid Spreading, Thin Films, Fluid Drainage, Interface Physics, Evaporation, ContainedFluids, Liquid/Gas Dis- persion, SampleMaterials: ,'Foams From:NASA Kennedy PayloadType:science ASTP Manned Environment Processing Wicks attached (Teflon _\u00a2*) base plate .

These calculations cannot bedirectly applied torealis- tic cloth ormetal-fabric wicks which have variable properties. This ASTP science Demonstration Experiment was designed toinves- tigate capillary wicking under low-gravity conditions. The specific objective ofthe investigation was todetermine the wicking rates and efficiency offluid transfer ofwicks used for fluid management inspacecraft. Four identical wicking assemblies were used during the experi- ment. Each assembly contained three stainless steel wicks and one nylon wick. The stainless steel wicks differed intheir weave and mesh size: (i) 325 by2300 Dutch twill weave, (2) 200 by200 plain weave, and (3) 200 by600 Plain Dutch weave; the nylon wick was included for comparison. The wicking fluid ofone ormore ofthe assemblies was awater-soap solution and the wick- ing fluid ofthe remaining assemblies was silicone oil.

The specific objective ofthe experi- ment was toobserve the rise ofwater incapillary tubes ina reduced gravity environment. Itwas expected that this study of capillarity would also lead toabetter understanding ofwettingkinetics. The experiment was performed inthe TEM 06Liquid Module.

Research related tothe TEXUS experiment was also performed on Earth in asimulated weightlessness liquid/liquid system. The system employed two immiscible liquids ofthe same density, ina Plateau setup. Wetting kinetic experiments with model tubes of different geometries were performed to (i) study the flow be- havior atand near the interface and (2) prepare for the TEXUS experiment scenario. Reportedly, \"The evaluation ofexperiments with liquid-liquid systems shows that in connection with transport processes interfaces are very stable. Furthermore, menisci in cylindrical and conical tubes.., are of almost hemisperical shape like those incapillary hydrostatics. Merely insinusoidally shaped tubes strongly deformed menisci occur at 2-21 the bottlenecks.\" (5, p.583) \"Experiments performed within the framework of the TEXUS programme with tubes ofthe same geometry demonstrate that in case oftransport processes the interfaces ofliquid-liquid sys- tems are less stable, already inround tubes there exist strongly deformed menisci.

The specific objectives ofthe experiment were to(i) study the capillary properties ofa silicone oil liquid zone held axisymetrically between two end plates, (2) investigate (in particular) the low-gravity formation and properties ofthe thin films forming between the contacting solid and liquid and (3) examine the stability ofthe zone. The Spacelab Fluid Physics Module was configured such that a large liquid zone ofsilicone oil could besuspended between (i) ai0cmdiameter titanium plate shaped asashallow cone, and (2) a3cm diameter plate of aluminum. (The outer edge of the titanium plate had been treated with ananti-wetting agent.) It was noted that \"By adjusting the separation and the volume ofthe liquid, conditions may beobtained whereby anouter annulus of the cone plate holds aspread film ofliquid inequilibrium with the liquid zone. Thus the negative capillary pressure balances the positive disjoining pressure ofthe thin film.\" p.i0) environment, low capillary pressures can becreated which allow the cor- responding spread film tobecome.., much thicker than (I, p.9) Prior tothe flight, Laplace's capillary equation was used to calculate the theoretical shapes and stability properties ofthe axisymmetric zones. One interesting fact that the analysis indi- cated was that aspreading film would form if\"...the angle of contact ofthe zone with the large end plate reached the cone angle before the radius limit ofthe outer edge ofthe plate.\" (i, p. i0) (Further details concerning the analysis were presented inReference (i).) Itappears that the liquid zones were created during the mission byinjecting silicone oil through ahole inthe titanium plate towards the smaller aluminum plate. A16mmVinten Camera Mark B was used to record the resulting liquid zone shape and film thickness. During the two experimental runs, voice contact be- tween the ground investigative crew and the payload specialist operating the equipment was available. During the first experiment run \"...the silicon oil overspread the small end plate and wetted completely aplastic backing plate of3cmradius (situated immediately behind the 1.5 cmradius aluminum plate). Examination ofthe photographic record... showed that the plate was wetted very quickly and that either due toinertia within the liquid ortoimposed wetting movement, the 28[degree] advancing contact angle ofsilicon oil onthe an- tispread was exceeded and unwanted wetting took place .... [I]t isabundantly clear that the overwetting was caused byoperations and not byantispread failure.\" (i, p. Ii) After the anomaly, \"new settings for the zone\" (presumably new injection procedures) were uplinked tothe crewman operating the experiment. <Note: It appears tothe editors that during the remainder ofthe run, six different liquid zones were examined.> Each ofthese zones had a slightly different separation length and zone volume. The shapes ofthese zones were compared tothe predicted theoretical shapes. For all ofthese six Spacelab zones, awell-defined wetting film appears tohave been formed. Further, the liquid zones were also well defined and had aLaplace shape. Itwas reported that during the examination ofone ofthe zones \"...a I00 vD.C. potential was applied between the end plates.', (i, p.12) A brief note inthe introductory abstract ofReference indi- cated that the \"electrical showed also reported that \"During the 20second lapse ofeach experiment no measurable perturbations tozone shape, contact angle or film thickness was detected.\" (i, p.12) Reference (I) indicated that some ofthe data had not yet been analyzed for three ofthe more interesting zones. Reference (i) did report that the capillar_ pressures ofthese three zones were -0.34, -0.24, and -0.40 N/m .Itwas further reported that al- 2-38 though these pressures were small asexpected, they \"...were still too large toobtain films ofsufficient thickness.\" (i, p. 12) Because ofthe experience gained during the first run, the second experimental run was much more successful. \"The small end plate had been cleaned and the edges retreated with antispread material during the flight.\" (i, p.12) During this second run, nine dif- ferent liquid zones were examined. Each ofthese zones had a slightly different plate separation length and zone volume. (The cap_llary pressures ofthe zones were between -0.08 and -0.909 N/m_,the pressures were between 0.01 and 0.08 N/m_.) One ofthe zones created during the later part ofthe run had a wel_ -0.72 N/m ). Itwas reported with thicker films did not correlate aswell tothe predicted shapes. \"Afurther feature ofsome... [of created during Run 2] was that athickening ofthe zone itself was detected inthe region where the liquid zone approached the wetting film.\" (i, p. 13) During the last portion ofthe second experimental run, alarge liquid bridge was broken at the expected separation distance. The rupture ofthis Spacelab bridge occurred much more rapidly (0.25 to0.3 seconds) than did rupture ofacorrespondingly sized bridge created onEarth inaPlateau tank (several seconds). Post-flight analysis ofthe exposed film (see Reference (I) for details) led tothe following conclusions: (i) The disjointing pressures achieved under low-gravity condi- tions were much lower than possible onEarth. (2) The thickness ofthe liquid film under low-gravity conditions was much greater than expected. (3) At lower capillary pressures, very thick liquid films were obtained. Athigher pressures, the films were thin. (4) The breakage ofthe liquid bridge (second experimental run) was much faster than observed onEarth.

During the earlier Spacelab 1experiment, \"...it was discovered that very low capillary pressures ofazone incontact with a liquid film were achieved. Atthese low pressures (0.01 N/m...2) the corresponding wetting layer appeared tobeexcessively thick, that isupto0.2 mm. However the scarce data and the associated problems inproving equilibrium led tothe need to obtain much more and better refined data inasecond flight experiment.\" (2, p.251) The objectives ofthis study were to (i) study the capillary properties ofasilicone oil liquid zone held axisymetrically be- tween two end plates, (2) investigate the low gravity formation and properties ofthe thin films (at even lower capillary pres- sures than had been realized onSpacelab i)which form between the contacting solid (titanium plate) and liquid (silicone oil), (3) create and investigate wetting layers which were inequi- librium with axisymmetric Laplace zones, (4) investigate vibra- tion and rotation effects on Laplace zones and wetting layers, and (5) quantitatively confirm the stability increase ofaliquid zone caused byvibration. \"The theoretical shapes of zones at equilibrium between endplates... [were] derived from numerical solutions ofLaplace's capillary equation .... For each combination of[zone] volume and [plate] separation, there isusually two Laplace shapes, one of which isstable and the other unstable. Afurther small group 2-41 are those with aunique shape and these are the ones reached when azone iscritically stable (i.e. the two points merge) and the zone breaks.\" (2, p.252) During the Spacelab D1mission, liquid zones were created between two axisymmetric end plates. \"The large end plate... [was] cone shaped with adiameter ofI00 mmand acone oftitanium. Unlikethe... [Spacelab i]end plate this one was made with sharp edges and all non wetted surfaces were treated with alayer ofsuitable an- tispread material. This cone endplate was mounted atthe rear end ofthe Fluid Physics Module .... The small endplate, mounted atth [sic] front end, was fed with liquid through arosette of five small hole [sic] inits surface connecting toasyringe which had adelivery accuracy of+or-0.02 cc. \"The small end plate was flat, of30mmdiameter and made of aluminum. The edges ofthe wetted surfaces were again sharp and the rear side and supporting surfaces treated with antispread coating. Silicone oil (viscosity 5cs) was used for all experi- ments and notracers were added. The density ofthe silicone oil was given as0.93 g/cc and surface tension asi0mN/m.\" (2, p.252) The experiment runs were photographed using a16mm Vinten camera. The camera usually operated insingle frame mode except when the liquid began torupture. Atthe initiation ofrupture, the camera instantly changed tocine mode. The experimental sequence included (i) \"...adjusting the volume of silicone oil and the distance of separation so that a predetermined series of shapes with and without wetting films were produced, hopefully atstable equilibrium .... \"(2, p.253), (2) later rotating the cone plate alone, orboth endplates at5 rpm (rotation ofthe cone plate orboth plates was not performed for all the zones), and (3) vibrating the cone plate atan amplitude of0.2 mmand afrequency of1.9 Hz. Three experimental conditions were examined during this study: (i) liquid zones which were very nearly catenoid shaped and without awetting film or stimulation (to study liquid zone properties), (2) liquid zones with awetting film onthe cone plate surface (to study properties of wetting films), and (3) liquid zones stimulated byrotation and axial vibration (to study stability of liquid zones). The results from the above condi- tions are reported below: 2-42 Near Catenoid Zones: During the first experimental run, five zones were created. Each ofthese zones had aslightly different liquid volume and plate separation distance. \"The settings were arranged so that all shapes would be stable and have the shape of \"perfect\" catenoids .... \"(2, p. 253) (The capillary ranged between -0.013 and +0.032 N/m_.) One ofthe experimental zone shapes was compared tothe expected theoretical shape. \"It isseen that there isexcellent agreement between the experimental and theoretical data indicating that the methods ofmeasurement and ofdata analysis were working satis- factorily.\" (2, p.253) During the run, one ofthe five zones broke. ,'...the zone was broken.., first atconstant separation byreducing the zone volume and then, after repairing the zone, bystretching the zone atconstant volume. Within experimental error, the zone broke atthe theoretical ineach experi- ment.\" (2, p.253) Properties ofWetting Layers: \"It was found that when zones were created with small volumes and small separation distances, the liquid partitioned itself between the Laplace zone and anewly formed wetting layer onthe cone's angle ofcontact ofthe liquid atthe cone's surface, reaching its limiting value. Inthis case the liquid did not recede from the cone's surface and sothe angle reached was assumed tobethat ofthe cone (i0 deg.). (2, p.254) Reportedly, due toflight delays, only two data points for this part ofthe study could beobtained. <Note: More details of the wetting film results are included in Reference (2).> Rotational and Vibrational Stimulation ofZones: The first run ofthis portion ofthe experiment yielded three points onthe stability diagram. However, \"...the repeat of these points and the addition of[asecond run data points] were unrecorded because ofmajor camera failure. The precise separa- tion distances atrupture, determined under stimulation, were re- corded both manually and onthe data logging system thereby saving the essential part ofthe experiment.\" (2, p.254) Itwas reported that both monorotation (rotation ofcone plate only) and isorotation (rotation ofboth end plates) did not visibly change the zone shape. However, theoretical calculations (Laplace equation) did predict aslight shape change. Induced axial vibration did not induce harmonic wave movement and apparently increased the stability ofthe zone. 2-43 Rupture ofthe liquid zones was also analyzed during these ex- periments. Itwas reported that rupture occurs infour steps: (i) Aseries of unstable equilibrium Laplace shapes with con- tinuously decreasing neck size. (2) Liquid cascading through aseries ofnon-Laplace shapes (still axisymmetric) with liquid at each end plate being pyramidal and connected byathin column. (3) Rupture occurring rapidly attwo places inthe thin column. The column becomes asatellite drop and liquid atend plates relaxes tospherical drop shape. (4) Satellite rebounds between liquid/air surfaces, but not penetrating these surfaces.

The primary goal ofthe experiment was to establish along, cylindrical column offluid inaminimum amount oftime. The TEXUSi0experiment was performed inthe TEM 06-9Liquid Column Cell.The apparatus contained two aluminum disks between which asilicone oilbridge(zone) could becreated. Each disk was 30mmindiameter with its lateral sides (5mm) cut back to 45\u00b0toincrease its anchoring capability. Because fluid spillage while attempting tocreate aliquid bridge isirreversible, asmooth, progressive, bridge-building approach was planned. The zones were tobeestablished bythe injection of liquid through one disk. The maximum zone length achievable was 82mm, and the length could bebuilt upatten different speeds (by adjusting axial separation ofdisks During the experiment from starting: \"...a mechanical problem inthe drive motor prevented itfrom functioning properly .... ,,(i, p. 324).

Ifthe bridge can becreated quickly, sufficient time would be available for meaningful investigation. This TEXUS 12experiment was the (see DaRiva, Spacelab i; Martinez, TEXUS i0 (both in this chapter)). The primary objectives ofthe study were to (I) establish aliquid bridge inaminimum amount oftime and (2) ob- serve several bridge properties. Asecondary objective ofthe experiment was totest experimental concepts tobeused during future STS Spacelab mission experiments. The TEXUS 12experiment was performed inthe TEM 06-9 Liquid ColumnCell.The apparatus contained two aluminum disks between which asilicone oil bridge (zone) was created. Each disk was 30 mmindiameter with its lateral sides (5mm) cut back to45\u00b0to increase its anchoring capability. The zones were established by the injection of liquid through one disk. The maximum zone length achievable was 82mm, and the length could bebuilt upat ten different speeds (by adjusting axial separation ofdisks and simultaneous injection offluid). zone was possible by an 80 x120 mm lit field equipped with amillimeter rastar. The experimental process was filmed using a16mmcine camera at20frames/sec. Three ,,stretchings\" ofliquid bridge zones were achieved during the rocket experiment. During each ofthese stretchings (i) the liquid bridge was expanded from 4mmto82mmand (2) the bridge formation speed was either 2mm/s (stretch #i), 4mm/s (stretch #2) or6mm/s (stretch #3). Itwas reported that the column behaved asexpected during the first stretching with aperfectly cylindrical shape. Aslight necking occurred near the injection disk ofits forma- tion. This necking column with a frequency ofapproximately i0seconds. The second column also was very cylindrical uptoabout an80mm length (stretched at4mm/s). Atthis point aneck the fixed disk side with aperiod of12seconds. \"At the end, larger reflecting waves than before [the first column] could be observed.

This cell was modified after the TEXUS 12experiment to include (i) acooling system, (2) laser illumination, (3) video recording equipment (replacing the cine camera used on TEXUS 12), and (4) eight thermocouples. Three ofthe eight ther- mocouples were located inthe cooling disk (two ofwhich were used asaheat meter) and five thermocouples were located inthe liquid column. During the first minute oflow-gravity conditions, a86mmlong, 30mm diameter column ofwater was established between two aluminum coaxial disks. One disk was then cooled (via evapora- tion ofahalogen carbon compound, R-12) toapproximately 210 K. All data (thermal and video) were transmitted tothe ground ona real-time basis. Post-flight examination of the video data revealed that there were problems with the recording. \"...the most defeating being that the video transmission seriously deteriorated the image 2-58 recording, adding some flickering and image distortions that prevent[ed] any simple, automated, image analysis. Besides, light contrast inthe images ismuch poorer than expected .... \" (i, p. 6)Itwas reported that the problems with the recording prevented adetailed contact angle analysis (gamma was near zero value). Problems with the thermal data also appeared. \"..the heat-meter data [was] unreliable (quick-look and final data donot match) and anout ofrange state was reached. Besides, the cooling law achieved (exemplified bythe temperature ofthe disc) isnot simple and not reproducible. Aninteresting kick can beseen in the plot ofthe disc temperature atabout 260 K,perhaps due to initial undercooling ofthe liquid and subsequent release ofthe solidification enthalpy, but the available diagnostics donot al- low ittobeelucidated.

The sample ofscreen material used inthis investigation was the same material that is\"...used inthe the fuel system ofthe space shuttle totransport fuel from the storage tanks to the combustion section.\" (i,p.64) Because no discussion ofthe experimental setup could located which was published after the shuttle flight, the expected ex- periment setup and procedure (as described inadocument pub- lished flight) isdetailed here: placed inbetween two single sided ofcopper clad material creating acapacitor. The dielectric ofthe capacitor consists ofthe screen and the fluid. Inthis case freon 113 represents the fuel, which will wick onthe screen.

Each block had over i00 sample wells strategically drilled into its surface. Awell was capable ofholding 100-500 mloffluid. After all ofthe wells had been filled with the ap- propriate sample materials (depending oneach investigator's specific objectives), the blocks were joined together. Twice during the mission, the upper block moved relative tothe bottom block. Each movement ofthe block either (a) aligned or (b) misaligned wells onthe top block with wells onthe bottom. When the wells were aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could take place. When the wells were not aligned, 2-65 material transfer from one well tothe other could not take place. Appropriate positioning ofthe wells onthe top block to those onthe used exclusively byCassantoetal. for aprotein crystal stability experiment which investigated the effect of re-entry loads onterrestrial-grown crystals (see Cassanto, Consorti). The \"Type 2\"and were the liquid-liquid orliquid-solid diffusion experiments. The \"Type 4\"test wells were used exclusively for the film formation and membrane casting experiments (see Pellegrino, Consort i; Vera, Consort i). This experiment Discussion ofthis specific well-type isdetailed here. Each \"Type 2\"test well provided the investigator with one ex- perimental opportunity. The well-type used two sample wells, one onthe top block and one onthe bottom block. Prior tothe rocket flight, the well inthe upper block ofeach well-type was filled with water and the well inthe lower block ofeach well- type was filled with triton x-100 (2% inwater plus atrace dye). The blocks were then joined together such that the well inthe upper block was purposely misaligned with the well onthe lower block. Once the rocket had been launched and the low-gravity phase achieved, amotor and cam mechanism moved the upper block tothe right, aligning the wells onthe upper and lower blocks. Once the wells were incontact, material diffusion was realized across the liquid-liquid interface. Just prior tothe termina- tion ofthe low-gravity rocket phase, the upper block again moved to the right misaligning the upper and lower wells. This misalignment prevented further material diffusion between the liquids. Post-flight evaluation ofthe operation ofthe MDA indicated that the upper moved asexpected allowing diffusion totake place inthe \"Type 2\"test wells. Although itwas reported that minor fluid leakage inthe top and bottom blocks ofthe MDA resulted incontamination ofsome ofthe test wells allotted 17investigations, itwas not clear ifthis particular ex- periment was affected bythe contamination. Optical density measurements ofeach well-pair performed after the rocket flight illustrated the amount ofdye which had dif- fused during the low-gravity phase ofthe rocket. Very little discussion ofresults could belocated atthis time. However, ashort report detailed inReference (3) appears to couple the results ofthis experiment with two others byTodd (see also Todd, Consorti,Phase Rearrangement (Chapter i); Todd, ConsortI,Turbulent Mixing (Chapter ii)) :\"Steep Rocket Flight.

Although extensive flammability testing of materials has been performed onEarth, combustion processes are significantly different inspace. Underlow-gravity ornoconvective combustion products. Such acondition influences most phases ofcombustion (including smoke toxicity). The objectives ofthis SL-4 experiment were todetermine (i) the extent ofsurface flame propagation, (2) the extent of flame flash-over toadjacent materials, (3) the rates of surface and bulk flame propagation, (4) the conditions for self- extinguishment, and (5) the effectiveness of extinguishment by either (a) vacuum or(b) water spray. The experiment was also designed toverify theoretical expectations offlame behavior in adiffusion controlled environment. Thirty-seven samples of six different materials were employed during the Skylab Experiment: (i) aluminized Mylar film, (2) polyurethane foam, (3) nylon sheet, (4) neoprene-coated nylon fabric, (5) bleached cellulose paper, and (6) Teflon fabric. During the investigation, \"Each sample was supported byametal- lic frame and ignited byanelectrically heated filament. A flammability specimen holder was the mechanical and electrical 3-3 interface between the flammability sample and the zero-gravity connector inthe work chamber .... The holder positioned the specimen inthe approximate center ofthe chamber, inview ofthe 16-millimeter data anf-stop of2.8, a1/60 shutter speed, an18mm lens, and #3443 color infrared film. All samples were ignited and burned inthe Skylab atmosphere: 65% specially designed toprevent ac- ofadevice. (It was especially needed inoxygen-rich environments.)> Typically, asample was mounted inthe sample holder and then placed inside the chamber onto the zero-gravity connector. After the sample number had been filmed the sample was ignited. The camera ran, automatically, for apreset period oftime. The sample was then extinguished byeither (I) allowing the sample to burn out byitself (self-extinguishment), (2) opening avent line tospace (vacuum quench), or(3) spraying the sample with water. Six ofthe samples tested flame flash-over between two strips of material which were separated bygaps ofvarious dimensions. Post-flight examination ofthe film and returned samples led to the following conclusions: (I) Ignition under low-gravity conditions, although not quantita- tively evaluated, appeared tobeidentical inheat and time ason Earth. (2) Generally, burning rates were much lower in space than on Earth. The low-gravity burning rates were considerably slower than upward orhorizontal rates under l-g conditions. (3) \"Extinguishment byvacuum iseffective fire tosome level such as6 millimeters ofoxygen. Asignificant side effect that deserves consideration is the intensification that develops during the initial phase. The flame can beextremely soft and small with a nearly negligible burning rate and, asthe air flow produces a forced convection, itwill greatly intensify. Ifsuch aproce- dure was used significantly long the fire could doconsiderable damage before going out.\" (2, p.i0) (4) \"Self-extinguishment ofanundisturbed fire was only that self-extinguishment ispos- application ofwater water striking material results inamomentary flare-up which Flammability, Burn Rates, Flame Propagation, Flame Extinguishment, Diffusion, Space Vacuum, Water Spray, Quench Process, Convection, CoatedSurfaces, Photographic Difficulties NumberofSamples: 37 Sample Materials: aluminized mylar, neoprene-coated nylon fabric, sheet nylon, teflon fabric, bleached cellulose paper, foamed polyurethane Container Materials: not applicable 3-5 Experiment/Material Applications: The materials selected for this experiment were limited by the number ofpossible testsand bythenumber and Schwaniger, A.: Low-G Measurements by NASA.

However, ifmelting isperformed inalow-gravity environment, then (I) collapse ofthe porous structure might beavoided and (2) aproduct with aunique porous structure might be obtained.

Consequently, asolid metal structure on Earth loses its shape when melted.

The specific ob- jectives ofthe investigation were similar tothose outlined in Patten, SPAR i. Prior tothe rocket flight, the samples were prepared using high rate sputter depositioning techniques. During this ground-based deposition, acontrolled quantity ofinert argon was trapped in twelve pure aluminum samples. (Three different gas concentration quantities were investigated.) The twelve samples were placed intwo TCU furnaces and processed during the rocket flight. Within the first furnace/sample system (designated asexperiment 74-10/2), specimens were heated above the 660 \u00b0Cmelting point for approximately 85seconds. Within the second furnace/sample system (designated as experiment 74- 10/3), specimens were heated above the 660\u00b0Cmelting point for approximately 160 seconds. All samples were then cooled with a water quench system. 4-13 Post-flight analysis indicated that nine of the twelve rocket samples were suitable for further, extensive examinations. These samples were compared tosimilarly processed terrestrial samples. Metallographic examinations indicated that metal foams were produced in both the rocket and terrestrial experiments. Detailed information about each ofthe samples was tabulated and included (i) trapped argon content, and (2) time above melt tem- perature. Reportedly: \"Very uniform cell size foams were produced in1ginone series ofexperiments, possibly because avery thick oxide scale was al- lowed to form, thus, providing uniform constraints to the samples. Bubble coarsening and alarger void volume fraction were observed with increasing time above melting point. Inother 1gexperiments and inall zero gexperiments, the oxide scales fractured during expansion of the foam, providing non-uniform sample constraint. <Note: Itappears that all ofthe rocket samples had an oxide film.> In the thickest samples foamed in zero g,much more bubble coarsening and alarger void volume fraction were observed with increasing time above the melting point. However, the effects ofthe oxide scale were still quite pronounced and kinetic information onfoam formation behavior was not obtained. Itisalso believed that much more difference would benoted between ground-based and zero gfoam behavior without mechanical restriction from oxide scale.\" (I, p.IV-3) Key Words: Composites with Gases, Metallic Foams, Metals and Al- loys, Binary Systems, Melt and Solidification, Sputter- Deposition, Liquid/Gas Dispersion, Liquid/Gas Interface, Thin Films, Oxide Layer, Coated Surfaces, Voids, Density Difference, Buoyancy Effects Diminished, Phase Separation, Solid/Liquid Interface, Quench Process, Space Struc- tures NumberofSamples: twelve Processing Applications.

The ex- periment was touse the following reaction copper melt: Cu20(l )+C(graphite) -->2Cu(1) +CO (This reaction has been used for many years inthe fire refining ofcopper.) \"The advantage here limited bythe ofaparticular gas inamolten solid which can begenerated islimited only bythe reactants, and indeed,.., limiting the reactants is the way tocontrol the amount ofgas generated.\" (i, p. 76) (Reference (i) containsadiscussion ofthe fundamental con- siderations, thermodynamics, and extensive ground-based studies performed to investigate the rate and quantity of gas evolved during the reaction.) Prior tothe SPAR I0mission, the sample was prepared bymixing six powder with 60mg ofcarbon and 0.47 gof Cu20powders (see Reference (i) for further sample preparation procedures). The sample was configured inaTZM molybdenum alloy cartridge (0.812 inch outer diameter; 2.75 inches long; 0.15 inch wall thickness). The cartridge contained ahelical spring to prevent sample movement during handling and rocket launch. The cartridge was sealed byTIG-welding tomaintain the expected 4-24 pressure development. During the SPAR i0 experiment, the Low Gravity Exothermic Heating/Cooling Apparatus was used tomelt and resolidify the sample. Reportedly, itwas clear that the expected reaction be- tween the carbon and copper oxide occurred. Yet, \"...the tem- perature measurement ofthe capsule was lost; and therefore, it isnot known whether ornot the sample solidified before itbe- came affected bythe Earth's gravitation. However, the reclaimed capsule provided evidence that acopper foam was developed al- though itwas not maintained. \"In the reclaimed capsule, the copper was coated onto three- quarters ofthe inner surface ofthe cavity inthe half nearest the TIG-welded end. This copper movement could have been the result of... [the copper].., wetting the surface ofthe TZM or that... [the developed asafoam which collapsed onto the surface. Isolated inthis surface coating are 17crystals of copper approximately 2mmonanedge and extending from the sur- face 2to3mm. This indicates that the pool ofcopper from which these crystals grew must have been atleast 2to 3mm thick. Such crystals could not have been developed from acopper sheet generated bywetting but could have developed from afoam. Although this evidence strongly suggests the development of a copper foam, there isnoevidence tosupport areason for its collapse since the experiment may have been subject torelatively high 'g' forces before solidification.\" (I, p.86) <Note: Itwas reported that further investigation pected and will bereported atalater date.> Key Words: Composites with Gases, Metallic Foams, Foam Stability, Metallic Matrix, Metals and Alloys, Binary Systems, Reactant Solutions, Melt and Solidification, Porosity, Bubble Formation, Kinetics, Wetting, Wetting ofContainer, Density Decrease, Coated toexamine composites with solid (A1203) and gaseous inclusions.

The specific objective of the experiment was todetermine ifmetallic foams with high porosity could be formed ifgravity-driven forces (such as buoyancy) were absent. Prior tothe mission, asample consisting of3gofCuSn6with additions ofCuOand Cwas placed within anAI203 crucible. During the low-gravity phase ofthe rocket flight, the specimen was processed inthe TEXUS Experimental Module TEM 01-i cartridge furnace. During this processing, the material was heated toap- proximately 1090 \u00b0C (this temperature isabove reaction occurred: CuO +C=Cu+CO Before the end ofthe low-gravity period, the sample was rapidly cooled below the solidus temperature. Reference samples were prepared under l-g conditions using the same time/temperature profile. Post-flight, the l-g and low-gravity processed samples were com- pared. Itwas reported that the l-g sample contained pores with amaximum diameter of0.05 mmand had aporosity of0.8%. The space processed diameter of 2mm and had aporosity of11%. Itwas concluded that the Composites with Gases, Metallic Foams, Metallic Matrix, Multiphase Media, Phase Stability, Foam Stability, Melt and Solidification, Bubble Formation, Bubble Dispersion, Gas For- conditions increases the stability ofgas bubbles inamolten metal.

The properties ofthe matrix material (e.g., strength) are determined not only bythe materials them- selves, but also the distribution ofthe second phase through the matrix. The distribution ofthe second phase isaffected bysuch parameters as (I) surface properties ofthe dispersed phase, (2) buoyahcy forces present while the matrix material ismolten, (3) gravity-independent convective flows, and (4) interaction ofthe solidification front. This Spacelab 1experiment wasdesigned tostudy the behavior of dispersed phases during amelting and solidification treatment. The specific objectives ofthe experiment were to(i) investigate the performance ofthin film oxide containers, (2) study the be- havior ofdispersed solid and gaseous phases within aliquid melt, and (3) determine the interaction ofthe dispersed phases, eutectic structures, and cellular structures with asolidifica- tion front. Prior tothe Spacelab flight, atotal of21samples which con- tained Ag, AI, orCuas the base metal were prepared. The samples were either (I) binary alloys (Ag-Cu, eutectic composition), (2) Ag-Cu binary alloys with (3) 1% Ni. The AI-AI203 samples were prepared byhot extrusion and referred to as S.A.P. Samples were prepared using various methods including (i) sintering, (2) compacting only, (3) explo- sion sintering, (4) alternated electrolytic deposition, (5) hot extrusion, or(6) preparation from slices. The sample shapes in- cluded (i) cylindrical with hemispherical extremes, (2) cylindri- and (3) slices(approximately thick). Some ofthe samples also had (i) a thin (i000 toi0000 angstroms) alumina coating, (2) aNifilm coating. Other samples had nocoating.

Corresponding reference samples were processed onEarth for comparison. Post-flight examination ofthe low-gravity processed samples led tothe following conclusions: (i)Theoxide films maintained the initialsample shape after melting and solidifying for (a) the Ag-Cu materials and (b) the A1 samples with fine dispersions ofAI203 particles which had been prepared byhot extrusion.

The non-wetting behavior, which was not observed during ground experiments, was attributed tothe lack of gravitational forces which cause the liquid melt tocontact the crucible walls. Italso appeared that avaporization ofZnat the melt/SiC interface occurred, which allowed the movement. As the thermal field developed, the pressure attempted toequi- librate. Therefore, ahigher pressure existed atthe cold end of the samples than above the free meniscus. Itwas reported that that anacceleration accident may have occurred which could have resulted insample movement. Metallographic examination of the 5at.% flight-processed material (longitudinal cut, Keller's etch) revealed alarge grain structure inthe first solidified portion which became anelon- gated grain structure inthe latter solidified portion. The last quarter ofthe sample contained numerous interconnected cavities. Overall, the sample exhibited nodendritic structure. However, the corresponding l-g processed sample was clearly dendritic (same etching technique). Examination of the 2.5 at.% flight-processed material (same metallographic technique) revealed three grain boundaries atthe beginning ofsolidification \"...which gives one single boundary oriented parallel to the sample axis after acertain dis- tance .... \"(I, p. 124) Large dendrites (oriented parallel to sample axis) with voids between the secondary arms were located inthe last portion ofthe sample.

The objectives ofthis Consort 1experiment were to (i) form a polymer-gas foam (polyurethane) and (2)determine if the properties ofthe low-gravity produced foam were significantly different from terrestrially-produced foams. Chemicals used toproduce the foaming reaction were stored intwo chambers within the experimental apparatus. The first chamber contained apolyol solution; the second chamber contained diisocyanate. During the rocket flight (just prior tothe onset ofthe low gravity period), apiston located inthe first chamber was moved, expanding the available volume inthe chamber.

Post-flight evaluation of the flight sample indicated that most ofthe gas had unexpectedly leaked from the material during ground-based preparation ofthe capsule.

Further, there was an inconclusive tendency for fibers toalign themselves inthe reduced gravity environment which indicated possible controlled fiber orientation. The second sample was processed todemonstrate the dispersion of cerrobend-coated beryllium copper fibers and argon gas bubbles in paraffin. Post-flight evaluation ofthe sample indicated that most ofthe gas had unexpectedly leaked from the material during ground-based preparation ofthe capsule. Further, \"At the time of sample preparation, only coated fibers were available for the flight sample ....

Con- sequently, the objectives of fiber dispersion and fiber-bubble interaction were not achieved.\" (2, p.7-20) Itwas reported, however, that fairly stable dispersion ofgas bubbles was achieved inthe paraffin flight sample with only asmall amount ofgas (low bubble density).

All three crucibles were then enclosed inasingle TMZ cartridge. Three thermo- elements were fixed onthe outside surface ofthe cartridge (one ateach end and one inthe middle). The cartridge was placed in amultipurpose furnace housed within the TEXUS Experiment Module TEM 01-2. Just prior tolaunch, the samples were preheated to850 \u00b0C. Once the low-gravity period ofthe flight was achieved, rapid heating and melting ofthe sample occurred followed by solidification. Similar reference samples were processed onEarth using the same time-temperature profile. Post-flight examination ofthe flight thermal data revealed that melting and solidification occurred under low-gravity conditions. (The samples had been molten for about 3minutes.) However, the samples were subjected toanunintended thermal gradient of50 \u00b0C/cm. Examination ofthe space-processed samples revealed that ,'...liquid two samples... [was] sucked out ofthe TMZ-crucible bycapillary action, resulting inrather large gas holes and inducing additional flow currents inthe liquid .... \" (Reference (3)) Reportedly, such capillary action did not occur in the graphite crucible and particles were found at the periphery ofthe Cumatrix. Further examination ofall the samples (l-g and low-g) indicated that the particles separated from the matrix during the melting phase ofthe experiment. During heating, \"...extensive dissolu- tion ofSiC and diffusion ofSiinthe copper took place. This alloying effect lowered the melting point ofthe copper matrix around the sic particles. The volume expansion due tothe par- tial melting ofthe alloyed zones dif- ferences inthe liquid.

Priortothe rocket three Cu-dispersed particle were Sample 1was acopper melt). The TMZ crucible was configured with anon-wetted graphite ring atthe top, which reduced the free melt surface. Sample 2was a copper sample with 20-45 micron diameter Wparticles. The Cu-30 wt.% Wsample was contained inapure copper shell. The copper shell prevented the interaction between the crucible wall and particles during sample melting. Sample 3was the same asSample 1except itwas contained inanon-wetted graphite crucible. (It was noted that tungsten particles are well-wetted b_the copper matrix (wetting angle, theta, isapproximately 60_)while the copper does not wet the SiO2particles well is ap- proximately 140-170\u00b0).) Multipurpose Furnace was used toprocess the samples. While un- der low-gravity conditions, the samples were (i) melted, (2) maintained inamolten state (for approximately 3minutes), and (3) resolidified. Thermal data indicated that the samples were 5-18 slightly overheated (30 \u00b0C) during the mission. Similar reference samples were also processed under l-g condi- tions. Itwas reported that the experimental procedure used l-g investigations was analogous tribution throughout most ofthe inSample 3(low-gravity) were only partially matrix. The particles were either (i) ag- glomerated or(2) clinging tosmall gas holes. Inthe similarly processed l-g sample, the particles had completely exuded tothe top. The Wparticles ofSample 2(l-g) had completely lost their tial skeletal floating tothe top Examination ofthe low-gravity processed sample indi- cated that the particles remained intheir skeletal form, which moved asawhole over asmall distance. This movement was at- tributed toresidual accelerations during the TEXUS 7flight. Itwas from the TEXUS 6and TEXUS 7experiments was not maintained insimilar experiments onEarth and under low-gravity conditions when the materials were melted ina non-wetting crucible.

The samples were enclosed inasingle graphite crucible, which was contained (after degassing) inatantalum cartridge. Three Pt/Pt-Rh ther- mocouples were also contained inthe graphite crucible.

I.H.F... the second run with the copper matrix samples was cancelled.\" (i, p.70) (The I.H.F. malfunction was at- tributed to ageneral electrical failure which could not be repaired bythe shuttle crew.) Instead, only six aluminum matrix samples were processed. During the flight experiment, the cartridge containing the aluminum matrix samples was heated to800 \u00b0C and held atthis temperature for 40minutes. Helium gas was then introduced to solidify the samples. Acooling rate of1K/s resulted. Further cooling ofthe samples occurred atambient temperature inacool- ing chamber. <Note: The location ofthis cooling chamber isnot known.> Similar reference experiments were performed on Earth using nearly identical thermal conditions. Post-flight analysis ofthe samples included (I) radiography, (2) metallography, (3) Vickers macro-hardness tests (i0 kg load, approximately 1mm indentation), (4) tensile tests, (5) fracture surface examina- tion, and (6) abrasive wear tests. Reportedly, hardness tests were only performed onSamples i,2,and 4because gas holes (Sample 3)and large carbide particles (Samples 5and 6)in- validated hardness measurements. Castingdefects also caused premature fracture during tensile tests, resulting ininadequate evaluation ofstrength and ductility characteristics inboth the l-g and low-gravity processed samples. Reportedly, the results and achievement ofthe experimental ob- jectives were limited because the IHF malfunctioned and the Cu samples could not be processed. The following conclusions, however, were reported: (i) The main result from the experiment was that the space- processed samples contained amore homogeneous distribution of particles than the l-g processed samples. However, even low- gravity processing did not achieve acompletely homogeneous dis- tribution, indicating the presence ofgravity-independent, par- ticle mechanisms. (2) The macro-hardness ofthe space samples (Samples I,2,and 4) was more uniform than the l-g samples. (3) From elementary fracture analysis, the adhesion between the sic particles and A1was improved bylow-gravity melt processing (compared to initial powder metallurgically prepared samples). This improved adhesion was especially apparent insamples with coarse particles. 5-23 (4) The difference inparticle distribution between the flight and ground-based samples were attributed to (a) sedimentation, (b) fluid flow from thermal convection, and particularly (c) ag- glomeration tendency ofthe dispersed particles. Itwas also reported that the mutual wetting behavior ofthe matrix material and dispersed phase was animportant factor inparticle distribu- tion (see also Deruyterre, TEXUS 7).

This objective was tobe achieved by studying identical samples subjected to different thermal conditions. Prior tolaunch, four sampleswereprepared: Samples 1and the bythe copper melt. Prior toenclosure in poorly-wetted samples H2atmosphere All four crucibles were TZM cartridge. The cartridge was placed inthe TEXUS Experiment Module TEM 01-I Multipurpose Furnace such 3and 4were inthe gradient section ofthe apparatus. \"The cartridge was connected toaheat sink byusing acopper cooling block.

During cooling, the...[paraffin] underwent asolid...[to] liquid transformation, extracting extra heat.\" (5) The samples experienced the follow- ing thermal I-3.8 Sample \u00b0C/mm. Reportedly the experiment fulfilled the requested conditions. Itappears that melting and solidification of the samples occurred during the low-gravity period ofthe mission. 5-26 Post-flight analysis ofthe low-gravity samples indicated that the redistribution of particles was less pronounced than that found insamples similarly produced onEarth. Inthe isothermal flight Cu-SiO 2sample, the particles moved from the lower part of the sample tothe top and exuded from the matrix. However, in flight sample 4(highest gradient), the Moparticles retained a good distribution throughout the copper matrix. Inthe gradient Cu-SiO 2flight samples, aportion ofthe particles remained in the matrix while some were exuded from the copper. Itwas reported that there was nosignificant difference between the ground-based samples processed (i) isothermally or(2) inthe gradient portion of the furnace. Examination of the l-g processed Cu-Mosamples indicated acomplete redistribution of the Moparticles: they remained inthe Cumatrix but moved toward the side surfaces. Inthe ground-based SiO2samples, most ofthe particles moved from their initial position-(lower portion ofthe sample) and exuded from the top ofthe sample. Itwas concluded that low-gravity levels with copper could beexplained byinterfacial energy considerations.

Sweden Payload Type:Sounding Rocket Experiment Processing Facility: ESA/Swedish Space Corporation experiment module containing the Gradient Furnace Assembly (GFA) Builder of Processing Facility: Swedish Space Corporation (SSC)/ACR, Solna, Sweden Experiment: Metallic Particle Composites This TEXUS 14a sounding rocket experiment was the seventh ina series ofinvestigations designed byDeruyttere etal. tostudy the 9,Spacelab DI). The objective ofthe experiment was to further understand the sedimentation and skeletal forma- tion processes inmelted and solidified composites. During the mission, two furnaces within the Swedish Space Cor- poration experiment module were tomelt and resolidify two AI-SiC samples (0.4 vol.% SiC, 0-3 The samples (designated as sample Aand sample B)were tobeprocessed with identical heat- ing cycles but different solidification rates. This method of processing was employed toinvestigate the influence of melting and solidification onparticle redistribution. Reportedly, the TEXUS 14a experiment was ex- uncontrollable accelerations were produced onthe vehicle and the desired low gravity ofi0-_gwas not attained. Principal Investigator L.Froyen reported that the samples were not analyzed. The experiment was reflown onTEXUS ofthe ex- periment was tofurther understand the sedimentation and skeletal formation processes inmelted and solidified composites. During the mission,two furnaces withinthe Swedish SpaceCor- poration experiment module were used two AI-SiC samples (0.4 vol.% (designated asSample Aand Sample identi- cal heating cycles (heating to750 vC (Tm+90)) but then cooled at different rates to establish different solidification velocities. This method ofprocessing was used toinvestigate the influence of melting and solidification on particle redistribution. Reportedly, \"The redistribution ofthe particles during melting could bestudied inthe fast cooled sample...[in] holder A... where the particle distribution after melting was conserved.\" (4, p.302) \"With the (0.4#/s: the slowest pos- sible within the 5min cooling time inreduced gravity).\" (I, p. 7O) Reference experiments were performed onEarth using agradient furnace identical tothe flight furnace. Calculations which simulated the directional solidification process (taking into ac- count the difference inthermal conductivity between the particle and matrix materials) were performed toaid inthe analysis of the samples (see Reference (2) for details). 5-35 Post-flight examination ofthe thermal data and sampledendritic arm spacing revealed asolidification rate of(i) 8microns/s for Sample Aand (2) 0.4 microns/s for Sample B. The flight ther- mocouple readings indicated that the samples experienced sig- nificantly longer solidification times than (i) observed during the l-g reference tests and (2) predicted bythe computer simula- tions. Radiographic examination ofboth the low-gravity and reference revealed the presence ofunexpected, large holes inthe material. \"No such hole formation had ever been ob- served during the [other] extensive ground tests.\" (4, p. 302) These holes were attributed to defects and inhomogeneities (adsorbed hydroxides on the Al-powder) introduced during preflight sample fabrication. This was indicated by the following: (I) No such large holes were present inthe samples before processing. (2) Aluminum had been pressed into the plug during processing be- cause ofthe expansion ofgas trapped inthe samples. <Note: It appears \"plug\" acted asacap onone end ofthe sample holder.> (3) Some holes were covered with SiC particles; these holes were more spherically shaped than those holes around internal oxide surfaces. The following effects ofthe gas hole formation were reported: (i) Adifferent particle distribution resulted than what was ex- pected. This distribution was attributed todifferent melt flows around the holes. (2) Aslower heat transfer rate resulted. This slower rate was the main reason the predicted and observed solidification times differed. These effects reduced the use ofSample Aasareference to Sample Band impeded the quantitative analysis ofthe experiment.

The specific objective of the experiment was to produce void-free silver samples which had been reinforced with oriented silicon carbide whiskers. During these sample and [the] sample ampoule were held vertical tothe ground, and the piston rod was kept downward to the sample.\" (2, p. 453) Reportedly, the l-g samples remained molten for approximately 2hours. Post-flight, the following characteristics ofthe l-g and space- were investigated: (i) macrostructure, (2) microstructure, (3) whisker distribution, (4) x-ray structure, (5) microhardness, (6) bend-test strength, and (7) fracture sur- face. From these examinations, the following conclusions were reported: (i) The density ratio (measured density/theoretical density) of both the l-g and low-gravity processed samples was increased be- cause ofthe spring/piston ampoules. (2) Crystalgrain sizes ofthe l-g and space-processed samples at the spring/piston end were about one-tenth those atthe opposite end because of (a) heat conduction through the graphite piston rod and (b) thermal characteristics ofthe MEFS. (3) Separation ofthe whiskers and Aginthe low-gravity samples was not observed, despite the large density difference between Ag and SiC. However, separation, onamicroscopic and macroscopic scale, was observed inthe l-g processed samples. (4) The microhardness values and whisker distribution density from the low-gravity samples were uniform over the entire sample. \"The whiskers ofthe l-g sample were distributed richly atthe spring end compared tothe other end, and the values ofhardness were scattered widely with their measured positions.\" (2, p.457) (5) X-ray analysis indicated apreferred grain orientation inthe space-processed samples. This orientation was inthe large grained area ofthe sample (opposite from the spring/piston end ofthe sample). The l-g processed samples did not indicate such anorientation. (6) The bend tests indicated aductile behavior for the low- gravity processed samples while the l-g samples exhibited a brittle behavior. Reportedly, these results \"...indicate clearly that the low-g samples were devoid of [the] influence of floating due to the density difference and thermal convection: accordingly, the low- gravity environment isapreferable place where the high-quality composite materials can bewell processed.\" (2, p.457) 5-42 Key Words: Composites with Solid Particles, Binary Systems, Rein- forced Materials, Dispersion Alloys, Metallic Matrix, Powder Metallurgy, Melt and Solidification, Whiskers, Thermal Convec- tion, Heat Conduction, Buoyancy Effects, Density Difference, Sedimentation, Particle Distribution, Par- ticle Motion, Solid/Liquid Dispersion, Solid/Liquid Interface, Thermal Soak, Sample Microstructure, Grain Size, Hardness, Material Strength, Piston System, Separation of Components, Voids, Passive Cooling Number ofSamples: three Sample Materials: (i) Ag-2 vol.% SiC Ag-5 vol.% SiC and (3) Ag-10 vol.% SiC whiskers (Ag*Si*C*) Container Materials: graphite sheath contained insilica tube which was sealed inastainless steel cartridge (C*, Si*O*) Experiment/Material Applications: Composite materials, composed ofhigh-strength whiskers within a metal matrix, have high-strength applications.

The overall goal ofthe investigative series was to determine the feasibility of, and establish techniques for, reduced gravity casting ofnew dispersion-strengthened titanium matrix composites. Magnesium (rather than titanium) was used to model the technique because its lower melting point was within the temperature limitations ofthe employed SPAR furnace. (Both magnesium and titanium have identical thermodynamic behavior relativetooxidation.) The specificobjective crucible and placed within the SPAR General Pur- pose Rocket Furnace. Itwas reported that during the mission, (a) the sample was heated atarate ofi0\u00b0C/sand (b) the sample's temperature was maintained above the Mgmelting point (651 \u00b0C) for the duration of the low-gravity period (230 seconds). (The sample was held atgreater than orequal to800 \u00b0Cfor atleast 190 seconds during period.) tional samples were similarly processed onEarth for comparison. 5-48 Reportedly, \"...the flight furnace did not follow the programmed cooldown rate after 340 seconds because ofamalfunction ofthe gas injection system. However,... [it was believed].., that the sample had already solidified completely bythat time.\" (i, p. VI-6) Post-flight examination ofthe flight sample revealed gas voids located next to the crucible wall and \"...dispersion-depleted areas, relatively large insize...\" which were roughly round in shape. (i, p.VI-II) Adispersion-depleted area was also located around the periphery ofthe flight sample. The ground-processed samples contained voids internal tothe sample material and layered sedimentation ofthe dispersoids due togravity. One ground-based sample contained voids located onand near the top ofthe ingot. All samples (flight and ground processed) showed sedimentation orclusters ofdispersoids intwo layers. However, the layering due to gravity was predominant in the ground samples. (Adetailed discussion ofthe sample microstructure is contained inReference (i).) Asummary possible mechanisms acting onthe samples was reported asfollows: \"The internally sound ingot cast under low-gravity conditions, liquid state. The protective gas ar- gon moved tothe container walls and the non-wetting melt moved toward the center ofthe crucible.\" (5) \"The presence ofrounded regions that can beattributed tothermoacoustic waves induced byrapid heat- byvoid-filling action ofthe low viscosity liquid. \"Overheating and heating with gas beneath the melt under the in- fluence ofgravity will result inextremely unsound ingots with internal adeviation from the ideal Stokes law and isnot unexpected with the present experiment design. Itis necessary, however, tospecul_te ont_e possibility ofthe flight dispersion-depleted periphery ofthe flight- processed ingot cannot be explained by the particle rejection mechanism because ofthe estimated high rate ofsolidification. However, the mechanism ofpreferential gas motion atlow gravity 5-49 coupled with surface tension induced liquid motion and Mgvapor condensation can beused toexplain this particular microstruc- tural feature.\" (i, p.VI-31) These results led tothe following recommendations for the SPAR 2 experiment oncast dispersion-strengthened composites (wit hthe objective ofattaining the liquid state while only at10-_g to prevent sedimentation due togravity effects): (i) Preheat the prevent sample mel_ing prior tothe achievement of agravity level less than i0-_g. (3) Establish asample soak range of800 \u00b0Cto 850 \u00b0Cwhich may beasshort as180 seconds. (4) Reduce the thermal lag between the sample and furnace and apply aquench rate which isasrapid aspossible inorder to solidify before re-entry an attainment of i0-_gto 10-3g gravity levels while inthe liquid state.

The overall goal ofthe inves- tigative series was todetermine the feasibility of, and estab- lish techniques for, reduced gravity casting ofnew dispersion- strengthened titanium matrix composites. Magnesium (rather than titanium) was used tomodel the technique because its lower melt- ing point was within the temperature limitations ofthe employed SPAR furnace. (Both magnesium and titanium have identical ther- modynamic behavior relative tooxidation.) The specific objectives ofthe SPAR1and dispersion-strengthened Mgmatrix bycomparing flight and ground-based samples processed under identical thermal condi- tions. During the earlier SPAR 1mission, apremixed powder sample ofMg containing already formed ThO 2particles was melted and solidified retaining adispersion-strengthened metal matrix com- posite under low-gravity conditions. During this SPAR 2mission, two samples comprised of Mg-9.2 wt.% Th-3.2 wt.% MgO were stoichiometrically selected such following allowed the insitu production of2vol.% ThO2par- ticles. Thus, the composite was produced bytaking advantage of the ability ofThtogetter oxygen from MgO and precipitate out asThO2particles within the Mgmatrix. During the SPAR 2mission, the forward and aft portions ofthe General Purpose Rocket Furnace (GPRF) were used toprocess the two samples. Each sample was contained within anargon-filled \"POCO\" graphite crucible. The Arwas included because (I) the high vapor pressure ofMgwould bedetrimental interms ofmetal evaporation and vapor condensation, (2) the oxidation ofMg during preflight sample preparation had tobeminimized (the samples were prepared inaglovebox under anAratmosphere), and (3) any practical casting ofMg isperformed inaflux which precludes the use ofavacuum. The experimental procedures for both SPAR 2samples were as follows: (i) pre-launch thermal soak (2) intended low-gravity soak time for the forward fur- nace sample was approximately 60seconds and the intended low- gravity soak time for the aft furnace sample was greater than or equal to180 seconds. Reportedly, \"The short-soak flight test inthe Forward Furnace appeared tohave failed, because the interpolated cartridge tem- perature had barely reached 800 \u00b0Cwhen initiated.\" (i, p.VII-26). Further, flight samples, aswell ground-based (GBT) were shorter than intended. Post-flight and microhardness studies were performed onthe SPAR 2and GBT samples. When the results were coupled with those from the SPAR 1experiment, the following conclusions were reported: (i) Low-gravity processing resulted insamples with no internal pores. Earth-processing resulted iningots containing internal pores. (2) The gettering-dispersion mechanism was successful inproduc- ing cast dispersion-strengthened metal matrix composites which cannot beobtained onEarth. Segregation, resulting from density differences between the dispersoids and matrix, can bereduced or 5-53 avoided by low-gravity processing. The \"%Area with Sufficient Dispersion\" was (a) approximately 90% for the low-g samples and (b) approximately 50% for the l-g processed material. The average size ofthe dispersoids was the same inboth the SPAR 2 and l-g samples (0.5 to0.6 microns) which should beadequate to attain dispersion strengthening atelevated temperatures. (3) The average hardness ofthe low-g samples was significantly more uniform than that ofthe Earth-processed material. The hardness values ofthe rocket samples were twice that ofpure Mg and about 30% greater than (a) the l-g samples and (b) commercial Mg-Th-Zr (HK31A) alloys subjected tosimilar thermal conditions. time-dependent mechanisms and rates ofheating and cooling donot complicate the experimental observations ....

The particle sizes for the low-gravity experiments were selected such that, during ground- based experiments, the smaller particles were easily pushed by the solidification front but the larger particles were not pushed bythe front (see Reference (i) for particle size range).

At300 seconds after launch, the heaters were switched off toallow sample freezing prior tore-entry. Post-flight examination ofthe photographs from cell no. 7led to the following conclusions: (i) The sample incell no. 7did not melt prior to launch; therefore, the initial particle dispersion was retained prior to melting and resolidification under low-gravity conditions. It was inferred that this condition was also true for all other samples. (2) The camphor was melted under low-gravity conditions, leaving the particles dispersed throughout the liquid. (3) The interface melted back toaposition within the field of view ofthe camera. However, the melt-back was not as far as desired (programmed).

Con- versely, during the production ofdispersion-hardened metals, it isimportant that the solidification front overtake the particles (rather than push the particles) ahead ofthe front. Ifthe behavior ofsuch particles can bebetter understood and controlled then the following industrial advantages might be realized: (i) the cleansing ofmetals ofimpurities during the solidifica- tion process (2) the production ofdispersion-hardened metals directly from the melt (which would have better mechanical properties over those produced through powder metallurgical techniques) (3) the production ofmetallic foams from the melt (without changing the inital pore distribution). This study was performed inalow-gravity environment toreduce the segregation between constituents ofdiffering densities (melt and suspended particles).

Four composite-powder model systems, representing solid-liquid- gas mixtures, were chosen for the TEXUS 1flight.

Other mechanisms (as detailed inthe above experiment summary) could contribute to separation. Itwas necessary, therefore, todetermine the extent and relevance ofeach ofthese forces. The materials used inthis study were chosen for many reasons: (i) the melt temperatures ofeach were below that ofthe avail- able maximum furnace temperature, (2) large density differences between materials could illustrate separation due toresidual ac- celeration components, and (3) wetting and non-wetting powder combinations would indicate separation due to this material characteristic. In addition, (I) no chemical reaction or solubility ofcomponents would occur, (2) plasticity ofmatrix material (Ag) allowed density control, (3) control of surface contamination and oxidation was possible, (4) the vapor pressure atmaximum temperature would below, and (5) the powders were available inthe required form (particle shape, etc.).

Components fabricated from ceramic- strengthened metal composites can withstand these severe environ- ments. However, fabrication ofsuch materials isdifficult on Earth because gravity-induced convection and sedimentation affect composite strength properties. ThisTT-500A8experiment was the first inaseries ofinvestiga- tions designed by Takahashi to study the solidification of ceramic-strengthened metallic composites. The specific objective ofthe experiment was toprepare acomposite material bymelting, pressing, and solidifying under low-gravity samples wereprepared. Sample1con- sisted ofanickel-molybdenum alloy (i0 wt.% Mo) with titanium whiskers (30 wt.%). The whiskers, which were 10-50 microns thick and 0.5-2.0 mmlong, were plated with rhodium to prevent reaction with the Ni-Mo matrix at1300 \u00b0C. The sample was prepared onEarth by (i) mixing the material with anaqueous solution ofammonium alginate (to make it\"clayish\" for ease of extrusion), (2) extruding the material through small cylindrical holes (to align the whiskers) (3)drying the material, and (4) heating the material atii00 6Cfor 30minutes (to evaporate the wt.% Mo) with 1-2 micron diameter titanium carbide particles (25 wt.%). The sample was prepared by (i) mixing the Ni, Mo, and TiC powders, (2) pressing the blended^powder into cylindrical form (500 MPa)f Torr. contained inacarbon crucible. The crucible contained acarbon piston used for pressing the sample material. The samples were pressed during processing to eliminate voids which would normally be created when the material was heated. Each ofthe crucibles was placed inanelectric furnace for processing. During the 6-minute rocket flight, the samples were (I) heated, (2) melted, (3) soaked, (4) pressed, and (5) cooled. Although a constant soak temperature of 1450 \u00b0C was intended, it was reported that \"...sample [i] did not seem tobecompletely melted because the time elapsed to reach 1450 _C.... Sothe sample rapidly expanded on account ofthe quick heating, then most ofmolten sample.., flowed out ofthe crucible.\" (i, p.222) Itwas further reported that the desired gravity (10-4g)level was not achieved because ofaproblem with t_e rocket longitudinal axis. (i, p.222) Additional samples were similarly processed on Earth for com- parison. Post-flight examination ofthe samples included microphotography, microvicker's hardness tests, X-ray microanalysis. The fol- lowing results for the whisker and particle were reported: Low-gravity whisker sample (Sample i): (a) Itappeared that this sample was pressed and cooled after in- sufficient melting. Some voids were located inthe sample. (b) Anincrease inhardness values ofthe flight sample was indi- cated (the hardness value of the low-gravity sample was i01 before flight; 350 after low-gravity processing). Reportedly, the whisker sample had alower hardness value than the low- gravity particle sample (Sample 2). This was \"...considered to bedue tothe whisker reinforced sample preparation process being insufficient intemperature condition.\" (i, p.223) (c) The sample exhibited avertical alignment ofthe TiC whisk- ers.

(c) X-ray analysis indicated that \"...Mo was recognized toexist overlapping with the region ofTiC particles .... \"(i, p.223) Analysis ofthe samples, considering assedimenta- tion, random walk ofthe particles, and Marangoni forces led to the following conclusions: (i) The migration ofthe particles (1-2 microns) inSample 2, attributed to sedimentation, was considered negligible when a gravity level of i0-_was taken into account. However, the larger size ofthe whiskers 1resulted in\"...a migra- tion distance remarkably increased.\" p.224) (2) Since the contact angle between molten Ni-Mo and TiC was regarded aszero ornear zero, the tendency ofthe particles to coagulate byrandom walk was considered negligible.

Four other experiments (of the ten) were applicable tothis this data base (see Alford, (Chapter 14)). The objective ofthe experiment was to demonstrate the curing ofanepoxy resin-graphite composite. Prior to the flight, apartially-cured composite sample was selected for the space investigation. During the mission, the sample was tobeheated to329 OFand held atthis temperature for 70minutes (allowing the togel). Post-flight, the resultant composite strength and ,,...quality ofwetting between the resin and graphite fibers\" (i, p.12) was tobecompared toa similarly processed ground-based sample. Reportedly, the experimental objectives could not becompleted as planned. The heating apparatus, although operational, did not provide the necessary operating temperature. (The temperature of the GAS canister was lower than expected.) The Principal Inves- tigator provided additional information on this anomaly: \"A 5-109 shuttle/canister wiring malfunction delayed all experiment in- itiations. Meanwhile the shuttle was performing its 'cold soak' mission inwhich the bay was pointed into space and its tempera- ture dropped significantly.

Prior tothe mission, two 150-mm long, 6-mm diameter samples were prepared: (i) Cu-2vol.% diameter) and (2) Cu-2 vol.% Moparticles (ito4micron particle diameter). The samples were contained within analumina crucible protected byatantalum cartridge. During the mission, melting and directional solidification ofthe samples were performed using the Isothermal Heating Facility \"with Gradient device\" (IHF/G). (The various furnace translation rates were presented inReference (5).) Post-flight examination ofthe thermal data and processed samples indicated that (i) the Cu-alumina sample was exposed toathermal gradient of120 K/cm (planar solidification front) and (2) the 5-126 Cu-Mosample was exposed to athermal gradient of 45 K/cm (cellular solidification front). During the first 15minutes of the experiment, the pulling rate unexpectedly varied from 0.025 to 0.I mm/min. This anomaly ,,...resulted byafailure inthe furnace control system. Here aholding time (v=0) was planned to stabilize the system thermally. Hence, the rate showed afluc- tuation .... \"(5, samples [bubbles] causing Soonly the first two solidifica- tothe pushing ofpar- ticles.\" (5, p.306) Examination ofthe suspension distribution illustrated that the particles had been pushed during solidifica- tion. Inboth samples the particles were shifted normal tothe solidification interface. Reportedly, the Cu-alumina sample contained anagglomeration of particles. This result was attributed to(i) the pushing ofthe particles bythe planar solidification front and (2) the string- ing of particles by the sample preparation procedure (hot extrusion). Examination of the Cu-Mo sample (cellular solidification) indicated apearl-string distribution ofthe par- ticles. This alignment was attributed tothe pushing ofthe par- ticles into the intercellular regions. Reportedly, the observations and obtained values for solidifica- tion velocity corresponded reasonably well with theoretical determinations (see Reference (5)).

This TEXUS 14b sounding rocket experiment was the sixth ina series ofinvestigations designed byGoodhew and/or 14a (this chapter)).

Itisdetailed in the following paragraphs, almost inits entirety.> Reportedly, \"The final system geometry, necessary toobtain dif- ferent heat extraction rates, makes accurate heat flow modelling highly complex. However, itseems that inpractise[sic] the solidification front rapidly entered aquasi-steady state regime. Ithas therefore been assumed that the growth front velocities were constant ineach case and these have been estimated from the thermocouple traces. These traces can beinterpreted inconjunc- tion with the final solidification structure observed inan etched sample inwhich itisobserved that the aluminum matrix has solidified with adendritic morphology.,, (i, p.63) Thus, the first flight sample was solidified ataslow rate (growth front velocity 0.29 mm/s), the second sample atamedium rate (growth front velocity 0.35 mm/s) and the third sample atafast rate (growth front velocity 1.0 mm/s). The three flight samples were compared toground-based samples solidified ata\"slow\" rate (growth front velocity 0.46 mm/s), a medium rate (growth front velocity 0.46 mm/s) and afast rate (growth front velocity 1.14 mm/s). <Note: Itisnot clear why both the slow and medium growth rates for the ground-based samples were reported tobethe same rate.> \"Three sections were machined from each sample (5, I0, and 15mmfrom the heatsink and polished.\" (i, p.63) slowly-solidified, low-gravity and exhibited a\"...significant increase ofsub-4_m 2particles from the bottom tothetop ofthe 5-136 specimen. particles seem tohave been pushed of[sic] the solidifying dendrites reducing the number atthe bottom creasing atthe top...\" \"In the the patter_ isnot so clear.

Directly above 5-140 the sample (within the alumina container) was asection of electrolytic copper. Directly above the electrolytic copper was acapillary volume compensation system (also within the container). The entire arrangement was contained within atan- talum crucible. The volume compensation silicate (i0 mminlength). Nineteen l-mm diameter holes were drilled into the cylinder. The system was designed toavoid Marangoni convection inthe melt, and thus reduce coagulation and formation ofthe particles. \"Magnesium... [silicate] is not wetted bymolten inthe holes and apositive capillary pressure inthe melt results. The melt penetrates into the capillaries during heating and melting and ispressed back during cooling and solidification.\" (4, p. 310) The section ofelectrolytic copper (placed between the volume compensation system and the sample material) prevented penetration ofmolybdenum particles into the capillaries. During the Spacelab D1mission, the Isothermal Heating Facility (IHF) was used tomelt and resolidify the sample. The intent was todirectionally melt the sample from the top downward with an increasing traveling rate. This was tobeaccomplished bymoving the chill block atdifferent speeds during the melt process. Then, the sample was tobedirectionally solidified upward with a decreasing rate. This procedure would have permitted (at various rates ofmovement) the investigation ofthe interaction between the molybdenum particles and the (i) melting front and (2) solidification front. However, because of,,...difficulties with the vacuum system ofthe IHF and further delay during conversion tothe gradient mode .... The slow unidirectional melting had to becanceled.\" (4, p.310) Instead, the sample was rapidly melted from its center and subsequently directionally solidified with decreasing traveling rates ofthe chill-block. Post-flight removal ofthe sample from the tantalum cartridge was performed without difficulty. The outer surface ofthe sample exhibited bubbles \"...in the upper part ofthe sample only, which rapidly solidified after switching off the IHF. Whereas the copper melt has wetted the alumina crucible, the solid phase obviously detached from it. The copper sample and the volume compensation system separated too, when the crucible was opened .... 19pimples, the remainders ofthe menisci sys- tem are clearly visible. tomelting ofthe sample starting atits centre rather than atthe volume compensation system, copper penetrated through cracks inthe alumina crucible and moved along the capillary slit of sample is provided in Reference (4). The following isabrief summary ofthe X-ray image analysis and related discussion.> Post-flight examination ofthe sample revealed nocharacteristics ofglobal There was noclustering orskeletal formation ofthe molybdenum particles. Several different types ofbubbles were observed inthe samples. Spherical bubbles, some ofwhich contained copper, were present. Molybdenum particles were also found within the bubbles. Some of these particles were i0to20microns indiameter and exhibited a perfect crystalline shape. This result indicated that the Mo particles grew within the bubbles. Inaddition to spherical bubbles, tear-shaped bubbles were also observed. The slim end of these bubbles pointed toward the hot end ofthe sample (an analysis ofthis result isincluded inReference (4)). Reportedly, \"The volume percentage of bubbles clearly in- creases.., with increasing sample temperature and time. The num- ber ofbubbles decreases inthe same direction, e.g., with in- creasing volume content ofthe bubbles[,] coagulation was more frequent. This isstrengthened bythe fact that inthe vicinity oflarge bubbles only very few small bubbles are found.\" (4, p. 312) \"If auniform gas generation inthe molten sample isassumed, the increase percentage ofthe bubbles beattributed toMarangoni Alternatively, anin- crease ingas generation with increasing duration inthe molten state and the maximum melt temperature may beconsidered. The latter assumption issupported bythe absence ofbubbles inthe upper sample region consisting ofelectrolyte copper. Inthis region nooxygen for bubble formation was available. Afurther argument against Marangoni migration ofthe bubbles isthe strong covering oftheir surfaces bymolybdenum particles. These did not just deposite[sic] but also crystallized within the bubbles, which requires long times free ofstirring.\" (4, p. 313) Addi- tional discussion ofthe possible bubble migration modes are presented inReference (4). Itwas concluded that the volume compensation system did not work as intended. The system \"...was hardly able todoso, since melting did not start atits position. Itappears that... [it] worked more due toits due lary and thus incapillary pressure not tocause successive rather than simultaneous filling and clearing ofthe 5-142 capillaries.\" (4, Demixing of Transparent Liquids\" (Chapter 17).> Words: Composites with Solid Particles, Binary Systems, Dis- persion Alloys, Melt and Solidification, Directional Solidifica- tion, Metallic Dispersion, Buoyancy Forces, Wetting, Wetting of Container, Solidification Front Physics, Inclusion and/or Rejection ofParticles, Thermal Gradient, Solidification Rate, Composites with Gases, Gas Formation, Bubbles, Bubble For- mation, Porosity, Crucible Effects, Free Surface Elimination, Meniscus Shape, Volume Compensation, Volume Expansion, Capil- laries, Capillary Forces, Liquid Leakage, Hardware Malfunction, Processing Difficulties Sample Materials: copper containing Applications: Acopper sample with molybdenum particles was used for this ex- periment because the sample was to be compared to specific materials processed during earlier microgravity studies (see Deruyttere, TEXUS 9;P6tschke, with aface-centered cubic structure.

Each sample wheel had 14spokes dedicated toholding samples. A single sample was placed onthe end ofeach ofthese spokes. The indexing motor was used toturn the wheel and thus position each sample inthe path ofthe electron beam for melting. Afifteenth spoke (in each ofthe sample wheels) was used toalign the beam.

One ofthe samples was heavily and thermal instabilities, constitutional supercooling, etc. Reportedly, the experimental procedure was the same as that employed during Walter's earlier SL-3 experiment (see Walter, Skylab SL-3). Post-flight analysis ofthe undoped space crystals confirmed the data obtained from the SL-3 mission samples. The crystals were tear-drop shaped; the (ii0) facets very well developed. The (Iii), (-i-i-i), and particularly the {211) facets were smaller and more disturbed than the (ii0) facets. Chemical etching showed edge dislocations onthe (-i-i-i) planes which terminated with Inatoms. The pattern ofdislocation distribution within the crystal and the dislocation density (100/cm _) were also similar tothe SL-3 samples with the exception that (I) the SL-4 samples did not exhibit the ring-shaped mark (which reportedly had resulted during avehicle maneuver during SL-3) or (2) the corresponding local increase indislocation density. 6-13 The Sedoped InSb sample was with aspace-grown length ofapproximately 2cm (l-cm diameter). The interface between the solid and liquid portions was convex throughout the solidification process.

The experiment was performed anelectromagnetic levitation nace housed within the Electromagnetic mission, The cusp coil, which consisted ofadjacent coils which had opposing, alternating magnetic fields, was used tomelt the sample by induction heating. Thermal control was set bytimers such that the experiment sequence was (I) application of full power, (2) reduction ofpower, and (3) low power mode. Inthe low power mode, enough power was supplied tomaintain the sample position against residual acceleration forces.

(Corresponding ground-based studies were performed using anapparatus similar tothe flight processing facility which was constructed byThe General Electric Company.) Unexpectedly, the flight sample contained large grain sizes: averaging about 700 microns. Itwas concluded, therefore, that the addition ofBeO did not produce finer grains orretard grain growth. The reasons for the lack ofgrain refinement may have been because the particles (i) were not stable inthe melt, (2) did not possess amaximum surface area, or (3) did not have op- timum surface characteristics. \"It may bepossible that as a result ofthe long molten dwell, the particles change their sur- face character as well as become inactive as sites for heterogeneous nucleation; however, this could not beobserved at 30000X.

Such reduction was thought toresult insmaller primary crystals within the contained within crucibles. During the melting ofthe samples, crucible constituents often react with sample constituents, chemically contaminating the glass. Asthe glass solidifies during the later part of processing, heterogeneous nucleation sites often result because the material isincontact with the container wall. Glasses which are processed inalow-gravity en- vironment donot have tobecontained. Itistherefore expected that defects attributed tothe container should beavoided. This SPAR 6experiment The objective of the experiment was toevaluate the capability ofthe experimental equipment toposition, melt, and solidify aglass sample under flight conditions. The experiment hardware consisted of(i) afurnace with silicon carbide elements, (2) asingle-axis acoustic positioning device, (3) aPt-30% Rhinjection cage, and (4) amotion picture camera. Amassive copper cooling shroud was used for radiation cooling of the sample. Other equipment associated with the hardware in- cluded (i) electronics, (2) timers, (3) temperature control equipment, (4) sample injection mechanism, and (5) furnace wall gates. During approximately 4minutes ofthe SPAR 6low-gravity rocket phase, 39.3 Ga203-35.7 mol% Ca0-25.Omol% SiO2was (i) injected into the furnace hot zone, (2) completely meIted and soaked at1575 \u00b0C, being Ca2Ga2SiO7. Platinum (with some Rhpresent) was reported asthe probable cause ofthe crystal nucleation. The most likely cause ofPtpresence was either \"...(i) mechanical transfer from the loose-fitting injection cage during lift-off ofthe rocket or(2) surface diffusion from the platinum-rhodium wire which was in contact with the glass sample during most ofthe flight experi- ment cycle.\" (i, p.III-2) Itwas crystallization would bereduced if(i) the Ptcage firmly gripped the sample (prior to experiment initiation) toeliminate its rattling during lift-off and (2) the acoustic positioning device prevented contact with the injection cage during processing. Conclusions related tothe performance ofthe experimental ap- paratus included: (i) The furnace and heating elements survived the launch environ- ment. (2) The flight sample was completely melted during the flight in- dicating that the processing temperature time cycle was adequate. (3) \"The acoustic positioning device was able tocapture the sample, despite arough injection. After several contacts with the cage during the first nine seconds, the acoustic positioner satisfactorily prevented contact ofthe sample with furnace com- ponents for 27seconds before itcontacted the cage wire.\" (i, p.

The overall objective of the experiment was to evaluate the capability of the employed experimental equipment to position, melt, and solidify aglass sample under flight conditions. Be- cause of earlier hardware difficulties onSPAR 6,additional ob- jectives ofthe SPAR 8experiment included (i) increasing the sonic positioning time toencompass the entire heating and cool- ing cycle,and (2) eliminating sample platinum contamination. The experiment hardware was similar tothat used byHappe during the SPAR 6experiment (see Happe, SPAR 6for adetailed hardware description); only the acoustic positioning device and Ptinjec- tion cage wire had been changed for the SPAR 8mission. During the earlier SPAR 6experiment byHappe, asingle spherical sample of asilica-modified gallia-calcia glass was melted and solidified inasingle-axis acoustic positioning device. Because the sample levitation time (during that mission) was much shorter than intended (27 seconds vs. the intended 240 seconds) and be- cause this anomaly was suspected tohave been due toasig- nificant drop insonic power, the acoustic positioning device was now equipped with alarger sonic driver. Further, because the SPAR 6glass sample was contaminated with Pt (from the wires of the injection cage) and underwent anunexpected crystallization, the cage wires (in the area which gripped the sample) were covered with alumina beads. Itwas believed that the alumina would prevent the mechanical transfer ofPttothe sample. 6-32 During the SPAR 8sounding rocket mission, the High Temperature Single-Axis Levitation Furnace was Ga203-35.7 CAO-25.0 mol% SiO2. The expected experiment timeline and processing temperatures were not detailed. Itwas reported that the SPAR 8rocket was successfully launched and achieved low-gravity conditions with normal flight experiment operation. However, during the re-entry phase, \"The payload parachute opened prematurely at [a] higher-than-planned altitude resulting inknotting ofthe central portion ofthe parachute and tearing ofthe fabric.

Therefore, elimination ofPtcontamination ofthe sample could not beverified. However, the film recording ofthe experiment was located and processed. Post-flight analysis ofthe film indicated that the sample im- pacted the sample cage during processing, resulting inits at- tachment to the cage wires.

After the release, the samples oscillated inthe acous- tic field for 40-50 seconds and then became almost stationary in the acoustic energy well. The samples remained stationary during and after melting but began tooscillate again during the cooling sequence. The first sample, alumina, was used toverify SAAL performance (as discussed earlier). The second sample (calcia- gallia- silica) was found solidified onthe wire cage which surrounded the sample within the SAAL during processing. (The cage was used tocatch samples if, for some reason, they were not held within the acoustic well.) The photographic record indicated \"...that the sample struck and adhered tothe cage when the cooling gate ofthe SAAL containing alarge air bubble) resulted inanellipsoidal piece of solid glass rather than the expected highly spherical shell ofuniform wall thick- ness.

During anucleus can ifthe energy as- sociated with the free enthalpy difference between the solid and liquid exceeds the energy contribution ofthe newly formed inter- face. This energy level corresponds to the activation energy required for astable orgrowing nuclei toexist. During heterogeneous nucleation, otherphases, either within the melt (e.g., impurities) or incontact with the melt surface (e.g., crucible wall), participate inthe process. These phases significantly reduce the activation energy required for the for- mation ofstable nuclei. Thus, before homogeneous nucleation is possible, heterogeneous nucleation decreases the amount ofunder- cooling possible. Since undercooled melts are thermodynamically in anon- equilibrium state (i) non-equilibrium solidification ispossible and (2) formation of non-equilibrium phases results. These solid-state, metastable phases have physical properties which can significantly differ from equilibrium phases. Homogeneous nucleation depends onthe thermodynamic properties ofthe melt and, therefore, isanintrinsic property. However, heterogeneous nucleation isextrinsic and, therefore, can be influenced by (controllable) experimental parameters. For example, container- less solidification (the elimination percentage.> During the mission, \"The experiment was performed inthe temperature range 760 \u00b0C([sample] melting point) toi000 \u00b0Cwith heating rates of i0to20\u00b0C/s.

The Sicontained inthe sample had been oxidized indicating that the atmosphere was not sufficiently pure. Solidification was initiated when the sample contacted the wire cage. Alamellar eutectic structure formed at the wire/sample contact point. The lamellae increased insize with increasing distance from the contact point. This result indi- cated that atthe point where the sample contacted the wire cage, both heterogeneous nucleation and ahigh cooling rate had oc- curred.

The specific objective ofthe experiment was to investigate the liquid-vapor phase transition of sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, atthe critical density. (The experiment was mKbelow the critical temperature, Tc. During the low-gravity flight, the cell was heated tothe single phase vapor region (Tc +400 mK). While temperature measurements were made atthe center ofthe fluid and atthe cell wall, the phase transition was documented bya16mmmovie (cine) camera. Rotation ofthe fluid, attributed tothe spin stabilization of the rocket was noted during the initial stages ofthe experiment. \"...damping ofthis flow took approximately 1minute. The two phases could easily bediscerned, due tothe difference oftheir refractive indices, as large inhomogeneous particles.\" (3, p. 246) Itwas also reported that \"During Transfer, Ther- mal Diffusion, Thermal Equilibrium, Critical Density, Interface Stability, Interface Physics, Rotating Fluids, Acceleration Ef- fects, Rocket Motion, Fluid Motion Damping, Liquid Dynamic Response, Spinodal Decomposition, Nucleation NumberofSamples: one change.

The HPT contained (i) a30-mm diameter, l-mm thick coin- shaped sample cell filled with SF6 and (2) afour-stage scanning ratio calorimeter. During the mlsslon, the calorimeter was used todetermine gSF6ofcriti- cal density (0.737 point (from T-Tc=-i00 mKtoT-Tc=+i00 mK). Reportedly, \"Despite the reduced experiment time of four days, four different heating rates (dT/dt =3.6, i0, 20and i00 mK/h) could beaccomplished. around the critical point of/T-Tc/=50and /t-tc/=i00 mK and were re- second.\" (8, p.188) Low-gravity specific heat (Cv) measurements were compared to theoretical predictions and ground-based measurements. While theory predicted that an enhanced peak inCv(at the critical temperature) would occur inthe low-gravity environment, the Cv vs. temperature curves were surprisingly below that predicted. The expected peak Cvdegenerated toaslight hump. \"In the four heating ramps the cell CO[which isproportional toCv] was measured and showed The \"peaks\" were also lower than l-g reference measurements. \"These quite unexpected results cannot beexplained by malfunction of hardware; after landing, the experiments were repeated inthe original flight configuration and the critical peak was again ob- served.

During each cycle, the measurements were made successively at i, 0.i and i0kHz.

The specific objective ofthe experiment was todetermine the feasibility ofgrowing single crystals byatechnique inwhich two reactant solutions diffuse toward each other through apure solvent. This method ofcrystal growth isclosely related to growth bythe gel method. Prior tothe flight, sixexperiment reactors were prepared to study three different crystal growth systems (two reactors f_ each system). The reactors were constructed ofaclear Lexan _'* polycarbonate resin and were equipped with silicone rubber gas- kets and seals. Each reactor contained three chambers. The 8-12 chamber containing the solvent was sandwiched between two cham- bers, each ofwhich contained areactant solution. (The chambers varied inlength.) Separating the chambers were porous, glass diaphragms. Prior todelivery tothe launch site, the chambers were filled with the appropriate solutions. During the ASTP mission three crystal growth reactions were studied. Inthe first reaction, calcium tartrate (CaC4H406) was grown from aqueous ofCaCl 2and NaHC4H406. ofCaCl 2and (NH4)2CO 3. Inthe third reaction, was grown from solutions ofPbCl 2and CH3CSNH2.While under low-gravity conditions, the experiments were initiated by opening intercompartment valves and allowing the solutions to diffuse together. Atthe start ofthe experiment anastronaut photographed the six reactors with a35mmcamera. During the following 116 hours the astronaut photographed the reactors once every 12hours. (Aframing device was used toproperly position the camera.) The reactions were allowed tooccur atcabin- ambient temperatures. Itwas reported that the experiment operated asplanned with no observed leakage ofthe fluids before orduring the experiment. Post-flight examination ofthe photographs and grown crystals in- dicated that \"Crystals ofabout the expected size, quality, and number formed inall six reactors.\" (i, p.558) Itwas noted that the temperature variation inthe spacecraft, between 60OFand 75 OF, was greater than expected. Reportedly, the calcium tartrate crystals were the best obtained. This result was expected because these crystals are among the easiest togrow using the gel method. The calcium tartrate reactors prismatic crystals, the plate-like crystals were larger and more numerous than the prismatic crystals. X-ray dif- fraction studies indicated that they were ofgood quality. Some crystals about i0mm in length were also formed, but their quality was not asgood asthe shorter crystals. Both calcium carbonate reactors produced numerous well-formed, clear rhombohedral crystals aslong as 0.5 mmonedge. These crystals were similar inappearance tothose grown onEarth and were large enough toexhibit most ofthe crystals adhered tothe polycarbonate walls ofthe reactor in- dicating that this material was not the best choice to demonstrate this reaction. 8-13 Reportedly, the two PbS experiments were not considered success- ful, although discrete single crystals aslarge as0.i mmwere produced. The mixing and reaction process was not completed prior tore-entry. Even after return ofthe reactors, afine precipitate continued togrow. This indicated that for crystal system, alonger period oftime orahigher temperature isrequired toobtain high concluded that low-gravity processing resulted incrystals ofapproximately asthose ob- gel method length oftime). \"Nucleation was excessive inall six reactors, which indicates the need for considerable refinement of the experimental parameters tosuppress nucleation and improve crystals size and quality. Precise temperature control and longer growth times are probably the two main improvements tobemade.\" (i, p.562) Key Words: CrystalGrowth From Ternary Sys- tems, Insoluble Crystals, Single Crystals, Solvent, Diffusion, Double Diffusion, Liquid/Liquid Diffusion, Diffusive Mass Trans- fer, Diffusion-Controlled Growth, Buoyancy-Driven Convection, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Thermal Environ- ment More Extreme Than Predicted, Crystal Morphology, Crystalline Structure, Nucleation, Platelike Structure, Birefringence, Wet- ting, Liquid Reservoir, Contained Fluids, Material Interaction With Containment Facility, CrucibleEffects, Optics Applications, Semiconductors, Semiconductor Applications, Electronic Materials, Incomplete Sample Processing NumberofSamples:six SampleMaterlals: ingel systems.

LDEF was toberetrieved after approximately 9 months. However, the structure remained inorbit for nearly 6 years because shuttle flights were delayed following the loss of the space shuttle Challenger. LDEF was eventually retrieved at analtitude ofapproximately 180 nautical miles. This Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) experiment was the third inaseries ofinvestigations designed byLind and/or Niel- sen etal. tostudy conditions (see Lind, ASTP; Nielsen, Spacelab 1(this chapter)). The specific objective ofthe experiment was to produce high quality crystals using (i) the Opposite Oriented Diffusion (OOD) method and (2) the low-gravity environment provided bythe LDEF. Four specially designed reactors were employed for the experi- ments. Two ofthe reactors were constructed from stainless steel, the others from Teflon TM. Each reactor contained three 8-17 chambers. Two ofthe chambers were reservoirs which contained the reactant solutions. Between the two reservoir chambers was a reactant chamber which contained asolvent. The solutions in each ofthe three chambers were separated byvalves toprevent contact between the reactants prior to LDEF deployment. (The motorized valves were designed to prevent unwanted convection when opened.) See Reference (2) or (8) for adetailed discus- sion ofthe experimental apparatus. The crystal growth experiments involved asolute diffusion process inwhich liquid reactant solutions diffused into pure solvent (in the reaction chamber) and reacted chemically toform single crystals. Three different growth systems were inves- tigated during the LDEF Mission: (i) CaCO3(calcite-type) single from solutions ofCaCl2and NH4HCO 3inwater, (2) tetrathiofulvalene-tetracyanoquinidime\u00a3hane (TTF-TCNQ) single crystals were grown from solutions of TTF and TCNQ in acetonitrile, and (3) PbS crystals from PbCl 2and CH3CSNH 2inwater. (The CaCO 3and PbS crystals were grown in the stainless steel reactors and the TTF-TCNQ experiments were grown inthe Teflon TMreactors.) These crystal growth experiments were performed onthe LDEF be- cause they require more low-gravity growth time than the 5-10 days available during aspace shuttle flight. The experiment had been designed tooperate for approximately 2months, and then remain dormant for the remainder ofthe flight. Although the LDEF remained inorbit much longer than originally planned, the additional time did not have any significant effect onthe crys- tal growth process orthe crystals produced. Reportedly, \"The CaCO 3experiment produced numerous clear, well- formed single ortwinned crystals ranging between 1and 6mmin longest dimension, which issubstantially larger than previous solution growth results. These crystals have an acute scalenohedral habit very different from the habits that wehave obtained previously [on Earth and inspace]. Their habit islike that of some natural calcite crystals, but very unlike the familiar rhombohedral habit of Iceland spar. The twinning is like that ofnatural calcite. \"The TTF-TCNQ experiment also produced numerous well formed single crystals. They are smaller than the largest crystals grown previously, but are adequate in size and quality for analysis. Their habit isalso very different from that obtained previously [on Earth and inspace]. The crystals are thin rec- tangular plates with the crystallographic baxis perpendicular to the plate. That iscontrary toall our previous crystal growth experiments, inwhich the baxis has been the preferred direction ofgrowth.\" (Reference (5)) <Note: Previous related space ex- are detailed inReference (s).> <Note: References (6), (7), (8) and (9) were received just prior tothe publication ofthis technical memorandum.

Toachieve these objectives, two types ofcrystal growth were attempted: (i) epitaxial growth of PbSnTe on substrate and editors.> Prior tothe rocket flight, the experiment sample material was prepared. \"The substrate for the epitaxial growth was a(i00) surface ofthe PbTe single crystal. The... [substrates] were cut from the ingot, polished, and etched byHBr +Br2(5% )etchant incontact with the substrate at600 C for i0minutes. After cooling, the substrate and the Pbmelt was [sic] enclosed invacuum bya... [quartz] capsule.\" (i, p.294) During the rocket flight, one electric furnace was used to process the sample. Approximately 80seconds after rocket launch the furnace was switched onand the material was heated to650 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0Cover the intended temperature). After rapid cooling to 600 \u00b0C, the material was held atthis point for about 4minutes. Cooling below the Pbmelt temperature was then accomplished by application ofHegas. 8-24 Post-flight examination ofthe material revealed that the surface ofthe Pbmelt was round, indicating solidification under low- gravity conditions. While sometimes, when Pbismelted onEarth, the Pbwill react with the quartz and the transparent ampoule surface becomes opaque; this did not occur inthe low-gravity sample, which suggested that the sample solidified without con- tacting the quartz wall. Metallographic examination ofthe PbTe substrate indicated a meltback caused by temperature Squares of epitaxially grown 3Te _ere found deter-mined microanalysis Examination of the Pbmelt revealed squares ofPbSnTe crystals covering the surface. Surface tension forces resulted inaslightly convex PbSnTe sur- face. \"Also wecan see some parallel faces.., suggesting that these crystals have the same crystalline axis. [In] Other words, they are the [sic] thin single crystal inspite of... some cracks caused bythe convex curve ofthe surface.\" (i, p. 296) X-ray Laue patterns indicated the PbSnTe thin film had a(i00) surface. Other crystalline axes also had the same orientation. This characteristic was not observed inl-g processed materials. Reportedly, without convection, under low-gravity conditions, nuclei were not moved throughout the melt. Therefore, athin film grew onthe melt surface. Eventually, this film covered the entire surface. This suggested that low-gravity conditions will permit the formation ofathin, single crystalline film. <Note: Although it appeared that this experiment could be in- cluded inthe \"Crystal Growth From the Melt\" chapter (Chapter i0), Segawa indicated that the appropriate chapter for the ex- periment was \"Crystal Growth From Solution\".> Key Words: Crystal Growth From Solution, Melt and Solidification, Metallic Solutions, Ternary Systems, Single Crystals, Substrates, Epitaxial Growth, Free Surface, Wetting, Surface Tension, Menis- cus Growth Kinetics, Buoyancy Effects Diminished, Homogeneous Nucleation, Solid/Liquid Interface, Quench Process, Crystal Morphology, Surface Morphology, Crystal- line Structure, Cracks, Films, Thin Films, Film Microstructure, Sample Detachment From Crucible, Coated Surfaces, Non-Wetting of Container, Thermal Environment More Extreme Than Predicted, Fur- nace Malfunction, Semiconductors, Semiconductor Results Rocket.

The apparatus consisted ofahot plate (solute cup) and acold plate (sting) maintained bysmall ther- moelectric heat pumps. Heat was extracted from the cold sting upon which aseed crystal was glued. \"Imbedded inthe solute cup was acavity containing solute enrichment crystals, which were separated from the growth chamber byascreen.\" (2, p.3) Prior tothe shuttle launch, \"the cell\" was filled with TGS solution.

A.N., insoluble substances may begrown from solution bythe Opposite Oriented Diffusion (OOD) method. The method allows diffusion oftwo ormore reactant solutions through asolvent toward acentral area where acrystal isprecipitated. OnEarth, both the transport process and crystal growth are heavily influenced bygravity-driven convection. This convection can cause the growth of(i) many small crystals and (2) crystals with anirregular array ofdislocations. Itwas expected that a reduction inconvective flow (made possible inalow-gravity environment) would allow the production of (i) larger crystals, (2) crystals with fewer dislocations, and (3) crystals containing regular dislocation patterns. This Spacelab 1experiment was the second inaseries (see Lind, ASTP (this chapter)). Initially, itwas proposed crystals (TetraThiaFulvalene-TetraCyNoQuinodimethane) should beprocessed. TTF-TCNQ crystal isofinterest state physicists be- cause ofits unique single crystal conductivity properties. Be- cause this crystal growth system required acetonitrile asasol- vent, and Spacelab safety requirements did not permit the use of acetonitrile, growth systems using either water orweak acid asa solvent were eventually selected. 8-48 Prior to the Spacelab 1flight, 12 reaction chambers were prepared tostudy three different crystal growth systems. Each reactor contained three chambers: two reservoir chambers and one reaction chamber. Each reservoir chamber contained areactant solution. The chambers were configured with arubber wall to suppress air bubbles and provide equal pressure for the three chambers. During the Spacelab 1mission, crystal growth ofthe following systems were complex, (NH_) 1_Pt(C204)2; (2) calcium tartrate, CaC4H406; (3) calcium carbonate, CaCO 3. The experiments were initiated byopening valves between the chambers ineach ofthe reactors. After the valves were open, the appropriate reactant solutions diffused into the central reaction chamber and the two solutions combined toform the in- tended single crystal. <Note: Half ofthe reaction chambers used valves with teflon filters. OnEarth, these teflon filters are used toprevent unwanted convection which may occur when the valves are opened.> The temperature ofthe reaction chambers was maintained at40\u00b0C. Post-flight, itwas reported that the experiment proceeded as planned (temperature control, opening ofthe valves). \"However, during the prolonged waiting period prior to launch, the Platinum-complex molecules desintegrated [sic] chemically, and the low-dimensional crystal growth experiments did not yield any useful results. Four ofthe remaining six experiments were successful. Two of those grew Calcium-Carbonate, two grew Calcium-Tartrate.\" (i, p.190) Ofthe successful experiments, only the results from the calcium- tartrate growth system were reported. It appears that the employed teflon filters permitted aslower and more controlled growth rate ofthe calcium-tartrate crystals. \"It isobvious from the results that filters were necessary between the reser- voirs and the growth chamber .... This isindicative ofsome g- levels being present during the mission causing too much convec- tion inthe crystallization chamber with nofilter protection.\" (i, p. 191) <Note: More detailed reporting ofthe experimental results could not belocated.> 8-49 KeyWords: Crystal Growth From Solution, Reactant Solutions, Aqueous Solutions, Organic Crystals, Insoluble Crystals, Single Crystals, Solvent, Diffusion, Double Diffusion, Liquid/Liquid Diffusion, Diffusive Mass Transfer, Diffusion-Controlled Growth, Buoyancy-Driven Convection, Precipitation, Inter- face, Solid/Liquid Interface, Acceleration Effects, Crystal Mor- phology, Crystalline Structure, Dislocations, Bubbles, Liquid Reservoir, Contained Fluids, Deterioration ofLoaded Samples Prior to Launch, Optics Applications, Electronic Materials, was selected was Proceedings ofMeasurement and Characteriza- tion ofthe Acceleration Environment OnBoard 1986, Guntersville, Alabama, pp. K.F.and Lind, M.D.: LDEF, and the EURECA Mis- sions.

The potential was placed across the electrodes, initiating crystal growth onthe anode. Reportedly, the _rowth chamber temperature was toberegulated at20\u00b0C(+/- i0_C). (Adocument published prior to the flight indicated that several small heaters were available tomaintain the required temperature should the tem- perature fall below i0\u00b0C.) The growth process was documented by intermittent flash photographs. <Note: Although prior tothe shuttle flight itwas reported that \"...crystal [was] tobegin when the best micro-gravity conditions exist[ed At the first available [low-gravity] period lasting 4hours ormore...,\" (2, p. 127) post-flight documentation did not indicate ifthis timing was achieved.> Reportedly, \"Several primary payloads on this Shuttle mission failed [not including this one], sothe mission was terminated early toavoid apotential weather problem atlanding.

Although the crystals are.., much smaller than what would beex- pected for Earth-like-conditions, the growth process was demonstrated. This position isconfirmed with the high quality photographs taken during the mission. The orbital environment was distinctly colder than that anticipated inadvance, and this factor ismost likely the major cause ofthe smaller size ofthe product.

The quest for methods tosynthesize high quality single crystals ofthese highly conducting materials has been avery important part ofprevious research. Because ofthe anisotropic nature of these compounds, impurities and defects will strongly influence the unique physical properties ofthe most reproducible and purest crystals thus far.

Various methods have been developed toproduce such crystals onEarth including (i) gel diffusion and (2) frit- controlled diffusion. However, these techniques have been unable toproduce the required high quality single crystals for non- linear optical property investigations. Gravity-induced effects such assedimentation, convection, and turbulence are believed to be responsible for crystal defects (e.g. ,occlusions, dislocations) which reduce the quality ofthe material. This STS-019 experiment was sponsored bythe tostudy low-gravity, organic crystal growth. The specific objective ofthe experiment was to investigate the growth ofurea and other organic crystals by chemical precipitation and Ostwald ripening. The experiment was performed insix reactors. Reportedly, five ofthe chambers contained proprietary materials. Thus, only a single reactor designed tostudy the precipitation ofurea crys- tals was discussed bythe investigators. The urea crystal growth experiment was performed inthe Diffusive Mixing ofOrganic Solutions (DMOS) cell. The cell was contained in aNASA-supplied Experiment Apparatus Container (EAC). (See Reference (i) for acomplete hardware description.) The urea reactor consisted ofthree chambers. Reportedly, \"...an organic chemical solution [urea/methanol] iscontained inone end chamber ofthe reactor. The solution isallowed todiffuse into the two remaining chambers [each containing toluene], which are filled with anincompatible solvent that causes the organic chemicals to 8-63 crystallize out ofthe solution.\" (5, p.20) Prior toopening the valves between the chambers, the cell and solutions were preheated for 5hours. After preheating, the valves were slowly opened over another 5hour period. (This valve-openning portion ofthe experiment took place during the crew sleep period such that the fluid system would experience a minimum disturbance with respect to g-level.) The valves remained open for the remainder of the flight (176 hours). During this period, the temperature ofthe cell was maintained at 30\u00b0C. Crystal collection byfiltration occurred with 56hours after the landing ofthe space shuttle. Reportedly, crystal growth caused bymixing occurred during and after re-entry tol-g conditions. Post-flight examination of the low-gravity processed urea materials revealed that the crystals had anaverage length of 8.16 mmand anaverage width of0.48 mm. had anaverage length of6.08 mmand anaverage width ofi.i0 mm. Average growth of the space-processed crystals were reported tobe0.0106 mm3/hour, an_ average growth Earth-grown crystals were 0.0432 mm_/hour. Generally, the Earth- grown crystals were thicker and contained more light-scattering centers than the low-gravity material. Seventy-eight percent of the crystals (1.64 gr) grown under low-gravity conditions were located inthe central chamber, \"...suggesting that crystal growth occurred when the urea solution diffused into toluene, but not vice versa. However, there was noinformation astohow much crystal growth occurred inthe end chambers during and after [shuttle] re-entry .... In contrast, the ground-based results showed that virtually all ofthe crystal growth occurred inthe end chamber containing the urea/methanol solution, suggesting that the initial diffusion ofsolutions and nucleation processes involved mechanisms which were different from the space-grown crystals.\" (I, p.677) The crystal yield for the low-gravity experiment was 30.29% ver- sus 37.68% for the ground-based study. This difference may have been caused bythe greater extent ofmixing inthe terrestrial solutions because ofgravitational effects (e.g., convection caused bytemperature and density gradients). Elemental analysis and x-ray powder diffraction experiments did not reveal sig- nificant differences (within experimental error) between the low- gravity and l-g processed materials. However, shape-factor analysis (see Reference (I)) indicated that \"...the shape ofthe space grown crystals and crystal morphology was per- formed using semi-empirical, quantum mechanical calculations (see Reference (i) for details). Comparison ofthese calculations to the experimental results led to the conclusion that \"The preferred growth direction of urea is along the... [bar-4 axis]..., the direction along which hydrogen bonding ismost sig- nificant, suggesting that urea crystal isdominated byintermolecular interactions inthe ofcrystal growth experiments inmicrogravity.\" (i, p.679) Key Words: CrystalGrowth From Solution, Organic Crystals, Single Crystals, Model Materials, Solvent, Diffusion, Diffusive Mass Transfer, Double Diffusion, Diffusion-Controlled Growth, Liquid/Liquid Rate, Liquid/Liquid In- terface, Solid/Liquid Interface, Crystal Morphology, Crystalline Defects, Dislocations, Needles, Occlusions, Three-Dimensional Crystalline Structure, Contained Fluids, Liquid Reservoir, Non- linear Optical Materials, optics Applications, CoatedSurfaces, Acceleration Effects, Vehicle Re-entry Forces/Vibration NumberofSamples: Six reaction cells, although onlythe results from only one cell were reported.

Diffusive growth should produce crystals that are larger and ofhigher purity than crystals grown onEarth. During alow-gravity space shuttle mission, crew and payload ac- aswell attitude maneuvers result intran- sient accelerations onthe of10-3g. Theoretical models have indicated that (i) these accelerations can result inconvec- tive flows and (2) these flows, inturn, may overwhelm the dif- fusive transport. This STS-031 Egbert, STS-019 (this chapter)). The specific objectives ofthe experiment were to (I) characterize the dominant transport mechanisms active during the reduced gravity shuttle flight and (2) examine the effect ofthe shuttle gravity conditions oncrystal growth. During the STS-031 mission, the Diffusive Mixing ofOrganic used toinvestigate (I) mixing ofdif- fering density solutions and (2) organic crystal growth. The ap- paratus, which was configured inaNASA-supplied Experiment Ap- paratus Container (EAC), contained six, three-chambered reactors. (The three-chamber design kept the reagents separate until the 8-67 experiment wasactivated.) AGeneric thatemployed during initial solution mixing. 8-68 For the next 130 hours, the solutions were allowed tomix during regular crew and orbital maneuver activities. Atthe end ofthis period, the valves ofthe two fluid dynamics (mixing) experiments were closed to isolate the contents of each chamber for post- flight analysis. Twelve hours later, the experiment was com- pletely deactivated. Itwas noted that the valves for the four crystal growth experiments were left open toallow any unmixed solutions tocompletely mix during re-entry and landing. Approximately 18hours after landing, the experiment was removed and returned toalaboratory for analysis. Atthis time, the flight experiment was duplicated inthe laboratory under similar thermal conditions. The following paragraphs present the results and discussion from the two fluid dynamics (mixing) experiments and two ofthe crys- tal growth experiments. Itappears that the results from the remaining two crystal growth experiments were not reported (in the available publications) because they employed proprietary materials. Fluid Dynamics Experiments Large Density Difference Mixing Reactor: Concentration inthis reactor ofthe chloroform was determined using gas ofthe deter- reported that sive transfer ofcomponents occurred during the 130 hour experi- ment time. Calculation ofthe diffusion times (characteristic diffusion length of6-12 cm) and esti_ate_ binary diffusivity of chloroform and heptane of2or3xi0-_cm_/s) indicated that for diffusive mixing, 400 to1600 hours would be required toreach equilibrium. Further calculations indicated that more than 2000 hours would be required. The fact that the actual experiment time was considerably less than any ofthese calculated diffusive mixing times \"...demonstrates unambiguously that convective transport far exceeded Small Density Difference Mixing Reactor: UV-VIS spectroscopy analysis indicated that after 130 hours the basic yellow and methylene blue solutions remained largely un- mixed. Apartial mixing ofthe dyes inthe center chamber was reported. Mole fraction versus distance data demonstrated ahigh degree ofsymmetry, illustrating the isotropic nature solution ofDMBA was countersolvent (see Reference (2) for details ofprocedures). The solutions had relatively large density dif- ferences and, therefore, mixing must have occurred because ofor- biter accelerations. This result was confirmed inthe large den- sity difference, fluids dynamics experiment. The total mass ofcrystals obtained from the space experiment was 89% ofthe total mass ofcrystals obtained during the ground- based investigation. The space crystals were narrower and had a higher aspect ratio than the l-g crystals. This result was ex- plained \"...based onthe anticipated differences between the space and Earth interracial boundary layers ordepletion zones present inthe nutrient solution around the growing crystals.\" (2, p.587) (See Reference (2) for details.) The reduced convec- tion during the low-g experiment did not produce crystals ofsu- perior size, purity, oroptical uniformity when compared tothe Earth crystals. Both l-g and low-g crystals contained solvent inclusions and the melting points ofboth materials had similar sharpness. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and powder x-ray studies revealed nodifferences. Second CrystalGrowth Experiment TetraThiaFulvalene-TetraCyaNoQuinodimethane (TTF-TCNQ) Crystals: The two end chambers ofthis growth reactor designated ascham- bers (A) and (C) contained acetonitrile solutions ofTCNQ (0.0147 molar, chamber (A)) and TTF (0.0132 molar, chamber (C)). The center chamber (B) contained acetonitrile. The density dif- ferences between the solutions and the solvent were about 0.02 g/ml, and, therefore, the convective contributions should have been approximately the same asthat observed inthe yellow and blue dye mixing experiment. 8-70 Two different types ofcrystals were recovered from the low-g experiment: (i) planar blades orplatelets (20 mmx3mm, 24.4 mg) and (2) microcrystalline needles (293 mg). The l-g experi- ment produced only needles which indicated that the needles from the flight experiment were probably produced during the landing ofthe shuttle. The few large crystals obtained during space processing were much larger than those obtained onEarth. This result was attributed tothe dominance ofdiffusive transport un- der low-gravity conditions. However, the low-g crystals did not possess ahigh degree ofperfection: they were not ofuniform shape nor did they have sharp, well-defined edges. The normal- ized conductivity measurements indicated that the Earth-grown crystals were ofhigher quality. Itwas also reported that x-ray diffraction studies indicated that the l-g and low-g materials were crystallographically equivalent. Elemental analysis also detected nodifferences. Itwas concluded that convective mixing occurred inthose experi- ments involving fluids with large density differences. However, for those slight density difference, diffusive mixing was dominant despite the milligravity tomicrogravity accelerations present during the mission. Regardless ofthe active transport mechanism, the space crystals were not superior tothose produced onEarth.

While itisknown that buoyancy-driven convection isinferior to forced alow-g environment, convection isgreatly suppressed and diffusion becomes the predominant mechanism for thermal and mass transport. Inthe absence ofconvection, crystal growth from solution will rapidly become slower asthe adjacent solution is depleted insolute, unless the growth temperature islowered to compensate. However, ifthe temperature islowered too fast the growth rate will reach the level atwhich solvent inclusions are formed.\" (9,p.i) This Spacelab 3experiment was designed tostudy the growth of single triglycine sulfate crystals from solution inthe low- gravity environment. The specific objectives ofthe research were \"...(I) todevelop atechnique for solution crystal growth inalow gravity environment, (2) tocharacterize the growth en- vironment provided byanorbiting spacecraft and todetermine the 8-74 influence ofthe environment onthe growth behavior, and (3) to determine how gravity inamicrogravity environment influences the properties ofaresulting TGS crystal.\" (9, p.iii) The ex- periment employed anew crystal growth technique which allowed programmed heat extraction from the seed crystal. The experiment was performed inthe Spacelab 3Fluids Experiment System (FES). The FES was specifically designed toinvestigate fluid phenomena using optical observation techniques. The system consisted of (i) aninterchangeable crystal growth experimental cell and (2) asupport module. Three experiment cells were prepared for the mission. Each cell was filled with asolution ofTGS above the saturation tempera- ture. Asting assembly, affixed end ofthe cell, extended into the TGS solution. ATGS seed crystal, attached tothe sting tip, was protected from the solution prior tothe initiation of crystal growth byacap assembly. The support module included several components including (i) an optical bench with holographic facility, (2) aschlieren optical setup, (3) control electronics, and (4) three-axis ac- celerometers. Three experimental runs were planned for the Spacelab 3mission. Arun was initiated byplacing the FES experiment cell into a preheat enclosure and raising the temperature ofthe solution to 70\u00b0C. (At 50\u00b0Castirrer inside the cell was initiated to \"dissolve the crystallites faster.\") The FES remained atthis temperature until the fluid loop ofthe optical bench was heated and and held atatemperature of70\u00b0C. The FES was then trans- ferred tothe optical bench, and the experiment temperature at- tained. <Note: This temperature was not specified.> The tem- perature was equilibrated first using astirrer (later the stir- rer was not used). After itwas determined that (I) the solution was at the desired temperature above saturation and (2) there were nocrystallites inthe fluid, the cap covering the seed crystal was retracted, bringing the seed into contact with the TGS solution. Because the cell temperature was slightly higher than the saturation temperature, the outer surface ofthe crystal dissolved. The temperature was then slowly lowered tothe desired growth temperature and stabilized. Crystalgrowth was initiated byextracting heat from the seed crystal through the thermoelectrically cooled sting thereby creating the desired un- dercooling near the growing crystal. The cell and sting/seed temperatures were controlled b_ a microprocessor toanaccuracy of+/- 0.i \u00b0Cand +/- 0.01 C, The cell temperatures were monitored atthree places: (i) onthe sting base, (2) 1cmaway from the sting (in 8-75 the fluid), and (3) atthe cell walls. Holograms ofthe experi- ment cell were obtained from two orthogonal directions using an He-Ne laser directed through the cell's primary and transverse optical windows. (The holograms provide adetailed picture of the fluid refractive index around the growing crystal, from which concentration data can bededuced.) The crystal growth was monitored onboard Spacelab and onEarth bythe real-time video schlieron system. Atthe end ofthe growth period the cap was placed over the crys- tal. Acrew member then (i) removed the sting assembly from the cell, (2) allowed the crystal tocool, (3) dried the crystal, and (4) stowed the crystal for the mission back toEarth. Reportedly, \"Two crystal runs were successfully performed during the mission. Inboth [of these successful] experiment runs the starting seed... [cystals were] TGS crystal mmand 9.98 mmdiameter, respectively. The first experiment run inwhich (010) oriented seed was planned tobeused could not becompleted due tosome hardware problems. The second experiment run was performed for 58 hr where both sting/crystal and walls were cooled at a programmed rate, where T(substing) <T(subsol) <T(subsat). The third run was accomplished in 32.2 hr, where T(substing) = T(subsol) <T(subsat). The total average growth for both crys- tals... [was]... [approximately] 0.4 mm. The growth, however, was not quite uniform across the exposed face due to some ap- parent damage toseed prior togrowth. There was less growth in the center ofthe seed toexamine (010) for pyroelectric qualities. The fol- lowing conclusions were reported: (I) Adiffusion-controlled growth was indicated bythe lack ofa visible interface between the seed and space grown crystal. (2) Diffusion-controlled growth was also indicated by the reconstructed interferogram from the third experiment run showing anaxially symmetric concentration field about the growing crys- tal. <Note: Itwas reported that the interferograms would be digitized to determine concentration and temperature fields around the crystal and that these data would becompared toa (i.0 xi0vW-_ cmHzI/2) issomewhat less than the best Earth grown crystal 8-76 detectors for sample thickness of0.7 mil thickness (i.0 x 109 W-IcmHzl/2) .\"(6, p.19) 43nC/cm 2 \u00b0C) and (b) the hysteresis loop shape.

The lower graphite block (18 mmlong) contained two thermocouples. The assembly was con- figured within aquartz ampoule such that asmall slit existed between the ampoule wall and sample material. Avolume compensa- tion mechanism was included inthe upper graphite block. During the mission, the sample was processed inthe ELLI Monoel- lipsoid Mirror Furnace. The sample was placed inthe furnace and power supplied to the lamps until the desired temperature was reached. This temperature was maintained for afew hours toal- low homogenization ofthe solution zone. The sample was then rotated (i0 rpm) while being pulled atarate of3.7 mm/day. A total growth length of2.8 mm was achieved. (The complete time/temperature profile isincluded inReference (2)). For com- parison, aground-based reference experiment was performed using the same sample setup and time-temperature profile. Post-flight examination ofthe sample included (i) visual and metallographic inspection, (2) Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX), (3) x-ray diffraction, (4) infrared reflection measure- ments, (5) Hall effect measurements (Van-der-Pauw Method), (6) 8-84 electrochemical etching, and (7) element selective etching. Visual inspection ofthe low-gravity sample revealed growth facets and etch pits (before application ofetchant) onthe sur- face. The etch pits were attributed to selective evaporation from the surface into the slit area between sample and ampoule wall, resulting ingas phase etching. The metallographic ex- amination (sample cut axially) revealed two spherical shrink holes, one touching the growth boundary ofthe single crystal. A l-g processed sample contained aring-shaped shrink hole around the surface ofthe solution zone. The differences between the shrink holes ofthese two samples was attributed tothe lack of convection inthe low-gravity sample. EDAX examinations revealed three distinct types of in- homogeneities (axial tin profiles) : (i) Long range inhomogeneity: Asystematic shift intin con- centration was found inthe l-g sample but not the low-gravity sample. (2) Medium range inhomogeneity: An oscillation of tin content (period =about 1mm) in(a) the Bridgman-grown seed material of both l-g and low-gravity processed samples, (b) the THM grown portion ofthe l-g sample, and (c) the first 1mmofthe THM por- ofthe low-gravity processed low-gravity and samples. Hall effect measurements indicated asignificant increase in charge-carrier density for the low-gravity sample (THM grown material). Inall Earth-p_ocessed samples, the maximum charge- carrier density was 1900 cm_/Vs.

Furnace translation was initiated (5mm/day) and crys- tal growth proceeded for 21hours. Finally, the sample was an- nealed by (i) reducing lamp power to46Wand (2) holding itfor 25minutes atthis level. The asimilarly processed Earth-grown sample (heater power =116 W, no rotation) demonstrated better performance ofthe low-gravity processed material. The concentration ofelectrically active defects was less for the space-prqces_ed sample. The etchpit density ofthe space sample (_x_0_/cm _)was than the Earth-processed sample (5x10\"/cm=). The photoconductivity and resistivity studies (which characterize carrier transport properties) ofthe low-gravity processed specimen indicated animprovement over the Earth-processed sample.

(4) Experimentmodul Membrane toDirect Crystal Growth (SE82-5) This STS-26 student experiment was designed to investigate the ,,double-displacement-reaction\" solution crystal growth of lead iodide. The major objectives ofthe research were to(a) control the crystal growth using asemi-permeable membrane and (b) produce large, pure, single crystals oflead iodide. Itwas speculated that the rate ofdiffusion through the membrane and the initial concentrations ofthe lead acetate and potassium iodide solutions could dictate which side ofthe membrane crys- tals grew, the growth rate, the size, and the shape ofthe final crystals. Prior tothe shuttle launch, three experiment reactors were prepared. In each reactor, asolution of lead acetate was separated from asolution ofpotassium iodide by achamber con- taining water. This inner water chamber was divided down the middle byasemi-permeable, cellulose membrane (template). 8-95 During the STS-26 mission, valves isolating the inner chambers were opened, permitting the diffusion ofthe solutions toward the membrane. Asthe solutions came into contact, adouble replace- ment reaction took place: \"[The] Lead acetate and potassium iodide... [reacted] to form [collided and formed] the lead iodide 36) \"Video recordings ofthe 40-hour experiments show[ed] crystals beginning to form onthe membrane 30to120 seconds later.\" (3, p.206) The space crystals were compared toterrestrial-grown crystals. Video tape images ofthe growth process indicated that while on Earth, crystals form only onthe lower half ofthe membrane; the space grown crystals form (I) over the entire membrane and (2) in the solution away from the membrane. Reportedly, crystals in both the Earth and space experiments grew \"...on the side ofthe membrane initially containing the lead ions, therefore, iodide ions are migrating through the cellulose membrane.\" (7, p.ii) Purity, size, crystal color, density, hardness, morphology, refractive index, and electrical and thermal characteristics were examined. Reportedly, the space-grown crystals were better in- sulators and exhibited higher analytical purity interms offor- eign elements. (9) \"For unknown reasons, significantly higher ofcarbon appear tohave migrated out ofthe growth reac- tors on Earth... Shuttle-grown crystals contained only about one-fifth the carbon contamination ofthose produced onEarth.\" (3, p.206) \"In addition, Earth-grown crystals contain three times more needle crystallites ofanimpurity phase ofPbI(OH).\" (9) Notably, both the Earth and space crystals were similar in terms ofdefects relating tosite vacancies and plane slippage. (9) \"In two experiments onEarth, with the reactors oriented sothat their membrane templates stood vertically, yellow lead iodide crystals formed only onthe lower half ofeach membrane. Adeep, horizontal, lead iodide shelf marked the upper boundary ofcrys- tal growth.

The MDA was fashioned (in part) from two blocks of inert material. Each block had over i00 sample wells strategically drilled into its surface. Awell was capable ofholding 100-500 mloffluid. After all ofthe wells had been filled with the ap- propriate sample materials (depending oneach investigator's specific objectives), the blocks were joined together. Twice during the mission, the upper block moved relative tothe bottom block. Each movement ofthe block either (I) aligned or (2) misaligned wells onthe top block with wells onthe bottom. When the wells were aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could take place. When the wells were not aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could not take place. Appropriate positioning ofthe wells onthe top block to those onthe used exclusively byCassantoetal. for aprotein crystal stability experiment which investigated the effect of re-entry loads onterrestrial-grown crystals (see Cassanto etal., Consort I). The \"Type used for either the liquid-liquid or liquid-solid diffusion experiments. The \"Type 4\"test wells were used exclusively for the film formation and membrane casting experiments (see Pellegrino, Consorti; Vera, Consorti). This experiment was allotted Discussion ofthis specific well-type isdetailed here. Each \"Type 3\"test well provided the investigator with one ex- perimental opportunity. The well-type used three sample wells, two inthe top block and one inthe bottom block. One ofthese wells onthe top block \"...contained a.45_m pore size backed supported byacellulose prefilter. The fil- ters were prepared bycutting small circles from normal filters with acork borer.\" (5, p.i) The second well onthe of phenytoin The well onthe bottom block contained the low pHsolution (pH 2.0 phosphate buffer). Prior tothe Consortflight, the blocks were joined together such that the wells inthe upper block were purposely misaligned with the well inthe lower block. Once the rocket had been launched 8-100 and the low-gravity period achieved, amotor and cam mechanism moved the upper block tothe right, aligning the wells containing the phenytoin solution and pH2.0 buffer. Once the wells were in contact, material diffusion was realized across the liquid-liquid interface. Just prior tothe termination ofthe low-gravity phase, the upper block again moved right, aligning the well which now contained amixture ofliquid pH2.0 buffer and the phenytoin crystals with the top well containing the filter. These wells remained in contact through the re-entry phase of the flight. Reportedly, \"Filtration was expected tobeaccomplished byeither acceleration forces moving the fluid through the filter or by capillary action drawing fluid through the filter into the ab- sorbent backing used tosupport the filter.\" (5, p.2) Post-flight evaluation ofthe operation ofthe MDA indicated that the moved asexpected allowing diffusion totake place inthe \"Type 3\"test wells. Although itwas reported that minor fluid leakage inthe top and bottom blocks ofthe MDA resulted incontamination ofsome ofthe test wells allotted 17investigations, itwas not clear ifthis particular ex- periment form ofcontamination. Examination ofthe seven Consort 1pH2.0 phosphate buffer wells indicated that (i) filtration ofthe contents during re-entry had occurred, (2) nocrystals were present inthe remaining solution and (3) that the pHofthe fluid inthe seven wells ranged from 2.0 to2.2. Examination ofthe seven Consort 1filter wells indicated that the filters worked adequately. Reportedly, (i) there were very few crystals inthe filters and (2) each ofthe filters exhibited some contamination from asilicon grease source. Examination ofthe seven Consort1phenytoin solution wells indi- cated that the pHinthe wells ranged from 6.0 to10.4. Such a variation inpHwas not expected. \"During the entire flight, the solution was either isolated from all other wells orincontact with the ph [sic] 2.0 solution inthe lower wells. Mixing be- tween the lower and upper wells was presumed tobebydiffusion only. Since all seven wells contained identical solutions, iden- tical diffusion mixing should have occurred ineach .... alarge five ofthe wells and nocrystals were present inthe remaining two wells. The two wells which did not contain crystals had apH of10.2 orhigher. Infour ofthe five wells which had crystals, phenytoin habit oflong needle-shaped crystals was ob- 8-101 served and there was nowide dispersion ofcrystal sizes. The fifth well, however, \"...contained crystals markedly different than those observed inthe laboratory. The distribution con- sisted ofone or two very large needle shaped crystals and numerous small, rounded crystals .... Closerexamination ofthe large needle shaped crystals showed avery rough surface with large pits, steps and cracks. Itishypothesized that the small crystals were formed from breakage or chipping from the large crystals...\" (5, p. 3)possibly during payload re-entry. Fur- ther, itwas reported that some of these wells experienced an unexplained 25%-50% fluid loss. \"Because... [the wells] were either isolated from all other wells orincontact with only the bottom wells containing pH2.0 buffer, there should have been no fluid loss from them.\" (5, p.8) Other assessments of the low-gravity formed crystals were not reported atthis time. The rocket samples were compared toground-based samples which had been similarly processed inthe MDA (i) with the pH Ii phenytoin solution onthe bottom and the pH2solution onthe top and (2) with the pH 2solution onthe bottom and the pH ii phenytoin solution onthe Examination ofthe ground-based pH 2solution wells indi- cated that (i) crystals were found inone-third ofthe wells, (2) the pHinthe wells ranged from 2.0 to5.8, and (3) the crystals were formed inthe wells with high pHvalues (5.6 and 5.8). Ex- amination ofthe ground-based pHIiphenytoin solution wells (bottom) indicated that (i) crystals were found intwo-thirds of the wells and (2) the pHinall ofthe wells ranged from 2.4 to i0.4. \"Unlike the microgravity results, copious crystal precipitation was seen in... [1/3 ofthe] wells that originally contained the pH 2.0 phosphate buffer solution. However, the crystal appearance was similar tothat ofthe crystals found in wells containing the pHIIphenytoin solution. There was noap- parent sample wells. wells the variation inpHwas larger than inthe low-gravity Consortexperiments. The variation difference was attributed to (i) gravity-independent effects (such as diffusion) and (2) gravity-dependent effects (such as convection), both ofwhich dictated the mixing ofthe solutions inthe upper and lower wells. Examination ofthe ground-based pH2solution wells (bottom) in- dicated that (i) nocrystals were found inany ofthe wells and (2) the pHinall the wells ranged from 2.1 to2.4. Examination ofthe ground-based phenytoin solution wells (top) indicated that (I) no crystals were found inany ofthe wells and (2) the pH 8-102 ranged from 10.3 to 10.6. \"The lack ofcrystalline product... was not due tothe presence ofgravity.

The experiment was one of17investigations simultaneously per- formed the MDA toconduct aliquid-liquid or liquid-solid diffusion study (ii experiments (including this one)), the apparatus was also used to (i) determine the role offluid physics onthe formation offilms and the casting ofmembranes (five experiments) and (2) determine the effect ofre-entry loads onterrestrial-grown crystals (one experiment). The MDA was fashioned (in part) from two blocks of inert material. Each block had over i00 sample wells strategically drilled into its surface. Awell was capable ofholding 100-500 mloffluid. After all ofthe wells had been filled with the ap- propriate sample materials (depending oneach investigator,s specific objectives), the blocks were joined together. Twice during the mission, the upper block moved relative tothe bottom block. Each movement ofthe block either (I) aligned or (2) misaligned wells onthe top block with wells onthe bottom. When the wells were aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could take place. When the wells were not aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could not take place. Appropriate positioning ofthe wells onthe top block to those onthe were used exclusively byCassantoetal. for aprotein crystal stability experiment which investigated the effect of re-entry loads onterrestrial-grown crystals (see Cassanto etal., Consort i). The \"Type used for either the liquid-liquid or liquid-solid diffusion experiments. The \"Type 4\"test wells were used exclusively for the film formation and membrane casting experiments (see Pellegrino, ConsortI; Vera, Consort i). This experiment was 2\"test well. Discussion ofthis specific well-type isdetailed here. The single \"Type 2\"test well provided the investigator with one experimental opportunity. The well-type used two sample wells, one onthe top block and one onthe bottom block. Prior to flight, each well was filled. The top well was filled with sodium iodide (0.I Mconcentration) and the bottom well was filled with AgNO 3(0.i Mconcentration). Prior torocket launch, the blocks were joined together such that the well inthe upper block was purposely misaligned with the well onthe lower block. Once the rocket had been launched and the low-gravity phase achieved, amotor and cam mechanism moved the upper block tothe right, aligning the wells onthe upper and lower blocks. Once the wells were incontact, material diffusion was realized across the liquid-liquid interface. Just prior to the termination ofthe low-gravity rocket phase, the upper block again moved right misaligning the upper and lower wells. This misalignment prevented further material diffusion between the 8-106 liquids. Post-flight evaluation ofthe operation ofthe MDA indicated that the upper block moved asexpected allowing diffusion to take place inthe \"Type 2\"test wells. Although itwas reported that minor fluid leakage inthe top and bottom blocks of the MDA resulted incontamination ofsome ofthe test wells allotted to the 17investigations, itwas not clear ifthis particular ex- periment was contamination. Adocument written prior tothe launch Consort1rocket detailed the expected post-flight analysis and results: \"...the size distributions of anegatively charged and an silver iodide dispersion will becompared tosimilar dis- (i, p.i) \"Dispersions ofcharged particles are expected to show avery narrow size distribution, irrespective of the gravitational field.

Reportedly, this phenomenon had not been previously observed. Itwas reported that these surface tension effects remained localized onthe sur- face and did not affect bulk growth orsegregation. Itwould be expected that this free surface condition would lead toasurface tension-driven Marangoni flow within the melt. However, nosuch flows were detected. Itwas reported inReference (3) that the lack of fluid flow may have been due tothe presence ofathin oxide film onthe free surface. (3) Without the interference ofconvective flows, itwas possible toidentify segregation discontinuities caused byfaceted growth and explain their presence onthe basis ofspurious nucleation.

This discontinuity allowed the determination ofthe average macroscopic growth rate. The average growth rate from the initial regrowth tothe application ofmechanical shock (90 minutes into regrowth) was 2.8 microns/sec. From this point to the second discontinuity, the growth rate was 4.6 microns/sec. Over the first 2.88 cmofregrowth, the average growth rate was 3.4 microns/sec.

The earlier had examined the crystal growth ofindium antimonide, established that the low- gravity environment can provide virtually ideal conditions for solidification studies. Thus, the ASTP experiment was designed toobtain more refined fundamental and quantitative information on the solidification and segregation processes. The specific objectives ofthe experiment were toexamine the following low- gravity processing characteristics ofagermanium doped gallium system: (i) the the surfacetension and/or wetting ofthe molten material (3) the microscopic growth rate behavior during directional solidification (and the corresponding segregation) (4) the heat transfer ofthe experimental system Prior tothe mission,three germanium (Ge) crystals doped grown direction; another was grown inthe <iii> direction. <Note: The growth direction ofthe third crystal could not be determined from the published literature.> Each sample was sealed inits 9-14 morphological characteristics (e.g., absence oftwin and grain boundaries) revealed that the Ge<iii> sample maintained its single crystallinity in the peripheral region. This was not the case for the <iii> sample grown onEarth. However, the space-processed Ge <I00> sample exhibited surface grain boundaries after the first 3.5 cmofregrowth. The same sample processed onEarth exhibited grain boundaries ofgrowth. High-resolution characterization ofthe dopant distribution indi- occurred after the initial growth tran- sient (unlike the previous Skylab experiments). Dopant con- centration increased steadily over the first 1.5 cmofregrowth, but never achieved the steady-state prediction. Itwas also determined that the distribution ofdopant varied with distance from the axis ofthe crystal. Itwas concluded, through analysis ofthe interface markings, that these results were probably caused byasymmetrical heat flow through the furnace. Therefore, flat solid-liquid interfaces were not present during the experi- ment causing unequal growth rates and radial segregation. The asymmetrical heat flow was probably present during the Skylab ex- periments but was not aspronounced due to(i) the difference in segregation coefficient ofthe materials used during Skylab and (2) the higher resolution techniques used for the ASTP samples.

Contaot(s) z Dr. The eutec- tic composition ofNaCI-NaF solidifies into crystalline rods of sodium fluoride. These NaF rods are transparent and could be used asfiber optic materials ifthey could begrown without defects. However, onEarth, these structures form imperfectly because ofconvective flows within the melt. Reportedly, in space, such convective flows are significantly reduced and acon- tinuous, fault-free solidified structure may result. This Skylab was to flight, three NaCi-21 wt.% NaF samples (0.31inch diameter, 2.5 inches long) were prepared. Each sample was con- tained inamachined, graphite tube and loaded into astainless steel container. After loading, the interior ofthe stainless steel container was coated with agraphite paste toprevent reac- tion ofthe molten salt with the container wall. Acalcined graphite disk was placed over the ingot and astainless steel cap (with avent hole) was welded onto the cartridge. The three steel containers were configured within the Skylab Multipurpose Electric Furnace System (MEFS). 9-27 During the low-gravity phase of the mission, all but ap- proximately 1/2 inch ofeach ingot was purposely melted. (The unmelted section ofthe ingot acted asaseed crystal.) The sample was then directionally solidified atarate of0.6 \u00b0C/min and athermal gradient of 50\u00b0C/cm. were similarly processed onEarth for comparison. Post-flight examination ofthe samples indicated that noreaction between the salt ingots and the graphite occurred. Itwas also noted that, atthe beginning ofthe solidification process, the NaF eutectic fibers grew perpendicular tothe growth direction. This behavior was attributed toimproper insulation design, which permitted heat flow inthe radial direction. After about 0.12 cm of growth, the fibers were aligned parallel with the growth direction. Microscopic examination ofthe samples indicated that the aligned fibers were regularly spaced aswell asparallel with the growth direction. Itwas also reported that the fibers were more con- tinuous (fewer defects) than those found inthe Earth-processed material. This result was attributed tothe lack ofgravity- induced convective flows and vibration normally present during solidification processes onEarth. Examination of the infrared transmittance properties also revealed the improved continuity ofthe space-grown fiber. The transmittance was better for the low-gravity sample than for the l-g processed material throughout the infrared wavelength range investigated. Results from this experiment led tothe following conclusions: (I) The ability toproduce aligned eutectic NaF fibers inthe low-gravity environment was due tothe absence ofconvective flows inthe liquid during solidification. (2) Larger transmittance over awider wavelength was achieved by the low-gravity material because of better alignment ofNaF fibers compared tothe l-g processed material. 9-28 Key Words:Crystal Growth From the Melt, Melt and Solidification, Directional Solidification, Eutectics, Fiber Eutectics, Binary Systems, Molten Salts, Fiber Optic Applications, Optics Applica- tions, Two-Phase System, Seed Crystals, Thermal Gradient, Asym- metric Temperature Field, Solidification Rate, Solid/Liquid In- terface, Surface Morphology, Fibers, Inter-Fiber Spacing, Single Grain Eutectics, Defects, Defect Density, Buoyancy-Driven Con- vection, Buoyancy Effects Diminished, CrucibleEffects, Material Interaction With Containment Facility, Coated Surfaces, Infrared Transmission, Optical Transmission NumberofSamples: three Sample Materials: Eutectic salt composition (Na*CI*, steel cartridge.

Other objectives ofthe research included (i) determining the continuity of the low-gravity aligned fibers, (2) comparing the fiber continuity oflow-gravity and Earth-processed materials, (3) determining the interfiber spacing of low-gravity and Earth-produced LiF fibers, and (4) the Furnace was used to directionally solidify three NaCl-29 wt% LiF eutectic samples. The experimental setup and procedure were the same as the earlier Skylab SL-3 experiment and are described under A.S. Yue, Skylab SL-3. Post-flight examination ofthe ingots indicated that all but 0.28 cmofone sample was not melted and all but 0.51 cmofthe other two samples was not melted. This result indicated \"...a slight offset inthe positioning ofthe heat zones that the LiF fibers grew perpendicular tothe direction of solidification. This result was attributed tothe heat extrac- tion direction being perpendicular tothe ingot axis. After a short distance, however, the fibers were aligned parallel tothe growth direction. (This initial misdirection ofthe fibers was also observed during the Skylab experiment and was attributed to 9-31 animproper insulation design ofthe Skylab furnace.) Microstructural examination ofthe low-gravity samples revealed a continuous and straight fiber structure. Incontrast, those in- gots processed onEarth contained discontinuous and randomly oriented fibers. These differences were attributed tothe lack ofgravity-induced convective flows that tend to break up and randomly orient the fibers. Measurements ofthe inter-fiber dis- tance for all samples indicated little difference. The inter- fiber spacing for the Earth-processed material was slightly smal- ler, which was attributed tothe faster cooling rate of these samples during growth. Image transmission properties of the space-processed materials (sectioned samples) were investigated. \"The transmitted image has the same dimensions asthe source, anindication that the LiF fibers are perpendicular tothe plane ofthe paper [containing the source]. However, the image isnot as the original image ofthe source; through transmission isindicated.

This indicated that the ASTP samples contained ahigher percentage of fibers aligned tothe growth direction.

The major con- tribution tosolute micro-segregation isgravity-induced convec- setsofsimilar sampleswere prepared for ground- based testing (horizontal and vertical growth directions). All ofthe samples were prepared from powdered Geand dopant and 9-34 grown inthe <iii> direction. Each resulting crystal was then enclosed inagraphite tube and encapsulated inanevacuated stainless steel ampoule. All samples were processed under similar thermal conditions. Initially, the portions ofthe samples within the furnace hot zone were heated toI000 \u00b0Cwithin 3hours (the melting point of Geis938 \u00b0C). The samples were then held atthis temperature for approximately 2hours to achieve steady-state conditions. arate level. Post-flight examination ofthe space-processed samples revealed that the B- and Sb-doped crystals became contaminated. \"Unfortunately, the amount ofcontaminants which entered the Ge melt during the 'oven-on' cycle was large enough to interfere with the electrical properties of both Sb and Bdoped Ge samples .... The major constituents of the contaminants in samples taken from the melt ends ofthe crystals were shown by emission spectroscopy tobeMn, Cu, and Fe. Asthe graphite tubes did not contain such large quantities ofthese transition metals.., itisdeduced that they entered the melt from the stainless tube during the oven-on cycle.\" (i, p.385) Analysis con- ducted with aspreading resistance probe (see Reference (i) for procedure details). It was reported that the low-gravity processed sample contained much less radial segregation than those similar materials processed onEarth. However, all samples showed asignificant increase indopant level near the surface. The Skylab sample's diameter decreased inthe regrowth region. This decrease resulted inafree surface and, therefore, surface tension-driven flow may have caused the dopant increase inthis area. The l-g samples had nofree surfaces. However, the radial segregation inthe Earth-processed material may have been driven byconventional convection caused byaradial thermal gradient. Examination of the micro-segregation of dopant (resolution of resistance measurements was 5microns) indicated that the amplitude ofthe fluctuations exhibited bythe space sample was significantly less than inthe l-g material. \"The degree of microsegregation (mean square value ofthese fluctuations over a I00... [micron] interval) was 0.4 percent for the space-grown crystal compared with 1.6 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, for the ground control samples.\" (4, p.58) These micro- and macrosegregation measurements led tothe provide provement inmacrosegregation and nearly two-fold improvement in microsegregation for crystal growth by the gradient freeze 9-35 method.\" (i, p.385) The effective segregation coefficient was determined (see Reference (i) for details). Reportedly, for the low-gravity sample, k ,was higher atthe solid-liquid interface.

Azoneof equiaxed grain structure will form if (i) nuclei for equiaxed grains are present throughout the melt and (2) growth ofthe equiaxed grains isgreater than that ofthe columnar grains. Both of these conditions (presence of nuclei and growth of eqiaxed grains) are influenced bygravity. For example, gravity- induced convection (driven by composition gradients that arise from rejection of solute at the solidification interface) can contribute tothe formation ofanequiaxed grain structure. Skylab SL-2 (Chapter 14)) anunex- pected occurrence offine-grained equiaxed microstructures inthe cast samples. These structures were formed despite the reduction ofgravity-induced convection. Therefore, further investigation ofthe gravitational effects oncolumnar-to-equiaxed transition was initiated. This SPAR 1experiment was the first inaseries ofinvestiga- tions designed by Papazian et al. to study the low-gravity solidification behavior ofapolycrystalline material. (The ex- periment also represented one oftwo investigations performed by Papazian during the SPAR 1sounding rocket mission (see Papazian, SPAR i,Experiment 74-36 (Chapter 12)).) The objectives ofEx- periment were measure the effect ofreduced width ofthe solute enriched zone ahead ofa 9-41 solidification interface and (2) investigate the columnar-to- equiaxed transition during polycrystalline solidification. In preparation for the experiment, asample of transparent cyclohexanol mixed with fluorescein dye was placed inasilica cuvette. (Use ofthis material allowed observation ofthe buildup colored solute (fluorescein, green incolor) ahead of the solidification interface.) During the mission, solidification ofthe material was accomplished via ather- moelectric cooling device which was placed atthe bottom Reflected illumination from atungsten filament micro- scope illuminator provided lighting for 35 mm photographic recording ofthe process. Itwas intended that asequence of220 photographs would record the solidification process and buildup of solute. \"Unfortunately, during flight, the government furnished (GFE) camera for this experiment malfunctioned. Weobtained 4test ex- posures before lift-off, followed by13exposures to have been taken atthe beginning ofthe low-gravity interval and 56exposures which were probably taken toward the end ofthe cooling sequence. The first 14low-gravity frames show that no crystallization had yet occurred; this isconsistent with our ground-based results the first solid isobserved atap- proximately 20s. .... \"(I, p.VIII-9) Further post-flight examination ofthe photographs revealed that the solute-enriched zone ahead of the interface was wider and more irregular than that observed for ground-based tests. The solidified flight sample consisted of anequiaxed grain struc- ture, while the l-g processed samples consisted ofacolumnar grain morphology. The grain size ofthe flight sample was 1.2 mm. The grain sizes ofthe ground-processed samples (width of columnar grain) ranged between 2and 3.5 mm. The average growth rate ofthe flight sample was reported as60microns/sec which was significantly higher than the growth rate ofthe ground samples (20 to30microns/sec). The smaller grain size, equiaxed grain morphology, and alarger average macroscopic growth rate ofthe flight sample were at- tributed toparasitic nucleation ahead ofthe interface (that was not observed inthe ground-based samples). Several possibilities for this different behavior were reported: (I) the different thermal histories ofthe flight and ground-processed samples, (2) contamination ofthe flight sample, (3) perturbation ofthe heat and fluid flow caused bythe presence ofasmall bubble inthe flight sample, (4) launch-induced fluid motion, and (5) in- adequate superheating ofthe flight sample prior tolaunch.

The specific objectives ofthis experiment were to (I) im- prove understanding of the LPE crystal growth process and (2) confirm theoretical analysis of material transport and growth kinetics during the process. The SPAR6experimental apparatus consisted of(i) atubular resistance heated (nichrome wire) furnace, (2) an atmospheric control system (which provided ahydrogen flow inside the furnace to prevent incorporation of oxygen in the crystal), (3) a pheumatically _perated, graphite slider (which positioned the two (i.I cmby1m_cm) substrates incontact with the solution), and (4) anelectronic controller (which provided temperature control and operation ofthe hydrogen gas system). (Reference (I) con- tains additional details of the experimental apparatus and preflight testing procedures.) Prior tolaunch, two cleaned GaAs wafers were loaded into the slider. The wafers had been cut perpendicular tothe i00 direc- tion. Ninety minutes was heated to1050 K. Atlaunch, the solu- tion temperature was lowered sothat the growth temperature of 990 Kwas reached 4minutes into the flight. This assured that (i) the correct solution temperature was attained well into the low-gravity period ofthe mission and (2) the fluid motions in- duced bylaunch were fully damped. The slider mechanism was then 9-54 activated, bringing the wafers into contact with the solution, allowing aone minute growth period. Samples were also processed onthe ground, using the flight hardware, under identical conditions (with the exception of gravity level). Post-flight examination ofthe thermal data indicated that \"The recorded temperatures are not precise enough toconfirm that the desired supercooling interval, [delta]T =10\u00b0K, was achieved. The reliability oftemperature control proven during pre-flight tests isthe only evidence available toshow that itwas.\" (I, p.

This result was asexpected ifonly diffusive mass transfer (and not convective transfer) took place during the flight experiment. The actual thickness, 1.5 microns, was in good agreement with theoretical predictions. X-ray diffraction topography indicated the films were single crystalline, offairly good quality, and ofuniform composition.

The pulsing made itpossible to(i) determine the in- terface shape and (2) quantify the microscopic growth rates. 9-73 Post-flight analysis ofthe single crystal samples (longitudinal sections) revealed \"...an excellent homogeneity observed and ofcrystal growth system isabout i0-_ toi0-_gwhich was higher than expected.

InSummary Review of Sounding Rocket Sciences, TEXUS During crystalgrowth from amelt, convective flows within the molten material affect the impurity segregation at the solid- liquid interface. This impurity segregation can lead tocomposi- tional inhomogeneities which appear asstriations inadoped crystal. The dopant distribution reflects the flow patterns which prevailed during crystal growth. The flow mechanisms, which are both dependent and independent ofgravity, are superim- posed oneach other and difficult todiscern during processing. During experiments performed in alow-g environment, gravity- driven flows are greatly reduced and contribution from the governing flow mechanisms can bedistinguished. This TEXUS 7experiment was the and/or Cr611etal. theflow mechanism responsible for striations observed in float-zone solidified silicon. The specific objectives ofthe research were to (I) compare the dopant distribution ofcrystals grown inspace with thosegrown onEarth, and (2) that crystal low-gravity con- ditions. Prior tothe asingle rod sample (length =90mm, diameter =8mm) with a[iii] orientation was prepared. The rod was contained within aquartz ampoule (18 mm internal diameter) such that the sample material and ampoule wall were not touching. The ampoule was sealed and pressurized with argon to760 Torr. 9-76 The sample TEXUS Experiment Module TEM 02-2 ELLI Monoellipsoid Furnace. The module was configured with (i) a halogen lamp, (2) amonoellipsoidal mirror (a=90mm, b=80 mm), (3) asample translation and rotation mechanism, (4) aTV camera (which allowed observation and subsequent control ofthe process during the rocket flight), (5) experiment controllers and power supply, and (6) data transmission equipment. <Note: Eyer etal. had studied the sample was rotated ati0rpm. During lift-off and rocket ac- celeration, the lamp was switched off toprevent filament damage. Once low-gravity conditions were achieved (65 seconds after lift- off), (i) the lamp was switched onand (2) azone ofthe sample was melted while rotation continued. At220 seconds after lift- off, zone translation was initiated atarate of5mm/min. At 300 seconds after lift-off, sample rotation was terminated but zone translation continued. At 410 seconds (the beginning of rocket re-entry), the furnace power was switched off. Itwas reported that the intended control ofthe experiment from the ground was not possible since \"Up toT=250 [seconds] the TV picture was blurred. Ahose, connecting TVcamera and power supply, became leaky because ittouched the hot rocket wall. The ensuing pressure drop caused corona discharges inthe system, which later on, with the vacuum improving, disappeared.\" (i, p. 176) Post-flight examination ofthe film and sample revealed that the zone length unexpectedly increased inlength. The zone became so long that att=330 seconds zone instability and disruption oc- curred. \"Atiny part ofthe melt was drawn tothe lower inter- face and solidified there immediately. The major part collected atthe upper interface forming a'sphere' (diameter about 12mm) ofmolten silicon.\" (i, p.177) The increase inzone length was attributed toan increase intemperature of the sample. This temperature increase was attributed to the lack of convective cooling inthe reduced gravity environment. Despite these dif- ficulties, asample length ofabout i0mmwas attained. Examination of the flight and l-g processed specimens revealed micro-striations present inboth samples. Itwas, therefore, concluded that these striations were due to dopant in- homogeneities caused byoscillatory and turbulent modes ofther- mocapillary flow inthe melt (see Reference (i) for acomplete discussion ofthe results). 9-77 KeyWords: Crystal Growth From the Melt, Melt and Solidification, Float Zones, Float Zone Stability, Sample Rotation, Rotating Fluids, Dopant, Binary Systems, Segregation, Free Surface, Sur- face (Detrimental), Several factors are involved inthe growth ofintermetallic com- pounds, including (i) thermodynamics ofthe system (enthalpies of formation, congruent melting) and (2) dynamic effects inthe crystallization process (convection, diffusion, solidification- front shape). The dynamic effects, some ofwhich are gravity- dependent, may prevent the crystallization ofacongruent melting byPierre study the growth of alloys under low-gravity conditions. The specific was togrow crystals ofthe CeMg3 intermetallic without the inhibiting effects ofgravity. During the mission, one Ce-Mg sample was processed inanbi- elli_soidal mirror furnace facility. The sample was heated to 800 vC and was molten for about 4minutes ofthe 6-minute low- gravity period. Itwas reported that \"...due tothe geometry of this furnace, the temperature in the sample is rather in- homogeneous, which prevents the obtention [sic] oflarge single crystals.\" (i, p.314) Areference sample was processed onEarth using similar experimental parameters. Post-flight examination of the low-gravity processed sample revealed complete formation ofthe CeMg 3phase. Incontrast, the ground-processed sample also contained CeMg impurities. Reportedly, these results indicated that the segregation of Ce observed onEarth was due todensity differences between the com- ponents rather than diffusion ofatoms under the influence ofa thermal gradient. 9-79 Nofurther discussion ofthe results from this mission could be located inavailable publications.

The specific objective ofthe experiment was togrow large crystals ofCeMg 3without the fur- nace. <Note: Reference (4), p.52, states two samples were processed, whereas, Reference (2), pp. 57-59, refers toonly one sample.> The material was asealed tantalum cartridge. Athermocouple was located inthe conically shaped bottom ofthe cartridge. During the low-gravity phase ofthe mission, the sample was heated to820 \u00b0Cand translated for about 20mm, which allowed crystal growth. The power tothe furnace was decreased prior to rocket re-entry allowing solidification. Asimilar sample was processed onEarth using the same thermal profile asthe low- gravity processed sample. Post-flight examination of the space-processed sample (metallography, x-ray back scattering for the surface, and neutron diffraction and topographic methods for the bulk) revealed platelet-shaped precipitates inthe conical section of the sample (where crystallization started). These precipitates exhibited more orless coherent orientations over alarge scale with domains ofapproximately 0.5 mm. Inasimilarly processed Earth-grown crystal, the precipitates were more randomly dis- with space-grown crystal was than the Earth-grown sample which was attributed tothe lack of convection under low-gravity conditions. Itwas further reported that the TEXUS 12sample exhibited a restricted mosaicity while \"...the Earth grown sample yielded X- ray patterns ofworse quality.\" (3, p. 172) The neutron trans- mission Laue patterns showed acoherent ofthe flight sample while the l-g processed material contained crystals ofvarying orientation.

Itisnot clear ifthe sources ofthese flow patterns are (i) gravity- dependent buoyancy effects or (2) gravity-independent Marangoni effects (surface-driven flow caused bylocal differences insur- face tension). Inspace, the gravity-dependent effects should be reduced allowing closer examination of Marangoni flows in the liquid silicon system.

Itwas reported that, while molten, the was spherical. \"Because of acertain peculiarity ofthe wetting angle.., the growing very strongly deviate[d] from the spherical shape and assume[d] more solidified].\" (i, 9-84 p.17o) Asecond experimental run was planned during which the sample would be processed without rotation. Reportedly, this second procedure \"...could not becarried out because ofbreakdown of ofthe single, resolidified Spacelab sample indicated that athin, dark surface layer had collected on the specimen. Itwas suspected that this layer was due toa carbon impurity ofanunknown origin. Reportedly, once the droplet was etched, this layer was removed and the sample was very shiny. After longitudinally slicing, polishing and etching the sample (see Reference (I) for procedure), distinct rotational striations were revealed atthe surface. Itwas expected that the distance between neighboring striation lines would be about 50microns. However, distances varied considerably (from 40to300 microns). This variation inline distance was attributed toavariation in growth rate caused bythe carbon impurity. Because the melting point ofSivaries greatly with small changes incarbon content, \"So the growth rate rises with increasing carbon content and must fall back tothe value of1mm/min imposed bythe driving motor when the carbon content isheld byprecipitation ofSi-C inclusions.\" (I, p.170) Less distinct were found between the more distinct rotational striations described above and were spaced at adistance of about i0microns. Because of the presence ofthese itwas assumed that \"...other temperature in the twofold symmetry [existed]. Inthe light ofour earth bound experiments itisvery tempting toassume they are indeed caused bythe Marangoni effect.\" (i, p.171) Reportedly, tocon- firm this assumption, the planned (but not realized) experiment without rotation would have been helpful. 9-85 KeyWords: Crystal Growth FromtheMelt,MeltandSolidification, Directional Solidification, Containerless Processing, Binary Sys- tems, Semiconductors, Semiconductor Applications, Electronic Materials, Dopant, Drops, Spheres, Sphericity, Sample Rotation, Drop Rotation, Rotating Fluids, Growth Rate, Translation Rate, Free Surface Solidification, Solid/Liquid Interface, Liquid/Gas Interface, Free Surface, Surface Sample Homogeneity, Contamina- tion Source, Impurities, Thin Films, Coated Surfaces, Halogen Lamps, Furnace Malfunction NumberofSamples: one Sample Materials: silicon rod, Proceedings ofMeasurement and Characteriza- tion ofthe Acceleration Environment OnBoard 1986, Guntersville, Alabama, pp. (3) Nitsche, R.: The Mirror Heating Facility: Performance and Ex- periences.

Prior tothe rocket launch, two, 6mmdiameter samples were prepared such that when each was processed, 14mmofa20mmmol- ten zone would becoated with quartz glass. Usingtwo ofthe four ellipsoidal furnaces housed within the Crystal Growth Fur- nace (CGF), the two samples were melted and then directionally solidified during the mission.

Sample mounting and heat shielding differences ofthe two samples allowed one ofthe samples tobeprocessed with athermal gradient of130 K/cm with athermal gradient of90K/cm. Athermocouple, placed atthe border between the coated and uncoated sections of the sample, was used torecord this thermal gradient. Reportedly, \"The outprints ofdata from the flight, show tempera- ture and power curves in fairly good agreement with the programmed sequences.

Because indium oxide layers were found onthe surfaces ofboth ground and flight 9-113 samples, itwas thought that this oxide layer may have reduced Marangoni convection inthe melt.

The specific objective ofthe experiment was to determine if purely diffusive conditions prevailed during the reduced-gravity float-zone growth ofsilica-coated asingle phosphorous-doped Sicrystal (90 mm long, 7.6 mm diameter) was boron-doped by filling a peripheral hole (1.5 mmdepth, 1.2 mmdiameter) with 0.45 mgof boron. After filling, the hole was closed byspot welding with focused light. (The boron dopant, released during melting, maps the diffusive orconvective behavior ofthe melt.) The sample was then coated with a5-micron-thick silica film byexposing it toaflow ofoxygen saturated with water (50 hours at1400 K). The sample was mounted free from the wall inafused silica am- poule and sealed hole forma- tion inthe silica mission, the TEXUS monoellipsoidal reflector furnace was used toprocess the crystal using the float-zone method. Acamera was included with the apparatus to allow real-time observation and control ofthe experiment. Prior to lift-off (time t=0), the sample was preheated for 240 seconds. During lift-off the furnace was switched off toprevent damage tothe lamp filament. Att=65seconds, the lamp power was increased to600 Wtoassure sample melting. Att=114 seconds, the power was reduced linearly to450 W(this wattage had been used inground-based experiments, resulting ina17mm zone length). Sample translation (5mm/min) began att=160 seconds with the melt zone reaching the boron att=185 seconds (zone length =18.5 mm). When the zone length reached 25.5 mm, the lamp was powered down inthree steps to410 W. (Apparently the lack ofgravity-induced convection (which cooled the lamp and sample onEarth) resulted inthe lower power requirement.) Att =410 seconds, the power was switched off (total growth time = 250 seconds), resulting inatotal recrystallized length of35mm (including arapidly solidified zone of23mm). <Note: Reportedly, asmall portion crystal grown sample rotated atarate ofi0rpm for 1minute. Figure 2of Reference (3) indicates this began at about t=65seconds. However, this figure also implies that the rotation lasted much longer than 1minute. Noexplanation orclarification ofthis discrepancy could belocated. Itwas reported that the effect of this rotation was ofexactly ten manner asthe flight sample, was processed on Earth. The terrestrial experiment parameters were identical tothe flight sample uptot=285 seconds. From this point tot=410 seconds, aconstant power of 450 Wwas used for ground-based Post-flight low-gravity processed crystal indicated that (i) the boron-doped area was limited insize and was separated bytwo adjacent n-type regions, and (2) the resistivity distribution inthe flight sample was inexcellent agreement with theoretical calculations which were determined assuming apurely diffusive dopant propaga- tion. Incontrast, examination of the Earth-grown sample revealed a much larger boron doped region (than observed in the TEXUS sample). This result indicated that additional flow mechanisms had augmented the diffusive propagation. There was also alarge deviation from the expected theoretical boron distribution. \"Since Marangoni flow was excluded and since time dependent buoyancy flows should have produced striations, itishighly probable that the broadened boron distribution iscaused by steady buoyancy flows.\" (4, p.70) KeyWords: CrystalGrowth From the Melt, Melt and Solidification, Float Zones, Coated Float Zones, Encapsulated Float Zones, Binary Systems, Dopant, Single Crystals, Electronic Materials, Sample Rotation, Rotating Fluids, Diffusion, Diffusive Mass Transfer, Diffusion-Controlled Growth, Free Flow, Buoyancy Effects Diminished, Liquid/Liquid Interface, Growth Rate, Solid/Liquid Interface, Liquid/Gas Interface, Concentration Distribution, Translation Rate, Striations, Rotational Striations, Sample Homogeneity, CoatedSurfaces, Thin Films, Experiment Investigator, May (3) Cr611, A., Muller, and Nitsche, R.: Under France, ofCrystal (5) Growth ofaSiCrystalCoveredwith aSiO2Skin. InSummary Review of Sounding Rocket Experiments in Fluid and Materials Sciences, TEXUS Nitsche and/or Eyer etal. to the flow mechanism responsible for striations observed in float-zone solidified runs were tobeperformed during the mission. The objective ofthe first run (designated asMHF 01A) was to confirm the results ofan earlier Spacelab 1experiment: that Marangoni flows may have grown bythe method (see Nitsche, Spacelab i). Reportedly, the \"MHF 01Arun\" was canceled due to timeline problems.\" (2, p.261) The objective ofthe second run (designated asMHF 01B)was to investigate the differences inflow patterns found incoated Earth-processed and coated space-processed molten Sizones. This objective was tobeaccomplished byanalyzing the distribution of adopant released from apoint source sample. During the Spacelab a molten zone 15mmlong through the crystal atarate of5mm/min. The center portion ofthe rod (approximately 70mminlength) had been coated (on Earth) with a5-micron-thick, coherent, amorphous 9-121 silica film. (Other portions ofthe rod had not been coated.) Within the coated section were two peripheral boron deposits (see Croll,TEXUS 12orReference (2) for details ofthe sample coat- ing procedures and boron-deposit procedures). Reportedly, problems arose during the experiment run when anin- correct furnace power setting resulted inoverheating ofthe sample. This power setting caused \"...the zone length to in- crease unduly (approx. 24mminstead of15mm). Video and data transmission for real-time correction was not available atthis time. The excess zone length caused premature release ofthe boron deposits. Furthermore, the prolonged contact time between melt and coating and the higher temperature produced holes inthe silica coating bythe reaction: Si+SiO2--> SiO. Thus, the an- diffusive conditions no longer prevailed because of Marangoni flows.\" (2, p. 261) <Note: Itisnot clear to the editors whether this reaction occurred over the entire length of the coated section orover acertain portion ofthe coated sec- tion. Examination processed samples for comparison, two experiments were performed using the same time-power conditions asthe flight experiment. Post-flight analysis ofthe l-g and low-gravity processed samples included (modified Sirtl measurements (imminter- vals along rod axis with four-point probe). Comparison between surface topograms ofthe flight and l-g reference samples led to the following conclusions: (i) Inboth the l-g and space crystals, the por- contained micron size striation patterns. Inthe coated portion ofthe space sample, nostriations were present. This result confirmed the findings from previous low-gravity experi- ments that time-dependent Marangoni isnot clear: if holes were present inthe silica coating and thus Marangoni flows were present (as reported three paragraphs above), why were no striations found inthe coated portions? Itissuspected that there were still areas ofthe coated section which did not have holes.> (2) The striation contrast inthe uncoated l-g processed sample was stronger than the contrast in the uncoated low-gravity processed sample. (This was attributed toadditional buoyancy flow inthe ground-based sample. The flow tended todecrease the 9-122 thickness ofthe diffusion layer atthe interface inthe ground sample, resulting inagreater effect oftemperature effective segregation coefficient.) (3) Periodic striations (0.2-0.5 were located in the 20mmlong coated portion ofthe l-g processed sample. The striations were attributed tothe transition from steady toos- cillatory buoyancy flow. Because ofthe overheating ofthe sample (excessive zone length), the desired, purely diffusive conditions could not beachieved. Resistivity versus axial distance curves indicated similar shapes for the l-g and low-gravity processed samples. The calculated curve for the complete mixing case was also similar inshape to the those from the experimental samples.

The detailed comparison ofspace experiments with related cel- lular growth theories was limited bythe unexpected temperature fluctuations during the low-gravity experiment. (The evolution ofthe solidification pattern inspace isdirectly connected to the temperature profile.) Because the growth was not stationary inspace, \"...it isnot possible toassociate the instantaneous velocity tothe spacing which was observed atthe same time. The decrease inperiodicity, which isconcomitant with the decrease of the solidification rate indeed occurs very slowly and bya heavy process based onamassive division ofthe cells.

The sample was not stuck tothe walls ofthe am- poule. There was anunusual feature tofreeze sur- face ofthe sample that appeared tobeasmall bump, about millimeters indiameter. Lead tin telluride had acrystal struc- ture that solidifies at ahigher density than the liquid, i.e. the volume ofthe solid isless than the volume ofthe liquid.

Radiography of the sample before the ampoule was opened showed that novoids were present.\" (7, analysis sample indi- cated considerable convective mixing had occurred during the solidification ofthe sample material. Thus, planar, diffusion- controlled growth did not result asexpected. Itwas speculated that this mixing within the me_t was produced by residual ac- celeration forces (less than i0-_g). Analysis ofthe furnace operation indicated \"...the cooling water loop did not function asplanned .... The lack ofcoolant, of course, changes the growth rate. Additional calibration runs are being conducted to determine the actual growth rates that oc- curred under flight conditions.

This control requires insitu measurement ofvarious solidification parameters. One method isbased the calorimetric prin- ciple. Theoretically, the growth rate ofasolidification inter- face may becalculated from (i) the latent heat ofsolidifica- tion, (2) the thermal flux inthe liquid, and (3) the thermal flux inthe solid. Since itisnot possible tomeasure the ther- mal fluxes onthe interface itself, these determinations must be made atsome distance from the interface, with the expected heat diffusion and heat loss accounted for. Underlow-gravity condi- tions, the characteristic ofdiffusive heat transport (absence of convection) allows testing ofthe calorimetric principle. This 1(Chpater 4)).

Journal of Crystal Growth, Vol. 92, 1988, was oneoftwo investigations housed within the G-479 Get Away Special canister during STS-031. The other ex- periment ofthe two isalso applicable Production UsingVapor Deposition\" (Chapter i0)). This crystalproduction experiment, which was designed, built, and tested byscientists and engineers atthe National Research Councilof Canada,was integrated into the G-479 GAS canister with the Telesat Canada Primary Mirror Production Experiment when itwas determined that the mirror experiment configuration (i) left unused space inthe canister and (2) had excess battery capacity topower asecond experiment. The experiment proposal was accepted byTelesat Canada inJune 1984 (the canister was scheduled tofly just 4months later on the shuttle inOctober 1984). Several constraints (dictated by the primary mirror production experiment already within the GAS can) had tobe addressed prior toexperiment assembly: volume, weight, operating temperature, power (65 W), etc. Nevertheless, 2months later, the completed experiment assembly was integrated into the G-479 canister ready for the October launch. Even- tually, the canister was removed from the originally scheduled flight inorder toclear the cargo bay for the rescue oftwo 9-138 satellites. The canister was finally flown (no upgrades allowed) inNovember 1985. The experimental concept was based on (i) the Principal Investigator's scientific experience with cadmium crystals, (2) Walter's earlier Skylab InSb quasi-containerless crystal growth experiments (see Walter, and SL-4 (Chapter 6)) and (3) Witt's ASTP Ga-doped Ge experiment (see Witt, ASTP (this chapter)). the earlier Skylab experiment, acontainerless section of anInSb cylindrical sample was melted inagradient furnace and resolidified. Although itwas expected that the solidified free section ofthe crystal would bespherical, the crystals grew into alonger tear-drop shape (containing facets around their circumference) and unexpectedly made contact with the container wall. During the earlier ASTP experiment, \"...it was found that gallium-doped germanium crystals regrown in aclosely fitting container (in the bridgman method) did not contact the container asthey would have onearth, but developed 'ribs' which contacted only about 1%ofthe container surface. Thus aform ofcon- tainerless growth was achieved without special measures.\" (8, p. 55) Based onthe three factors above, the specific objective ofthe experiment was todetermine ifpolycrystalline cadmium rods would behave similarly tothe crystals flown during these earlier ex- periments. Prior tothe shuttle flight i0cadmium specimens were prepared. \"The metal was purified, mainly for the removal ofoxides, bythe casting inavacuum. The castings were used asbillets for the hot extrusion of2mmdiameter rods inapress. The rods, cut to length became the specimens [each specimen 44mmlong]. Nospe- cial precautions were taken toclean before sealing into acontainer [with anargon atmosphere], an omission which had notable consequences.\" \"The containers were designed sothat the cadmium rod would not besupported everywhere, but would beheld atone end and either stand free for the remainder ofits length orbeinsome form of contact with the inside ofthe container. The latter portion of the container would beheated until the metal melted and then cooled topermit resolidification.\" (8, pp. 55-56) The s_cimen containers were made from two standard sizes of Pyrex tubing -6mmo.d. and I0mmo.d. -blown tothe the shape desired. Some of the containers had circular cross- sections (such that nosection ofthe sample's free section would touch the container). The other containers had circular cross- 9-139 sections achuck along the length ofthe tubing in three or four equally spaced positions around the tube circum- ference (such that the sample would touch the tube atthree or four longitudinal locations, see Reference (8), Figure i.) The specimens were anchored atone end by melting the end and shrinking the tubing over the form. Bundles of containers \"...were assembled bywrapping them with Nicrome ribbon, which served both tosecure and heat them. As- bestos tape was wrapped around the outside and secured with ce- ment. Finally aluminum foil was wrapped around the outside and secured with wire. Since only free-standing [or semi-free standing] section ofthe specimen was start from the unmelted part.\" (8, p.56) Terrestrial experiments were performed to determine the power required tomelt the cadmium bundles. \"If too little power was used the cadmium might not melt, while iftoo much was used the cadmium might melt back into the bulb. Itwas therefore decided tocut off the power when acertain temperature, indicated bythe thermocou_le voltage was reached. The temperature chosen was about i0vCover the melting point.\" (8, p.57) During the shuttle mission, power was supplied tothe experiment for i0min, 40seconds. Since time tofuse blowout onEarth was about 8minutes, itwas thought that the experiment might not have proceeded asplanned \"...since the survival ofthe fuse showed that the controlling thermocouple had not reached its cutoff temperature.\" (8, p.57) Post-flight examination of the flight specimens indicated that (I) all ofthe eight specimens inthe 6mmo.d. containers had melted tosome degree (although not tothe degree desired) and (2) the two specimens inthe 8mmo.d. containers had not melted. Reportedly, the samples did not melt asexpected because ofan inadequate estimate ofconvective heat transfer inspace. The general appearance ofthe flight specimens was much the same asbefore the flight. \"Although unexpected[,] the near retention ofthe original shape proved due tothe presence ofanoxide coating, left from the [ground-based, preflight] extrusion process, which acted asacontainer inmicrogravity .... ,,(8, p. 55) Soft X-ray wavelength dispersive analysis showed that the oxide layer was approximately 100-170... angstroms thick- substantially more than anormal layer 9-140 \"The melted lengths, determined with ameasuring microscope, ranged from 5to 28.5 mm [the expected meltback was 25mm]. There appears tobenofirm correlation between the number ofin- dentations and melted length although containers with indenta- tions ingeneral had longer melted lengths than those without. Grain size was ingeneral larger with increased melted length, but the maximum diameter shows norelation. Only the solid-melt interface changed inaregular way with irregular interfaces for short melted lengths and precise circular melts for longer lengths.\" (8, p.58) All melted specimens exhibited aslight in- crease indiameter. \"The grain structure ofthe specimens was revealed byetching. X-ray photographs were taken with Laue back reflection to show the crystal structure. The grains were large insome specimens, smaller inothers, but consistently larger than grains inthe un- melted metal.\" (8, p.55) Itwas concluded that: ,,Although prepared in haste, the experiment showed several phenomena not tobeseen onearth. The external shape ofthe specimens showed that the metal remained clear ofthe container walls and that anoxide layer remaining from extrusion of the rods acted asaslightly elastic container. The surface ofthe melted length did not retain die marks, although traces remained on some specimens. The grain size ofthe specimens varied greatly, but was always larger than that of the starting material. The crystallinity ofthe specimens ranged from highly perfect togreatly imperfect.

Results further indicated that \"...the discrepancy between observed and expected mass transport rates inspace...

In such aphysical vapor transport (PVT) system, chemical phase reactions are essentially absent. 10-20 During the mission, two ampoules containing the source/buffer components were simultaneously subjected to atemperature gradient of600 \u00b0C-500 \u00b0Cwithin athree-zone electric furnace.

Almost 50years later during this STS Get Away Special (GAS) experiment, Japanese inves- tigators attempted the production ofartificial snow inthe low- gravity environment. Scientists speculated that space-produced snow crystals would behighly symmetrical oreven spherical. The space was the environment. The experiment concept was originally proposed bytwo Japanese High School students (listed above under the Co-Investigator designation). The experiment hardware, which was developed and manufactured within 8months, was configured toproduce snow crystals grown inair (not onthe surface ofanobject). The payload consisted oftwo identical subsystems, which allowed the observation ofthe crystalline production. Each subsystem was configured with (I) asmall, lightweight, cold chamber (requiring low electrical power), (2) two compact high resolution video recorders (one with low power optics and one with high 10-28 power optics), (3) asequence control unit, and (4) athermal control unit. The power for the experiments was provided byNi- Cdbatteries. Snow crystals were tobegrown and observed inthe cold chamber. The chamber was designed to (i) obtain and maintain the desired temperature environment, (2) continuously supply water vapor (to grow snow crystals), (3) supply small particles ofsilver iodine (to act asseeds for the snow crystals), and (4) illuminate the snow crystals (so the growth could berecorded). The overall payload design also had to (i) provide additional cooling ofthe cold chamber (because ofheat generated during the experiment and the insufficiency ofavailable radiation cooling), (2) insure that water used inthe snow production did not scatter during shuttle launch (because ofhigh accelerations ofvarying frequencies), and (3) insure the water did not evaporate before the experiment was initiated. Prior tothe shuttle launch, approximately 15grams ofwater were stored inasmall, porous, sintered-metal container. The con- tainer lid was designed to prevent the stored water from evaporating orscattering before the experiment began. Three days after STS-006 was launched, the experiment was ac- tivated via asignal from anSTS astronaut. Within 5minutes of activation, acommand was sent byanastronaut toopen the lid of the water container. Reportedly, \"The water temperature inthe porous sintered metal container... [was tobe] raised byaninternal electric heater. This heater... [was] tomaintain the water temperature at20-30 degrees centigrade and thus supply water vapor continuously to the cold chamber. Avery small heating element made of platinum... [was tobe] activated inthe cold chamber iodine. The... iodine onthe element sublimates, forming small particles that act asseeds for the snow crystals.\" (7, p.5) The cold chamber was tobemain- tained atatemperature -15 \u00b0C via semiconductor thermo- modules \"The growth forms ofthe snow crystals depend onthe environmen- tal temperature and the mass ofwater vapor supplied (in other words, supersaturation ofsurrounding water vapor.) ....

[an] observation window onthe other side of the copper box, through which the snow crystals are observed with TV cameras and recorded onto video-tapes.,, (i, p.33) Four strands ofrabbit hair, which were stretched vertically across the cold chamber, were used tocapture the snow crystals for observation. Similarly, apiece ofcopper wire configured horizontally across the cold chamber was used the employed the rabbit hairs and wire. Only ground-based experiments appear tohave incorporated the hairs at the time ofthe STS-006 investigations (see Kimura, STS-006).> Because snow crystals were not observed during the earlier STS- 006 GAS experiment, two small improvements were made tothe payload for this STS-008 flight: (i) The replacement ofthe water vaporization heaters. During STS-006, a1watt heater had been used tovaporize the water ineach ofthe subsystems. Since the shuttle environment was colder than expected, this heater could not heat the water to the desired 25\u00b0C-30 \u00b0Ctemperature. Therefore, these heaters were replaced with 4.5 watt heaters. (2) Addition ofa1.5 cmdiameter blower-type fan. Inthe low- gravity environment, convective flows within the chamber are reduced. Itwas suspected that during STS-006, this reduction was responsible for the inefficient transport ofthe water vapor (if ithad indeed been produced) into the field ofview ofthe cameras. Therefore, a1.5 cmdiameter gas inthe coldchambers. During the STS-008 mission, each subsystem performed two snow ex- periments. The experiments were performed insequence. (Thus a total offour experiments were performed.) Adocument released prior tothe shuttle launch outlined the ex- pected fan operation sequences. \"The fan will bechanged in every snow-making experiment .... Inthe first experiment, the fan will beactivated for the first third ofthe time. Inthe second experiment, the fan will beturned onfrom the beginning tothe end ofthe experiment. Inthe third, fan will beac- inthe latter half, and inthe final one, for ashort time atthe <Note: Itwas unclear ifthis exact fan sequence was during the experiments.> Post-flight analysis of 6hours and 50minutes of space video tape indicated that the experiment was successful and that snow had been produced. Reportedly, during the second and third ex- periments (experiments inwhich the fan was activated tocreate the artificial breeze \"during most of the experimental time\") ,,...hexagonal and irregularly shaped snow crystals were formed on the rabbit hairs .... The results ofthese two experiments were just... [the] same asthe results ofthe experiments which were carried out hundreds oftimes onthe ground.\" (i, p.35) However, during the two other experiments, very different results were observed. Inthe first experiment, the fan was not ac- tivated during the initial 30minutes ofthe experiment. <Note: It isnot clear how long the fan was activated after this 30- minute time.> Inthe second experiment, the fan was activated for 5minutes when the silver-iodine was sublimated. Itthen ap- pears that the fan was turned off for the following 50minutes. <Note: Nofurther details ofthe experiments were described (for example, the total length ofthe experiments).> Itappears that during both ofthese experiments, nosnow came into the view of the cameras when the fan was not activated. However, when the fan was activated, nearly spherical, artificial snow crystals (formed presumably under near-weightlessness) were moved into view ofthe TVcameras bythe fan breeze. \"The diameter ofthe largest crystal was about 3mm.\" \"One crystal traveled the field of... view from left toright and finally collide[d] with arabbit hair.

Two ofthe investigations employed vacuum deposition techniques (vapor deposition and sputter deposition) and are reported in this experiment summary; the third investigation isdescribed un- der path. Ifmost ofthe molecules inthe vapor reach the substrate without first striking another molecule, the resultant coating isreasonably dense and adherent.

(i) Vapor Deposition The objective ofthe first investigation was touse avapor deposition process to create three spherical sculptures inte- riorly coated with metallic films. Three, 3000-ml glass spheres were selected. Prior tothe shuttle flight, each ofthe spheres was configured with atungsten filament which had been coated or wrapped with metal. Itappears that during the space experiment, the interior ofeach sphere was exposed tothe space vacuum and the tungsten filament was heated. Subsequently, the metal vaporized and the vapor covered the interior ofthe glass spheres. Post-flight analysis ofthe equipment dedicated tothis inves- tigation indicated that the vapor deposition experiments were performed asplanned \"...creating two sculptures with very clean opaque coatings ofgold and aluminum and one sculpture with a coating deposited from atwo stage filament coated with aluminum and silicon monoxide, creating aniredescent [sic] effect.\" (5, p.269) <Note: Nodetailed results ofthis experiment were presented which compared the quality of the space-produced films with Earth-produced films.

Further, although itwas not specifically stated inthe available references, itappears that the first two spheres were each coated with one metallic element (one sphere was coated with gold, the second with aluminum).> (2) Sputter Deposition The objective ofthe second investigation was touse asputter deposition process tocreate five spherical sculptures interiorly coated with metallic films ofgold, silver, platinum, and chrome. Toachieve this goal, the interior offive, 500-ml glass spheres were each configured with the appropriate sputter deposition hardware. (Reportedly, the experiments were performed insmaller spheres than employed for the vapor deposition experiments be- cause during sputtering, the substrate isusually much closer to the source.) During the experiment, the interior ofeach sphere was exposed to the space vacuum environment. Then, \"By accelerating positively charged argon ions into the surface ofanegatively charged metal target mounted inthe center of each sphere, target molecules were [mechanically knocked loose from the relatively cold source (the target) and] ejected bythe impact of the argon ions and formed acoating onthe ofeach Although itwas not specifically stated inthe available references, itappears that each sphere was coated with asingle metallic element.

The specific objective ofthe investigation was to produce an HgI2crystal of high quality by atechnique of vaporization and recondensation. The low-gravity experiment was performed Crystal Growth System (VCGS). The was configured seed crystal (3mmper side). The pedestal fit over ame- tal support tube which contained aPeltier cooling device. The source material (polycrystalline HgI2) was located atthe sides ofthe ampoule, and was held inplace byglass fingers.

These in- cluded multiple sublimation/condensation steps and a melting/refreezing operation.\" (Reference ii)) thermal profile ofthe indepen- dently covered with a heat equalization ring (configured inthe payload below the am- poule atthe pedestal end) heated the lower section ofthe am- poule. Ahelically wound vertical coil provided thermal equalization ofthe ampoule. Ontop of the helical coil was areflective shield for minimizing heat loss. This arrangement resulted inatemperature minimum atap- proximately the middle ofthe ampoule. The entire apparatus was enclosed byabell jar ofhigh optical quality, which allowed microscopic observation of the growing crystal. (See References (6), (8), and/or (9) for further details ofthe hardware.) During the mission, the VCGS was used toproduce asingle crystal ofmercuric iodide. steps: (i) heat-up (4hours), (2) growth (i18 hours), and (3) cool down (8hours). During the heat-up phase, the temperature atthe source, heat distribution ring, and cooling sting were controlled tooptimize the growth conditions. Gradually decreasing the pedestal tem- perature initiated the growth phase. (The temperature difference between the source material and crystal was inthe region ofa few degrees celsius (<i0 degrees).) Periodic etching ofthe grow- ing crystal was possible by oscillating the temperature ofthe source material. This etching was performed toremove any stray particles ofmercuric iodide dust onthe seed's surfaces. (The technique reportedly also allowed more stable crystal growth and avoided spurious crystal nucleation.) System cool-down was in- 10-52 itiated when the experiment time had elapsed (Spacelab shutdown). ,,Notwithstanding the efforts made topredetermine the proper growth conditions onthe ground (elimination ofconvection around the ampoule byevacuation ofthe space between the ampoule and bell jar), the temperature again had tobe adjusted to obtain crystal growth inspace. This accounts for the fact that during the first 14hours inspace nogrowth was observed. The tempera- ture difference between source and the pedestal had tobein- creased by1.6 \u00b0Ctoinitiate growth. \"As higher tempera- ture gradients could be applied than isusually done onthe ground, without disturbing the stability ofthe crystal surfaces orwithout any new therefore rates bydiffusion transport alone than isusually seen onthe ground with both diffusion and convection transport .... \"(9, p. 278) \"...the linear varied, reaching amaximum ofabout 3mm/day. This compares togrowth rates on earth that range from about 0.5 to2mm/day, with anaverage of about 1mm/day. (On earth cm space-grown HgI2crystal was performed using gamma-ray rocking curve analysis and electronic measurements. The rocking curve measurements revealed asingle peak indicative ofasingle crys- tal without major grain boundaries. However, evidence ofinter- nal strain, asdetermined bythe width and asymmetrical shape of the curve, was also detected. The rocking curve of anEarth- grown crystal revealed several peaks indicating that the crystal consisted ofthree sections atslight angles with respect toeach other (see Reference (9) for rocking curves). The crystal quality ofradiation detectors can bedetermined by examining the electron and hole mobilities and lifetimes. These properties were investigated by evaluation of the nuclear spectral response asafunction ofapplied bias. Comparison of these values tothose for detectors produced onEarth revealed improved properties for the low-gravity material (see Reference (9)). This was especially true \"...with respect tothe holes, which isthe most critical factor for detector operation.\" (9, p. 282) 10-53 \"Initial electrical properties measurements onslices ofthe space-grown crystal indicated extremely high electron and hole mobilities, more than twice ashigh asthe best ever reported on earth. When these measurements were repeated some 3months later, the mobilities had degraded totypical earth-grown values. This isnot understood although since this particular material is extremely soft and easily damaged, the apparent degradation could have been caused by aging and handling despite the extreme precautions taken toprevent such effects.\" (3, p.29) Itwas concluded that the experiment togrow HgI2from the vapor phase performed exceptionally well, and the objectives were ful- filled. Growth conditions inspace allowed processing with an increased temperature gradient, such that the growth rate with diffusion transport alone was larger than onEarth (diffusion and convection). The structural quality and electronic transport properties ofthe low-gravity sample were significantly improved over the l-g processed material. Other interesting results are reported inseveral ofthe avail- able publications.

OnEarth, both buoyancy-driven convection and gaseous diffusion ofthe vapor contribute tothe formation ofthe crystalline product. Inareduced-gravity environment, the convective con- tribution should begreatly suppressed, resulting invapor growth which isstrongly driven by the diffusion contribution. Such diffusion-controlled growth contributes tothe production of higher quality crystals. This experiment was the first inaseriesofinvestigations designed byDebe etal. tostudy the closed-cell vapor transport oforganic solids. The specific objectives ofthe experiment were to (i) study the vapor transport process, (2) explore the effects oflow-gravity processing onfilm microstructure, and (3) evaluate the thermal performance ofthe experimental hardware un- der space flight conditions. Atotal ofnine, sealed, ultra high vacuum (UHV)-quality stain- less steel PVT ampoules were employed during the mission. Five of these ampoules were dedicated to the study of the vapor transport process and four tothe growth ofthin films \u00b0Cbycon- centric heater assemblies. The heater power, source end, cell surface, and substrate temperatures, were controlled and monitored during 4.5-hour processing periods. Itwas noted that \"The outgassing ofthe cell's and resultant heat loss by gas phase conduction... [were] important parameters for the cell power requirements and ampoule boundary conditions.\" (9, p.2406 (abstract)) Post-flight, space-based experimental results were compared to ground-based control experiments which (I) were conducted in\"hot end up\" and \"hot end down\" orientations and (2) duplicated the flight experimental conditions. Reportedly, \"Very well defined substrate deposits, both thick and thin film, were obtained inall nine ofthe PVTOS flight PVT am- weight ofthe buffer gas.\" (9, p.2406) Extensive characterization of the flight-produced X-ray photoemission, SEM and visible microscopy (i) established the existence of anew polymorph of copper phthalocyanine and (2) indicated that low-g processing results in films with enhanced uniaxial ordering, smoothness, and optical homogeneity. \"An assessment ofthe [flight] PVTOS experimental cell design and performance indicates the use ofUHV-type materials and sealing techniques, including aglass-to-metal joint, have very adequately met the launch and landing stresses while providing the desiredthermal insulation and environment for aPVT experi- ment with limited power available. The outgassing ofmaterials inour particular cell design was also typical ofUHVsystems, with H2the dominant species, confirming our cell cleaning and assembly procedures. Heattransfer from the cell heater tothe outer stainless-steel envelope by gas phase conduction in microgravity issignificant when the residual pressures exceed 0.5 Torr.

These flows, inturn, often contribute to the formation ofmicroinhomogeneities inthe processed materials. Such inhomogeneities tend to degrade crystalline quality. In contrast, during space-based vapor crystal growth, gravity- induced convective flows are reduced and diffusion-dominated flow ofthe vapor components (Cd atoms, Te2molecules) should result. The objectives ofthis Spacelab D1experiment were to(i) produce aCdTecrystal grown from the vapor phase inalow-gravity en- vironment, and (2) determine (a) ifdiffusion-dominated vapor crystal growth had occurred and (b) ifcrystals with areduced defect density had been produced. ofaquartz ampoule... containing separated bya distance of6mm.

Inorder toincrease the quality ofthe grown crystals, the governing parameters of the process must be known. These parameters include both gravity-dependent (convective flows) and quasi-diffusive transport mechanisms. The objectives ofthis Spacelab D1research were to (I) inves- tigate and characterize the parameters which govern the vapor phase transport during vapor crystal growth and (2) employ these parameters intheoretical analyses. Each sample consistedof(i) agrowth ampoule, agent. The growth ampoules were made ofsilica glass (19.5 mm outsidediameter). The source and sink were Gepolycrystals held atthe tube ends by aGegrid. The Gemonocrystalline substrate held holder agent. Six chromel-alumel thermocouples, located at the quartz wall, were used for temperature field determination.

InESA European Science UnderMicrogravity, Growth ofthe employed metals lowers the quality ofthe surface. If the mirrors could beprocessed inthe contamination-free environ- ment ofspace, higher quality mirrors might result. This experiment was oneoftwo investigations housed within the G-479 Get Away Special canister during STS-031. The other ex- periment (of the two) isalso applicable tothis data base (see Lipsett, STS-031(Chapter 9)). The specific objectives ofthe research were to (i) create mir- rors inalow-gravity environment and (2) compare the optical properties of the space-produced mirrors with vapor isrealized onthe substrate, areflective surface is formed. OnEarth, high quality mirrors are generally produced invacuums of the order of 1to5micro-Torr. Incontrast, the vacuum available shuttle's \"parking orbit\" was tobeof the order of2to5milli-Torr. Nevertheless, the investigators decided touse the vacuum conditions available inthe shuttle's orbit (for all but one ofthe experiments). This decision al- lowed them toinvestigate the quality ofthe processing available inthe shuttle \"parking orbit\" environment. Prior tothe shuttle launch, six tubes were configured for the experiments. Five ofthe tubes were used tosublimate metallic elements; the sixth tube was used tosublimate sodium. The five tubes dedicated tothe metallic elements were made of steel. Each tube contained (i) two, 2-inch diameter quartz lenses (one ateach end acting asthe substrates), (2) acoated filament (inserted between the lenses), and (3) \"inserts holding smaller samples... [which] were later examined for their metal- lurgical properties byperforming transmission electron micros- copy (TEM) tests.\" (4, p.53) Gold, silver, and aluminum were chosen asfilament coatings. Holes were drilled into the tube that ,,...allowed air toevacuate from the tube when the shuttle left the earth's atmosphere (the GAS cannister [sic] was open to the shuttle bay).\" (4, p.52) Itwas noted that there was a drawback inselecting this evacuation design because air would re-enter the tubes when the shuttle returned toEarth (and would thus permit oxidation and contamination ofthe samples). Because sodium requires avacuum onthe order of1to6micro- Torr to sublimate, the remaining (sixth) sealed tube was evacuated prior tolaunch. The tube was made ofglass and was designed with anhour-glass shape. The neck ofthe hour-glass held the sodium tobevaporized; the filament was wrapped around the neck. The two ends ofthe hour-glass acted asthe substrate for the desired mirrors. \"The packaging for the hourglass tube was designed toabsorb the vibration oflaunch and contain the chemically reactive sodium ifthe glass were tobreak .... Two drawbacks tothis hourglass tube were the fragility ofthe glass and the fact that helium permeated the glass walls degrading the vacuum over time. This made itimperative that the flight tube be manufactured and installed as late as possible in the experiment's integration into the shuttle.\" (4, p.52) Post-flight analysis ofthe payload indicated that metallic mir- rors were made inall.of the steel tubes. Unfortunately, sodium mirrors were not made. Itwas determined that the neck ofthe hour-glass tube cracked during launch and the required vacuum to 10-73 sublimatethe sodiumwaslost. After the space experiment was returned toEarth, similar mirror production experiments were performed inthe space hardware. These experiments were performed inathermal vacuum chamber. Atthe time Reference (4) was published, full evaluation ofthe mirror samples had not been completed. Tests were still being performed on the Earth and space-processed samples in the re- search labs ofthe National Research Council ofCanada,the University ofToronto, and Litton Systems (Toronto). Itwas reported that the tests were toinclude: \"...reflectance measure- ments, polarization measurements, backscatter measurements, dif- microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and spectroscopic analysis.\" (4, p.56) Although Reference (4) indicated that technical reports were ex- pected which wouldfurther describe experimental results, Reference (7) reported that documents which detailed the final mirror evaluation were not published. Itwas briefly reported (Reference (7)): \"The experiment successfully produced mirrors.

Two sets ofthree samples each were processed onEarth for comparison: one set was soaked at 775 \u00b0Cfor 2hours and the second set was soaked at775 \u00b0Cfor 1 hour. Post-flight examination ofall the low-gravity processed samples indicated unique wrinkled surfaces inthose sections located in the hot end ofthe furnace. This characteristic was attributed to(i) solidification shrinkage, and/or (2) asurface effect oc- curring during heating, and/or (3) higher heat removal atcertain sites along the cylinder. Reportedly, \"Ground based samples be- came shorter and thicker after melting because ofthe filling of space provided for expansion.,, (i, p.437) However, none ofthe l-g samples exhibited the surface wrinkles. Itwas reported that all l-g and ground-based samples weighed less after processing (probably because ofzinc evaporation). Alow-level gamma-ray spectrometer was used for determining gamma intensity from the zinc samples (see Reference (I) for procedure). All ground-based samples indicated acomplete mixing ofthe zinc-65. Distribution predictions (using apure diffusion mechanism) revealed auniform distribution would be expected after (i) 73.5 hours for the zinc-65 pellet located onone end (A-type) and (2) 18.38 the pellet located inthe middle (B-type).

Prior tolaunch, the sample was heated inthe TEXUS Experiment Module TEM 01-i toatemperature above its glass transition point (550 \u00b0C). Once low-gravity conditions had been achieved, the sample was heated to1160 \u00b0C(as registered atthe middle ofthe sample) resulting inaneffective reaction time ofabout 135 seconds. Reportedly, a\"...step atthe edge between both glass cylinders has the function tomaintain aneven interface...,, at gravity levels approaching zero. (i, p.264) Prior tothe end of the low-gravity period, the sample was rapidly cooled. Areference sample was processed onEarth using the same thermal profile. Post-flight comparison ofthe l-g and low-gravity processed sample indicated that the low-gravity material had a more even interface. Aslight radius ofcurvature atthe inter- face ofthe low-gravity sample was observed and attributed togas bubbles which formed during cooling.

The specific objective ofthis experiment was toinvestigate the corrosion of vitreous silica by two sodium silicate glass melts under low- gravity conditions Prior tothe flight, two experimental samples were prepared. In the first sample, aType III vitreous silica glass cylinder was sandwiched between two cylinders ofNa20 3sio2(25 mol% NaO) ,2 Inthe second sample, aType and sintered at550 \u00b0Cinavacuum furnace. The cylinders were then closed byPt caps and the entire configuration sealed under vacuum inaTa-Zr- Mocartridge. (See Reference (4) for additional sample prepara- tion details.) Just prior toliftoff, the samples were preheated to700 \u00b0C in the TEXUS Experiment Module TEM 01Furnace (maximum heating rate of0.5 K/s). After launch, the material was heated atamaximum heating rate of3.5 K/s until the effective reaction temperature of1420 \u00b0Cwas achieved ,,...the sample was held atthat tem- perature about 3min and was then cooled atarate of20K/s byflushing with He. Cooling near the transformation tempera- tures ofthe sodium silicate glasses took place more slowly .... \" (4, p.2) Aneffective reaction time of182 seconds was es- 11-17 timated. (The hold time and cooling were achieved during the low-gravity phases ofthe rocket flight.) Reference samples were prepared inthe same manner on Earth using anidentical time- temperature profile. After sample recovery and prior toanalysis, the specimens were heated to550 \u00b0C(above the glass transition temperature, T_) and slowly cooled toroom temperature. This procedure was performed tominimize mechanical stress inthe samples. Post-flight analysis ofthe specimens included (i) electron microprobe studies (for determination ofthe corrosion profiles) and (2) photography (after axial slicing, grinding, and polishing). Reportedly, the Earth-processed samples contained clearly visible convective vortices which were absent inthe low- gravity processed material. The l-g processed samples (because ofthe presence ofconvection) also exhibited anapparent inter- diffusion coefficient which was smaller than that seen for the low-gravity samples. (Reference (i) reported that this result was also observed inthe TEXUS 1low-gravity sample and the cor- TEXUS 1(this chapter)).) The TEXUS 4low-gravity processed samples demonstrated the expected undisturbed diffusion profiles. The interdiffusion coefficients for the l-g and low-gravity T=1420 \u00b0C.

Cylinders (4) and (5) (comprising the third sample) were used for the interdiffusion experiment (designated asES307A). Reportedly, the IHF malfunctioned during the experiment because of \"...the misworking vacuum gas system of the MSDR [Material Science Double Rack].

The material was then removed from the cartridge and placed ina water-free methanol bath toprevent corrosion byair.

Calculation of the effective diffusion time was performed using the formula of Makin etal. (see Reference (5)). The effective diffusion time, teff, was ofthe low-gravity concentration profiles (parallel and normal tothe original phase boundary of the two glass cylinders) indicated anundisturbed interdiffusion process.

InProceedings ofthe 4th European Symposium onMaterials Sciences under Microgravity, melt (fining) during aglass refining process isaproblem which has been studied extensively inthe past (see Reference (i) for details). Earlier work em- phasized the importance ofgas diffusion and gas solution during the fining process. Bubble-radius versus time data has been used todetermine diffu- sion coefficients during ground-based experiments. However, un- wanted gravity-dependent convective effects disturb the con- centration fields around the bubble and make the calculation of the diffusion coefficients inaccurate. This STS-011 experiment was the i). (The series ofexperiments, asawhole, included examination in the areas of (i) interdiffusion between glass melts ofdiffering compositions, (2) corrosion ofsilica bythe melt, and (3) self- diffusion inglass melts.) The specific objective ofthis ex- periment was to (i) investigate the shrinking of ahelium gas 11-28 bubble inaglass melt and thus (2) determine the diffusion coef- ficient ofhelium inaglass melt. The experiment was performed inanisothermal furnace configured within aMAUS container. (The container, which issimilar toa Get Away Special (GAS) Canister,was part ofthe STS-011 Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS 01A) system.) The furnace was equipped with sapphire windows which permitted photography ofthe shrink- ing bubble at1min intervals. Illumination for the photography was provided byanelectronic flash. During the investigation, asodalime silica glass sample (30 mm inlength, 16mmindiameter) containing aHebubble was melted atII00 \u00b0C. The total observation time was 93min. Information onthe bubble radius versus time was attained from post-flight examination ofthe photographs. Itwas reported that the bubble shrank almost linearly with time toaresidual volume of10%. Itwas also reported that the bubble center remained at afixed location during the experiment. From the radius versus time data, the intrinsic diffusion coefficient ofHeinthe glass melt was determined (see Reference (i) for analysis details). The low-gravity, time-temperature data indicated that the sample temperature was not constant through any portion ofthe experi- ment. \"This was due tothe restricted electrical power resources and probably an increase ofthe emissivity ofthe stainless... [steel heat] shields during several thermal tests. The initial objective toevaluate the the diffusion coefficient for acon- stant temperature had tobereplaced bythe... [calculation] ofa temperature dependent This led tothe values for the diffu- sion coefficient for two temperatures.\" (7) The Principal Investigator's response(Reference (7)) reported that the calculated diffusion coefficients from the values of the diffusion coefficients asreported inReference (i) were preliminary results. \"Alater detailed analysis showed, that it was only possible toevaluate about 30minutes ofthe experiment. This was due tothe applicated model, which had totake into ac- count the variable temperature. This means atemperatUre range from 936\u00b0C to1036 \u00b0C.\" (7) The tothe editors.> 11-29 The low-gravity results were compared totwo earlier experiments performed onEarth (see Reference (6)).

Optical analysis ofthe cell was made by employing aSavart interferometer. Inorder toachieve homogeneous melts inthe reservoirs, the cell was heated for 24 hours at atemperature of 300 deg \u00b0C. Reportedly, because ofdelays during the ventilation and filling procedure (jammingofthe slide bars associated with the compres- sible reservoirs), the applied anti-wetting coating was destroyed and the necessary phase boundary could not beformed.

This Spacelab 1experiment was the first tostudy The objective ofthe was tostudy the self diffusion ofSnIIz and Sn124 inliquid tin. The specific goals ofthe research were to (i) determine the self diffusion coefficient of molten tin without the disturbing influence of gravity-driven convection, (2) compare the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient with theories and terrestrial- experimental results, and (3) determine the extent ofthe isotope and \"wall\" effects. During the mission, 16tin samples (with SnI12 and Sn124 tracers) were isothermally annealed within eight vacuum chambers inthe Spacelab High Temperature Thermostat (HTT). Itappears that each ofthe eight chambers (i) held two samples (one which had a capillary diameter of1mmand one which had acapillary diameter of3mm), (2) was heated toadifferent diffusion temperature (ranging from 240-1250 \u00b0C), and (3) employed three thermocouples (to monitor thermal distributions). <Note: Itisnot clear if 11-65 each of the 16 tin samples contained both SnI12 and Sn124 tracers, although itappears from discussions ofthe post-flight sample analysis that both isotopes were ineach ofthe samples. It was reported that the \"...two highly enriched stable isotopes.., were two heaters: one toprovide atemperature gradient during melting and cooling and one to provide an isothermal distribution during annealing. During the experiment sequence, each chamber was :(i) heated toatemperature above its melting point, (2) heated toits appropriate diffusion tem- perature, (3) maintained atthe diffusion temperature for a specified time (for example, 2.7 hours (400 \u00b0C) and 10.5 hours (260 \u00b0C)), and (4) cooled via the helium flooding. It appears that difficulties related to (i) unexpected vacuum- gas-system (VGS) operation, (2) experimental data loss, and (3) a HTT power relay problem, severely affected diffusion results in atleast two ofthe chambers. Inaddition, while precise tem- perature measurement was ofsignificant importance, errors inall temperature values were higher than anticipated (1% instead of +/-0.1%).

This indicates the even- tual sample analysis was not limited tothe three diffusion tem- peratures cited above.> Based on the results reported in References (i) and (4), the following was reported: 11-66 (I) The diffusion coefficients for each isotope at398 \u00b0Cand 810 ocwere significantly lower than those determined condi- tions. This decrease indicated alack of gravity-driven microconvections. These results also implied that 30% to 50% the l-g diffusion coefficient value was due to gravity-driven convection. ofthe space-obtained diffusion coefficients were percent,\" while accuracy the Earth-obtained diffusion coefficients had typically been 5%-30%. <Note: It is anaccuracy of0.5% DI12 and isotope masses 112 and 124 .... \"_4, p. 148) This difference was illustrated in Reference (4) using composition profiles ofSnI12 and Sn124 for the 321 \u00b0Csample (see Reference (4), Figure 8). Itappears that from such values, the isotope effect was derived for atleast 5 ofthe samples. Agraph depicting the effect illustrated that the isotope effect inSngenerally increased with increasing tem- perature. Reportedly this fact could be interpreted \"...by a more collective atomic motion ofatoms atlower temperatures (small free volume) with the tendency tomove more gas-like at higher temperatures.\" (4, p. can (4), pp. 146 and 148.> (4) Further, reliable measurements of...

The objective ofthis Spacelab D1experiment was toobservethe thermal diffusion of amolten mixture, \"...in such conditions that the gravity field issmall compared tothe thermal field, and permitting in-situ measurement ofthe Soret effect after a careful choice ofthe method and dimensions ofthe cell.\" (ii, p. 152) Although itappears that onlyoneexperiment run was planned, a second experimental opportunity seems tohave been made available atthe end ofthe mission after the processing facility had been used for all other scheduled experiments. The two runs were es- sentially the same except that during the second, the D1ves- tibular sled facility, Spacelab aisle...\", (i0, p. 53) was operating. During the two investigations, atotal of six thermodiffusion cells containing amolten salt AgI/KI mixture were heated within the Gradient Heating Facility (GHF). Astrong temperature was imposed over the cells for 6hours. As expected, there was asalt volume increase during melting. This increase was absorbed with aporous material cylinder which surrounded the salt. Detection ofthe diffusion inreal time was achieved by measuring the thermoelectric power with silver electrodes. During the melting, therefore, itwas important to compensate for the volume expansion while keeping the cell com- pletely filled and fluid incontact with the electrodes. Space diffusion experiments were compared tosimilarly performed Earth diffusion experiments. Reportedly, afew hours after Earth-based experiment initiation, thermoelectric signals were erratically perturbed. Itwas thought that these perturbations were due toliquid contact problems inthe top electrode. Too large ofaliquid absorption bythe porous tube near the top electrode had occurred. (Such perturbations did not appear in the space samples.) This proved that inspace the measured ther- mopotential corresponded toacomplete cell filling. The evolution of the space measured thermoelectric power with time was quite different from equivalent Earth variations. It seemed characteristic ofadiffusion process but slower than pre- dicted, corresponding tomuch smaller diffusion coefficients in space than onEarth The Soret coeffi- cient could not becalculated, asthe stationary state was too far from being attained, but itispositive when related tothe migration ofAgI toward the cold side ofthe cell. Small Earth variations make itimpossible tomeasure the Soret effect correctly under normal gravity conditions. Although the system was theoretically stable, the heavier components migrate toward the cold side ofthe cell. Resultant vestibular sled accelerations were correlated toex- perimental measurements during the second experimental run. It was found that accelerations produced bythe sled were atleast I0times smaller than corresponding tothe space situation confirmed that the experiment was not perturbed by convection resulting from the low-gravity space environment. 11-75 KeyWords: Diffusion, Molten Salts, Binary Systems, and Solidification, Thermal Diffusion, Self-Diffusion, In- terdiffusion, Thermal Gradient, Buoyancy-Driven Convection, Volume Expansion, Porous Material, Wetting, Thermopotential Measurements, Density Difference, Sample Purity, Electrodes, Ac- celeration Effects, Accelerations/Vibrations Produced ByOnboard Equipment NumberofSamples:six chosen because \"-first, one component isasilver salt, permitting tofol- low the electromotive force evolution versus time with convenient silver electrodes. \"-Secondly, the bonding forces are not purely ionic inthe case ofsilver compounds sothat one can assume the silver ions' heat oftransport not tobeneglected.

Above the monotectic temperature, separation ofthe components due togravity occurs rapidly (because ofthe large variation in density between the two materials). Therefore, alloys which have compositions between 0.9 wt.% and 99.5 wt.% Pbare not useful. Processing inspace (reduced gravity conditions) should allow the production ofuseful alloys within the desired composition range. Itwas expected that such analloy could beproduced under low- gravity conditions by (i) heating the desired Pb/Zn contained material above the consulate temperature, (2) holding the material atthis temperature for along enough period oftime to allow homogenization bydiffusion, and (3) solidifying the alloy. The required homogenization time was not known since accurate diffusion constants had not been determined onEarth. Ground- based studies had indicated that low-gravity experiments were required toobtain this information. Thus, this Spacelab D1ex- periment was designed tostudy the interdiffusion of zinc and lead under low-gravity conditions.

Fortunately the samples were distributed among the cells in such amanner that itwas possible tostudy all the alloys .... \"(5, p. 173) However, itappears that the Sn-Bi alloy was analyzed with a \"reduced statistical spread\" compared tothe other materials. Post-flight, the component concentration ofall ofthe samples was determined via neutron activation (except for the Bisample which required chemical analysis).

July 1993.Praizey, Contact(s): ofthe investigation were todetermine ther- mal convective influences on (i) the mass diffusion inthe melt ahead ofasolid-liquid interface (in anAlCu alloy), (2) the stability ofthis interface, and (3) ofmetal- analysis and microsonde measurements for concentration profile determination. Itwas reported that for the AlCu alloys, the diffusion boundary layer ofthe low-gravity material was twice as thick when compared to the boundary layer of l-g processed samples (same crystallization condition). (A9mm boundary layer was indicated for one ofthe space-processed specimens (see Reference (3) for quantitative and theoretical treatments ofthese results).) 11-86 The quenched solidification front ofone (low-g) AlCu sample was examined. Reportedly, the interface between the solid and quenched liquid zone was unstructured and smooth. This result indicated that the criteria described byG/v (where G=sample temperature gradient and v=solidification velocity) for a smooth solidification front appears tohave athermal convection term which has not been considered (see Reference (3) for details). The influence ofconvection ondendrite arm coarsening was ex- amined that coarsening was lower inthe l-g processed samples when solidified with a thermal gradient ofapproximately 16K/mm and asolidification velocity and low-gravity processed samples was nearly identical. Therefore, itappeared that con- vection only influenced the dendrite arm spacing below acertain solidification front velocity. (Theoretical treatment ofthe con- vection influences ondendrite arm spacing can be located in Reference (6).)

In ofthe Norderney Symposium onScientific Results of the German Spacelab of the Norderney Symposium onScientific Results ofthe German Spacelab Mission DI, Norderney, A,Vol. 1988, experiment, the diffusion ofnickel incopper alloys was tobeinvestigated. Reportedly, shortly after the successful launch ofTEXUS16, fuel inthe second stage ofthe rocket did not ignite asplanned. After the apogee was reached and the rocket began to fall, the yo-yo despin system was deployed asprogrammed. Due tothe unex- pected excess rocket mass, however, there was an incomplete reduction ofrocket spin. Subsequently, the payload separated from the second stage, but the parachute was not released. An unbraked impact ofthe payload resulted inthe destruction ofall experiment modules including the TEM 01-2 module. Nofurther information concerning the experimental objectives or equipment setup ofthis investigation could be located atthis time. Key Words:Diffusion, Metals are oftenused tomodelmetal alloy systems be- cause (I) such systems normally melt atsignificantly lower tem- peratures than metal alloy systems, (2) at these low tempera- tures, visual recording ofthe solidification can take place, (3) the phase diagrams ofsuch systems can beremarkably similar to metal alloy systems, and (4) by employing these diagrams, interpretation/extrapolation/prediction ofmetal alloy system microstructural features ispossible. Oneof the goals ofsolidification research isunder- standing the phenomena occurring atthe growth front. \"These phenomena are governed byconvection and diffusion inthe liquid ahead ofthe front. Byremoving the convection term (in alow gravity field), amore detailed understanding ofdiffusion- controlled growth will result.\" (7, p.i) The objective ofthis Consort1experiment was Chapter i)). While most ofthe investigative teams 11-91 (including this one) used the MDA toconduct aliquid-liquid or liquid-solid diffusion study (ii experiments), the apparatus was also used to(I) determine the role offluid physics onthe for- mation offilms and the casting ofmembranes (five experiments) and (2) determine the effect ofre-entry loads onterrestrial- grown crystals (one experiment). The MDA was fashioned (in part) from two blocks of inert material. Each block had over i00 sample wells strategically drilled into its surface. Awell was capable ofholding 100-500 mloffluid. After all ofthe wells had been filled with the ap- propriate sample materials (depending oneach investigator's specific objectives), the blocks were joined together. Twice during the mission, the upper block moved relative tothe bottom block. Each movement ofthe block either (i) aligned or (2) misaligned wells onthe top block with wells onthe bottom. When the wells were aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could take place. When the wells were not aligned, material transfer from one well tothe other could not take place.

The \"Type 4\"test wells were used exclusively for the film formation and membrane casting experiments (see Pellegrino, Consort i;Vera, Consort1(all inChapteri)). This experiment was allotted two 2\" test wells. Discussion of this specific well-type isdetailed here. Each \"Type 2\"test well provided the investigator with one ex- perimental opportunity (data point). The well-type used two sample wells, one onthe top block and one onthe bottom block. Prior toflight, the top well ofeach well-type was filled with ethanol and the bottom well of each well-type was filled with succinonitrile. The blocks were then joined together such that the wells inthe upper block were purposely misaligned with the wells inthe lower block. Once the rocket had been launched and the low-gravity phase had been achieved, amotor and cam mechanism moved the upper block tothe right, aligning the wells onthe upper and lower blocks. The MDA experiments were performed inanambient temperature en- vironment and thus, the succinonitrile was inthe solid phase. Once the wells were incontact, material diffusion was realized across the solid-liquid interface. Just prior tothe termination ofthe low gravity rocket phase, the upper block again moved I1-92 rightmisaligning theupperandlowerwells. Thismisalignment prevented further Rocket Flight.

This experiment ofthis specific well-type isdetailed here. Each \"Type 2\"test well provided the investigator with one ex- perimental opportunity. The well-type used two sample wells, one on the top block and one onthe bottom block. Prior tothe rocket flight, the well inthe upper block ofeach well-type was filled with water and the well inthe lower block ofeach well- type was filled with trypan blue dye, 2%or4%inwater. <Note: Reference (6) indicated that 2%dye inwater was used while Reference (2) indicated that 4%dye inwater was used.> The blocks were then joined together such that the well inthe upper block was purposely misaligned with the well onthe lower block. Once the rocket had been launched and the low-gravity phase achieved, amotor and cam mechanism moved the upper block tothe right, aligning the wells onthe upper and lower blocks. Once the wells were incontact, material diffusion was realized across the liquid-liquid interface. Just prior tothe termination of the low-gravity rocket phase, the upper block again moved right misaligning the upper and lower wells. This misalignment prevented further material diffusion between the liquids. Post-flight evaluation ofthe operation ofthe MDA indicated that the upper moved asexpected allowing diffusion totake place inthe \"Type 2\"test wells. Although itwas reported that minor fluid leakage inthe top and bottom blocks ofthe MDA resulted incontamination ofsome ofthe test wells allotted 17investigations, itwas not clear ifthis particular ex- periment was affected bythe contamination. Optical density measurements ofeach well-pair performed after the rocket flight illustrated the amount ofdye which had dif- fused during the low gravity phase ofthe rocket flight. Very little discussion ofresults could belocated atthis time. However, itwas reported that \"...diffusion oftrypan blue from a water solution into.., pure water, occurs atthe same rate inlow 11-96 gravity asonearth. This observation served asthe baseline for approximately 70other samples on the MDA and affirmed that solute transport was due primarily todiffusion plus the mixing that occurs attime=0 measured onthe ground.\" (5, p.7) Ashort report detailed inReference (5) appears to couple results ofthis experiment with two others byTodd (see also Todd, Consort i, Capillary Flow (Chapter Consorti, surface-tension established intwo types oftransport experiments involving two fully-enclosed liquids with an interface between them. When the two liquids were immiscible aqueous solutions [Phase Rearrangement Experiment], noevidence ofcapillary flow or reorientation of the phases was obtained during the low gravity period. When the two liquids were miscible aqueous solu- tions (one with detergent [Capillary Flow Experiment] without [Turbulent Mixing Experiment]) there was also nocapil- lary flow. This last observation could not bemade definitely on the ground, where transport was dominated byconvection, owing to the similar densities ofthe two solutions.\" (5, p.7) Nofurther information discussing specific orresults KeyWords: Dif- Interface, Mixing, Turbulent Flow, Buoyancy-Driven Convection, Surface Ten- sion, Contamination Source, Liquid water; bottom wells: trypan (2) indicates that there was 4%dye inwater; Reference (6) indicates that there was 2% dye in water.)
