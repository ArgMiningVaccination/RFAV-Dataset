The Military Health System (MHS) provides care in government owned and operated medical treatment facilities focused on sustaining readiness of the medical force and the medical readiness of deployable forces. Additionally, the MHS purchases more than 65 percent of the total care provided for beneficiaries through tailored contracts, such as Managed Care Support Co ntracts responsible for the administration of the TRICARE benefit. The DoD Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) is an accrual fund to pay for DoD's share of applicable Direct Care and Private Sector Care operation and maintenance health care costs for Medicare-e ligible retirees, retiree family members and survivors. Directed in the National Defense Authorization Ac t (NDAA) for Fiscal Years 2017 and 2019, the MHS is undergoing its most significant transformation in decades. The reforms set forth in the NDAA change the structure of the health care benefit and the management of the MHS. Centralization for the management and administration of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) under the Defense Health Agency (DHA) transform the MHS into an integrated readiness and health system, eliminate redundancies, and create a common high quality experience for our beneficiaries. The FY 2021 Budget demonstrates continued efforts focused on aligning resources to the Department's readiness priorities and internal business process improvements and structural changes to find greater efficiencies, such as further integrating the military health system; continuing the deployment of MHS GENESIS - DoD's new electronic health record; implementing the health benefit reforms authorized by Congress; modernizing clinical and business processes; and, streamlining internal operations. The FY 2021 President's Budget reflects the Department's continued efforts to re-s cope the military medical end strength portfolio. The manner in which we ensure both a medically ready force and a ready medical force has evolved significantly over the past decade. As such, the Department is driving a corresponding reform effort to evolve its approach to how it allocates and Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-3clinically diversifies the medical military end strength. The FY 2020 Budget presented the Department's estimate of the military medical manpower required to the National Defense Strategy and the FY 2021 President's Budget request incorporates a phased conversion of military end-strength based on mitigations strategies and market analysis. In some cases, the care will remain in the MTFs and be provided by civilian or contract staff and, where feasible, some care will be transitioned to a local network provider. As efforts are ongoing, the Department will continue to evaluate the impacts of the force structure changes and adjust its plans accordingly throughout the transition period. This agile and phased approach helps the Department to ensure all beneficiaries continue to receive safe, high quality care and while it pursues a more orderly implementation of these transitions in the military medical force structure. In accordance with the FY 2021 Secretary of Defense Memo, Department of Defense Reform Focus in 2020, the Defense Health Program has transferred the Service Medical Readiness activities which occur outside of the Military Treatm ent Facility to the Military Departments. This transfer allows the medical force structure to meet the operational requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy and support the Congressionally- mandated reforms to the Military Health System. The transfer Medical Readiness programs have been identified as functions that would be more effectively and efficiently run by the Military Departments and support development of a Ready Medical Force and will not have an adverse impact to the delivery of healthcare in the Military Treatment Facilities. In early 2017, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) began preparing to assume responsibility for the administration and management of M ilitary Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and Dental Treatment Facilities (DTFs) worldwide. The assumption of these responsibilities commenced on October 1, 2018 with the transition of 31 facilities scattered throughout the south eastern portion of the United States. All other MTFs/DTFs in the United States transitioned in October 2019 to DHA oversight and management with support from the Military Departments as the DHA continues to build its management system's capacity. The Military Department support is scheduled to end in October 2020 and will be transitioned on a conditions- based approach to ensure that healthcare delivery and readiness is not impacted. The second phase, executing in FY 2021, will transition Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-4additional MTFs located overseas to the management control of the DHA with a target of DHA having full control of all MTFs and Dental treatment facilities by October 2022. Private Sector Care continues to be a vital part of the Military Health System in FY 2021 and represents roughly half of the Operations and Maintenance requirement. Over the period of FY 2012 to FY 2018, both private health insurance premiums and National Health Expenditures per capita rose 25% (or 3.7% annually). The Private Sector Care budget should have continued to rise but the Department, with concurrence from Congress, instituted a series of initiatives that bent the cost curve. A combination of benefit changes, payment savings initiatives, contract changes, and population reductions masked underlying increases in health care costs which would have been $3.5 billion higher than actual execution. The vast majority of the increase seen in FY 2019 was related to normal price inflation, an increase in beneficiaries, new benefits (e.g., urgent care with no referral), and a small increase in utilization of some services. These trends continue in FY 2020. As multiple reform efforts continue within the Military Health System, Private Sector Care will continue to represent an important part of the overall health system in FY 2021. The DoD and the Department of Veteran's Affairs continues to progress in the establishment of the unified Electronic Health Record. In FY 2021, DoD continues funding the clinical application, HealtheIntent, which provides a platform for population health and analytic tools, and offers a seamless longitudinal record between the DoD and VA that will grant providers and beneficiaries access to the detailed medical history. The FY 2021 budget continues the deployment of MHS GENESIS, the Department's Electronic Health Record. The FY 2021 expansion to Wave PENDLETON, Wave SAN DIEGO , Wave BLISS, Wave CARSON, and Wave TRIPLER is based on the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization Program (DHMSM) Program Executive Office's (PEO) updated deployment schedule and incorporates lessons learned from initial deployments in the Pacific Northwest and Wave TRAVIS. In addition the following waves will begin pre- deployment activities in FY 2021, Wave SAAMC, Wave LACKLAND, Wave WRIGHT- PATTERSON, and Wave DRUM. Additional enhancements to MHS GENESIS will provide expanded analytics and data modeling; decision- support, integrated patient level accounting and billing functionality, and advanced prognostic competencies. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-5The DHP appropriation funds the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) program developed in response to the needs of the National Defense Strategy and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS). The goal is to advance the state of medical science in those areas of most pressing need and relevance to today's battlefield experience and emerging threats. The objectives are to discover and explore innovative approaches to protect, support, and advance the health and welfare of military personnel and individuals eligible for care in the MHS; to accelerate the transition of medical technologies into deployed products; and to accelerate the translation of advances in knowledge into new standards of care for injury prevention, treatment of casualties, rehabilitation, and training systems that can be applied in theater or in military medical treatment facilities. The DHP appropriation Procurement program funds acquisition of capital equipment in MTFs and other selected health care activities which include equipment for initial outfitting of newly constructed, expanded, or modernized health care facilities; equ ipment for modernization and replacement of uneconomically reparable items; and MHS information technology (IT) requirements.

The creation of the new Software & Digital Technology appropriations allows software capability delivery to Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-12 be funded as a single budget line item, with no separation between RDT&E, production and sustainment. $2.0 million decrease for the Military Health System (MHS) Virtual Health Program (VHP) due to a one-time add in FY 2019 to support hardware for additional locations, expanded storage capacity, and potential cloud computing expansion for enhanced capacity in order to comply with NDAA 2017, Section 718 as well as combatant commanders' requirements President's Management Plan - Performance Metrics Requirements: The Military Health System (MHS) continues to refine existing performance measures and develop specific criteria to determine and measure outputs/outcomes as compared with initial goals. The Quadruple Aim provides a focused and balanced approach to overall performance. This approach includes not only production but outcome measures related to medical readiness, a healthy population, positive patient experiences and the responsible management of health care costs. Individual Medical Readiness - This measure provides operational commanders, Military Department leaders and primary care managers use this measure to monitor the medical readiness status of their personnel, ensuring a healthy and fit fighting force medically ready to deploy. This represents the best- available indicator of the medical readiness of the Total Force (Active Component and Reserve Component) prior to deployment. Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction is measured using a standard survey instrument comparable to those used by civilian plans. The goal is to improve MHS beneficiary overall satisfaction with TRICARE to a level at or above benchmark satisfaction with civilian plans utilizing the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey. Increasing satisfaction with the Health Plan indicates that actions being taken are improving the overall functioning of the health plan from the beneficiary perspective. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - This measure focuses on the annual overall cost growth for the Prime enrollees and includes all costs related to health care delivered to Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-13enrollees. The objective is to keep the rate of cost growth for the TRICARE Prime enrollees to a level at or below the increases for the Civilian health care plans at the national level. Currently the measure provides insight to issues regarding unit cost, utilization management, and Purchased care management. The metric has been enhanced to properly account for differences in population demographics and health care requirements of the enrolled population. Since enrollment demographics can vary significantly by Service, and across time, it is important to adjust the measure. For example, as increasing numbers of older individuals enroll, the overall average medical expense per enrollee would likely increase. Conversely, as younger, healthy active duty enroll, the overall average would likely decrease. Through the use of adjustment factors, a comparison across Services and across time is made more meaningful. Output relat ed measures that influence Medical Cost Per Member Per Year: Inpatient Production Target (Medicare Severity Adjusted Relative Weighted Products, referred to as MS -RWPs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plan for allocation of pe rsonnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of inpatient workload. Outpatient Production Target (Relative Value Units, referred to as RVUs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plans for allocation of personnel andresources are used appropriately in the production of outpatient workload. Below is reporting for FY 2019 performance measures related to the Quadruple Aim, and two output measures related to production plan targets. The overall success of each measured is discussed below: Individual Medical Readiness - The Military Health System achieved the goal for the Total Force Medical Readiness as of FY 2019 4th quarter reporting with a score of 86.7 percent compared to the goal of 85 percent. This represents t he fifth year in a row that the MHS has surpassed the performance goal for the measure. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-14 Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction with Health Care Plan performance for FY 2019 was 62%, which exceeded the goal of 57 percent based on CAHPS for the fiscal year. Satisfaction levels met or exceeded the goal for all beneficiary categories and enrollment status. This has been a continuous process to maintain and improve performance to levels comparable with the civilian sector, and performance must be maintained. Major performance drivers for this measure are related to claims processing timeliness, interaction during health care encounter, and access to health care. NOTE: Due to the deployment of MHS GENESIS, sites in the Puget Sound Enhanced Multi- Service Market Area are excluded from the following three measures and the goals have been adjusted accordingly for the two production measures related to Inpatient and Outpatient Care. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - Annual Cost Growth - The Year to Date performance estimate for FY 2019 is 2.2 percent vs goal of 4.5 percent. While final claims data is still completing, the system currently is achieving the goal during the fiscal year. Overall the growth rate is well below historical levels, and may increase as medical claims data are finalized. Inpatient Production Target (MS- RWPs) - Based on workload reported through the 4th fiscal quarter of FY 2019, the MHS produced 167 thousand MS- RWPs, slightly below the annual adjusted target of 172 thousand MS- RWPs. These numbers are based on the records reported to date, and should increase slightly as all records are completed. Outpatient Production Target (RVUs) - Based on workload reported through the 4th fiscal quarter of FY 2019, the MHS produced 73.4 million relative value units which is below the annual adjusted goal of 75.2 million.

Modernization includes alteration of facilities solely to implement new or higher standards (including regulatory changes), to accommodate new functions, or to replace building components that typically last more than 30 years (such as foundations and framework). Recapitalization of facilities, which extends the service life of a facility, is accomplished by either restoration, modernization or replacement of the facility keeping infrastructure inventory relevant to delivery of healthcare advances and enhance operational or business effectiveness within a revitalized structure. The Operations & Maintenance portion of recapitalization is restoration or modernization activities. Facility Sustainment - Resources required for maintenance and repair activities necessary to keep facilities in good working order. It includes regularly scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventive maintenance tasks, emergency response and service calls for minor repairs. Sustainment also includes major repairs or replacement of facility components (usually accomplished by contract) that are expected to occur periodically throughout the life cycle of facilities.

BA Subactivities FY 2019 Actuals Budget Request Amount Percent Appropriated Resources programmed for Facilities Restoration or Modernization (RM) activities is planned for failing systems or infrastructure repairs due to lack of sustainment, excessive age, and emergency repairs. It also funds modernization efforts that propel the MHS toward compliance with new and current medical advancements for function within the medical facilities to include changing regulatory standards. The RM funding is an easy area for re- purposing funding toward emergent year of execution unplanned thus unfunded costs to accomplish the MHS medical mission. Persistent re- purposing of RM funding in year of execution encroaches on the ability of the DHP to mitigate failing facility systems and infrastructure repairs that only maintains the current function at status quo. Decreases to these funds also prevents planned modernization efforts that have allowed the MHS medical facilities to obtain status of a world class healthcare system servicing the Military Service Members and their families. (a) FY 2019 Actuals reflects reprogramming of $249,371K from the Restoration/Modernization of Facilities program to mitigate increasing healthcare costs in Private Sector Care and MHS IM/IT costs associated with Desktop to Data Center and Med- COI high priority system requirements (b) FY 2020 reflects $10,000K funding for Fisher House as provided in Section 8068 of Appropriation Law.

Preparation of the Defense-Wide budget excluding revolving funds, cost the Department of Defense a total of approximately $1,220,000 in FY 2020(This page intentionally left blank)Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance Summary of Operations Exhibit O-1 - DHP OCO, Summary of Operations DHP-1 (This page intentionally left blank)Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-3Budget Activity 1, Operation and Maintenance I. Description of Operations Supported: Provides resources needed to fund the incremental (above baseline) costs to support Operation FREEDOM'S SENTINEL (OFS) in Afghanistan, Operation INHERENT RESOLVE (OIR) in Iraq and the Levant, increasing efforts to support European allies and deter aggression (European Reassurance Initiative), and supporting a partnership-focused approach to counterterrorism. The resource amounts provided are consistent with the Department's force level budgetary assumptions. These incremental funds provide medical and dental services to active forces, mobilized Reserve Components (RC), and their family members in support of these operations. TheDefense Health Program (DHP) baseline budget request does not fund the medical and dental support requirements within the Area of Responsibility (AOR). Other DHP operational requirements in support of these operations include: Pre/Post deployment processing for personnel, aeromedical transportationof casualties from Germany to the U.S., and contracted civilian medical personnel to backfilldeployed permanent Military Treatment Facility (MTF) staff.The Defense Health Program's FY 2021 Overseas Contingency Operations funding supports the following category: OCO for Direct War Costs ($365,098K): Direct War costs are those combat or direct combat supportcosts that will not continue to be expended once combat operations end at major contingencylocations. In House Care: -Incremental costs for casualties above the baseline budget -Backfill of deployed permanent medical personnel Private Sector Care -Incremental costs to provide medical/dental care for mobilized RC and their family members Consolidated Health Support -Incremental costs for aeromedical transportation of wounded warriors from outside the theater ofoperations to the United States -Backfill of medical staff in the Public Health and Bioenvironmental Engineering duty sections tocontinue MTF and base support functions.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-4II. Financial Summary: ($ in 365,098 Subactivity - In-House Estimate Enacted Request 69,929 57,459 65,072 Narrative Justification : Funding in this budget activity group directly supports pre/post deployment activities such as medical records reviews, hearing and vision exams, medical evaluations, immunizations and behavioral health screening for all deploying and returning soldiers. Funding also supports backfill of deployed personnel with medical staff to sustain the delivery of patient care in Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Increase from FY 2020 to FY 2021 is based on increase in forecasted deployments. Impact if not funded: The Military Treatment Facilities' (MTFs') primary mission is to provide healthcare to uniformed service personnel. Funding is required to provide medical and dental care Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-5for the mobilized forces not funded in the baseline budget. Without this funding, MTFs would have to reduce access to care for non-active duty beneficiaries (retirees and family members) resulting in disengagement of these beneficiaries to the private sector for healthcare services. If funding is not provided to backfill the healthcare positions vacated in the MTFs by deployed medical personnel, components will have to redirect funding from other direct care system requirements to sustain the continuity of healthcare to patients. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-6 A. Subactivity Group - Private Sector Care: 296,828 Narrative Justification: Funding provides Reserve Component (RC) personnel and their family members with healthcare, pharmacy and dental benefits. Mobilized RC personnel and their family members are eligible for medical and dental similar to active duty personnel, including access to private sector care providers through the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract (MCSC) provider networks. This access to MCSC provider networks also supports those beneficiaries living in remote locations outside the established network areas. TRICARE Reserve Select program, offered to RC members who enroll and share premiums with the government, is not included in this requirement. Impact if not funded: Providing healthcare to mobilized Reserve Component personnel and their families is congressionally mandated. This is a must-pay bill and the cost will be incurred regardless of the availability of funding. If funding is not provided, lower priority healthcare requirements will be delayed so that funding can be shifted to pay for the healthcare services. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 President's Budget Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-7A. Subactivity Group - Consolidated Health Support: 2021 Estimate Enacted Request 2,426 2,800 3,198 Narrative Justification: Requirements in this budget activity group directly support the transportation of wounded warriors by aircraft from outside the theater of operations to the United States, the resupply of medical evacuation equipment, and ground transportation for patients outside of the theater. Projections for deployed active and reserve component forces in FY 2021 contribute to an increase in the overall requirement. Impact if not funded: Aeromedical transport missions would require additional internal funding offsets such as delays in infrastructure improvements and equipment or supply procurement.
