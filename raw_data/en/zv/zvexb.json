This famous phrase, is attributed to Hippocrates, the father of medicine. Hippocrates more than 2000 years ago, understood that the micro and macro- nutrients in food, that is vitamins, trace elements and enzymes, have a powerful role to play in maintaining the body's health. Restoring imbalances is a vitally important approach in natural healing. Naturopathic guidance therefore focuses on nutrition as the central pivot around which good health is based. Also essential, is having a healthy weight. Naturopathic guidance may also help with this issue. Detoxification Methods In the last hundred years or so, the toxicity on the planet is almost one hundred times greater than in the past. Chemicals from the environment are the most dangerous substances that can enter the body overwhelming the body's cells and leading to disease. These chemicals may come from our foods, from pesticides, fertilizers, animal hormones, preservatives and additives. Toxins may also cause accumulation of water, increase in weight-gain, fatigue, and loss of energy. Chemicals may also enter the body from skin products, such as soaps and shampoos, or household substances or when we breathe them in. Body deterioration begins at a cellular level and toxic build-up leading to cell death may result in an increased risk of degenerative and autoimmune diseases. Detoxification is therefore of paramount importance if the body is to be healthy. Naturopathy uses different methods for clearing the body of toxic substances, thus promoting restoration and healing. Phytotherapy and Medicinal Herbalism Phytotherapy is one of the oldest medicines in the world. For over 6000 years, humans have effectively used plants to cure their illnesses. Chemical drugs have only been used for the last 100 years or so and whilst effective, can also sometimes, come with dangerous and long lasting side effects. Plants and herbs work by supporting and stimulating the body's own capacity for healing. For example, it is well known, that garlic, onions, pine offer active natural antibiotic properties. Turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory, especially for joints, as well as a natural blood thinner. The seeds from sunflowers contain a good amount of vitamin E, known to boost fertility and helps to counteract the aging process. Thyme is a powerful lung cleanser, ginger tea naturally fights nausea and helps with stomach problems. Dandelion root and leaves are natural diuretics, whilst artichoke is a powerful liver cleanser. Bach's flower remedies are another complementary treatment that may be used chiefly for emotional balance. The list is probably endless. Thus, naturopathy uses plants to support the body's natural healing abilities. Orthomolecular Approaches The term orthomolecular was first used by Linus Pauling, a Nobel prize-winner and means \"the correct molecule\". Orthomolecular aims at healing by an optimal intake of natural substances recognised by the body. This is contrary to conventional medicine, which creates substances non-recognized by the human body. The first aim of a naturopath is to rebalance food intake and vitamins chiefly from pure food. Sometimes supplements may be necessary to correct a lack of vitamins and other nutrients. A naturopath will advise which of these are in their most natural and bioavailable form rather than synthetic. Natural forms are considered superior in terms of their effectiveness for helping to detoxify and heal the body. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is using the essences of plants. These aromatic extracts are in the form of essential oils obtained from steam distillation. Concentrated essential oils can have powerful healing qualities. For many centuries, essential oils have been known to possess antiseptic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. For example, even earlier than 5000 BC, the aborigines used the smoke of eucalyptus leaves for chest infections. In ancient Greece, lavender and rosemary were among the plants used to fight the black plague. China, Egypt and India also have a long history using essential oils. Biochemistry has recently confirmed the important healing properties of essential oils for both massages and for inhaling. Aromatherapy is also particularly important in addressing conditions common in today's stressful living, such as anxiety, worry and insomnia as well as other illnesses. Aromatherapy, as part of a holistic approach, helps to harmonise, heal and revitalize both the mind and body. Gemmotherapy Gemmotherapy falls under the umbrella of homeopathy and is an extraordinary plant therapy which has the potential for cleansing the body at the cellular level to clear toxic material that prevents the cells from being able to function as intended. Gemmotherapies, are obtained from germinating plant embryonic buds which contain all the growth material for the future plant to develop. These contain gibberellin and growth factors which have the power to cleanse the cells by draining toxins. Each different plant Gemmotherapy acts on a particular body organ or organs. Gemmotherapy is also known as a regenerative cure. Gemmotherapy is typically used at the beginning of natural healing for detoxification, prior to other approaches. Homeopathy Although the basis of homeopathy goes back to the father of medicine, Hippocrates, Dr. Hahnemann, a German doctor and pharmacist in the 18th century, is considered to be the founder father of homeopathy. The term Homeopathy has its roots from 'Homeo' meaning similar and 'Pathos' meaning suffering. Thus, homeopathy is a treatment approach, which is based on 'like cures like' Hahnemann observed that certain substances which can produce illness in healthy individuals, can also be used to cure people who show those same symptoms. For example, poison ivy can cause small blisters, inflammation, itching and also stiff muscles. Thus, a homeopathic preparation based on poison ivy can be used to cure herpes or eczema and even specific kinds of arthritis. The second principle of homeopathy is based on the minimum dose i.e. the specific substance used is diluted many times and paradoxically the more dilute it is, the stronger it is able to trigger the body's own healing process, and vital force. Homeopathic remedies are prescribed based on the symptoms, not on a diagnosis and are extremely safe, free of chemical side effects. People who are allergic to certain drugs can safely take homeopathy and it may be used alongside conventional medicines. The correct homeopathic remedy is not only based on specific symptoms but also the person's specific constitution and characteristics, which are taken into account to maximise the healing outcome. Tissue salts, of which there are only twelve types, are also considered homeopathy and can be used over a longer period of time to help stimulate the body's healing process and balance it. Homeopathy may take up to several weeks before an improvement is noticed for chronic problems. However, for acute problems, homeopathy can be effective very quickly. Over the last 50 years or so, many trials have been conducted showing the effectiveness of homeopathic medicine and there is a growing worldwide interest. "}
