The authors apply the sociotechnical view of technology and the ramifications this view has on successful use of technology in design and construction. Design/methodology/approach: This is a discussion paper reviewing over a decade of research that connects three streams of research on architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) teams as these teams grappled with adapting work practices to new technologies and the opportunities these technologies promised. Findings: From studies of design and construction practices with building information modeling and energy modeling, the authors show that given the constructed nature of models and the loose coupling of project teams, these team organizational practices need to mirror the modeling requirements. Second, looking at distributed teams, whose interaction is mediated by technology, the authors argue that virtual world visualizations enhance discovery, while distributed AEC teams also need more traditional forms of 2D abstraction, sketching and gestures to support integrated design dialogue. Finally, in information exchange research, the authors found that models and data have their own logic and structure and, as such, require creativity and ingenuity to exchange data across systems. Taken together, these streams of research suggest that process innovation is brought about by people developing new practices. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors argue that technology alone does not change practice. People who modify practices with and through technology create process innovation. \u00a9 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.||Architectural design - Engineering research - Information dissemination - Information systems - Information theory - Societies and institutions - Virtual reality - Visualization||Architecture , engineering and constructions - Building Information Model - BIM - Building Information Modelling - Design and construction - Design and construction practice - Design/methodology/approach - Information exchanges - Organizational practices| |Protecting neighbourhood character while allowing growth? Pike/Pine Washington||Kuriyama, Naoko; Ochsner, Jeffrey PERSPECTIVES||Article; Early Access||The City of Seattle created the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District in 2009 to preserve the character of the Pike/Pine Corridor (neighbourhood) while simultaneously accommodating substantial growth in the number of residents and the size of buildings. Pike/Pine is known for its adaptively reused collection of early twentieth century 'Auto Row' buildings and for the diversity of its population. Since the year 2000, proximity to downtown has made this area attractive for development, and the city has designated Pike/Pine as a growth centre in its comprehensive plan. The city's implementation of the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District (one of the first uses of a conservation district in a commercial/mixed-use neighbourhood in the United States) seeks to address the conflict inherent in accommodating growth while simultaneously trying to protect older architecture, small-scale local businesses, and a diverse mix of housing. This article analyses the elements and impacts of this unusual district, considering its application of facade retention for townscape conservation as well as analysing its broad approach within the framework of integrated conservation. This article argues that the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District offers a useful case study for other cities looking to support growth while also retaining elements of the past.||PRESERVATION||Historic preservation; conservation |Racial disparity in exposure to housing Panel Study of Income Dynamics to analyse Black-White differences in housing cost burden exposure among renter households in the USA from 1980 to 2017, expanding understanding of this phenomenon in two respects. Specifically, we document how much this racial disparity changed among renters over almost four decades and identify how much factors associated with income or housing costs explain Black-White inequality in exposure to housing cost burden. For White households, the net contribution of household, neighbourhood and metropolitan covariates accounts for much of the change in the probability of housing cost burden over time. For Black households, however, the probability of experiencing housing cost burden continued to rise throughout the period of this study, even after controlling for household, neighbourhood and metropolitan covariates. This suggests that unobserved variables like racial discrimination, social networks or employment quality might explain the increasing disparity in cost burden among for Black and White households in the USA.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=145585289&site=ehost-live| |Owning vs. Renting: the benefits of residential stability?||Acolin, Arthur||Housing Studies||2020||Journal Article||In housing research, owning, as compared to renting, is generally depicted as more desirable and associated with better outcomes. This paper explores differences in outcomes between owners and renters in 25 European countries and whether these differences are systematically smaller in countries in which owners and renters have more similar levels of residential stability (smaller tenure length gap). The results indicate that the direction of the relationship between tenure type and the selected outcomes is largely similar across countries. Owners generally exhibit more desirable outcomes (including life satisfaction, civic participation, educational outcomes for children, and physical and mental health). However, when looking at the relationship between outcomes and country level differences in tenure length gap, findings suggest that renters have outcomes that are more similar to owners in countries in which tenure length gaps are smaller. These results point to the potential benefits of policies that would increase residential stability, particularly for renters.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=146024925&site=ehost-live| |Safety climate and productivity improvement of construction workplaces through the 6S system: mixed-method analysis of 5S Mohammad Sadra; Kim, Yong Woo||International Journal of Occupational Safety & Ergonomics||2021||Journal Article||The purpose of this study is to develop a framework for integrating essential safety practices (visualization, job safety analysis and plan-do-check-act) into 5S steps and validate it. First, 18 interviews with a snowball sample of construction workers, safety representatives, supervisors and site and project managers were conducted. A grounded theory method was utilized to code the interview data. The results revealed that the studied construction companies implement a systematic safety-based methodology to minimize construction work injuries. Second, to validate the proposed framework, a pre-test and post-test study was applied. The case and control groups (26 participants) answered a 6S questionnaire before the 6S system and 1 month after implementation. The results revealed that safety climate and productivity significantly increased for the case group but reduced for the control group during time.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=150535606&site=ehost-live| |Selection of wearable sensor measurements for monitoring and managing entry-level construction worker fatigue: a logistic regression approach||Lee, Wonil; Lin, Ken-Yu; Johnson, Peter W.; Seto, Edmund Y. W.||ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT||Article; Early Access||Purpose The identification of fatigue status and early intervention to mitigate fatigue can reduce the risk of workplace injuries. Off-the-shelf wearable sensors capable of assessing multiple parameters are available. However, using numerous variables in the fatigue prediction model can elicit data issues. This study aimed at identifying the most relevant variables for measuring occupational fatigue among entry-level construction workers by using common wearable sensor technologies, such as electrocardiogram and actigraphy sensors. Design/methodology/approach Twenty-two individuals were assigned different task workloads in repeated sessions. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the most parsimonious fatigue prediction model. Heart rate variability measurements, standard deviation of NN intervals and power in the low-frequency range (LF) were considered for fatigue prediction. Fast Fourier transform and autoregressive (AR) analysis were employed as frequency domain analysis methods. Findings The log-transformed LF obtained using AR analysis is preferred for daily fatigue management, whereas the standard deviation of normal-to-normal NN is useful in weekly fatigue management. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted with entry-level construction workers who are involved in manual material handling activities. The findings of this study are applicable to this group. Originality/value This is the first study to investigate all major measures obtainable through electrocardiogram and actigraphy among current mainstream wearables for monitoring occupational fatigue in the construction industry. It contributes knowledge on the use of wearable technology for managing occupational fatigue among entry-level construction workers engaged in material technology (ICT) applications| |Modelling housing market fundamentals and the response to economic and political events: empirical evidence from Kuwait||Alfalah, Abdullah; D'Arcy, Eamonn; Heinig, Steffen; Simon||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS||Article; Early Access||Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the sensitivity of the Kuwait housing market to major local and regional geo-political and economic events. Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines the market dynamics of the housing market in Kuwait. Kuwait provides an interesting market to consider owing to its position as a major oil producer, its sensitivity to geo-political events and its unusual demographic characteristics. Findings - The error-correction model highlights that market is relatively volatile, with evidence of meanreverting behaviour. Only when the data is smoothed are their more consistent findings with respect to underlying fundamentals. This paper also examines the response of the market to seven regional and local events. Of particular interest is that the one event that results in a consistent significant response is domestic legislation directly concerned with housing. This has a far greater impact than local or regional geo-political events. Originality/value - Very few papers have considered how economic and political shocks directly impact housing markets using an event study approach. Given its geographic location and also its economic dependence on oil, Kuwait is an interesting market to consider.||ERROR-CORRECTION MODEL; Geo-political risk| |The Economic of Alerts-A Case High-Threat US Volcanoes||Peers, Article||A common concern about volcanic unrest is that the communication of information about increasing volcanic alert levels (VALs) to the public could cause serious social and economic impacts even if an eruption does not occur. To test this statement, this study examined housing prices and business patterns from 1974-2016 in volcanic regions with very-high threat designations from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)-Long Valley Caldera (LVC), CA Kilauea, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai (shield volcano). To compare economic trends in nonvolcanic regions that are economically dependent on tourism, Steamboat Springs, CO, served as a control as it is a ski-tourism community much like Mammoth Lakes in LVC. Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models predicted that housing prices were negatively affected by VALs at LVC from 1982-1983 and 1991-1997. While VALs associated with unrest and eruptions included in this study both had short-term indirect effects on housing prices and business indicators (e.g., number of establishments, employment, and salary), these notifications were not strong predictors of long-term economic trends. Our findings suggest that these indirect effects result from both eruptions with higher level VALs and from unrest involving lower-level VAL notifications that communicate a change in volcanic activity but do not indicate that an eruption is imminent or underway. This provides evidence concerning a systemic issue in disaster resilience. While disaster relief is provided by the U.S. federal government for direct impacts associated with disaster events that result in presidential major disaster declarations, there is limited or no assistance for indirect effects to businesses and homeowners that may follow volcanic unrest with no resulting direct physical losses. The fact that periods of volcanic unrest preceding eruption are often protracted in comparison to precursory periods for other hazardous events (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding) makes the issue of indirect effects particularly important in regions susceptible to volcanic activity.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/economic-effects-volcanic-alerts-case-study-high/docview/2606832031/se-2?accountid=14784| |Spatial spillover effects of crime on private investment at Arthur; activity may influence the decisions of existing property owners or prospective investors to invest in a property, given the potential elevated expenses and increased uncertainty that often accompany crime. This study investigates the relationship between crime and private investment at nearby micro-places using location-specific crime incident and building permit data from 2008 to 2018 in the cities of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Antonio and Seattle. Data were aggregated to the blockface-level to examine how changes in investment on a blockface are influenced by changes in crime on that blockface and adjacent blockfaces in the subsequent year. Results indicate that an increase in total crime on a blockface was associated with a significant decrease in building permit activity the following year in all six cities, but the relationship is less strong when aggregating crime from adjacent blockfaces. When looking at spillover effects, higher crime on adjacent blockfaces was significantly associated with lower levels of investment beyond the effect of the crime trend on that blockface in Los Angeles and San Antonio. Though the relationship between adjacent blockface crime and investment was negative across the other four cities, it was not statistically significant. Taken together, these findings suggest that effective targeted crime prevention policies may have the added benefit of spurring local economic investment and that the impact of crime is RESEARCH RECORD||Article; Early Access||A central theme of U.S. transportation planning policies is to reduce single-occupancy vehicle (SOV) trips and promote transit and non-motorized transportation by coordinating land-use planning and transportation demand management (TDM) programs. Cities often implement TDM programs by intervening with new development during the municipal permit review process. Seattle's Transportation Management Program (TMP) under a joint Director's Rule (DR) requires a commitment from developers to adopt select strategies from six TDM element categories: program management, physical improvements, bicycle/walking programs, employer-based incentives, transit and car/vanpooling, and parking management. TMP targets new developments and requires some TDM elements, recommends others, and leaves the rest to negotiation. The result is an individualized TMP agreement that is site-specific, reflecting both city policy and developer needs. This case study presents a qualitative analysis of the guiding eight DRs and 41 site-specific TMP agreements in Seattle's Downtown and South Lake Union (SLU) area since 1988. Overall, a content analysis of TMP documents reveals that the average number of elements adopted in an agreement falls short of requirements set by DRs (34%-61%). Major findings include developer preference toward non-traditional TDM measures such as physical improvement of frontage and urban design features, as well as parking management. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) elements showed higher adoption rates (59%-63%) over biking/walking programs (< 1%). It is concluded that future TDM policies could benefit if future research includes examining the effectiveness of the range of management options stemming from the real estate trends toward green buildings, tenants' values in sustainability, and city policy to reduce automobile trips.||TRAVEL||Planning and analysis; Transportation demand management; Transportation planning policy and processes| |How Does Ride-Hailing Influence Individual Mode Choice? An Examination Using Longitudinal Trip Data from the Seattle Region||Wang, Yiyuan; Moudon, Anne Vernez; Shen, Qing||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||Article; Early Access||This study investigates the impacts of ride-hailing, which we define as mobility services consisting of both conventional taxis and app-based services offered by transportation network companies, on individual mode choice. We examine whether ride-hailing substitutes for or complements travel by driving, public transit, or walking and biking. The study overcomes some of the limitations of convenience samples or cross-sectional surveys used in past research by employing a longitudinal dataset of individual travel behavior and socio-demographic information. The data include three waves of travel log data collected between 2012 and 2018 in transit-rich areas of the Seattle region. We conducted individual-level panel data modeling, estimating independently pooled models and fixed-effect models of average daily trip count and duration for each mode, while controlling for various factors that affect travel behavior. The results provide evidence of substitution effects of ride-hailing on driving. We found that cross-sectionally, participants who used more ride-hailing tended to drive less, and that longitudinally, an increase in ride-hailing usage was associated with fewer driving trips. No significant associations were found between ride-hailing and public transit usage or walking and biking. Based on detailed travel data of a large population in a major U.S. metropolitan area, the study highlights the value of collecting and analyzing longitudinal data to understand the impacts of new mobility services.||SERVICES; UBER||Shared mobility; ride-hailing; longitudinal between travel modes| |The Role of Smart Growth in Residential Location Choice: Heterogeneity of Location Preferences in the Chicago Region||Wang, Yiyuan; Lee, Bumsoo; Greenlee, Andrew||JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH||Article; Early Access||We investigate the role of smart growth in household location choice in the Chicago region, using a discrete choice analysis. In the midst of continued region-wide suburbanization, households tend to move to neighborhoods with rich consumption amenities and high transit access. However, this study does not find evidence that the neighborhood's physical compactness is a significant location factor. Location preference for compact, mixed-use, and transit-oriented neighborhoods is significantly affected by the life cycle stage and income level, but less influenced by generation and age. Millennial households show strong preference for amenities and transit access only before they marry and have and groundtruthing the remote mapping of informal settlements: The example of Ho Chi Minh City's periphery||Acolin, Arthur; Kim, Annette M.||ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE||Article; Early Access||The significant advances made in interpreting satellite imagery to monitor urban expansion and informal settlements has made important contributions to urban studies and planning. This paper focuses on the under-examined dimensions of how improvements to classifications of urban areas are not only a technical challenge but lie at the society/technology nexus. We examine why three different research groups produced different urban land use classifications of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from remote sensing images. We trace how a confluence of factors including how the technology intersects with field conditions, researcher assumptions and discretionary choices, and institutional norms and agendas shaped the differences in their results. The different spatial facts they produced raises the issue of adapting algorithms for not only technical accuracy but appropriate social use. In the case of detecting informal settlements, our study finds that groundtruthing through fieldwork or collaborative partnerships is needed to not systematically overlook vulnerable populations and misinform urban planning decisions.||Urban neighborhood-scale urban form and travel behavior||Krizek, KJ||TRANSPORTATION LAND USE AND SMART GROWTH: PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATION||2000||Article; Proceedings Paper||Communities are increasingly looking to land use planning strategies based on a less auto-dependent urban form to reduce the need for travel, especially drive-alone travel. In recent years, several studies have attempted to test the impact urban form has on travel behavior to determine if such designs are warranted. The results of these studies are mixed because of several shortcomings. Some shortcomings can be attributed to data availability; others are a product of the techniques used to characterize urban form or travel. Still other shortcomings are embedded in the strategies employed, using cross-sectional travel data and correlating travel outcomes with urban form. The line of research is being extended, aimed at isolating the influence of urban form on travel behavior; a new research strategy is presented using longitudinal travel data in concert with detailed measures of travel behavior and urban form. Data sources from the Puget Sound are described and a research strategy is presented that permits a pretest-posttest analysis of households' travel behavior before and after they changed residential location. Early results show few changes in household travel behavior after a move, suggesting that attitudes toward travel are firmly entrenched and postmove travel provides little insight into how changes in urban form affect travel. Although a pretest-posttest makes valiant strides in shedding new light on the matter, the complex phenomenon being addressed requires myriad approaches. More comprehensive research techniques and even research approaches based on different different traditions are much needed to better understand how urban form and travel interact.||LAND-USE; LINK| |Measuring land Logsdon, MG||LAND DEVELOPMENT TRANSPORTATION: PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATION||2001||Article; Proceedings Paper||Density and land use mix are focused on as the two primary variables for characterization of land use in transportation research. As commonly constructed, these variables do not capture well actual development patterns on the ground, thus obscuring a potentially strong relationship between land use and transportation behavior. To overcome these limitations, parcel-level data and geographic information system software were used to identify and measure attributes of land use. These data are at a level of resolution that closely corresponds to the spatial distribution of development patterns. A method for location of concentrations of medium- to high-density housing and commercial development in suburban areas identified in previous research is described. The method includes the use of metrics derived from landscape ecology to model these development patterns and, specifically, their shapes and their functional and spatial mixes.| |Pedestrian location identification tools - Identifying suburban areas with potentially high latent demand for pedestrian travel||Moudon, AV; Hess, PM; Matlick, JM; Pergakes, N||HIGHWAY SAFETY: LAW ENFORCEMENT, MOTORCYCLES, TRUCKS, OLDER DRIVERS, AND PEDESTRIANS: SAFETY AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE||2002||Article; Proceedings Paper||Planning tools were developed for local and state agencies to identify locations with latent demand for pedestrian travel that are currently underserved with pedestrian infrastructure. Prior research in the Puget Sound showed that approximately 20% of the suburban population lives in dense, compact areas with latent demand for pedestrian travel. The tools are designed to enable agencies,to target capital investments in nonmotorized infrastructure to areas with the highest potential for pedestrian trips. They are a first step toward delineating suburban pedestrian zones. After a review of existing methodologies to identify areas with pedestrian travel demand, two tools were developed that use geographic information system software. One tool benefits from high-resolution parcel-level data with specified land use attributes. The other tool, however, relies on commonly available census block data and aerial photography. It is more labor intensive than the first tool and requires familiarity with reading urban form and development patterns. The tools identify locations with potential for pedestrian travel based on two attributes. First, the locations contain land uses that are functionally complementary, that is, commonly linked by travel. The land uses are dense residential development (travel generators) and retail areas and schools (travel attractors). Second, these land uses are also spatially complementary, that is, sufficiently close to each other to be linked by walking.| |A 2005||2005||Article; Proceedings Paper||Land use and transportation are linked by complex, yet identifiable, relationships. Tools are needed to formalize this relationship and to take it into account when decisions are made about urban and suburban transportation systems. This paper reviews foundational concepts of performance measures of metropolitan transportation systems. It offers a rationale for the types of tools needed to measure and assess land use and transportation system efficiency. One tool being developed by the Washington State Department of Transportation-the Transportation-Efficient Land Use Mapping Index (TELUMI)-illustrates how research findings can be applied in metropolitan transportation planning. TELUMI uses cartographic modeling (CM) techniques and parcel-level geographic information system data. The fine resolution of the data measures microscaled land use conditions associated with travel patterns in built-up areas. CM generates maps of zones in a region that match land use conditions with travel behaviors. Zones are defined by land use variables, such as density of activities, presence and agglomeration of destinations, block size, and transportation infrastructure attributes. CM also performs advanced quantitative analyses of map attributes, and it is effective with lay and professional audiences. TELUMI's use of individual land use variables makes it possible to target intervention strategies, such as augmenting density or building sidewalks, and to evaluate their effectiveness in improving transportation efficiency. TELUMI assists transportation and local planning authorities in allocating transportation investments appropriate to multimodal travel.||THRESHOLD MODELS| |Transportation-efficient land use regulations and their Proceedings Paper||This work evaluates how local land use regulations and development patterns support transportation efficiency in urban and suburban areas. An efficient transportation system includes multiple transportation modes and reduces the need to drive alone. The research sheds light on how long-term efforts to devise transportation-efficient land development regulations have shaped new development. Data include surveys of zoning and development regulations in 19 study areas of Puget Sound, Washington, and reviews of 163 projects with a building permit. Analyses focus on the frequency of use of transportation-efficient elements in land use regulations, the frequency of adherence to these elements in projects, and the connections between area regulations and development. Fifty elements classified into six categories of transportation-efficient land use serve to evaluate the characteristics of regulations and permitted projects in each study area. The research shows that local jurisdictions have adopted many transportation-efficient regulations, and many of the projects reviewed follow these regulations. Compact development stands out as a major strategy used successfully in area regulations and permitted projects. Pedestrian-oriented environment and street-sidewalk connectivity are used at the project level but less so in regulations. Parking elements are weakest at the regulatory and project levels. Washington State growth management approaches to land use appear to become integrated into local regulatory frameworks and to be followed through in the implementation and development process. Work is needed regionally to increase the use of transportation-efficient land use strategies, with particular attention to parking regulations.| |Tijuana-San Diego: Globalization and the transborder metropolis||Bae, CHC||ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE||2003||Article; Proceedings Paper||This paper explores the degree to which the Tijuana-San Diego metropolitan region functions as a transborder metropolis. It is shown that the border is quite porous, especially for work and shopping. In addition, the two metropolitan economies are much more complementary than competitive, with San Diego specializing in high-order services and the new economy while Tijuana primarily functions as a manufacturing center, based on maquiladora. However, much more cooperation and collaboration are needed in several areas: improving trade infrastructure; addressing the deficits in social infrastructure (especially in Tijuana); making the border crossings more user-friendly; expanding educational opportunities for Latinos in both areas; more priority to environmental problems, especially air quality and sewerage; attempting to reduce the public sector fiscal differentials between the two areas; and more attention to income distribution issues.| |There's nothing inherent about scale: political ecology, the local trap, and the politics of development in the Brazilian Amazon||Brown, JC; Purcell, M||GEOFORUM||2005||Article; Proceedings Paper||This paper argues that research in political ecology would benefit from more explicit and careful attention to the question of scale and scalar politics. Although political ecologists have extensively considered scale as a methodological question, they have yet to develop an explicit theoretical approach to scale as an object of inquiry. We highlight one principal drawback to this underdeveloped approach to scale: what we call the local trap in which political ecologists assume that organization, policies, and action at the local scale are inherently more likely to have desired social and ecological effects than activities organized at other scales. Over the past 10 years or so, an increasingly sophisticated literature on scale has been developinvvvg among scholars in geography working in the political economy tradition. This literature has argued that scale is socially produced rather than ontologically given. Therefore, there is nothing inherent about any scale, and so the local scale cannot be intrinsically more desirable than other scales. We suggest that a greater engagement with this scale literature offers political ecology a theoretical way out of the local trap. As a first approximation of the kind of scalar analysis we advocate, we present a case study that examines the scalar politics that have shaped environmental change in the Brazilian Amazon.

Improvements in information and productivity may lead to important long-run changes in business processes and industry structure tending to favour larger firms and promoting specialization of functions. Changing the information structure of real estate decision systems could change system dynamics and improve allocative efficiency. On the other hand, under different institutional arrangements, better information could increase the amplitude of real estate cycles and destabilize economies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

T.; Hsieh, S. H.; Tserng, H. P.||Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering||2009||Journal Article||Machine translation is able to support cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) applications given the availability of high-quality translation resources. This study explores the effectiveness of machine translation for the domain of earthquake engineering within the bounds of Chinese-to-English CLIR applications. The writers first defined and then applied a set of procedures to generate Chinese-to-English translation resources for the selected domain. The generated resources are unique and different from general dictionaries or corpora because they address the Chinese segmentation process and are especially oriented for information retrieval (IR) applications. To test the quality of the resources, the writers converted a test collection of documents from Chinese into English through machine translation and conducted trial retrieval runs on the translated documents using different retrieval models. For comparison purposes, the same retrieval runs were also tested on the expert-written English translations. The results suggest that IR-based machine translation was able to yield results comparable to that of human translation and the generated resources had the potential to enable greater sharing of earthquake engineering information across languages while reducing manual translation efforts.| |A locational analysis of growth and change in American metropolitan areas||Carruthers, John I.; Mulligan, Gordon F.||PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE||2008||Article; Proceedings Paper||This article examines the process of growth and change within the American constellation of metropolitan areas. It begins with the premise that regional development happens in two interconnected ways: via demand-induced growth, which is driven by economic opportunity, and supply-induced growth, which is driven by personal preference. The nature and spatial outcome of these mechanisms are investigated by estimating a series of three-equation regional adjustment models wherein changes in population density, employment density, and the average annual wage are endogenously determined. In order to account for spatial dependence in the development process, each model is specified with spatial lags of its three dependent variables and is estimated using a spatial two-stage least squares technique. The results of the analysis illustrate the evolving nature of metropolitan growth and yield insight into the land use patterns that use| |Protective Association Between Neighborhood Walkability and Depression in Older Men.||Berke, Ethan M.; Gottlieb, Laura M.; Moudon, Anne B.||Journal of the American Geriatrics Society||2007||Journal Article||OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between neighborhood walkability and depression in older adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using data from Adult Changes in Thought (ACT), a prospective, longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: King County, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred forty randomly selected men and women aged 65 and older, cognitively intact, living in the same home for at least 2 years. MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The Walkable and Bikable Communities Project provided objective data predicting the probability of walking at least 150 minutes per week in a particular neighborhood. ACT data were linked at the individual level via a geographic information system to this walkability score using buffer radii of 100, 500, and 1,000 meters around the subject's home. Multiple regression analysis tests were conducted for associations between the buffer-specific neighborhood walkability score and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: There was a significant association between neighborhood walkability and depressive symptoms in men when adjusted for individual-level factors of income, physical activity, education, smoking status, living alone, age, ethnicity, and chronic disease. The odds ratio for the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile) of walkability score was 0.31 to 0.33 for the buffer radii (P = .02), indicating a protective association with neighborhood walkability. This association was not significant in women. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant association between neighborhood walkability and depressive symptoms in older men. Further research on the effects of neighborhood walkability may inform community-level mental health treatment and focus depression screening in less-walkable areas.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=24500965&site=ehost-live| |Analysis of lifestyle choices - Neighborhood type, travel patterns, and activity participation||Krizek, KJ; Waddell, P||TRAVELER BEHAVIOR AND VALUES 2002: PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATION||2002||Article; Proceedings Paper||Activity-based travel modeling has begun to make significant progress toward a more behavioral framework for simulating household travel behavior. A significant challenge remains in the need to address the interaction of daily activity and travel patterns with longer-term household choices of vehicle ownership, residential location, and employment location. The choices often depend on one another and jointly define the lifestyle of the household. These choices are likely to evolve over the course of the life cycle as households are formed; as children are born, raised, and ultimately depart to form their own households; and as retirement and old age change patterns of residence, work, and travel. A framework is developed for analyzing household choices relating to three dimensions of lifestyle: travel patterns (including vehicle ownership), activity participation, and residential location (neighborhood type). With cluster analysis on data from the Puget Sound Transportation Panel, nine classifications of lifestyle are uncovered. These clusters demonstrate empirically how decisions of residential location reinforce and affect daily decisions related to travel patterns and activity participation. The applicability of these lifestyle clusters for land use transportation planning is discussed.||LAND-USE; RESIDENTIAL LOCATION; NONWORK TRAVEL; BEHAVIOR; modeling||Kim, S||TRAVELER BEHAVIOR AND VALUES 2003: PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATION||2003||Article; Proceedings Paper||Mobility is a critical element of quality of life.

For this, the factors that influence the mobility of the elderly population (elderly mobility) must be understood. Only a few systematic studies, however, have been published. Descriptive statistics of the potentially influential factors make it difficult to assess their effects on elderly mobility. The transportation mobility of retired people age 65 years or older in the Puget Sound region of Washington State was analyzed by using a structural equation model. The statistical significance and relative effects of various personal and household characteristics and urban form on elderly mobility were tested. The structural equation model finds statistically significant relationships between age, gender, transportation disability, possession of a driver's license, and education level and elderly mobility. Among these variables, age and education level show the strongest effects. Urban form, however, seems to be insignificant.||ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION; TRAVEL BEHAVIOR| |THE VISUAL AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF LANDSCAPES - HIGUCHI,T||THIEL, P||JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION||1983||Book Review| |THE URBAN DESIGN PROCESS - SHIRVANI,H||RYAN, DM||JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION||1987||Book Review| |NATURAL LANDSCAPE AMENITIES AND SUBURBAN GROWTH - METROPOLITAN 1970-1980 - MUELLERWILLE,C||PIVO, G||JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE||1991||Book Review| |THE MORAL ORDER OF A SUBURB - OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION||1992||Book Review| |READING KING,RODNEY READING URBAN UPRISING PLANNING ASSOCIATION||1994||Book Review| OF PLANNING |Gender, place and culture - Bondi,L||Dubrow, RESEARCH||1997||Book Review| GL||JOURNAL OF Review| |The right to the city: the fight for public space.||Purcell, M||ANTIPODE||2005||Book Review| |Planning the new suburbia - Flexibility Jeffrey||JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH||2006||Book Review| |Space, Review| |Women Chang-Hee OF PLANNING Power at SOCIETY||2016||Book Review| Mark||Environment & Planning A||2005||Book Review||Reviews the book Purcell.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=16199287&site=ehost-live||URBAN planning; |A Review of 'Seeking Spatial Justice'.||Purcell, books Planning,\" 2nd ed., by David Banister; \"Helsinki: The Innovative Historical Perspectives,\" by Marjatta Bell and Marjatta Hietala; \"The Birth of City Planning in the United by Jon (Book); HELSINKI: The Innovative City, Historical Perspectives (Book); BIRTH of City Planning in the United States 1840-1917, The (Book)| |Urban revolution now: |Pride in Modesty: Modernist Architecture and the Vernacular in Italy||McLaren, Brian L.||JOURNAL OF DESIGN HISTORY||2011||Book Review| |Advancing Sustainability at Sub-National Level: The Planning.||Bae, C||Papers in Regional Science||2005||Book Review||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=19203681&site=ehost-live| |Green Cities: Urban Growth and the Environment, by E.

The goal of this study was to investigate the nature of expertise in construction managers. Both experts and novices represent and organize experientially gained knowledge as abstractions that we refer to as \"mental models\". We investigated expertise by exploring mental models of construction managers. In this study we explored experimentally the existence of a difference in the mental models among construction managers. A group of construction managers with varying levels of experience were asked to respond to a construction management crisis scenario. Using the ConProFac software to calculate an index i indicative of the structuredness of the responses we found a significant correlation between i and the number of years of experience of the respondent. A better understanding of the mental models of experienced construction managers will help in developing a better theoretical understanding of the CM domain, while also enriching the construction management educational experience.||Computer software - Education - Industrial management - Managers - Mathematical models - Parallel processing systems||Construction manager cognition - Construction managers - Mental models - Parallel distributed processing| |Situational simulations in construction management||Mukherjee, Amlan(1); Rojas, Eddy M.(2)||Proceedings of the 2005 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering||2005||Conference article (CA)||This paper first investigates the motivations for developing situational simulations for the construction management domain.

In order to create a more appropriate CM curriculum, we feel it is imperative to examine the nature of learning in the CM domain. How do novice construction managers learn? How do they build expertise through experience? Most importantly, what tools do we have that will allow us to educate novice construction managers and provide instructors with guidance in answering these questions? We have argued that the CM domain can be modeled using system dynamics. Based on our observation of the students interacting with the Virtual Coach, a situational simulation environment, we have concluded that students in CM learn by developing a better understanding of the inter-relationships of the sub-components of the CM system (cost, schedule, and resource availability) and its evolution over time. We also contend that tools like the Virtual Coach can be very useful in helping us better educate construction managers.||Cognitive systems - Computer simulation - Curricula - Industrial management - Process control - Students||Construction management - Situational simulation - System dynamics - Systems thinking| |Re-envisioning construction engineering and management education through experiential learning||Rojas, Eddy; Dossick, Carrie||ASEE Annual article (CA)||No abstract available| |A survey for the current state of knowledge management within university capital projects offices in the US||Baldwin, Bob(1); Lin, Ken-Yu(2); Migliaccio, Giovanni(2); Xiao, Tan(3)||Proceedings, Annual Conference - Canadian Society for Civil Engineering||2011||Conference article (CA)||In the current economy, organizations need to optimize their work processes if they want to successfully fulfill their construction needs. Construction is no longer only about the extensive use of \"tools\" that are only used to pre-plan tasks and develop detailed schedules; employees need to become knowledge workers. The emergence of this new concept encompasses a paradigm shift with the manipulation and application of knowledge taking primacy over the production components. This paper is concerned with the current state of knowledge management (KM) within capital projects office (CPO) organizations at major universities within the United States. Based on the current state-of-the-art KM researches, an online survey was designed and administered. The survey was intended to address the lack of specific data regarding KM within university CPO organizations, to determine the current KM state in these organizations compared to the greater AEC industry, and to make recommendations on high priority KM agendas. The results indicated that the CPO organizations share many of the same barriers and keys to success as the greater AEC community. However, the opportunity for sharing knowledge within a university CPO organization is even greater due to the knowledge rich learning environment that they operate within. CPO organizations also do not compete with each other and could really learn from peer universities.||Computer aided instruction - Surveys||Capital projects - Knowledge workers - Learning environments - Online surveys - Paradigm shifts - Production components - Sharing knowledge - State of the art| |A survey on tools for measuring contractors performance by state DOTs||Abdel Aziz, A.M.(1)||Proceedings, Annual Conference - Canadian Society for Civil Engineering||2011||Conference article (CA)||A number of tools can be used to measure and evaluate the progress of construction work and the performance of contractors. These tools include variables related to project time, quantities of work, project cost, and/or project cash flow. Construction progress charts are one of these tools. Although these tools have been in existence for a long time, the actual practice and use of such tools is not well established. This paper explains the results of a questionnaire that was administered to solicit information about the current practices of state DOTs in measuring and evaluating performance during construction. The questionnaire covered two areas - performance evaluation, and development and use of progress charts. Twenty-four states participated in the survey. The survey showed that a formal progress measurement and performance evaluation process is lacking in many states, and that there is an apparent lack of progress charts for measuring the performance of contractors. For state DOTs to achieve good performance, it is suggested that more attention be given for measuring the project and contractor performance during construction, not just at the end of construction.||Contractors||Cash flow - Construction progress - Construction works - Contractor performance - Current practices - Progress measurement - Project cost| |Avatars, text, and miscommunication: The impact of communication richness on global virtual team collaboration||Anderson, Anne(1); Dossick, Carrie Sturts(2); Iorio, Josh(3); Taylor, John E.(3); Gina(4)||Proceedings, Annual Conference - Canadian Society for Civil Engineering||2011||Conference article (CA)||A growing number of engineering firms are outsourcing complex design and construction work to international vendors. Due to the significant geographic distances that can separate project team members in global design networks, much of this work is executed in virtual teams. The challenges of working in geographically distributed networks have prompted the development of alternative, virtual workspaces. Questions remain on how these virtual workspaces support or hinder collaborative work as compared to face to face. People are social beings that rely on body language and other non-verbal cues to communicate. What happens to team formation and collaborative effectiveness when non-verbal cues are mediated through virtual workspace functionalities such as text, voting tools and avatar actions? Are cultural and linguistic differences exacerbated or dampened by virtual workspace environments? In this paper, qualitative ethnographic data is used to examine collaboration effectiveness of global virtual engineering project teams. Based on an examination of the collaborative interactions in a virtual workspace between participants in five global engineering project networks over a two month period, we found that where communication richness increased (e.g. participants had ways of adding non-verbal cues to the conversation) the collaborative effectiveness increased for some but not all of the teams. We discuss a number of factors that contribute to effective collaboration and communication and outline the ramifications this has on the design of and the work in virtual teams.||Engineering - Industrial engineering||Collaborative interaction - Collaborative Work - Distributed networks - Global engineerings - Global virtual teams - Linguistic differences - Virtual engineering - Virtual workspaces| |Combined digital & physical modeling with vision-based tangible Opportunities and challenges||Hsiao, Chih-Pin(1); Johnson, Brian(2)||Designing Together: CAADFutures 2011 - Proceedings of the 14th International conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design||2011||Conference article (CA)||Designers in architectural studios, both in education and practice, have worked to integrate digital and physical media ever since they began to utilize digital tools in the design process [1].

Emerging strategies for human-computer interaction such as tangible user interfaces and computer vision techniques present new possibilities for manipulating architectural designs. These technologies can help bridge between the digital and physical worlds. In this paper we discuss some of these technologies, analyze several current design challenges and present a prototype that illustrates ways in which a broader approach to human computer interaction might resolve the problems.

Several estimates are performed throughout a project lifecycle to make decisions on the project with stakeholders often relying on historical data to estimate costs of future construction activities. Location cost adjustment factors (LCAFs) are commonly used to adjust historically based estimates by project location with the selection of the LCAF being one important step of this process. Various datasets provide LCAF values for sampled locations, but, obviously, not all locations across North America are included. Therefore, spatial interpolation and prediction methods are needed to infer LCAF for un-sampled locations. The current industry practice is to select the value for a location using only one variable, namely the nearest linear-distance between two sites. Arguably, construction costs could be affected by other variables, including socio-economics. This research investigated relationships between a commonly used set of location adjustment factors, the City Cost Indexes (CCI) by RSMeans and other attributes, included in the ESRI Community Sourcebook. Regression-based prediction modeling was investigated to understand if it could be an appropriate way to model CCI as a function of multiple covariates. WEKA and ArcGIS packages were used to develop and test the prediction models. The prediction models did not outperform interpolation methods, as expected. In addition, among the two prediction models, the GIS-based regression (GISBR) model slightly outperformed the WEKA-based regression (WEKABR) model.||Construction industry - Cost estimating - Forecasting - Geographic information systems - Interpolation - Life cycle - Location - Predictive analytics||Adjustment factors - Construction activities - Construction costs - Construction projects - Industry practices - Interpolation method - Prediction methods - Spatial interpolation| |Use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in facilities management||Foms-Samso, Francisco(1); Bogus, Susan M.(1); Migliaccio, Giovanni C.(2)||Proceedings, Annual Conference - Canadian Society for Civil Engineering||2011||Conference article (CA)||Conventional practices and inefficiencies in accessing relevant operation and maintenance (O&M) information are major issues for facility managers. Access to accurate information is critical for operating and maintaining a facility in a sustainable way. Building Information Modeling (BIM) facilitates the storage, organization and exchange of structured information; however, BIM is not often used for facilities management. While the benefits of BIM have been studied for the design and construction phase of projects, the O&M phase has lacked a similar level of attention. Reluctance to change, lack of knowledge, and lack of documented metrics have prevented facility managers from adopting BIM to support the O&M phase. The purpose of this research was to determine the perceived value by facility managers of using BIM for facilities O&M. An online questionnaire, along with a video simulating the use of BIM as an interface to access relevant O&M information, generated replies from 125 facilities operations personnel. From the replies, we determined their perception on future use, time savings, and benefits of using BIM for facilities O&M. The results of the survey indicated that more than two thirds of the respondents thought they would use BIM frequently to access O&M information. They also estimated that they could reduce the time for processing work orders by twenty five percent. Most respondents perceived improved accessibility to O&M information as the best benefit of using BIM for O&M.||Facilities - Information management - Information theory - Managers - Surveys||Building Information Model - BIM - Design and construction - Facilities management - Facility managers - Online questionnaire - Operation and maintenance - Perceived value - Structured information| |Using innovative technologies for studying the relationship between construction worker's physical strain and performance: An exploratory study||Gatti, U.(1); Migliaccio, G.C.(2); Schneider, S.(3)||Proceedings, Annual Conference - Canadian Society for Civil Engineering||2011||Conference article (CA)||Despite improvements in equipment and workplace ergonomics, industry data confirm that construction projects are still characterized by physically demanding activities and stressful environments. Anecdotal evidence suggests that physical strain may lead to decreased productivity, inattentiveness, poor quality work, accidents, and injuries. However, inadequate monitoring technologies have limited previous efforts to produce an empirical basis to this claim, thereby limiting the advances in the way human work utilization is optimized and construction projects are managed. The construction industry can be characterized as reluctant in adopting innovative technologies. However, when technologies are used there are usually measurable benefits to the construction industry. Using recently-introduced, non-intrusive Physiological Status Monitors, the authors are studying the effects of construction worker's physical strain on quality of work, productivity, and occurrence of unsafe behavior. The expected outcome of this long-term effort is an improved understanding of how construction work can be performed leading to an improvement of productivity, an enhancement of work quality, assurance of workers' safety, and the promotion of long term occupational health. The goal is to develop a physical strain monitoring system for workers that is able to maximize quality and productivity while preserving the workforce's health and safety. This exploratory study assessed PSMs' viability in the construction industry, comparing the performance of PSMs and standard laboratory instruments during dynamic activities simulating construction workers routine body movements. The selected PSMs are presented along with preliminary results showing that this innovative technology can be effectively implemented to monitor construction workforce's physical strain.||Construction equipment - Construction industry - Ergonomics - Industrial hygiene - Personnel - Productivity||Anecdotal evidences - Construction projects - Construction workers - Construction workforces - Exploratory studies - Innovative technology - Monitoring technologies - Physiological status monitors| |A comparative study on environmental life cycle impacts of curtain walls||Azari, R.(1); Yong-Woo Kim(2)||Proceedings of the 2012 Construction Research Congress||2012||Conference article (CA)||Design of glass curtain wall (CW) systems has long been under the influence of structural, thermal and daylighting performance requirements as well as cost and aesthetic concerns. However, environmental life-cycle impacts of the systems are usually ignored when selecting the suitable materials for mullions and glazing units. This paper intends to examine the effect of mullion material change on the environmental impacts of a typical CW system over its life-cycle. The mullion materials studied in this paper include extruded aluminum, carbon steel and glulam timber. The environmental impact categories of interest include global warming, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity. In addition, the paper applies a process-based Attritional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique to achieve its objectives. According to the results of this study, an extruded aluminum CW system contributes most to the environmental impact categories of interest in this research while a glulam timber CW makes the least contribution. Contribution of steel CW systems falls in-between.||buildings (structures) - daylighting - design for environment - environmental management - global warming - steel - structural engineering - walls||environmental life cycle impacts - curtain walls - CW system - structural performance - thermal performance - daylighting performance - aesthetic concerns - glazing units - mullion materials - carbon steel - extruded aluminum - glulam timber - global warming - acidification - eutrophication - human toxicity - process-based attritional life cycle assessment technique - LCA technique| |Automatic Identification of Unsafe Bending Behavior of Construction Workers using Real-time Location Sensing and Construction Research Congress||2012||Conference article (CA)||Nowadays, remote sensing technology allows for autonomous and remote data collection of construction resources.

These organizations inevitably have significant impacts upon the environment and ought to take more responsibilities on sustainability for their communities and regions. This paper explores the means and methods to apply knowledge management (KM) to support Capital Project Offices (CPO) at higher education institutions in the course of sustainable construction. While knowledge is generally regarded as a necessary foundation for sustainability innovation, its capturing and reuses has not been fully materialized in CPO organizations. One of the challenges is to understand and describe the types of sustainability knowledge of importance to CPO organizations. To this end, the authors conducted an in-depth case study at the University of Washington to explore its CPO personnel's perceptions on KM as it relates to sustainable construction. Survey questionnaire and interview were administered to collect data for the case study. In particular, a web-based KM system was used to help situate research participants in a pseudo knowledge capturing and sharing scenario to facilitate data collection. Research findings depict the status quo of KM in the case study CPO, point out barriers of the current practices, and based on the findings, a classification system tailored for CPO organizations to describe their sustainability knowledge is proposed.||construction industry - educational institutions - Internet - knowledge management - sustainable development||sustainability knowledge management - Capital Project Offices - higher educational organization - sustainable construction - Web-based KM system - classification system| |Integrated design to achieve zero net energy in an urban office building||Azari-N., Rahman(1); Peha, Robert B.(1)||World Renewable Energy Forum, WREF 2012, Including World Renewable Energy Congress XII and Colorado Renewable Energy Society (CRES) Annual Conferen||2012||Conference article (CA)||This paper reports on developments of what is likely to be the greenest urban office buildings in the world.

Proceedings||2013||Conference article (CA)||Knowledge of workforce productivity and activity is crucial for determining whether a construction project can be accomplished on time and within budget. As a result, significant work has been done on improving and assessing productivity and activity at task, project, and industry levels. Task level productivity and activity analysis are used extensively within the construction industry for various purposes, including cost estimating, claim evaluation, and day-to-day project management. Nevertheless, assessment of task level productivity and activity analyses are mostly performed through visual observations and after-the-fact even though studies have been performed to automatically translate the construction operations data into productivity information and to provide spatial information of construction resources for specific construction operations. This paper presents an original approach to automatically assess construction labor activity. Using data fusion of spatiotemporal and workers' thoracic posture data, the authors have developed a novel framework for identifying and understanding the worker's activity type over time automatically. This information is used to perform automatic work sampling that is expected to facilitate real-time productivity assessment.||construction industry - labour resources - production engineering computing - productivity - project management - sensor fusion||task level construction activity analysis automation - real time location sensors - worker thoracic posture data - workforce productivity - task level productivity analysis - cost estimation - claim evaluation - day-to-day project management - construction resources spatial information - spatiotemporal data fusion - work sampling - productivity assessment| |IPD in practice: innovation Kim(1); El-Anwar, O.(1)||AEI 2013. Building Solutions for Architectural Engineering. Proceedings of the 2013 Architectural Engineering National Conference||2013||Conference article (CA)||In this paper we present a healthcare case study that leveraged Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), Building Information Modeling (BIM) and lean construction (Lean). With this project, we aim to investigate organizational alignment and focus on how team building facilitated innovation in the design and construction processes and had significant positive impact on the operational efficiencies of the building. Through structured interviews, we found that a unique proposal process, which was focused on \"building team chemistry and understanding\", lead to the team's development of a culture of open communication and teamwork that set the ground work for designers and builders to work closely together, blending teams and blurring boundaries throughout the execution of design and construction. In this paper, we explore how \"The IPD allowed the overlaps to occur in a productive way\". In doing so, we build on previous finding that the antecedents of effective integration were the development of the team's orientation and culture as well as the processes of working together. The tools, IPD, lean and BIM, supported the integrated teamwork, but did not create the integrated team; however, the contract, lean and BIM tools did reinforce the project team's integration and facilitated better results in terms of design and construction products. In this paper, we focus on how the drive for efficiencies in construction and operations influenced design processes and outcomes, and how team alignment overcame technological and logistical challenges throughout their project process.||building - construction industry - health care - innovation management - logistics - project management - team working||logistical challenges - teamwork - team building facilitated innovation - organizational alignment - lean construction - BIM - building information modeling - integrated project delivery - healthcare design - IPD| |Using probabilistic crew production rate to projects||Orabi, Wallied(1); Sheykhi, Reza(1); El-Anwar, Omar(2)||Proceedings, Conference - Canadian Society for Civil Engineering||2013||Conference article (CA)||Risks are inherent in construction and therefore needs to be incorporated in construction project planning. To this end, existing stochastic planning models use historical activity duration data to model time uncertainties and simulate project durations. This approach does not take into consideration the impact of day-to-day changes on time-related risk factors (e.g. weather, labor availability, and trade coordination) and their associated uncertainties. Therefore, simulation of crew production rate can provide a more accurate representation of these time-related uncertainties. This paper therefore presents the development of a new stochastic planning model that uses historical crew production rate data to simulate both activity and project durations. The model uses Monte Carlo simulation with beta distributions to capture day-to-day and shift-to-shift changes in crew production rate. In addition, the model also considers the impact of sharing a limited pool of resources on the construction duration of a portfolio of projects rather than single projects. An application example is analyzed to evaluate the performance of the new model and demonstrate its capabilities.||Monte Carlo methods - Stochastic systems - Technology transfer||Activity duration - Application examples - Beta distributions - Construction duration - Construction projects - Project duration - Stochastic planning - Time uncertainty| |Avatar-model interaction in virtual worlds improves distributed team collaboration through issue discovery||Anderson, A.(1); Dossick, C.S.(2)||2014 International Conference on Computing in Civil and Building Engineering.

This paper contributes to visualization and building information modeling (BIM) literature by exploring how the affordances of the media-rich 3D environment of a virtual world support mutual discovery of construction coordination issues among team members. In Winter/Spring 2013, graduate and undergraduate students from four globally distributed universities met in three teams once a week for eleven weeks. Numerous communication affordances were available to the teams both within and external to the virtual world, including voice, text chat, screen-sharing, and exploring avatar-scaled models imported into the virtual world. When exploring the imported model, individuals controlled their own viewpoint by \"walking\" through the building as an avatar using the arrow keys on a keyboard and, as a result, all members of the team were able to view the model, together, regardless of BIM experience. We found the rate of issue discovery to be significantly higher in the avatar-scaled models compared to other methods of viewing the model, such as passively viewing the model on a 2D shared screen, indicating that bringing team members and building models into the same interactional space is more effective for quickly discovering coordination issues.||avatars - buildings (structures) - structural engineering computing - team working||avatar-model interaction - virtual worlds - distributed team collaboration - issue discovery - building information modeling - BIM - avatar-scaled models - 2D shared screen - distributed construction engineering management| |Building Information Modeling in Graduate Construction Engineering and Management Education||Dossick, C.S.(1); Namhun Lee(2); Foleyk, S.(3)||2014 International Conference on Computing in Civil and Building Engineering.

CEM programs across the country are updating their curriculum offerings to include computing generally and Building Information Modeling (BIM) specifically. In this paper, we focus on the question of Building Information Modeling in the context of graduate education and specifically ask in what ways should software generally and BIM specifically be incorporated into CEM graduate education? In this paper we present a review of CEM graduate programs and discuss ways that computer technology generally and BIM specifically can be incorporated into the curriculum. This paper will include the results of a survey of industry professionals to determine if, how and in what ways BIM education is valued by the industry. A majority of BIM managers surveyed thought that graduate education is important for BIM professionals. From this survey, we see a coupled need: technological education in the context of CEM topics. Our review of current graduate coursework in CEM aligns with the survey findings in that BIM courses focus on the CEM uses of technology and some are application specific (e.g., estimating) while others are project focused (e.g. design team coordination). This findings suggests that BIM workflow could be incorporated into many of the CEM topic coursework as BIM become more prevalent in the industry.||buildings (structures) - computer aided instruction - educational courses - engineering education - further education - management education - structural engineering computing||building information modeling - graduate construction engineering and management education - energy modeling - laser scanning - surveying - computer technology concepts - computer technology skills - curriculum update - CEM graduate education - CEM graduate programs - BIM professionals - technological education - graduate coursework - BIM courses - design team coordination - BIM workflow - CEM topic coursework| |Comparing Global Versus Domestic Project Facilitation in Virtual Workspaces||Comu, S.(1); Taylor, J.E.(2); Dossick, C.S.(3)||Construction in a Global Network. 2014 Construction Research Congress. Proceedings||2014||Conference article (CA)||One of the most compelling reasons to examine the globalization of the engineering and construction industry relates to the business opportunities it brings; yet global collaboration also creates distinctive challenges especially in the early stages that firms must overcome. Overcoming these collaboration challenges in a virtual environment may require different approaches for global virtual project networks (GVPNs) as compared to domestic virtual project networks (DVPNs) to achieve performance objectives. In this paper, we examine facilitation, a boundary spanning collaboration technique that may have unique requirements in GVPNs. We observed two DVPNs and two GVPNs working in a virtual workspace called the CyberGRID and studied the interactions between network members to examine whether significant differences exist in the utilization of facilitation in the initial stages of collaboration and we found that facilitators were utilized more frequently in GVPNs. This finding has important implications for the efficient functioning of the increasingly common global project networks in the construction industry that utilize virtual collaboration techniques.||construction industry - grid computing - groupware - project management - structural engineering computing - virtual reality||domestic project network facilitation - global project network facilitation - virtual workspaces - GVPN - DVPN - boundary spanning collaboration technique - CyberGRID - construction industry - virtual collaboration techniques| |Development and Validation of a Framework for Evaluation of Integrated Design Teams of Sustainable High-Performance Buildings||Azari, R.(1); Yong-Woo Kim(2)||Construction in a Global Network. 2014 Construction Research Congress. Proceedings||2014||Conference article (CA)||Integration of disciplines and project participants is widely prescribed as a major remedy to improve effectiveness and efficiency of construction projects. In the context of Sustainable High-Performance (SHP) projects, Integrated Design (ID) approach encourages implementation of systems-thinking and early intense collaboration of project stakeholders during design phase. The desired outcomes in this context would be buildings which not only are cost-effective but also have superior energy and sustainability performance over their life-cycle. The present manuscript reports on a research project, which attempted to develop and validate a framework for evaluation of the ID teams of SHP projects. The research applied a mixed-method (qualitative-quantitative) research methodology. First, qualitative research (case-study and interview) and literature review were used to create a pool of evaluation factors and items that could be used for evaluation/measurement of the performance of the ID teams. These items were generated and organized based on the Context, Input, Process and Product (CIPP) evaluation model. Then, in quantitative phase of research, the evaluation items were tested for reliability and validity by deploying a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of LEED-rated projects and statistical analysis of the collected responses. The research finally proposed a validated framework for evaluation of the ID teams of SHP projects which consisted of four major elements: a) an evaluation model based on the CIPP model, b) 27 evaluation factors, c) 65 evaluation items, and d) a measurement format.||buildings (structures) - construction industry - design engineering - project management - reliability - statistical analysis||integrated design teams - sustainable high-performance buildings - construction projects - SHP projects - sustainability performance - CIPP evaluation model - reliability - statistical analysis| |Exploring BIMs as Avatars: Using 3D Virtual Network. 2014 Construction Research Congress. Proceedings||2014||Conference article (CA)||In the AEC industry, globally distributed teams are becoming more common, BIM adoption is increasing, and effective time management is essential to remain competitive; therefore, understanding how to maximize BIM for construction coordination using collaborative technologies becomes crucial. Observations from a 2012 industry case study with a five-member distributed team led this research team to hypothesize that importing a 3D model into a 3D virtual world would improve team collaboration with models because (a) using cues in the 3D environment, including avatar position, affords more efficient communication and (b) having independent viewpoints allows a greater number of coordination issues to be discovered. This paper reports on a collaborative experiment with four different universities in 2013, in which we observed six geographically distributed nine-member teams as they conducted work using two different communication technologies: 1) A commercial collaboration platform in which team members view models via desktop sharing, and 2) A 3D virtual world in which the students were able to \"walk through\" the building model. We found that the teams using the 3D software were able to communicate ideas more quickly and had significantly more discoveries. By contrast, the teams using desktop sharing software often required a detailed verbal explanation when communicating specific ideas.||avatars - civil engineering computing - virtual reality||BIMs - 3D virtual worlds - AEC industry - globally distributed teams - time management - construction coordination - collaborative technology - 3D model - avatar position - commercial collaboration platform - building information model - 3D software - desktop sharing software - cues - communication technology| |Exploring the Relationship between Chronic Sleep Deprivation and Safety Construction Sites||Gatti, U.C.(1); Ken-Yu Lin(1); Caldera, C.(1); Chiang, R.(1)||Construction in Network. 2014 Construction Research Congress. Proceedings||2014||Conference article (CA)||Evidence suggests that sleep deprivation can negatively affect behavior, wellbeing, and work performance. Although several researchers debated the relationships between sleep deprivation and work performance, research that clearly determines the relationship between construction workers' sleep deprivation and safety performance has yet to be performed. To contribute to the analysis of such relationship, the researchers designed and administered a survey at three construction sites in Seattle (WA). The survey collected information about workers' schedule, and sleeping habits and issues. The study concluded that most of the workers sleep between five to six hours before a working day and, therefore, could become the candidates to experience sleep deprivation related issues. Further, respondents were asked to rank the impact of sleep deprivation on the occurrence of ten types of near misses. Three types of near misses relating to the operation of forklifts, scissor lifts, trucks, or carts; the lack or improper use of personal protective equipment; and, the use of ladders were recognized as most likely to occur because of sleep deprivation. Thus, this study warrants that sleep deprivation might cause safety concerns for particular construction activities and that trade-specific investigation is necessary to clearly understand the relationship between sleep deprivation and safety.||construction industry - occupational health - occupational safety||construction activities - personal protective equipment - carts operation - trucks operation - scissor lifts operation - forklift operation - Seattle - work performance - construction sites - safety performance - chronic sleep deprivation| |Knowledge transfer with technology: interdisciplinary team experiences in design and construction education||Monson, C.(1); Dossick, C.S.(2)||2014 International Conference on Computing in Civil and Building Engineering. Proceedings||2014||Conference article (CA)||Recognizing the growth of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) integrated practices and the expanding effect of computational and visualization technologies, this study formulates a relationship between iterative collaboration and the technology mediation that is beginning to typify professional integrated practice. Using the ground of collaborative project-based undergraduate studios between construction management, architecture, engineering, and other allied fields, we argue that transitions in the cycle of the design thinking model are where knowledge transfer is co-located with the affordances provided by technology. These points have historically been part of any learning about ambiguous problem solving; now in integrated studios, students explore joint-problem solving in the context of digital technologies and group collaboration. This context and the integrative skills needed in AEC practice are the issues that must be addressed by contemporary educators.||construction industry - design engineering - engineering education - knowledge management||knowledge transfer - interdisciplinary team experiences - design education - construction education - AEC integrated practices - architecture-engineering-and-construction - computational technology - visualization technology - iterative collaboration - technology mediation| |Starting From Scratch: Ballard, G.(3); Seong-Kyun Cho(4)||Construction in Network. 2014 Construction Research Congress. Proceedings||2014||Conference article (CA)||Extensive research and published material exists addressing owner, contractor and supplier relationships and contracting methods. Also, there exist a variety of capital project delivery systems in construction industry which all aim at delivering projects to project owners with desired quality and within expected cost and schedule. These project delivery systems are pre-defined systems and processes each defined to address some of the many problems that keep owners of projects from achieving their desired results. Previous literature, however, indicates that the outcomes of applying these delivery processes are still disappointing to owners and not promising to a major part of the construction industry. The major objectives of this Construction Industry Institute (CII)-funded research were to identify an innovative approach to project delivery, to challenge the industry and its customers to create conditions for ideal project delivery paradigm, and to provide suggestions on how to approximate the ideal in imperfect conditions. The research objectives were attempted through a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. A comprehensive review of existing literature in the field and creative thinking workshops were steps in the research to achieve the vision to the new ideal project delivery system, and to develop the hypothesis. The hypothesis was then tested and validated through statistical analyses and case-study research. We concluded that superior project performance can be achieved by breaking existing paradigms and implementing organizational integration, alignment of interests and management-by-means through new project delivery systems.||construction industry - innovation management - organisational aspects - project management - statistical analysis||Construction Industry Institute - CII - innovative approach - ideal project delivery paradigm - statistical analyses - organizational integration - interests alignment| |Testing Effectiveness of Solar Photovoltaic Systems for Public Schools in Washington||Ghadge, C.(1); Yong-Woo Kim(1)||Construction in a Global Network. 2014 Construction Research Congress.

Proceedings||2014||Conference article (CA)||In the global infrastructure market, unsolicited public-private partnership (UPPP) proposals have been promoted and a number of countries have established incentive programs to encourage such proposals. While PPPs have been growing in the United States, development of infrastructure through UPPP is still an area in need of further development. In this research, eighteen major national and international PPP companies working in the United States were surveyed about their perceptions of unsolicited PPP proposals in terms of the management of such proposals, adequacy of regulations, incentive programs, procurement stages and negotiations, procurement time and fees, and competing proposals. The analysis shows that a significant percentage of the surveyed companies has pursued, shortlisted, or awarded UPPP. Surprisingly, little less than half of the surveyed companies would not encourage UPPP in the United States. The reasons were rooted in government mismanagement of UPPP, transparency problems, and the lack of competition. The companies reported a lack of adequate guidelines and complained about the short bidding times for preparing competing proposals. The majority of the companies were not in favor of the UPPP incentive programs. It was concluded that significant work is needed for improving UPPP regulations and procurement processes.||globalisation - incentive schemes - organisational aspects - procurement - public administration - tendering||PPP projects - private sector perceptions - USA - global infrastructure market - unsolicited public-private partnership - UPPP - incentive programs - United States - PPP companies - procurement stages - procurement fees - procurement time - short bidding times| |Using Discrete-Event Simulation to Support Building 2014 Construction Research Congress. Proceedings||2014||Conference article (CA)||Among the Washington State Department of Transportation's (WSDOT) capital assets, Transportation Equipment Fund (TEF) shops provide a crucial service by ensuring proper care and maintenance of most of the state vehicles and equipment. Therefore, any reduction of TEF shop facilities capabilities could jeopardize not only WSDOT vehicles and equipment maintenance but also WSDOT's ability to fulfill its core mission. Given the importance of TEF shops, this exploratory case study analyzes the building system failures that have occurred or are likely to occur in these facilities, and utilizes discrete-event simulation to investigate how WSDOT operations can be affected by these events. In particular, by creating a model capable of simulating the service operations performed in the TEF shops, this study quantifies the consequences of failures on the shop activities and road users. The aim of this paper is to describe the development and validation of the discrete-event simulation model and its associated data gathering efforts. Whereas, further building systems failure analysis and impact assessment are within the scope of another publication.||buildings (structures) - condition monitoring - discrete event simulation - maintenance engineering - mechanical engineering computing - road vehicles||discrete-event simulation - Washington State Department of Transportation - WSDOT capital asset - building asset management - transportation equipment fund - TEF shop - WSDOT vehicle - equipment maintenance - building system failure analysis - impact assessment| |Identifying the optimal execution plan M.(1); El-Anwar, O.(2); Marzouk, M.(1)||Construction Research Congress 2016. Old and New Construction Technologies Converge in Historic San Juan||2016||Conference article (CA)||Infrastructure upgrading projects in slum areas face a number of challenges that are not common to those of similar projects in planned areas. These challenges stem from (1) the heavily-congested and unplanned nature of a slum, which results in a series of logistical challenges; and (2) the fact that slum dwellers reside in and around the upgrading project sites, which raises the level of resistance to project execution. As such, slum infrastructure upgrading projects face high risks of prolonged project duration and increased construction costs. This paper focuses on sanitary networks upgrading projects in slum areas. In these projects, the unplanned nature of the slum is manifested in the undocumented variations in road widths and their steep slopes as well as the ever changing urban characteristics of the area. It is common, under such conditions, for contractors to be forced to use different construction methods. Furthermore, these projects are expected to face high levels of dwellers' resistance because of the socioeconomic disturbance resulting from the construction activities. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes an automated heuristic-based planning model capable of prioritizing the upgrading phases and selecting the suitable construction methods to accelerate the delivery of service to slum dwellers. To this end, the model computes the rate of service delivery under different construction scenarios and hence accounts for the expected resistance in cases of late delivery. The model processes the urban characteristics of slum areas and topography data as well as the proposed sanitary network design in order to generate the optimal order of upgrading phases and the optimal selection of construction equipment. An application example is presented to demonstrate the use of the model and its capabilities.||critical infrastructures - optimisation - sanitary engineering - socio-economic effects - strategic planning - structural engineering - town and country planning||optimal execution planning - slum infrastructure upgrading projects - sanitary networks - socioeconomic disturbance - dwellers resistance - heuristic-based planning model| |Integrated project delivery in public Khaled(2); Lee, Hyun Woo(1); Angeley, Jeff(3)||IGLC 2016 - 24th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction||2016||Conference article (CA)||One of the major challenges that the construction industry facing is how to improve the effectiveness and performance of construction projects which become more dynamic and uncertain. For this reason, more projects are adopting lean principles which focuses on collaboration and work flow reliability. Due to the limitations of current procurement practices including competitive bidding strategy and fixed price contracts, an innovative project delivery, so called integrated project delivery (IPD) or lean project delivery, has been adopted by project owners. However, most of public agencies have restrictions in choosing a project delivery. In fact, most procurement codes require public agencies to use competitive pricing and bidding, leading to difficulties in using IPD which encourages collaboration among project teams. In this paper, the researchers present the result of a survey aimed at investigating the benefits and restrictions experienced by project participants who have tried IPD or some principles of IPD in public projects. The research is expected to provide a practical view on the opportunities and challenges in applying IPD to their projects.||Construction industry - Lean production - Surveying - Surveys||Competitive bidding - Construction projects - Fixed-price contracts - Integrated project deliveries - Lean project deliveries - Procurement practices - Project participants - Public project| |Management of Force Majeure Risks in Canadian PPP Transportation Projects||Aziz, A.A.(1); Tai-Ling Shen(1)||Construction Research Congress 2016. Old and New Construction Technologies Converge in Historic San Juan||2016||Conference article (CA)||The successful implementation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) requires the contractual obligations and rights of the public and private parties to be clearly defined. The occurrence of risks in PPPs may negatively impact the parties' abilities to perform their obligations. Force majeure (FM) risks represent a risk category that requires delicate management as it may cause tremendous losses to the private party. However, little has been published on how these risks were defined, allocated, and managed in PPPs. This paper investigates these issues through a case study approach that analyzes the agreements of five PPP transportation projects in British Columbia through content analysis. The findings show that not all FM events are dealt with as FM risks; only the most severe are called eligible FM (EFM) risks. These risks provide compensation events that relieve the parties from their obligations, allow termination of contracts, and provide for compensating the balance of the private debt, equity, and labor payments. Non-EFM events provide for continuation and compensation for the expenditure above the maximum insurance coverage. If the expenditure and restoration time exceed particular thresholds, termination may occur. The analysis should assist the PPPs on how to better manage the FM risks.||contracts - insurance - organisational aspects - project management - public administration - risk management - transportation||force majeure risk management - Canadian PPP transportation projects - public-private partnerships - contractual obligations - risk category - private party - private party - risk allocation - risk management - British Columbia - FM events - eligible FM risks - EFM risks - compensation events - contract termination - private debt - equity - labor payments - nonEFM events - expenditure continuation - expenditure compensation - maximum insurance coverage - expenditure time - restoration time| |BIM to Facilities Management: Presenting a Proven Civil Engineering 2017. Information Modeling and Data Analytics. Selected Papers from the ASCE International Workshop||2017||Conference article (CA)||Large institutional owners face a daunting task of assessing the condition of their facilities and forecasting maintenance and replacement costs of these assets. Computerized systems, generally known as asset management systems (AMS) are emerging in the market that provide maintenance budget forecasts based on building inventory data and conditions assessment. The main challenge that large institutional owners face is how to efficiently develop asset inventories that form the basis for AMS calculations. In response, this paper presents a research project wherein the research team developed a workflow for building information modeling (BIM) data transfer to AMS used for facility management (FM). This work provides a way for owners to leverage legacy BIM data to create building inventories or to specify BIM deliverables that will provide asset data for their intended AMS. This paper presents applied action research that developed a BIM to FM-AMS workflow as a proven practice that leads to sustainable facility management. The study results indicate that information exchange should require classification systems to utilize a consistent language between BIM systems. In addition, this paper presents peer institutional efforts and customization of classification systems that were studied to present a data crosswalk between these systems. The study results are expected to support owners and facility managers to understand the logic behind BIM information exchange practices so that they can adopt the best practice that fits the needs and goals of their organization.||building management systems - buildings (structures) - construction industry - data integration - facilities management - maintenance engineering - sustainable development - workflow management software||workflow tasks - information exchange - facilities condition - maintenance costs - replacement costs - computerized systems - asset management systems - AMS - maintenance budget forecasts - building inventory data - conditions assessment - building information modeling data transfer - BIM data transfer - sustainable facility management - classification systems - construction industry - data integration| |Comparative analysis of P3 availability payments in the USA and Canada||Aziz, A.A.(1); Abdelhalim, K.(1)||Advances in Public-Private Partnerships. Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Public-Private Partnerships||2017||Conference article (CA)||The availability payments have been used in the payment mechanisms of public-private partnership (P3) transportation projects in the United States. These payments have been used to emphasize the performance-based contracts and to achieve government objectives in using P3 as a delivery system. This research looks at the implementation of the availability payment in the USA transportation projects and compares it to the Canadian P3 experience. The research investigates the structure of the payment mechanism and whether other payments have been used in the mechanism, the share percentage of the availability payment in the mechanism structure, the economic/financial factors used in the payment structure, future adjustments, penalty/performance-deduction structure, the public agency objectives in using availability payment, and the public agency oversight and accounting. The work utilizes a document and content analysis approach to a detailed study of the selected P3 projects in the USA and Canada. The output of the research should explain the pros and cons of using availability payments in the USA and the areas that need improvement in the payment structure.||contracts - economics - organisational aspects - project management - public administration - transportation||P3 availability payments - USA - availability payment - payment mechanism - public-private partnership transportation projects - payment structure - Canada - contracts - economic factors - financial factors - penalty/performance-deduction structure - future adjustments - public agency| |Gazetteers for Information Extraction Applications 2017. Smart Safety, Sustainability and Resilience. Selected Papers from the ASCE International Workshop||2017||Conference article (CA)||Gazetteers, also known as entity dictionaries, can be applied to support many information extraction (IE) applications such as named entity recognition (NER). However, gazetteers are not always available, because they require not only domain knowledge but also human effort during development. Existing gazetteers are also mostly general in nature; they are limited to providing common types of entities such as locations, organizations, person names, etc. These common types of entities cannot accurately reflect the semantics of specific domain knowledge, and their applicability is therefore limited. A useful gazetteer, on the other hand, must be able to indicate the important types of entities (i.e., classes of concepts) and must also contain a sufficient number of entities. This creates the need for domain-specific gazetteers, especially when involving specialized IE tasks. In this paper, the authors take construction safety management as the target domain and propose a semi-automated approach to develop a construction safety gazetteer, aiming to eventually support IE applications for constructions safety management. The proposed approach consists of three steps: (1) applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract important phrases (not limited to single terms, but including bigrams and trigrams) from text resources, (2) defining important types of entities as entity classes for the construction safety domain, and (3) assigning the extracted phrases to the predefined entity classes. The authors also discuss how the proposed methodology could be affordable for domain experts, and the possible scenarios for IE applications for supporting construction safety management.||civil engineering computing - construction industry - information retrieval - natural language processing - safety - text analysis||gazetteers - information extraction applications - construction safety management - entity dictionaries - IE applications - named entity recognition - NER - natural language processing - NLP - phrases extraction - bigrams - trigrams - text resources - entity classes| |Spatial interpolation of Weather data for occupational health and safety research in construction||Lee, Wonil(1); Lin, Ken-Yu(2)||6th CSCE-CRC International Construction Specialty Conference 2017 - Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference and General Meeting 2017||2017||Conference article (CA)||Weather data help inform the sustainable management of construction workforce. Weather data can be used to predict the level of heat stress faced by workers and inform job rotation. Oftentimes, researchers struggle to obtain authorization from project owners or contractors when it comes to installing on-site weather station for collecting desirable data. Thus, researchers look to alternative data sources. This paper studies two alternative data sources: the weather stations validated by the world meteorological organization (WMO) and those provided by Weather Underground (WU), an online platform from The Weather Company, LLC. Specifically, we selected a project site in Seattle and estimated weather data for the site location on a geographical information system using inverse distance weighted interpolation. Weather data were collected from 35 weather stations within a 100 mile (160 km) radius from the project site through WU. We seek to understand: 1) through the spatial interpolation and for the locations which house the WMO stations, are the weather data derived from localized personal weather stations comparable to those measured by the WMO stations? 2) if they are comparable, for the location which houses the selected project site, are the weather data derived from localized personal weather stations areas comparable to those measured by the WMO stations?, and 3) if they are not comparable, how big is the difference when it is translated into the scale of heat stress? Eventually, our study hopes to develop a robust method to monitor construction workers' level of heat stress at specific project locations through localized weather data. \u00a9 CSCE-CRC International Construction Specialty Conference 2017 - Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference and General Meeting 2017.All rights reserved.||Geographic information systems - Heating - Industrial hygiene - Information systems - Information use - Interpolation - Inverse problems - Location - Meteorology - Thermal stress - Weather information services||Construction workforces - Estimated weather datum - Heat stress - Inverse distance-weighted interpolation - Meteorological data - Occupational health and safety - Spatial interpolation - World meteorological organizations| |Developing a Collaboration Woo Lee(1); Osburn, L.(1)||Construction Research Congress 2018. Construction Project Management. Selected Papers from the Construction Research Congress 2018||2018||Conference article (CA)||General contractors (GCs) in the United States increasingly use building information modeling (BIM) in all phases of a construction project. Especially for the preconstruction phase, GCs aim to leverage BIM capabilities for quantity takeoff and cost estimation, also known as model-based estimating (MBE), to address the current gap between a project's design and budget. However, the effectiveness of MBE has been limited mainly due to a lack of established MBE best practices and a lack of integration between design and estimation processes. This paper will report on an applied research project conducted by the research team for a large general contractor to develop a standard workflow and a collaboration framework to support the MBE in the preconstruction phase. For this purpose, the research team examined the benefits and challenges of current MBE practices and set criteria for selecting an appropriate workflow and toolset that fit project requirements. The main outcome of the research is a MBE workflow that explains the general process of model-based estimating, required activities, and suggested toolsets for successful implementation of MBE. In addition, this research presents a collaboration framework for owners, designers, and contractors that includes team members' roles and responsibilities and a guide for integrating design and estimating processes. The results of this research help project teams to benefit from MBE-supported collaboration partnership, leading to efficient and accurate quantity takeoff and cost estimation in the early design stages, on-time value engineering, and effective management of design and cost changes.||building management systems - civil engineering computing - construction industry - groupware - project management - structural engineering computing - value engineering||collaboration framework - preconstruction phase - research team - current MBE practices - appropriate workflow - toolset - fit project requirements - MBE workflow - general process - estimating processes - research help project teams - collaboration partnership - accurate quantity takeoff - cost estimation - early design stages - general contractor - United States increasingly - information modeling - construction project - GCs aim - leverage BIM capabilities - current gap - established MBE - estimation processes - applied research project| |Economic feasibility analysis of photovoltaic systems using Bayesian networks||Shakouri, M.(1); Hyun Woo Lee(2)||Construction Research Congress 2018. Sustainable Design and Construction and Education. Selected Papers from the Construction Research Congress 2018||2018||Conference article (CA)||The economic viability of photovoltaic (PV) systems is subject to spatial and temporal uncertainties that can pose significant financial risks to the investors of such systems. This paper presents a decision-making model using Bayesian networks to assess the economic viability of PV systems, by considering the inherent spatial and temporal uncertainties and their impacts on the annual electricity generation of a PV system. The application of the proposed model is shown in a 6.5 kWh PV system installed on a house located in Corvallis, OR. Results show that by using the Bayesian networks, the probability of different states of electricity generation can be estimated and used for quantitative decision making. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate how the key factors in the PV system can affect the annual electricity generation. The proposed model contributes to the body of knowledge in the valuation of renewable energy investments through the application of Bayesian networks. It is expected that the proposed model can help investors in PV systems make scientific and informed decisions.||Bayes methods - decision making - investment - photovoltaic power systems - power generation economics - renewable energy sources - sensitivity analysis||Bayesian networks - economic feasibility analysis - photovoltaic systems - economic viability - temporal uncertainties - inherent spatial uncertainties - annual electricity generation - renewable energy investments - sensitivity analysis - PV system - decision-making model| |Impact of Project Integration Zhu(1); Hyun Woo Lee(1); Dossick, C.S.(1)||Construction Research Congress 2018. Construction Project Management. Selected Papers from the Construction Research Congress 2018||2018||Conference article (CA)||Model-based estimating (MBE) has become more common in recent years with many seeking to capture the potential of building information modeling (BIM) in the construction industry. However, MBE is neither utilized as widely as expected nor implemented as efficiently as it could be in current industry practice. Previous studies attributed this to a low level of model sharing and lack of required information in models largely due to lack of integration between design and construction and the absence of effective communication among project participants. Thus, the cooperation between two major project participants, namely designing team and general contractor, appears to be a crucial factor in determining the level of utilization of MBE. However, there has been little to no study specifically aimed at investigating cooperation that is required for MBE. In response, the present study targets to test a hypothesis that a correlation exists between the level of project integration and the level of MBE implementation. This study uses an online survey as a main research methodology to collect responses from industry practitioners, and a statistical analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis. The study results will support project teams in devising ways to improve the level of MBE implementation for future projects.||construction industry - design engineering - project management - statistical analysis||project integration - construction industry - design - building information modeling - model-based estimating - BIM| |Improving safety in solar installations through prevention through design||Chung Ho(1); Hyun Woo Lee(1); Gambatese, J.A.(2)||Construction Research Congress 2018. Safety and Disaster Management||2018||Conference article (CA)||The U.S. solar industry has seen a drastic increase in solar systems installed on residential buildings due to the reduced payback periods in recent years. Most solar installations happen on the rooftops of existing houses, creating unique worker safety hazards associated with the existing roof conditions and panel installations. Prevention through design (PtD) has been developed as a proactive method to eliminate safety hazards during the design process. However, no identified study has investigated how PtD can be applied to improve safety in solar panel installations. The objective of this research is to fill this knowledge gap by investigating how, during the process to design the solar panel installations, to address safety concerns in solar system installations for small residential buildings by applying the concept of PtD. Based on a number of interviews and four case studies, this study led to the identification of seven PtD attributes and the development of a safety design protocol that small solar contractors can employ to improve their safety practices. This paper presents the research activities and the PtD attributes that the research team has identified including roof materials, roof slopes, roof accessories, panel layouts, fall protection systems, lifting methods, and electrical systems. The research will provide a valuable contribution to the effort to prevent safety hazards though PtD and improve safety practices in solar installations.||accident prevention - building integrated photovoltaics - buildings (structures) - construction industry - design engineering - hazards - industrial accidents - occupational health - occupational safety - roofs - safety||safety concerns - solar panel installations - design process - existing roof conditions - unique worker safety hazards - solar systems - solar industry - prevention - improving safety - solar installations - safety practices - solar contractors - safety design protocol - seven PtD attributes - residential buildings - solar system installations| |The USA PPP payment mechanisms: a comparison to the canadian PPP systems||Luming Shang(1); Aziz, A.A.(1)||Construction Research Congress 2018. Infrastructure and Facility Management||2018||Conference article (CA)||Over the years, PPPs in the USA have used different types of payments to compensate project developers. In the past decades, the dominant type was toll payment. Availability payments started to gain more popularity with performance-based PPP contracts. Internationally, some other payment types are also used in PPPs, such as operation and maintenance payment, safety payment, satisfaction payment, and end of term payment. A payment mechanism is a package that includes a set of payment type(s), performance measures, performance specifications, and penalties for not meeting the specifications. Since PPP payment mechanisms, other than toll payments, is new in the USA, it is not clear whether payment mechanisms as used in the USA projects would be similar to those used in the PPP international market regarding the payment types, payment structure, performance measures and specifications, penalties, and deduction schemes. This research investigated the payment mechanisms in transportation PPP projects in the USA and Canada. Comparative and content analyses of project agreements are used as research methods. The findings show that PPP projects in the USA tend to have payment mechanisms of fewer payment types, less sophisticated payment calculations, and less complex deduction schemes. Public agencies would use the outcome of this research to revisit and improve the design of payment mechanisms of their PPP projects.||contracts - organisational aspects - project management - public administration||public agencies - payment types - sophisticated payment calculations - PPP projects - payment structure - payment mechanism - satisfaction payment - safety payment - maintenance payment - payment type - availability payments - toll payment - USA PPP payment mechanisms| |A hybrid simulation approach for understanding the social contagion effect of safety violations within the construction crew||Huakang Liang(1); Ken-Yu Lin(2)||Computing in Civil Engineering 2019. Visualization, Information Modeling, and Simulation||2019||Conference article (CA)||Previous studies have recognized the social factor of safety violation within the construction crew. However, discussion on the social contagion effect of safety violation is still sparse. Therefore, this research aims to develop a hybrid simulation approach for looking into the cognitive, social, and organizational aspects that can altogether determine the social contagion effect of safety violations within the construction crew. The hybrid approach integrates system dynamics (SD) and agent-based modeling (ABM) to better represent the real world. SD is used to capture the systematic level dynamics such as the influence of perceived production pressure. ABM is employed to mimic the decision rules and interactions among the worker and management. The research contributes to providing a practical framework to examine how specific accident prevention measures (e.g., setting the safety goal) interacting with worker or environmental characteristics (e.g., the hazard level) influence the social contagion effect of safety violations. Our findings show that different interventions should be taken for situational and routine safety violations. Our model can also serve as a test-bed to evaluate different safety programs or strategies by considering the social contagion effect of safety violations.||accident prevention - construction industry - decision making - hazards - multi-agent systems - organisational aspects - personnel - safety||hybrid simulation approach - social contagion effect - safety violation - construction crew - social factor - situational safety violations - routine safety violations| |Automating the digital fabrication of concrete formwork Civil Engineering 2019.

The specific objectives are to (1) present a detailed workflow from the design phase of formwork to the fabrication phase, and (2) develop automated procedures to support the workflow without extensive manual intervention. This workflow integrates virtual design and construction (VDC), trade coordination, parametric modeling, software customization, tool path development, and CNC routing in order to produce precise prefabricated formwork components. To test and validate the workflow, the authors conducted a case study for the prefabrication of concrete edge formworks in a 26-story post-tensioned castin-place concrete structure. The case study shows that the use of the workflow for CNC machines supports craftsmanship to improve labor productivity, safety, and fabrication quality. The results demonstrate the advantages of using this workflow over the traditional approach to support project teams' productivity and enable them to make informed decisions for their implementation of digital fabrication.||buildings (structures) - computerised numerical control - concrete - construction - construction industry - design engineering - production engineering computing - productivity - project management - structural engineering||digital fabrication - concrete formwork - transforming design - digital technologies - design-to-fabrication workflow - construction projects - digital models - formwork fabrication - detailed workflow - fabrication phase - virtual design - precise prefabricated formwork components - case study - concrete edge formworks - 26-story post-tensioned castin-place concrete structure - fabrication quality - project teams| |Historical Accident and Injury in Civil Engineering 2019. Data, Sensing, and Analytics. Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2019||2019||Conference article (CA)||Construction safety has always been one of critical concerns in the construction industry with diverse approaches and technology for consistently managing safety hazard issues being examined and adopted. However, the current technology such as a vision-based approach does not appear to fully support consistent and robust safety monitoring because of its heavy-data processing and inherent restrictions including limited angle coverage and view detectability. A vulnerable construction environment requires an advanced safety surveillance and event detection approach. To provide a supplement safety monitoring method, this project has an objective to establish an audio-based autonomous safety surveillance system with alarming prenotifications and map visualization based on identified work activities and potential safety issues. This proposed system adopts a schedule-based sound data training method and incorporates historical occupational injury and illness manual data with classified sources and events of accidents in each construction activity. The injury data are informed by a daily project schedule to link potential safety hazard to daily planned work activities. By applying a machine learning technique, the system accurately categorizes a sound type according to sound training data scope-downed by project schedule and safety data and provides pre-warnings in accordance with any detected irregular events. The system is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge for safety monitoring and provide the potential to be integrated into a robust automated safety surveillance system with occupational accident data and significantly improving construction activities classification accuracy.||accident prevention - construction industry - hazards - learning (artificial intelligence) - occupational safety - video surveillance||safety data - robust automated safety surveillance system - occupational accident data - construction activities classification accuracy - irregular events - sound training data scope - daily planned work activities - potential safety hazard - daily project schedule - injury data - construction activity - classified sources - illness manual data - historical occupational injury - schedule-based sound data training method - potential safety issues - autonomous safety surveillance system - supplement safety monitoring method - event detection approach - advanced safety surveillance - vulnerable construction environment - view detectability - angle coverage - heavy-data processing - robust safety monitoring - consistent safety monitoring - vision-based approach - safety hazard issues - construction industry - construction safety| |Multi-objective optimization of process design using process-based sustainable impact analysis||El-Anwar, Omar(1); Kim, Yong-Woo(1)||EG-ICE 2010 - 17th International Workshop on Intelligent Computing in Engineering||2019||Conference article (CA)||Process design in material supply systems requires careful analysis from the process manager in order to optimize important variables, such as the number of assembly areas and their locations. Decisions on these critical variables can have significant impacts on multiple objectives, including minimizing project cost and adverse environmental impacts. The objective of this paper is to present the development of a robust methodology to optimize process design in logistics of material supply systems. This methodology incorporates (1) cost and environmental impact assessment models that utilize process-based assessment (Activity-Based Costing and Process-Based Life-Cycle Analysis); and (2) a multi-objective optimization model that utilizes Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms II (NSGA2). The presented models in this paper focuses on optimizing decisions related to the process design of prefabricated rebar supply systems for construction projects with space constraints. The developed models are capable of minimizing (1) the logistics costs; and (2) the associated environmental impacts.

Data, Sensing, and Analytics. Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2019||2019||Conference article (CA)||Posture quantification is important in biomechanical analysis of loadings of workers' trunk and upper extremities in studying back/neck/shoulder musculoskeletal disorders caused by laborintensive construction activities. This study demonstrates the reliability and validity of a posturematching method using inertial measurement unit (IMU) tracking system. A commercial IMUbased motion capture system was used to obtain upper extremity and trunk joint angles. Observers wore IMU sensors and mimicked prescribed distinct work postures shown on a screen; then joint angles were obtained by the IMU sensors. A reliability test and the root-mean square difference indicated that the posture-matching method was reliable in estimating certain joint angles such as upper arm flexion/extension but unreliable in estimating upper arm rotation and wrist ulnar/radial deviation. The reliability and validity were affected by the body part, joint angle range, observers' perception while mimicking and matching postures, angle of the camera captured the worker's posture, and errors from IMU sensors.||biomechanics - biomedical measurement - medical disorders - patient rehabilitation||neck musculoskeletal disorders - back musculoskeletal disorders - shoulder musculoskeletal disorders - commercial IMU-based motion capture system - upper arm extension - upper arm flexion - upper arm rotation - posture-matching method - IMU sensors - trunk joint angles - inertial measurement unit tracking system - posture quantification - inertial measurement unit-based motion - posture matching method| |A Critical Review of Visual Aid Implementation in Lean Construction Scheduling Process||Pratama, L.A.(1); Dossick, C.S.(2)||Construction Research Congress 2020 - Project Management and Controls, Materials, and Contracts. Selected Papers from the Construction, Research Congress 2020||2020||Conference article (CA)||One of the recent advances in the construction industry is the virtualization/digital representation of information. Building information modeling (BIM), which has been adopted over the past 20 years, enables the integration of data into the design and construction. This technology is deemed capable of facilitating better collaboration between different project stakeholders. One of its functions is to serve as a visual aid for the team members in decision making. However, not all types of BIM are appropriately used in certain practices. This study looks at lean construction scheduling where BIM may be used differently because of the last planner system. The last planner system facilitates short term planning by allowing project team members to elaborate on their tasks in greater detail so that the team can identify potential constraints on project execution. The lack of visual reference, especially one that provides a logic sequence that is important during the planning, might help project stakeholders discover issues. However, the conventional schedule methods with 4D BIM are typically developed based on a CPM schedule where the detailed schedule is determined early by a schedule. Consequently, 4D BIM practices and the last planner scheduling techniques are not yet compatible. This study provides an analysis of current research trends around the topic of visualization in lean construction project scheduling. Findings indicated that existing publications tend to focus on the technology instead of the underlying communication theory between project participants. From the technology side, this study is limited to studying the utilization of emerging technologies such as BIM. Thus, several suggestions were made on how emerging technology can be implemented in certain aspects of a lean project.||building information modelling - construction industry - data integration - data visualisation - decision making - lean production - planning - project management - scheduling - virtualisation||communication theory - visualization - planner scheduling - logic sequence - decision making - data integration - building information modeling - digital representation - virtualization - lean construction scheduling - visual reference - project execution - project team members - short term planning - planner system - project stakeholders - information modeling - construction industry - visual aid - lean project - lean construction project scheduling - CPM schedule - 4D BIM| |Assessing Worker Yellapragada, M.(1); 2020 - Safety, Workforce, and Education||2020||Conference article (CA)||Increase in chronic diseases amongst the U.S. workforce results in reduced productivity and increased medical care costs. The shortage of manpower against the growing demand has also forced many workers to work overtime multiple days a week. It is therefore important to study and understand a worker's health holistically, considering not only physical health but also mental health, work-life balance, stress, and safety. Total worker health takes factors relating to geography, industry, workload, family, travel time, etc. into consideration and thus, is a comprehensive approach to interpret worker health and well-being. This paper aims to study the total worker health of the people employed in the construction industry. An anonymous survey was conducted with worker participants from various construction trades in Seattle, the crane capital of America in 2018. Analysis of the survey results highlighted aspects that could impact total worker health in construction. One of our findings indicated that workers who put in the most physical effort had trouble sleeping at night. The physical demand and pace of work also seemed to be the contributing factors to troubled sleep. Age of the workers was found to play an important role in the commuting patterns and one's ability to maintain a work-life balance. We consider this preliminary understanding of the important aspects key to designing sensible measurements (e.g., well-being index) as well as strategic interventions to promote the well-being of construction workers and facilitate a positive work environment for the industry.||construction industry - diseases - employee welfare - health and safety - health care - labour resources - occupational health - occupational safety - personnel||Seattle - chronic diseases - worker health assessment - US workforce - construction workers - physical demand - worker participants - work-life balance| |Data Requirements C.S.(2)||Construction Research Congress 2020 - Computer Applications||2020||Conference article (CA)||Rapid development of technologies like building information modeling (BIM) and internet of things (IoT) has provided new tools and methods to facility owners for more effective asset management during the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase. However, many owners face a challenge to identify and address needed technical and organizational transformations to fully leverage new technologies. This paper reports on a series of workshops facilitated by the authors to discover key elements in developing standards and processes for data-driven asset management systems (AMS). For this applied research, the authors worked with six large public owners (including army, educational, transit, and seaport/airport facility owners) to analyze effectiveness of their current AMS, taxonomy and structure of their AMS database including asset's types, attributes, and specifications, as well as their means and methods for collaboration with designers and contractors to create reliable data required for O&M activities. The outcomes of this research are a standard framework for identifying and addressing data requirements for effective assets life-cycle management, as well as lessons learned from peer organizations' experiences and practices for integrating new technologies into asset management. The findings of this research will also help researchers in the academia to better understand the real-world constraints and requirements the AECO industry encounters to incorporate innovative research-based solutions into the existing practices.||asset management - building information modelling - building management systems - construction industry - data analysis - innovation management - Internet of Things - maintenance engineering - organisational aspects - standards||AECO industry - standards development - O&M - operation and maintenance phase - IoT - building information modeling - AMS database - innovative research-based solutions - life-cycle management - data-driven asset management systems - organizational transformations - technical transformations - asset management - Internet of Things - BIM| |Measurements and Verification (M&V) Guidelines C.(1); Kim, A.(1); Dossick, C.S.(2)||Construction Research Congress 2020 - Project Management and Controls, Materials, and Contracts. Selected Papers from the Construction, Research Congress 2020||2020||Conference article (CA)||Weatherization Plus Health (Wx+H), a pilot program introduced by the Washington State Department of Commerce, has proposed a new scope to improve the indoor environment quality (IEQ) for low-income housing residents-one that extends beyond energy benefits. Typical interventions include the distribution of green cleaning kits, walk-off mats, ventilation system upgrades, and resident education, among other elements. Wx+H experts are working to capture the long-term impact of these combined measures to assess the program's potential. Although guidelines and best practices exist to measure and verify the impacts and influences of energy conservation, these indicators do not holistically incorporate occupant satisfaction and perceptions regarding health benefits in the context of low-income housing. This paper presents a preliminary literature review that summarizes measurements and verifications (M&V) schemes applicable to the residential sector from two major standards: ASHRAE Guideline 14 and the international performance measurement and verification protocol. Additionally, reports from the Washington State Commerce Department were analyzed to identify procedures and factors that might influence M&V schemes as applied by Washington State who are leading health and energy programs.

Traditional techniques to evaluate worker stress (e.g., self-assessment and observational checklists) may not be effective in the field because of their potential to interrupt workers' ongoing tasks. Additionally, these methods are subject to biases. Research in neuroscience confirms that the human brain responds to various stressors, so studying patterns of brainwave activity can lead to strong assessments of subjects' stress. The authors' earlier research has monitored worker stress using a wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headset by applying supervised learning algorithms in a binary stress level (i.e., low and high). Despite the success of earlier work identifying excessive stress, there is a gap in knowledge in assessing medium-level stresses. It has been proven that intermittent exposure to medium-level stress decreases not only performance but also concentration and focus. This research attempts to identify multiple levels of worker stress using signals recorded from a wearable EEG headset by applying two supervised learning algorithms, multi-class support vector machines (SVM) and fully connected neural network (FCNN). A stress-related hormone, cortisol, was used as a baseline to label subjects' stress levels. In classifying three levels of stress, the FCNN yielded a prediction accuracy of 79.26%, which is competitive with previous EEG-based stress recognition methods in a binary setting. This research should help in identifying multiple levels of stress at construction sites and aid early detection and mitigation of high stress in the field.||construction industry - electroencephalography - learning (artificial intelligence) - medical signal processing - neural nets - occupational stress - support vector machines||multilevel assessment - occupational stress - wearable EEG headset - worker stress - interrupt workers - strong assessments - subjects - authors - wearable electroencephalography headset - supervised learning algorithms - binary stress level - excessive stress - medium-level stress - stress-related hormone - previous EEG-based stress recognition methods| |Overcoming Physical Obstacles with Four-Wheeled Hand Carts: An for the Commercial Roofing Trade||Zhenyu Zhang(1); Ken-Yu Lin(1)||Construction Research Congress 2020 - Safety, Workforce, and Education||2020||Conference article (CA)||Hand carts are used in nearly every construction trade for material handling. Nonetheless, the use of carts can be strenuous and lead to musculoskeletal injuries. This is particularly the case when carts are used in hazardous working conditions, such as physical obstacles and ramps. Unfortunately, little is known so far about the effects of these physical environmental hazards on cart operations. This study aims at understanding the operating forces required to overcome physical obstacles with a type of four-wheel carts commonly used in the commercial roofing trade. We varied obstacle heights, load weights, space constraints, and tire types in the laboratory experiment to reveal how hazardous an obstacle will be under different working circumstances commonly seen on construction sites. The space constraint is identified to be the most significant factor that determines the operating forces required to surmount an obstacle. This finding suggests the necessity of optimizing workplace layout to refrain workers from overcoming obstacles in a constrained space where the travel distance from cart to obstacle is less than 61 cm. An obstacle begins to yield noticeable impeding effect when it is higher than 3.8 cm, and any obstacle less than this threshold is not very hazardous especially when no space constraint is present. In addition, we found that pneumatic (air-filled rubber) tires are more favorable over solid (polyurethane foam-filled rubber) tires in overcoming obstacles and thus can be a convenient solution if it is infeasible to eliminate obstacles. The research findings can be used as reference information to develop numerical standards for manual cart handling, such as safe load restrictions and operating techniques, to increase ergonomics awareness and prevent musculoskeletal injuries in construction.||ergonomics - materials handling - occupational health - personnel - rubber - tyres - wheels||manual cart handling - overcoming obstacles - space constraint - varied obstacle heights - four-wheel carts - operating forces - cart operations - physical environmental hazards - hazardous working conditions - construction trade - commercial roofing trade - evidence-based ergonomics guideline - four-wheeled hand carts - physical obstacles - size 61.0 cm - size 3.8 cm| |PPPs for Healthcare Facilities in British Columbia: A Preliminary Analysis||Aziz, A.A.(1); Wenjie Shu(1)||Construction Research Congress 2020 - Project Management and Controls, Materials, and Contracts.

New delivery systems are being investigated to fulfill this need. This research explores how public-private partnerships (PPP) have been used for the development of health care facilities in British Columbia (BC), Canada. BC is known for its significant experience with PPP. The analysis covers the procurement process, risk management, payment mechanism, and performance-based criteria. Using a case study approach, the work was done using content analysis of nine project agreements. It is concluded that for the success of using PPP in healthcare facilities certain issues need to be maintained including, clear vision and objectives of the public owner before preparing the procurement and the agreements, fair and competitive procurement process, good understanding of the typical risks associated with PPP in healthcare and their proper allocation, and the use of performance-based payment mechanism to ensure the quality of the services and the achievement of owner's objectives. The work should provide insights to healthcare facilities in other jurisdictions on how to implement PPP in healthcare facilities.||health care - organisational aspects - procurement - project management - public administration - risk management||competitive procurement process - PPP - performance-based payment mechanism - British Columbia - high-quality-service health care facilities - public-private partnerships - content analysis - public owner - fair procurement - public health care agencies - delivery systems - Canada - risk management - performance-based criteria - project agreements| |Recognition of Construction Workers' Physical Fatigue Based on Gait Patterns Driven from Three-Axis 2020 - Safety, Workforce, and Education||2020||Conference article (CA)||The construction industry is among the most hazardous industries in the United States, associated with a high number of accidents. Workers' fatigue has been recognized as one of the four major causes of fatal incidents in this industry. Therefore, early identification of workers' fatigue in a project could support accident prevention. To this end, the objective of the present study is to develop a framework to detect workers' fatigue by examining their gait patterns measured by a three-axis accelerometer embedded in a smartphone. The application of accelerometer sensors in a smartphone is useful because it can record gait-pattern data at the construction site (not just limited just to a controlled environment). To achieve this objective, five construction workers were asked to participate in this study by recording their gait patterns before and after a fatigue-inducing exercise. Related time features were extracted and selected to train the classifier. Finally, supervised-learning algorithms [e.g., linear and nonlinear support vector machines (SVM)] were adopted to detect workers' fatigue in different working conditions. The study results indicate that workers' fatigue was detected at an accuracy of 87.93% and 82.75% using the linear and nonlinear SVMs, respectively. It is expected that these findings will provide useful guidelines for early prediction of physical fatigue and therefore enable project managers to make informed decisions in improving worker safety.||accelerometers - accident prevention - construction industry - gait analysis - learning (artificial intelligence) - occupational safety - pattern classification - support vector machines||construction workers - gait patterns driven - three-axis accelerometer embedded - smartphone - construction industry - gait-pattern data - fatigue-inducing exercise - physical fatigue - worker safety| |Social equity of clean energy policies in electric-vehicle charging infrastructure systems||Yohan Min(1); Hyun Woo Lee(1)||Construction Research Congress 2020 - Infrastructure Systems and Sustainability. Selected Papers from the Construction Research Congress 2020||2020||Conference article (CA)||The recent climate change has led to the development of various clean energy polices and technologies. As a result, the current rapid transition of energy systems due to the development, has the potential to significantly impact on how communities respond to any undesirable climate-related events. However, `energy divide' (inequalities in access to energy services), would be the result of uneven distribution of the clean energy technologies. Empirical analyses of residential electric vehicle (EV) chargers in Seattle, WA, revealed that (1) there is a clustered pattern in the distribution of the EV charger installations, (2) housing stability and economic status explain the uneven distribution, and (3) some neighbors are more sensitive to the economic status and housing stability in terms of residential EV charger installations. The study results revealed social equity issues based on the uneven distribution, i.e., certain communities are underserved for the clean energy technologies. The study results will help policy makers to better support any underserved communities (e.g., those who rent houses and have less finance for EV and charger) under limited resources by devising equitable incentive distributions in response to clean energy technologies.||electric vehicle charging - electric vehicles - environmental factors - government policies - power system economics||clean energy policies - electric-vehicle charging infrastructure systems - energy services - uneven energy distribution - housing stability - WA - Seattle - climate change - social equity issues - economic status - residential electric vehicle chargers - clean energy technologies| |The Cost-Effectiveness of Congress 2020 - Computer Applications||2020||Conference article (CA)||Digital fabrication has significant potential to support concrete formwork in the construction industry. While previous studies have been done on digital fabrication in construction, few empirical investigations have taken into account the cost-effectiveness of digital fabrication, which is a crucial factor. Currently, the percevied high initial cost of digital fabrication equipment makes companies reluctant to change their traditional approach. To address this knowledge gap, this study aims to determine the financial benefits of using digital technology in fabrication. Specifically, the study focuses on the use of a computer-numerical controlled (CNC) machine that can be used to automate formwork fabrication. To examine the cost-effectiveness of using a CNC machine for concrete formworks, a case study was carried out based on the prefabrication of edge formwork for a 26-story post-tensioned, cast-in-place structure. The study results indicate that the use of a CNC machine for formwork fabrication could help substantially improve labor productivity, fabrication quality, and worker safety, each of which led to a significant cost saving in the project. The study results provide evidence of the advantages of digital fabricatoin over the traditional approach and support project teams to make informed decisions when implementing digital fabrication.||buildings (structures) - computerised numerical control - concrete - construction components - construction industry - costing - occupational safety - product quality - production engineering computing - productivity - structural engineering||cost-effectiveness - concrete formwork - digital fabrication equipment - digital technology - computer-numerical controlled machine - CNC machine - fabrication quality - cost saving - construction industry - financial benefits - post-tensioned structure - cast-in-place structure - labor productivity - worker safety| |Messy work in virtual worlds: exploring discovery and synthesis in virtual teams||Dossick, Carrie Sturts(1)||Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)||2014||Journal Article||The challenges of engineering team collaboration\u2014establishing trust, fostering productive informal communication, cultivating knowledge exchange\u2014are often exacerbated in virtual teams by geographical separation as well as team members' cultural and linguistic differences. Researchers have observed that powerful collaboration in collocated teams is supported by shared visualizations with which the team engages in informal, flexible and active ways. In studying virtual team interactions in a virtual world known as the CyberGRID, we see that just as with AEC collocated teams, shared visualizations were instrumental for the teams as they define, understand, and generate knowledge when working on interrelated tasks. Emerging from this analysis is an empirically supported theory that while avatar-model interaction supports mutual discovery, more messy interactions of brainstorming, knowledge exchange and synthesis requires flexible, active, and informal shared visualizations. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.||Communication - Flow visualization - Information technology - Knowledge management - Visualization||Building Information Model - BIM - Collaboration - Geographical separation - Global virtual teams - Informal communication - Linguistic differences - Virtual team interactions - Virtual worlds| |Research methods associated with situational simulations in construction||Mukherjee, Amlan(1); Onder, Nilufer(2); Rojas, Eddy M.(3)||Building a Sustainable Future - Proceedings of the 2009 Construction Research Congress||2009||Conference article (CA)||Situational simulations create temporally dynamic clinical exercises of construction project scenarios that expose participants to rapidly unfolding events and the pressures of decision-making. They further construction research and education, by providing an interactive simulation platform that can be used to explore \"what-if\" construction scenarios, estimate risks and contingencies, test alternative plans during construction, and support the capture and analysis of real-time project data to support expert decision-making. The design, development, and use of situational simulations calls upon an inter-disciplinary approach which includes methodologies that are rooted in modeling of discrete event systems, intelligent planning, statistical data mining and cognitive psychology. We trace the development of two related situational simulation systems, the Virtual Coach and the Interactive Construction Decision-Making Aid (ICDMA) that have been developed by research groups at University of Washington and Michigan Tech. with technical support from industry. Over the last five years, the simulations have significantly evolved in their abilities to represent and reason about construction projects, as tools that enhance construction education and as experimental test beds that can be used to study construction decision-making.

Using a multi-method study of comparative case studies and triangulation interviews, we have observed two building projects over an eight-month period, interviewed architects, engineers, general contractors and subcontractors, and we are able to create generalizable grounded theory about technology-supported collaboration. This rich ethnographic data enables the analysis of the ramifications of the existing frameworks of standards of practice and occupational boundaries for collaboration, and allowed us to identify the potential of new technology to change these frameworks. Technology is always embedded in a social context, and its successful adoption depends upon that context. Some in the building design and construction industry are pushing for new technological advancements along side collaborative delivery methods, but there remain a number of organizational questions that must be addressed, particularly in how to engage second and third tier consultants, suppliers and subcontractors who are not part of the primary architect-owner-contractor agreements.

Considerable literature has been published that describes the roles of the owner and designer, but little research has been published on the role of the constructor. To identify issues relative to the constructor's role, a study was undertaken to assess past experiences of builders that have undertaken LEED-certified projects. Contractors who built 22 projects in ten states were surveyed to determine their experiences. From the survey results, the trends, best practices, and lessons learned were compiled and evaluated. The study results indicated that integrated project delivery methods were more conducive to the delivery of LEED-certified projects than was a design-bid-build approach. Through analysis of the data collected, a four-step guide was developed that can be used by constructors who are considering working on LEED-certified projects.

However, it is not always easy to perform these activities since numerous individuals and parties are involved in a typical project. This is where visual representations may be helpful. Several charts and diagrams have been traditionally used in construction to visually track performance. This paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of traditional visual representations such as bar charts, network diagrams, line of balance charts, and S-curve graphs, and introduces a set of design principles for the development of non-traditional visual representations to effectively monitor project performance. The paper closes with examples of new visualization schemes built according to those principles. \u00a9 ASCE 2009.||Construction - Graphic methods - Production control||Bar chart - Design Principles - Line of balances - Network diagrams - Non-traditional - Project managers - Project performance - Visual representations| |Construction of engineering domain ontology through extraction of knowledge from domain handbooks||Lin, Hsien-Tang(1); Hsieh, Shang-Hsien(1,2); Chou, Kuang-Wu(2); Lin, Ken-Yu(3)||Proceedings of the 2009 ASCE International Workshop on Computing in Civil Engineering||2009||Conference article (CA)||Domain ontology, encompassing both concepts and entities, along with their relations and properties, is a new medium for the storage and propagation of domain specific knowledge. For all of its associated advantages, a great deal of effort must still be expended during ontology construction, including collecting the domain-related vocabularies, developing the domain concept hierarchy, defining the properties of each concept and relationships between concepts. In recent years, several engineering handbooks have described detailed domain knowledge via organization into categories, sections, and chapters with indices in the appendix. In this paper, an approach is proposed with a view to extracting concepts, entities, properties and relationships from a handbook of a specific domain. The extracted information can then be reorganized and converted into OWL (Web Ontology Language) format to represent the domain ontology. The generation of an earthquake engineering ontology from an Earthquake Engineering Handbook is used to illustrate the proposed approach. \u00a9 2009 ASCE.||Birds - Computer aided engineering - Earthquake engineering - Engineering geology - Geophysics - Ontology||Domain concepts - Domain knowledge - Domain ontologies - Domain-specific knowledge - Engineering domains - Extracting concept - Ontology construction - Web ontology language| H.(2)||Construction Research Congress 2010: Innovation for Reshaping Construction Practice - Proceedings of the 2010 Construction Research Congress||2010||Conference article (CA)||There has been a significant increase in natural disasters that have negatively affected the U.S. economy in recent decades. The Government Accountability Office reported that the U.S. is not well prepared to manage large-scale natural disasters either through emergency response or financial relief. It is essential to develop integrated post-disaster investment strategies that avoid many of the pitfalls that have been observed following recent catastrophic events. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to build theoretical foundation and demonstrate technologies for creating a decision support system for optimizing stakeholders' resource allocation in natural hazards. The proposed framework will: (1) minimize the total costs associated with implementing such investment strategies and (2) maximize the uniformity of welfare distribution among all associated parties. This would provide broad members of the emergency management community as well as policy makers with easy-to-use preparedness and decision support tool, which would help in creating better societal financial resilience towards natural hazards.

One of the main objectives of these programs is to provide quick and permanent housing solutions to displaced families. Decisions on alternative housing should be carefully analyzed because of their significant impacts on (1) socioeconomic welfare of displaced families; and (2) available budgets for post-disaster housing recovery. This paper presents the development of an optimization model capable of identifying the optimal alternative housing plans that maximizes the net social benefits of these programs. This is achieved by striking a balance between the added social benefits to displaced families provided by alternative housing and the corresponding associated costs. An application example is analyzed to demonstrate the use of the proposed model and its capabilities in maximizing net social benefits.

Accordingly, governments adopt various intervention strategies to replace or upgrade these slums. However, implementing these strategies is often faced by several planning and constructability challenges, because the slums areas that should be upgraded (1) are already occupied by resident families; and (2) are often characterized by unplanned and extremely crowded transportation networks. Accordingly, the construction period of these upgrade projects can result in significant social disruption to resident families and requires protracted timelines and additional budgets. The objective of this paper is to present a multi-objective optimization model that is capable of accelerating the delivery of urgent redevelopments while minimizing construction costs and socioeconomic disruptions to slum dwellers. An application example is presented to demonstrate the model capabilities and is followed by a discussion of formulation challenges. \u00a9 2011 ASCE.||Automation - Budget control - Multiobjective optimization - Planning - Project management||Application examples - Collaborative framework - Construction management - Construction planning - Implementation phasis - Intervention strategy - Multi-objective optimization models - Transportation network| |Preparing for a new madrid earthquake: Accelerating and optimizing temporary housing decisions for shelby County, TN||El-Anwar, Omar(1); El-Rayes, Khaled(2); Elnashai, Amr(2)||Congress on Computing in Civil Engineering, Proceedings||2011||Conference article (CA)||In the early 1800s Central USA has experienced some of the strongest earthquake ground motions observed nationwide. A recurrence of these earthquakes would cause significant social and economic impacts affecting the lives of millions of residents. For instance, it is estimated that more than 60,000 families will need temporary housing assistance in Shelby County, TN, alone. Identifying temporary housing solutions for these families will be a challenging task, especially with the need for quick decisions. The objective of this paper is to present a case study that illustrates the use of automated multi-objective optimization in identifying optimal large-scale temporary housing plans for displaced families in Shelby County. These optimal plans have the potential to (1) minimize social and economic disruptions for displaced families; (2) maximize housing safety in the presence of a large number of potential post-disaster hazards; (3) minimize negative environmental impacts; and (4) minimize total public expenditures. \u00a9 2011 ASCE.||Economic and social effects - Emergency services - Environmental impact - Housing - Multiobjective optimization||Earthquake ground motions - Optimal plan - Post disasters - Public expenditures - Social and economic impacts - Tennessee| |Using the workforce's physiological strain monitoring Amelia(1); Migliaccio, Giovanni C.(2); Bogus, Susan M.(1)||ICSDC 2011: Integrating Sustainability Practices in the Construction Industry - Proceedings of the International Conference on Sustainable Design and Construction 2011||2012||Conference article (CA)||Construction safety is a critical component of social sustainability, since it considers the health and welfare of construction workers. Construction activities are generally physically demanding and performed in harsh environments. Anecdotal evidence suggests that physical strain may lead to accidents and injuries. Moreover, excessive physical strain can increase the risk of developing musculoskeletal or cardiovascular disorders. Thus, physical strain may deeply affect workforce's wellbeing in the short and long term. Therefore, a monitoring system that is able to assess workers' physical strain may be an important step to enhance social sustainability of construction. Recently-introduced Physiological Status Monitors (PSMs) have overcome the past limitations allowing physical strain to be monitored without hinders workers' activities. Three commercially-available PSMs have been selected and a testing protocol has been developed to assess PSMs' reliability in monitoring construction workforce during dynamic activities. The selected PSMs are presented along with initial results that confirm that recent advances in wireless telemetry and sensing technology can potentially affect construction sustainability. \u00a9 2012 ASCE.||Accident prevention - Construction industry - Monitoring - Personnel - Physiology - Project management - Safety engineering||Anecdotal evidences - Construction activities - Construction management - Construction workers - Monitoring construction - Physiological status monitors - Physiological strains - Social sustainability| |Construction to operations exchange: Challenges of implementing COBie and in a large organization||Anderson, Anne(1); Dossick, Carrie Sturts(3); Neff, Gina(4)||Construction Research Congress 2012: Construction Challenges in a Flat World, Proceedings of the 2012 Construction Research Congress||2012||Conference article (CA)||Despite the transition from paper to digital media, hand-off of data and documents from construction to operations and facilities management is still cumbersome and often requires manual entry and duplication of effort. This paper presents initial findings from an ongoing pilot project that began in spring 2011 on a digital information exchange standard called COBie (Construction Operations Building Information Exchange). Through interviews with key participants, we analyze existing practices as well as proposed changes to be made to these practices. Across a large organization, digital information is not trusted - nor is information neutral. Information is connected to particular jurisdictions who currently control the creation and management of their own datasets. We found that despite availability of digital information, people generally prefer to obtain information from colleagues with direct knowledge of the project or from paper documents. Digital information was considered to be either too difficult to access or not viewed as trustworthy since digital data was not consistently maintained. As more digital information is amassed, including information from COBie and building information models, organizational cultures and practices need to be developed around these new datasets. \u00a9 2012 ASCE.||construction - construction industry - information management - organisational aspects||COBie - BIM - large owner organization - hand-off of data - facilities management - operations management - digital information exchange - construction operations building information exchange - building information models - organizational cultures| |Creating a community-based housing response pool||El-Anwar, Omar(1); Chen, Lei(2)||Construction Research Congress 2012: Construction Challenges in a Flat World, Proceedings of the 2012 Construction Research Congress||2012||Conference article (CA)||Following disasters, housing is a principal component of economic and buildings losses. Traditional interim housing programs have been criticized for their inability to (1) adequately address the socioeconomic needs of displaced families; and (2) control expenditures. The objective of this paper is to present a new housing framework that can revolutionize the current understanding of post-shelter housing from an overly expensive, socially disruptive activity to a capacity building process. The proposed framework supports the development of a community-based housing response pool that can (1) transform the one-size-fits-all housing assistance to a customized need-tailored approach, while (2) supporting local businesses to recover. This paper presents the development of two key modules within the proposed framework, including (1) an automated data acquisition module; and (2) a data mapping module to match available housing characteristics and locations to fulfill the social, emotional, and economic needs of displaced families. Moreover, this paper discusses the need to develop (1) an IT-based collaboration system among multiple localities and agencies; and (2) a real-time housing procurement system. The proposed framework should prove useful to emergency management agencies in (1) utilizing available housing resources; and (2) quantifying the need to construct/install additional interim housing within the affected communities. \u00a9 2012 ASCE.||Data acquisition - Disasters - Optimization - Risk management||Automated data acquisition - Capacity building - Collaboration systems - Emergency management - Housing characteristic - Housing programs - Post disasters - Principal Components| |Developing 3D safety training materials on fall related hazards for limited english proficiency (LEP) and low literacy (LL) construction workers||Lin, K.Y.(1); Computing in Civil Engineering, Proceedings||2012||Conference article (CA)||Construction has been one of the most dangerous industries, with fall being the most common type of hazards. Meanwhile, about one fourth to one third of the industry's taskforce is composed of Hispanic workers, many of whom lack proficiency in English, and/or have limited literacy. Limited literacy and lack of English proficiency are not specific to Hispanic workers and serve as critical barriers in effective safety education and training. The paper presents the developmental efforts and lessons learned of six 3D visualized and scenario-based training case materials that use minimum amount of text descriptions. Common cases that involve construction fall hazards from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Fatalities Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) program were analyzed and modeled in a 3D video game platform referencing the effective training strategies from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Using 3D simulated virtual job sites in safety training is expected to reduce the required level of language proficiency and literacy, and increase the understanding as well as learning interests of those in construction who can't speak or read much English. \u00a9 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.||computer based training - computer games - construction industry - data visualisation - hazards - natural languages - occupational health - occupational safety - personnel - text analysis||3D safety training material development - fall-related hazards - limited English proficiency construction workers - LEP construction workers - low literacy construction workers - LL construction workers - Hispanic workers - safety education - safety training - 3D visualized training case materials - scenario-based training case materials - text descriptions - construction fall hazards - National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health - NIOSH - Fatalities Assessment and Control Evaluation program - FACE program - 3D video game platform - Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA - 3D simulated virtual job sites| |Using wearable physiological status monitors for analyzing construction tasks||Gatti, U.C.(1); Migliaccio, G.C.(2); Bogus, S.M.(1); S.(3)||Congress on Computing in Civil Engineering, Proceedings||2012||Conference article (CA)||Anecdotal evidence suggests that physical strain may negatively affect workforce productivity and safety performance. Thus, an effective management of construction workforce physical strain could be very beneficial in improving construction productivity and safety. However, clear relationships between physical strain, safety, and productivity have yet to be established because of limitations in data collection procedures and technologies. This research has utilized recent innovations in sensing and communication technology to investigate the physical strain vs. productivity relationship. Data collected by physiological status monitors were analyzed through regression analysis that adopted heart rate as predictor of physical strain. Productivity and heart rate data of seven subjects performing a four-hour, simulated construction task were collected. The analysis showed that heart rate is a significant predictor with a strong parabolic relationship with productivity. Therefore, this research provided evidence of the physical strain vs. productivity relationship and, for the first time, proposed a mathematical formulation of such a relationship. \u00a9 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.||Heart - Occupational risks - Personnel - Regression analysis - Safety engineering - Wearable technology||Anecdotal evidences - Communication technologies - Construction productivity - Construction workforces - Effective management - Mathematical formulation - Physiological status monitors - Safety performance| |Efficient analysis and optimization of reconstruction plans for damaged transportation networks following disasters||El-Anwar, Omar(1); Ye, Jin(2); Orabi, Wallied(3)||Computing in Civil Engineering - Proceedings of the 2013 ASCE International Workshop on Computing in Civil Engineering||2013||Conference article (CA)||Planning for post-disaster reconstruction of damaged transportation networks is a complex and computationally expensive effort. Decision makers need to prioritize the use of limited resources to maximize societal benefit through accelerated traffic services restoration, which involves evaluating numerous recovery scenarios. This paper presents a new model that enables efficient analysis and optimization of the post-disaster reconstruction of transportation networks that is capable of identifying optimal reconstruction plans using reasonable computational overhead. The model employs a number of search space reduction techniques using mixed linear-integer programming and goal programming-inspired approaches in order to explore the large space of possible alternative solutions. Each of these solutions is comprised of a set of interdependent variables, including (1) contractors selection; and (2) the start dates of reconstruction projects and their constituent work packages. An application example is used to demonstrate the new model's superior computational performance compared to recent research developments. \u00a9 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.||integer programming - linear programming - maintenance engineering - optimisation - planning - research and development - transportation||efficient analysis - reconstruction plan optimization - transportation networks - post-disaster reconstruction planning - decision makers - traffic services restoration - search space reduction techniques - research developments - linear integer programming| |On effective text classification for supporting job hazard analysis||Chi, N.W.(1); Lin, K.Y.(2); Hsieh, S.H.(1)||Computing in Civil Engineering - Proceedings of the 2013 ASCE International Workshop on Computing in Civil Engineering||2013||Conference article (CA)||The construction industry is known to be dangerous and is featured by fatal occupational hazards. Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) is a common approach to mitigate and control these occupational hazards. It analyzes major tasks in a construction activity, identifies all the potential task related hazards, and suggests means to reduce or avoid each potential hazard. Because every project is unique, an effective JHA must consider the conditions specific to the project instead of reusing previous JHAs directly. To this end, JHA requires the participation of experienced construction practitioners and becomes a time-consuming and brain-draining task. While expert involvement is necessary during JHA development, the authors would like to explore the possibility of leveraging existing construction safety resources in order to reduce the required human efforts. This paper presents an approach based on text classification to support the automation of JHA. It uses the CPWR construction solutions database as an example to demonstrate how text classification can be applied to match the database documents with predefined safety violation scenarios and identify potentially useful safety approaches. This paper also discusses how different strategies were tested to optimize the effectiveness of the proposed text classification approach. The results indicate that although some of the classification strategies cannot make obvious progress on the effectiveness, the effectiveness of the text classification without optimization is good enough to support JHA. \u00a9 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.||construction industry - database management systems - hazards - occupational safety - production engineering computing||text classification - job hazard analysis - construction industry - fatal occupational hazard mitigation - hazard reduction - hazard avoidance - construction safety resources - CPWR construction solutions database - database documents| |Achieving higher energy efficiency in high-performance buildings using integrated practices: A fuzzy set-qualitative comparative analysis Hoda(1); Dossick, Carrie Sturts(2); Neff, Gina(2)||Construction Research Congress 2014: Construction in a Global Network - Proceedings of the 2014 Construction Research Congress||2014||Conference article (CA)||High-performance (HP) buildings are known for the holistic approach to design and construction project delivery, which encompasses various performance goals, such as energy efficiency, environmental considerations, and occupants' well-being. Compared to traditional buildings, HP projects require closer integration in the design and construction process. Researchers have used conventional qualitative analysis to identify successful strategies in facilitating integration, and quantitative methods of research to rank such techniques in order of effectiveness. However, there have not been significant attempts in evaluating the joint causal effect of such strategies and uncovering the causal mechanisms that underlie successful HP projects. Utilizing a new methodology called fuzzy set-qualitative comparative analysis (fs-QCA), we analyzed the configurations of integration strategies used in more than 30 HP projects. We found that the four elements of setting ambitious environmental goals, having committed and trustworthy team members, using advanced information management technologies, and early and frequent involvement of the key team members create a sufficient recipe for achieving a high level of energy efficiency. Our analysis also shows that in the presence of these elements, contractual agreements do not produce a necessary element, as contractual barriers can be overcome with leadership, information systems, and work processes that engender an environment of trust, openness, and ambition. \u00a9 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.||building management systems - buildings (structures) - construction - contracts - design engineering - energy conservation - fuzzy set theory - information management - project management||high-performance buildings - construction project delivery - energy efficiency - environmental considerations - occupant well- being - HP projects - HP building design - construction process - fuzzy set-qualitative comparative analysis - fs-QCA - environmental goals - advanced information management technologies - contractual barriers - leadership - information systems| |Field use of physiological status monitoring (PSM) to identify construction workers' physiologically acceptable bounds and heart rate zones||Lee, Wonil(1); Migliaccio, Giovanni C.(1)||Computing in Civil and Building Engineering - Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Computing in Civil and Building Engineering||2014||Conference article (CA)||The construction environment affects workers' physical responses as well as individual and crew-level performance.

Five workers at the same building jobsite agreed to wear a Physiological Status Monitoring (PSM) system for several days while at work. HR data were collected to identify physiologically acceptable bounds and HR zones as practical threshold-based guidelines in construction. Since HR is affected by various external variables, daily video recordings and weather data were also collected and used to explain results. \u00a9 ASCE 2014.||cardiology - construction industry - occupational health - patient monitoring - physiology||field use - construction environment - worker physical responses - crew-level performance - worker performance - severe environments - physiologically acceptable bounds - heart rate zones - HR zones - construction workers - building jobsite - physiological status monitoring system - PSM system - HR data - threshold-based guidelines - daily video recordings - weather data| |Serious games for the learning and practices of hazard recognition: Understanding the design complexity for 3D construction site modeling||Lee, Wonil(1); Lin, Ting-Hui(2); Castronovo, Fadi(3); Lin, Ken-Yu(1)||Computing in Civil and Building Engineering - Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Computing in Civil and Building Engineering||2014||Conference article (CA)||Among the various construction safety and health (S&H) training methods, 3D digital game-based learning is believed to have a great potential. This method can combine various educational strategies to engage learners that have grown up with computer gaming. To this end, an increasing number of 3D serious games have been developed for the learning of construction S&H. However, developing a virtual construction-site simulation for serious gaming is a tedious process. Little has been done to understand the simulation parameters that should be controlled in order to adequately represent the dynamics of a construction site and, as a result, to influence student learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand and prioritize the 3D construction-site simulation parameters for learning hazard recognition. In the paper, the researchers reported their findings on the S&H game design framework as an initial step to identify how simulation parameters such as texture, lighting, and animation could align with game contents and positively affect student learning. A future experiment for validating each parameter was also introduced. The researchers expect that the final research outcomes will enable construction education stakeholders to better understand and manage the design complexity of 3D construction-site modeling for S&H serious games. \u00a9 ASCE 2014.||civil engineering computing - computer animation - computer based training - engineering education - health and safety - serious games (computing) - virtual reality||3D construction site modeling - construction safety and health training methods - construction S&H training methods - 3D digital game-based learning - educational strategies - computer gaming - 3D serious games - construction S&H learning - virtual construction-site simulation - construction site dynamics - student learning - 3D construction-site simulation parameters - hazard recognition learning - S&H game design framework - texture - lighting - animation - game contents - construction education - design complexity - S&H serious games| |Advancing in building information modeling (BIM) contracting: Trends in the AEC/FM industry||Abdirad, Hamid(1)||AEI 2015: Birth and Life of the Integrated Building - Proceedings of the AEI Conference 2015||2015||Conference article (CA)||BIM, as a best practice in the AEC/FM industry, provides a new set of processes and technologies in construction projects to improve productivity and reduce waste. Despite the significant growth in BIM adoption and research on technological aspects of BIM, far too little attention has been paid to research on BIM contracting. So far, two industry leading organizations (AIA and AGC) have developed standard forms of agreement for BIM contracting. However, many projects have used custom manuscripts to satisfy their special contractual needs, and the existing literature has not dealt with these industry-wide trends of BIM contracting. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine custom developed contracts in order to trace advances in BIM contracting. Through a detailed analysis of custom manuscripts, this research demonstrates that there are several areas of contracting that standard forms have not addressed. These include but are not limited to (1) requirements for BIM process inputs (e.g. BIM staff competencies), (2) requirements for BIM process management (e.g. BIM quality assurance and quality control, a metric based BIM processing assessment), (3) requirements for information modeling (e.g. landscape, facility management), and (4) requirements for data security (e.g. corruption of files, and data misuse). This study has practical implications for BIM implementation and future developments of inclusive BIM standard agreements. \u00a9 2015 ASCE.||Contracts - Human resource management - Information theory - Office buildings - Productivity - Quality assurance - Quality control - Security of data||Best practices - Building Information Model - BIM - Construction projects - Facility management - Information Modeling - Process inputs - Process management - Technological aspects| |Advancing in object-based landscape information modeling: Challenges and future needs||Abdirad, Hamid(1); Lin, Ken-Yu(2)||Congress on Computing in Civil Engineering, Proceedings||2015||Conference article (CA)||The AEC/FM industry has benefited from the innovative integration of information technologies and industry-wide processes in different lifecycle stages of facilities. Building Information Modeling (BIM), as one of these innovations, is fast becoming a key approach to virtually integrate the required information for facility design, construction, and management. So far, applications and benefits of using BIM tools and processes in building design and construction have been documented in research. However, landscape design and construction practice is underrated in current BIM developments and in integrated design-construction practices, and it has not benefited from the advantages BIM provides to the industry at different scales. This could result in a critical challenge, as BIM implementation and information modeling are becoming mandatory in many projects in public and private sectors, and the gap still exists in the processes of collaboration and information exchange between the landscape design and construction practice and other disciplines. As an early step to mitigate this challenge, this study shows that recent advances in BIM, COBie, information-exchange schemas (e.g. IFC), and taxonomies such as OmniClass have shortcomings in addressing landscape and hardscape elements and attributes. This challenge limits asset-management capabilities, and leads the practice to inefficient operations, more manual processes, and costly knowledge development and exchange. These findings have important implications for revising and updating existing taxonomies to support more automated information development and exchange processes. \u00a9 2015 ASCE.||civil engineering computing - electronic data interchange||object-based landscape information modeling - BIM - Building Information Modeling - COBie - information-exchange schemas - taxonomies - OmniClass - asset-management capabilities - knowledge development - knowledge exchange - automated information development| |The Effectiveness of AR (Augmented Reality) Technology in Acquiring on Job-site Task.||Yong-Woo Kim; Wonil Lee; Eom, Exposition, Conference Proceedings||2015||Conference article (CA)||Acquiring information from drawings and specifications is one of the fundamental skills for construction laborers and students in a construction-related domain. The research assessed the users' experiences in apprehending tasks, including interpreting drawing and specifications using an NFC-AR system. Three different surveys were designed and executed: a pre-test survey, a survey about AR usability, and one about the efficiency of delivering directives. The survey results were analyzed separately for comparison between groups using paper-based drawings and specifications, and those used AR groups. The findings from experiments suggest that the AR method was more effective in the students' apprehension of the tasks involving drawings and specifications when compared to the paper-based method. They also show that the level of students' understanding was consistent when the AR system was used, whereas students using the paper method had varied levels of understanding that depended upon the skills of the frontline manager. \u00a9 American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=116026353&site=ehost-live| |Remote construction worker activity and safety monitoring||Migliaccio, Giovanni(1); Gatti, Umberto(2); Teizer, Jochen(3)||Proceedings of the 28th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2011||2011||Conference article (CA)||Data fusion can be defined as a process for integrating information from multiple and heterogeneous sources to obtain a composite and augmented inference about the state of an entity. Data fusion has been successfully applied in several fields. Its usefulness is becoming evident for the enhancement of automated and remote monitoring systems of construction sites. Current technology allows the development of integrated systems able to autonomously and remotely document and track work site operations. Applications have so far focused on tracking material and equipment. Little work has been done on continuous remote monitoring of construction workers. This paper addresses the benefits and limitations of two remote sensing technologies: Physiological Status Monitors (PSMs) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) systems, which allow real-time tracking of construction workers' location and physiological status. The scope of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of fusing data from a PSM and an UWB system to obtain an augmented knowledge of workers' status and so compensate for existing limitations. Thus, the research team is developing and testing an algorithm that is able to process the collected data to establish the position, the activity, and the safely behavior of the monitored subjects during simulated construction tasks.||Agricultural robots - Broadband networks - Data fusion - Physiology - Real time systems - Remote control - Remote sensing - Robotics||Automated data collection and analysis - Heterogeneous sources - Integrating information - Physiological status - Physiological status monitors - Remote monitoring system - Remote sensing technology - Ultrawideband systems| |Best practices in design process development for delivery||Ptschelinzew, Lourdes R.(1); R.(4); Nettuno, Greg(5)||ISEC 2013 - 7th International Structural Engineering and Construction Conference: New Developments in Structural Engineering and Construction||2013||Conference article (CA)||The traditional system for highway delivery has served the public well for over 60 years. The foundation of this system, often called Design-bid-build (DBB), is the principle of selecting designers based on qualifications and selecting construction contractors based on competitive sealed bids. Though successful in the main, this process can foster adversarial relationships, limit innovation, result in high cost and time growth, and may not necessarily provide the best-value to the owner. In recent years, these issues have become a more pressing concern for highway agencies in the US, as deteriorating infrastructure and an increasing population have created pressure to move critical projects quickly from planning, through design, and into construction, without a cost increase. The wide range of options for project delivery available today is a recent development for publicly funded highway projects in the US. Design-Build (DB) was introduced in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. After the successful experience with DB, many states passed legislation to allow alternative project delivery methods, such as DB and Construction Manager/General Contractor (CMGC). In the rush to construct projects faster, the need to change the design process was a subject that did not receive proper attention. This paper, based on research sponsored by the US Federal Highway Administration, discusses and documents findings on these and other facets of the research.

One is that high-risk projects should yield high-returns, as in the field of financial investment. The other maintains that high-risk projects have a likelihood of increasing cost overruns, thereby decreasing profitability. This study is aimed at testing empirically these contradictory hypotheses on the basis of utility theory.We investigated 137 international construction projects carried out by 14 Korean contractors in 34 countries. This survey examined contingency, planned overhead and profit, cost overruns, and profit rate. Furthermore, the level of 71 risk factors was evaluated before and after starting construction. This study reveals that projects predicted as high-risk have a slight tendency to appropriate high contingency and planned overhead profit, but moderately experience cost overruns, thereby having a slight negative relationship with profits. In addition, projects that actually experience high-risk events after the start of construction trigger strongly cost overruns, thereby significantly lowering profitability. These results mean that the rules of \"high risk, high return\" should not be equally applied to the field of international construction. Although these results can be varied if the concept of return is extended to other values, such as obtaining know-how and future opportunities, this study contributes to evaluating the risk behavior for international construction projects.

The increasing socio-spatial unevenness of China's urban and rural communities has demanded a diversification of community-level planning modes, approaches and participants, exposing the limitations of the party-state's continuing scientistic paternalism.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/introduction-planning-chinas-communities-between/docview/2250947869/se-2?accountid=14784||Community planning , Urban , Paternalism , Rural areas , Urban planning , Rural communities , Community development , Community development , development , , Community , Unevenness Rural communities Community planning , , ARCHITECTURE||1988||Journal Article| |BEHAVIORAL DISTURBANCE, COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, AND FUNCTIONAL SKILL IN ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE||TERI, L; Article| Article| |Stormwater ponds - Constructed stormwater ponds can significantly soften the impact of development on the hydrologic regime-and provide |Up on a pedestal - Pedestal-mounted decking systems provide a relatively new approach WP; Winterbottom, D||LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE||2000||Journal Article| |Stone veneer craft||MacElroy, WP; Winterbottom, D||LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE||2001||Journal Article| |Building to learn, Part II - Reflections on a decade of developing a design/build University Washington, 1928-1942||Ochsner, JK||PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY||2005||Journal Article| |Differences Jeffrey; Kang, Min-Jay||OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL||2006||Journal Article||With the ability of linking distant partners and diverse bodies of students and faculty, virtual design studios provide unique opportunities for examining cultural, contextual, and methodological differences in design and design collaboration. However, most evaluations of virtual design studio in the recent literature hove focused primarily on technical and operational issues. In contrast, the social and cultural dimensions of virtual design studio and their pedagogical implications hove not been adequately examined. To address this gap, this article examines the experience and outcomes of a recent virtual design studio involving international collaboration between faculty and student partners. Specifically, it looks of how presence of differences and process of dialogic learning create pedagogical opportunities in a collaborative 'virtual' environment. Based on the case study, this article argues that through dialogues, collaboration, and negotiation of cultural, contextual and methodological differences, collaborative virtual design studio offers an alternative to traditional design studio based on the primacy of individual practice and the master-apprentice model of learning. By creatively utilizing the collaborative environment involving diverse partners, virtual design studio con foster a critical understanding of cross-cultural design process and the significance of dialogues and negotiation in design.||virtual design studio; difference; PLANNING RESEARCH||2006||Journal Article||This paper explores how multicultural politics and the geography of immigration present challenges,for the consideration of place identity in community planning and design in older ethnic neighborhoods. Seattle historic Chinatown-Internalional District (C-ID), a prime example of on urban space shaped by changing multi-ethnic immigration patterns, provides the case through which these issues are examined. Through this case study the authors find that success planning in multi-ethnic communities explicitly recognizes their various cultural identities, accounts for differences between resident and non-resident stakeholders, and focuses design attention on accentuating community cores rather than on defining boundaries of territories. This allows for multiple cultural identities to be acknowledged and represented without any one group's history or identity being undermined or sacrificed.||LOS-ANGELES; SPATIALITY; CITY| |Ballard Library and Neighborhood Article| |The Pay Streak Spectacle Representations of Race and Gender in the Amusement Quarters of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition||Chalana, Manish||PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY||2008||Journal Article| |Victor Steinbrueck Finds Seattle Cityscape||Ochsner, Jeffrey Karl||PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY||2008||Journal Article| for predicting the modulus of elasticity as a function of compressive strength can be found in the current literature.

A Decade of Research and Development in Architecture, Engineering and Construction||2015||Journal Article||Technical documents with complicated structures are often produced in architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) projects and research. Information retrieval (IR) techniques provide a possible solution for managing the ever-growing volume and contexts of the knowledge embedded in these technical documents. However, applying a general-purpose search engine to a domain-specific technical document collection often produces unsatisfactory results. To address this problem, we research the development of a novel IR system based on passage retrieval techniques. The system employs domain knowledge to assist passage partitioning and supports an interactive concept-based expanded IR for technical documents in an engineering field. The engineering domain selected in this case is earthquake engineering, although the technologies developed and employed by the system should be generally applicable to many other engineering domains that use technical documents with similar characteristics. We carry out the research in a three-step process. In the first step, since the final output of this research is an IR system, as a prerequisite, we created a reference collection which includes 111 earthquake engineering technical documents from Taiwan's National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering. With this collection, the effectiveness of the IR system can be further evaluated onceit is developed. In the second step, the research focuses on creating a base domain ontology using an earthquake-engineering handbook to represent the domain knowledge and to support the target IR system with the knowledge. In step three, the research focuses on the semantic querying and retrieval mechanisms and develops the OntoPassage approach to help with the mechanisms. The OntoPassage approach partitions a document into smaller passages, each with around 300 terms, according to the main concepts in the document. This approach is then used to implement the target domain knowledge-based IR system that allows users to interact with the system and perform concept-based query expansions. The results show that the proposed domain knowledge-based IR system can achieve not only an effective IR but also inform search engine users with a clear knowledge representation.||architecture - construction - engineering - knowledge based systems - ontologies (artificial intelligence) - query processing - search engines||knowledge representation - concept-based query expansions - base domain ontology - earthquake engineering - general-purpose search engine - AEC projects - architecture/engineering/construction projects - complicated structures - technical documents - domain knowledge-based information retrieval| |Products of Place The Era of Reinforced-Concrete in Seattle, 1921-1931||Sprague, Tyler S.||PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY||2015||Journal Article| |Meditations on the Empty Jeffrey PHOTOGRAPHY; THOUGHTS| |The Emergence of Regional Modernism in Seattle Architecture From the 1930s to the 1950s||Ochsner, Jeffrey Karl||PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY||2016||Journal Article| |VISITOR CENTER DESIGN Peng; Cai Weiguang; Abramson, Daniel||OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL||2016||Journal Article||Visitor center plays an important role in the normal operation and sustainable development of scenic spots, especially as a portal image of its management.

The framework of resilience theory was set from four dimensions, namely, resilience and match in the composition of ontology function, the extended function, integration of buildings into the surrounding environment, and alternative construction technologies and materials. This theory was explained and analyzed with the application of the theory in practice in combination with the design of Mount Hua visitor center.

National boundary spanning by AEC firms engaged in complex, interdependent work introduces coordination challenges because stakeholders may not share the same language, culture or work practices. These types of firms have begun to explore the use of technologies that can meaningfully create productive work connections between the distributed participants 47 and help improve work coordination and execution. In this chapter, we describe the CyberGRID (Cyber-enabled Global Research Infrastructure for Design); a virtual workspace designed to support geographically distributed AEC work coordination and execution. The CyberGRID was created as a research tool to both enable and study virtual AEC teamwork. We summarize findings from multiple experiments over the jive year history of CyberGRID research and development. These findings help to improve our understanding of interactional dynamics among virtual teams in complex sociotechnical systems like the CyberGRID. We then discuss the challenges faced in developing the CyberGRID and in achieving widespread adoption of such tools in the industry. We close the chapter with a discussion of future research opportunities to develop improved sociotechnical systems to better support the execution of AEC projects. Our goal with this chapter is to argue that sociotechnical systems like the CyberGRID can fundamentally and positively transform the interactional dynamics of AEC project stakeholders to create more efficient global virtual work practices.||civil engineering computing - construction industry - data visualisation - groupware - project management - team working - virtual reality||CyberGRID - virtual workspace - construction - engineering - national boundaries - national boundary spanning - AEC firms - complex work - interdependent work - coordination challenges - culture - productive work connections - chapter - Global Research Infrastructure - geographically distributed AEC work coordination - research tool - virtual AEC teamwork - virtual teams - complex sociotechnical systems - future research opportunities - improved sociotechnical systems - AEC projects - AEC project stakeholders - efficient global virtual work practices| |Work Zone Intrusion: Technology to John;Lee, Hyun Woo||Professional Safety||2018||Journal Article||WZIAT was first introduced to work zones in 1995 following a Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP)-sponsored study (Agent & Hibbs, 1996).

Virtual reality (VR) provides an alternative to create immersive working environments without significant safety concerns. Working on elevated surfaces is a dangerous scenario, which may lead to gait and postural instability and, consequently, a serious fall. Previous studies showed that VR is a promising tool for measuring the impact of height on the postural sway. However, most of these studies used the treadmill as the walking locomotion apparatus in a virtual environment (VE). This paper was focused on natural walking locomotion to reduce the inherent postural perturbations of VR devices. To investigate the impact of virtual height on gait characteristics and keep the level of realism and feeling of presence at their highest, we enhanced the first-person-character model with \"virtual legs\". Afterward, we investigated its effect on the gait parameters of the participants with and without the presence of height. To that end, twelve healthy adults were asked to walk on a virtual loop path once at the ground level and once at the 17th floor of an unfinished structure. By quantitatively comparing the participants' gait pattern results, we observed a decrease in the stride length and increase in the gait duration of the participants exposed to height. At the ground level, the use of the enhanced model reduced participants' average stride length and height. The results of this study help us understand users' behaviors when they were exposed to elevated surfaces and establish a firm ground for gait stability analysis for the future height-related VR studies. We expect this developed VR platform can generate reliable results of VR application in more construction safety studies.||civil engineering computing - construction industry - gait analysis - medical computing - occupational safety - virtual reality||construction safety studies - mixed VR - virtual legs - construction workers gait pattern - virtual reality - immersive working environments - postural instability - serious fall - postural sway - walking locomotion apparatus - natural walking locomotion - inherent postural perturbations - VR devices - virtual height - first-person-character model - gait parameters - virtual loop path - stride length - gait duration - gait stability analysis - safety concerns - VR platform - height-related M.||CITYSCAPE||2019||Journal Article||Fifty years after the adoption of the 1968 Fair Housing Act that prohibits discrimination in the housing market, homeownership rates have not increased for Black or Hispanic households. The current homeownership rate for Black households is 42 percent, identical to the 1970 census reported level, and 48 percent for Hispanic households, lower than that in 1970. Using data from the 1989, 2005, and 2013 American Housing Surveys, we identify the extent to which group differences in household endowments account for persistently low The First Time: The Influence of Height, Self-Judgment of Fear and a Moving Structural Beam on the Heart Rate and Postural Sway During the surfaces is the main cause of death and injury at construction sites. Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports, an average of nearly three workers per day suffer fatal injuries from falling. Studies show that postural instability is the foremost cause of this disproportional falling rate. To study what affects the postural stability of construction workers, we conducted a series of experiments in the virtual reality (VR). Twelve healthy adults, all students at the University of Nebraska were recruited for this study. During each trial, participants heart rates and postural sways were measured as the dependent factors. The independent factors included a moving structural beam (MB) coming directly at the participants, the presence of VR, height, the participants self-judgment of fear, and their level of acrophobia. The former was designed in an attempt to simulate some part of the steel erection procedure, which is one of the key tasks of ironworkers. The results of this study indicate that height increase the postural sway. Self-judged fear significantly was found to decrease postural sway, more specifically the normalized total excursion of the center of pressure (TE), both in the presence and absence of height. Also, participants heart rates significantly increase once they are confronted by a moving beam in the virtual environment (VE), even though they are informed that the beam will not hit them. The findings of this study can be useful for training novice ironworkers that will be subjected to height and steel erection for the first time.||biocontrol - biomechanics - construction industry - ergonomics - injuries - mechanoception - medical computing - occupational safety - personnel - statistical analysis - virtual reality||extreme height - moving structural beam - heart rate - postural sway - injury - construction sites - Labor Statistics reports - fatal injuries - postural instability - foremost cause - disproportional falling rate - postural stability - construction workers - participants heart rates - height increase - moving beam| |Toward a Cross-Platform Framework: Assessing the Comprehensiveness of Listings||Costa, Ana; rental housing markets in the United States has traditionally relied on national or local housing surveys. Those sources lack temporal and spatial specificity, limiting their use for tracking short-term changes in local markets. As rental housing ads have transitioned to digital spaces, a growing body of literature has utilized web scraping to analyze listing practices and variations in rental market dynamics. Those studies have primarily relied on one platform, Craigslist, as a source of data. Despite Craigslist's popularity, the authors contend that rental listings from various websites, rather than from individual ones, provide a more comprehensive picture. Using a mixed-methods approach to study listings across various platforms in five metropolitan areas, this article demonstrates considerable variation in both the types of rental units advertised and the features provided across those platforms. The article begins with an account of the birth and consolidation of online rental platforms and emergent characteristics of several selected websites, including the criteria for posting, search parameters, search results priority, and first-page search results. Visualizations are used to compare features such as the 40th percentile of rent, rent distribution, and bedroom size based on scraped data from six online platforms (Padmapper, Forrent.com , Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and GoSection8), 2020 Fair Market Rents, and 2019 American Community Survey data. The analyses indicate that online listing platforms target different audiences and offer distinct information on units within those market segments, resulting in markedly different estimates of local rental costs and unit size distribution depending on the platform.||https://www.jstor.org/stable/27039965| |Genetic structure of natural populations of California red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) using multiple and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to evaluate connectivity among nine red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) populations sampled between August 1998 and November 2003 along approximately 1,300 km of California coastline from Crescent City (41\u00b046N, 124\u00b012W) to San Miguel Island (34\u00b002N, 120\u00b022W).

A subset of five populations spanning the geographic range of the study was scored for 163 polymorphic AFLP markers. Of these, 41 loci showed significant divergence (P < 0.001) among populations. Still, no AFLP markers were diagnostic for any of the study populations, and assignment tests did not consistently assign individuals to the correct population. Although the AFLP data are the first to suggest there is significant genetic differentiation among California red abalone populations, the discordance between the different genetic markers needs further study before unambiguous conclusions can be drawn with respect to connectivity among the populations.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/genetic-structure-natural-populations-california/docview/2221064183/se-2?accountid=14784||amplified fragment length polymorphism , coasts Times Is Like Having Your House on Fire Once\": The Experience of Place and Impending Displacement among Public Housing Residents||Manzo, Lynne C;Kleit, Rachel G;Couch, Dawn||Urban Studies||2008||Journal Article||The HOPE VI in the US displaces tens of thousands of low-income households to disperse pockets of poverty and transform sites of `severely distressed' public housing into mixed-income housing.

Evaluation of stormwater bioretention treatment using a lumped urban ecohydrologic model study, we developed the urban ecohydrology model (UEM) to investigate the role of bioretention on watershed water balance, runoff production, and streamflow variability. UEM partitions the land surface into pervious, impervious, and bioretention cell fractions. Soil moisture and vegetation dynamics are simulated in pervious areas and bioretention cells using a lumped ecohydrological approach. Bioretention cells receive runoff from a fraction of impervious areas. The model is calibrated in an urban headwater catchment near Seattle, WA, USA, using hourly weather data and streamflow observations for 3years. The calibrated model is first used to investigate the relationship between streamflow variability and bioretention cell size that receives runoff from different values of impervious area in the watershed. Streamflow variability is quantified by 2 indices, high pulse count (HPC), which quantifies the number of flow high pulses in a water year above a threshold, and high pulse range (HPR), which defines the time over which the pulses occurred. Low values of these indices are associated with improved stream health. The effectiveness of the modelled bioretention facilities are measured by their influence on reducing HPC and HPR and on flow duration curves in comparison with modelled fully forested conditions. We used UEM to examine the effectiveness of bioretention cells under rainfall regimes that are wetter and drier than the study area in an effort to understand linkages between the degree of urbanization, climate, and design bioretention cell size to improve inferred stream health conditions. In all model simulations, limits to the reduction of HPC and HPR indicators were reached as the size of bioretention cells grew. Bioretention was more effective as the rainfall regime gets drier. Results may guide bioretention design practices and future studies to explore climate change impacts on bioretention design and management.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/is-there-limit-bioretention-effectiveness/docview/2131872613/se-2?accountid=14784| |Effects of a century of land cover and climate change on the hydrology of the Sound basin in northwestern Washington, USA has experienced substantial land cover and climate change over the last century. Using a spatially distributed hydrology model (the Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model, DHSVM) the concurrent effects of changing climate (primarily temperature) and land cover in the basin arc deconvolved. based on land cover maps for 1883 and 2002, and gridded climate data for 1915-2006. It is found that land cover and temperature change effects on streamflow have occurred differently at high and low elevations. In the lowlands, land cover has occurred primarily as conversion of forest to urban or partially urban land use, and here the land cover signal dominates temperature change. In the uplands, both land cover and temperature change have played important roles. Temperature change is especially important at intermediate elevations (so-called transient snow zone), where the winter snow line is most sensitive to temperature change-notwithstanding the effects of forest harvest over the same part of the basin. Model simulations show that current land cover results in higher fall, winter and early spring streamflow but lower summer flow; higher annual maximum flow and higher annual mean streamflow compared with pre-development conditions, which is largely consistent with a trend analysis of model residuals. Land cover change effects in urban and partially urban basins have resulted in changes in annual flow. annual maximum flows, fall and Summer flows. For the upland portion of the basin, shifts in the seasonal distribution of streamflows (higher spring flow and lower summer flow) are clearly related to rising temperatures, but annual streamflow has not changed much.

A 60-year climate model output, archived for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), was statistically downscaled and used as input to DHSVM. From the DHSVM output, we extracted multi-decadal averages of seasonal streamflow, annual maximum flow, snow water equivalent (SWE), and evapotranspiration centred around 2030 and 2050. Future land cover was represented by a 2027 projection, which was extended to 2050, and DHSVM was run (with current climate) for these future land cover projections. In general, the climate change signal alone on sub-basin streamflow was evidenced primarily through changes in the timing of winter and spring runoff, and slight increases in the annual runoff. Runoff changes in the uplands were attributable both to climate (increased winter precipitation, less snow) and land cover change (mostly reduced vegetation maturity). The most climatically sensitive parts of the uplands were in areas where the current winter precipitation is in the rain-snow transition zone. Changes in land cover were generally more important than climate change in the lowlands, where a substantial change to more urbanized land use and increased runoff was predicted. Both the annual total and seasonal distribution of freshwater flux to Puget Sound are more sensitive to climate change impacts than to land cover change, primarily because most of the runoff originates in the uplands. Both climate and land cover change slightly increase the annual freshwater flux to Puget Sound. Changes in the seasonal distribution of freshwater flux are mostly related to climate change, and consist of double-digit increases in winter flows and decreases in summer and fall flows.

This study examined whether SES can predict short-term weight change. MethodsThe Seattle Obesity Study II was based on an observational cohort of 440 adults. Weights and heights were measured at baseline and at 1 year. Self-reported education and incomes were obtained by questionnaire. Home addresses were linked to tax parcel property values from the King County, Washington, tax assessor. Associations among SES variables, prevalent obesity, and 1-year weight change were examined using multivariable linear regressions. ResultsLow residential property values at the tax parcel level predicted prevalent obesity at baseline and at 1 year. Living in the top quartile of house prices reduced obesity risk by 80% at both time points. At 1 year, about 38% of the sample lost >1 kg body weight; 32% maintained ( 1 kg); and 30% gained >1 kg. In adjusted models, none of the baseline SES measures had any impact on 1-year weight change.

Methods Data for 1,632 adult men and women came from the Seattle Obesity Study I. Demographic, socioeconomic and anthropometric data were collected via telephone survey. Home addresses were geocoded, and tax parcel residential property values were obtained from the King County tax assessor. Multiple logistic regression tested associations between house prices and obesity rates. House prices aggregated to census blocks and split into deciles were used to generate obesity heat maps. Results Deciles of property values for Seattle Obesity Study participants corresponded to county-wide deciles. Low residential property values were associated with high obesity rates (odds ratio, OR: 0.36; 95% confidence interval, CI [0.25, 0.51] in tertile 3 vs. tertile 1), adjusting for age, gender, race, home ownership, education, and incomes. Heat maps of obesity by census block captured differences by geographic area.

This study examined self-reported PA and weight accuracy and identified patterns of misreporting in a diverse sample. Methods: King, Pierce and Yakima county residents, aged 21-59 years (n= 728), self-reported their moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and weight, in kilograms. Self-reports were compared with minutes of bout-level MVPA, from 3 days of accelerometer data, and measured weights. Regression models examined characteristics associated with underreporting and overreporting of MVPA and weight, the potential bias introduced using each measure and the relation between perceived and measured PA and weight. Results: MVPA underreporting was higher among males and college educated participants; however, there was no differential MVPA overreporting. Weight underreporting was higher among males, those age 40-49 years and persons with obesity. Weight overreporting was higher among Hispanic participants and those reporting stress, unhappiness and fair or poor health. The estimated PA-obesity relation was similar using measured and self-reported PA but not self-reported weight. Perceived PA and weight predicted measured values. Conclusion: Self-reported PA and weight may be useful should objective measurement be infeasible; however, though population-specific adjustment for differential Ken P.||WIRES Water||2019||Journal Article||In recent decades, ecological restoration and landscape architecture have focused on reintegrating ecological processes in the urban environment to support greater habitat complexity and increase biodiversity. As these values are more broadly recognized, new approaches are being investigated to increase ecosystem services and ecological benefits in urban areas. Ecosystem engineers, such as the North American beaver (Castor canadensis), can create complex habitat and influence ecological processes in natural environments. Through dam building and wetland formation, beaver can create fish habitat, diversify vegetation in riparian zones, and aggrade sediment to increase stream productivity. As beaver populations have increased in urban areas across North America, their presence presents challenges and opportunities. Beaver can be integrated into the design of new and established urban green spaces to improve ecosystem functions. If managed properly, the conflicts that beaver sometimes create can be minimized. In this paper, we examine how landscape architects and restoration ecologists are anticipating the geomorphic and hydrological implications of beaver reintroduction in the design of wetlands and urban natural areas at regional and site levels. We present an urban beaver map and three case studies in Seattle, WA, USA, to identify various approaches, successes, and management strategies for integrating the actions of beaver into project designs. We make recommendations for how designers can capitalize on the benefits of beaver by identifying sites with increased likelihood of colonization, leveraging ecosystem engineers in design conception, designing site features to reduce constraints for the reintroduction and establishment of beaver, and anticipating and managing impacts.

The charrette methodology has been reconceptualized through the lens of new theoretical perspectives on children, social justice, and spatiality to encompass intergenerational, interskill, and inter-institutional participation. A formative evaluation of two design charrettes provides lessons on the benefits of and barriers to bringing 4th-5th and 9th-12th graders into a partnership with university students, design professionals, and community constituents. Benefits to younger participants included indications of social and environmental awareness, evidence of environmental competence, and opportunities to influence public decision-making. Barriers included the difficulties all parties experienced in taking new social roles, realizing new learning modes (including the design process), and overcoming institutional hierarchies.

We investigated associations between neighborhood greenspace and brain-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures and potential effect modification by sex or apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE), a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Methods We obtained a sample of non-demented participants 65 years or older (n = 1125) from the longitudinal, population-based Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Greenspace data were derived from the National Land Cover Dataset. Adjusted multivariable linear regression estimated associations between neighborhood greenspace five years prior to the MRI and left and right hippocampal volume and 10-point grades of ventricular size and burden of white matter hyperintensity. Interaction terms tested effect modification by APOE genotype and sex. CHS data (1989-1999) were obtained/analyzed in 2020. Results Participants were on average 79 years old [standard deviation (SD) = 4], 58% were female, and 11% were non-white race. Mean neighborhood greenspace was 38% (SD = 28%). Greater proportion of greenspace in the neighborhood five years before MRI was borderline associated with lower ventricle grade (estimate: - 0.30; 95% confidence interval: - 0.61, 0.00). We observed no associations between greenspace and the other MRI outcome measures and no evidence of effect modification by APOE genotype and sex. Conclusion This study suggests a possible association between greater greenspace and less ventricular enlargement, a measure reflecting global brain atrophy. If confirmed in other longitudinal cohort studies, interventions and policies to improve community greenspaces may help to maintain brain health in older transportation investment considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity in China: a spatial panel Ting; Sun, Feiyang||The Annals of Regional Science||2019||Journal Article||Transportation investment plays a significant role in promoting economic development. However, in what scenario and to what extent transportation investment can stimulate economic growth still remains debatable. For developing countries undergoing rapid urbanization, answering these questions is necessary for evaluating proposals and determining investment plans, especially considering the heterogeneity of spatiotemporal conditions. Current literature lacks systematical research to consider the impacts of panel data and spatial correlation issue in examining the economic effects of transportation investment. To fill this gap, this study collects provincial panel data in China from 1997 to 2015 to evaluate multi-level temporal and spatial effects of transportation investment on economic growth by using spatial panel data analysis. Results show that transportation investment leads to significant and positive effects on growth and spatial concentration of economic activities, but these results vary significantly depending on the temporal and spatial characteristics of each province. The economic impacts of transportation investment are quite positive even considering the time lag effects. This study suggests that both central and local governments should carefully evaluate the multifaceted economic effects of transportation investment, such as a balanced transportation investment and economic development between growing and lagging regions, and considering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the economic environment.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/quantifying-economic-effects-transportation/docview/2277753546/se-2?accountid=14784| |Integrating social science and design inquiry through interdisciplinary design charrettes: An approach to participatory community problem solving||Sutton, Sharon E.; Kemp, Susan P.||AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY||2006||Journal Article||Interdisciplinary collaborations that aim to facilitate meaningful community outcomes require both the right mix of disciplinary knowledge and effective community participation, which together can deepen collective knowledge and the capacity to take action. This article explores three interdisciplinary design charrettes, intensive participatory workshops that addressed specific community problems and provided a context for integrating design and social science inquiry with local community knowledge. Evaluation data from the charrettes shed light on how students from the design and social science disciplines experienced the charrettes, and on their interactions with community members. Key advantages to this interdisciplinary, community-based collaboration included expanded knowledge derived from the use of multiple modes of inquiry, particularly the resulting visualization tools that helped community members understand local issues and envision novel solutions. Key drawbacks included difficulties in balancing the two disciplines, the tendency for social scientists to feel out of place on designers' turf, and the increased disciplinary and interpersonal conflicts arising from a more diverse pool of participants.||community the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the rapidly growing Puget Sound region over three 5-year time blocks between 1986-1999 at three spatial scales in 42 Watershed Administrative Units (WAUs) to assess changes in the amounts and patterns of green vegetation. On average, approximately 20% of the area in each WAU experienced significant NDVI change over each 5-year time block. Cumulative NDVI change over 15 years (summing change over each 5-year time block) was an average of approximately 60% of each WAU, but was as high as 100% in some. At the regional scale, seasonal weather patterns and green-up from logging were the primary drivers of observed increases in NDVI values. At the WAU scale, anthropogenic factors were important drivers of both positive and negative NDVI change. For example, population density was highly correlated with negative NDVI change over 15 years (r = 0.66, P < 0.01), as was road density (r = 0.71, P < 0.01). At the smallest scale (within 3 case study WAUs) land use differences such as preserving versus harvesting forest lands drove vegetation change. We conclude that large areas within most watersheds are continually and heavily impacted by the high levels of human use and development over short time periods. Our results indicate that varying patterns and processes can be detected at multiple scales using changes in NDVIa unit| |Use of health impact assessments in the housing sector to promote health in the United States, 2002-2016||Bever, Emily; Arnold, and the Built Environment||2021||Journal Article||Housing affects health, yet health is seldom considered in housing decisions. Health impact assessment (HIA) is a tool that can improve housing-related policies, plans, programs, and projects by bringing together scientific data, health expertise, and stakeholder engagement to identify the potential health effects of proposed decisions. We systematically identified and reviewed HIAs of housing decisions in the United States, yielding 54 HIAs between 2002 and 2016. Two examined federal proposals; the others explored decisions in 20 states. A variety of organizations led the HIAs, including non-profits, public health departments, and academic institutions. The primary decision-makers each HIA sought to inform were housing, planning, and/or elected officials. Eighteen HIAs focused on housing policies, codes, design elements, and utilities in residential structures. The remaining 36 HIAs included housing as one element of broader community development and transportation planning decisions. HIA recommendations changed decisions in some cases, and the assessment process helped strengthen connections between public health and housing decision-makers. To illustrate key characteristics of housing HIAs, we purposefully selected three HIAs and described the decisions they informed in detail: off-campus student housing in Flagstaff, Arizona; a rental housing inspections program in Portland, Oregon; and revitalization plans for a major thoroughfare in a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. With a few exceptions, federal, state, and local agencies in the U.S. are not required to consider the health impacts of housing decisions, such as where housing is sited, how it is designed and constructed, and policies for ensuring that it is affordable and safe. HIA has emerged as a tool for advocates, health and housing practitioners, and policymakers to fill this gap. However, few studies have examined whether HIAs do in fact change housing decisions, shift the way that decision-makers think, or ultimately shift determinants of health (e.g., housing affordability and quality). This review demonstrates that HIAs can facilitate the consideration of health during housing decision-making. Housing HIAs can also help decision-makers address commonly overlooked effects, such as changes to social cohesion, and improve civic participation by engaging communities in the decisionmaking process.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/use-health-impact-assessments-housing-sector/docview/2563063151/se-2?accountid=14784| |Comparisons of Physical Activity and Walking Between Korean Immigrant and White Women in King County, WA.||Baek, So-Ra; Moudon, & Minority Health||2016||Journal Article||Immigrant and minority women are less physically active than White women particularly during leisure time. However, prior research demonstrates that reported household physical activity (PA) and non-leisure time walking/biking were higher among the former.

Time spent in total PA, walking, and home-based PA was higher among Whites than Korean immigrants regardless of PA type or location. 58 % of the White women but only 20 % of the Korean women met CDC's PA recommendations. Socio-economic status, psychosocial factors, and participants' neighborhood built environmental factors failed to account for the observed PA differences between these groups.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/comparisons-physical-activity-walking-between/docview/1829707476/se-2?accountid=14784| |Utilitarian and Recreational Walking Among Spanish- and English-Speaking & Minority Health||2017||Journal Article||Walking among Latinos in US Micropolitan towns may vary by language spoken. In 2011-2012, we collected telephone survey and built environment (BE) data from adults in six towns located within micropolitan counties from two states with sizable Latino populations. We performed mixed-effects logistic regression modeling to examine relationships between walking and recreational walking, accounting for socio-demographic, lifestyle and BE characteristics. Low-income SSLs reported higher amounts of utilitarian walking than ENLs (p = 0.007), but utilitarian walking in this group decreased as income increased. SSLs reported lower amounts of recreational walking than ENLs (p = 0.004). ESL-ENL differences were not significant. We identified no statistically significant interactions between ethnicity-language group and BE characteristics. Approaches to increase walking in micropolitan towns with sizable SSL populations may need to account for this group's differences in walking behaviors.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/utilitarian-recreational-walking-among-spanish/docview/1873284371/se-2| |Crime Generators in Rebecca J.||Journal of Quantitative Criminology||2021||Journal Article||Objectives The present study tests hypotheses regarding the moderating influence of neighborhood-level criminal opportunity on the relationship between crime generators and block-level crime. Methods We first estimated multilevel negative binomial regression models for violent, property, and drug crimes to identify crime-type specific crime generators on each block. We then estimated a series of crime-type specific models to examine whether the effects of violent, property, and drug crime generators are moderated by three census block group-level indicators of neighborhood criminal opportunity-concentrated disadvantage, vehicular traffic activity, and civic engagement. Results The positive relationship between crime generators and crime on blocks was exacerbated in census block groups with high levels of concentrated disadvantage and high levels of traffic activity for all three crime types. The effects of crime generators on block-level crime were significantly tempered in census block groups with high levels of civic engagement. Conclusions Particular place types do not generate crime similarly across varying neighborhood contexts. Rather, the criminogenic effects of micro-places appear to be exacerbated in neighborhoods with extensive criminal opportunity and tempered in neighborhoods with less criminal opportunity.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/crime-generators-context-examining-place/docview/2532441514/se-2?accountid=14784| |Modeling scale-dependent landscape pattern, dispersal, and connectivity from the perspective of the organism||Walters, Steven||LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY||2007||Journal Article||Understanding the impacts of habitat fragmentation on dispersal is an important issue in landscape and conservation ecology. Here I examine the effects of fine- to broad-scale patterns in landscape structure on dispersal success of organisms with differing life-history traits. An individual-based model was used to simulate dispersal of amphibian-like species whose movements were driven by land cover and moisture conditions. To systematically control spatial pattern, a landscape model was created by merging simulated land cover maps with synthetic topographic surfaces. Landscapes varied in topographic roughness and spatial contagion in agriculture and urban land cover. Simulations included three different species types that varied in their maximum potential dispersal distances by 1-, 2-, or 4-fold. Two sets of simulations addressed effects of varying aspects of landscape structure on dispersal success. In the first set of simulations, which incorporated variable distances between breeding patches, dispersal success was lowest for all species types when anthropogenic cover was patchily distributed. In the second set, with interpatch distances held constant as landscape composition varied, dispersal success decreased as anthropogenic cover became spatially contagious. Both sets revealed strong main effects of species characteristics, interpatch distances and landscape composition on dispersal success; furthermore, scale-dependent patterns in land cover and moisture gradients had a stronger effect on longer- than shorter-ranging species types. Taken together, these simulations suggest that heuristic conservation strategies could potentially be developed based on important but limited life landscape context effects; individual-based models| |Predicting land cover change and avian used an integrated modeling approach to simulate future land cover and predict the effects of future urban development and land cover on avian diversity in the Central Puget Sound region of Washington State, USA. We parameterized and applied a land cover change model (LCCM) that used output from a microsimulation model of urban development, UrbanSim, and biophysical site and landscape characteristics to simulate land cover 28 years into the future. We used 1991, 1995, and 1999 Landsat TM-derived land cover data and three different spatial partitions of our study area to develop six different estimations of the LCCM. We validated model simulations with 2002 land cover. We combined UrbanSim land use outputs and LCCM simulations to predict changes in avian species richness. Results indicate that landscape composition and configuration were important in explaining land cover change as well as avian species response to landscape change. Over the next 28 years, urban land cover was predicted to increase at the expense of agriculture and deciduous and mixed lowland forests. Land cover changes were predicted to reduce the total number of avian species, with losses primarily in native forest specialists and gains in common synanthropic species such as the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). The integrated modeling framework we present has potential applications in urban and natural resource planning and management and in assessing of the effects of policies on land development, land cover, and avian biodiversity.||SOUTHERN Huang, Shih-Kai; Wei, Hung-Lung; Samuelson, Charles D.||NATURAL HAZARDS||2016||Journal Article||To provide people with more specific information about tornado threats, the National Weather Service has replaced its county-wide warnings with smaller warning polygons that more specifically indicate the risk area. However, tornado warning polygons do not have a standardized definition regarding tornado strike probabilities (p (s)) so it is unclear how warning recipients interpret them. To better understand this issue, 155 participants responded to 15 hypothetical warning polygons. After viewing each polygon, they rated the likelihood of a tornado striking their location and the likelihood that they would take nine different response actions ranging from continuing normal activities to getting in a car and driving somewhere safer. The results showed participants inferred that the p (s) was highest at the polygon's centroid, lower just inside the edges of the polygon, still lower (but not zero) just outside the edges of the polygon, and lowest in locations beyond that. Moreover, higher p (s) values were associated with lower expectations of continuing normal activities and higher expectations of seeking information from social sources (but not environmental cues) and higher expectations of seeking shelter (but not evacuating in their cars). These results indicate that most people make some errors in their p (s) judgments but are likely to respond appropriately to the p (s) they infer from the warning polygons. Overall, the findings from this study and other research can help meteorologists to better understand how people interpret the uncertainty associated with warning polygons and, thus, improve tornado |Perceptions, behavioral expectations, and implementation timing for response actions in a hurricane emergency||Huang, Shih-Kai; Wu, Hazards||2017||Journal Article||This study examined the perceived attributes, behavioral expectations, and expected implementation timing of 11 organizational emergency response actions for hurricane emergencies. The perceived attributes of the hurricane response actions were characterized by two hazard-related attributes (effectiveness for person protection and property protection) and five resource-related attributes (financial costs, required knowledge/skill, required equipment, required time/effort, and required cooperation). A total of 155 introductory psychology students responded to a hypothetical scenario involving an approaching Category 4 hurricane. The data collected in this study explain previous findings of untimely protective action decision making. Specifically, these data reveal distinctly different patterns for the expected implementation of preparatory actions and evacuation recommendations. Participants used the hazard-related and resource-related attributes to differentiate among the response actions and the expected timing of implementation. Moreover, participants' behavioral expectations and expected implementation timing for the response actions were most strongly correlated with those actions' effectiveness for person protection. Finally, participants reported evacuation implementation times that were consistent with a phased evacuation strategy in which risk areas are evacuated in order of their proximity to the coast. However, the late initiation of evacuation in risk areas closest to the coast could lead to very late evacuation of risk areas farther inland.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/perceptions-behavioral-expectations/docview/1917626975/se-2?accountid=14784| |How do built-environment factors affect travel behavior? A spatial analysis at different geographic scales||Hong, Jinhyun; Shen, Qing; Zhang, Lei||TRANSPORTATION||2014||Journal Article||Much of the literature shows that a compact city with well-mixed land use tends to produce lower vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and consequently lower energy consumption and less emissions. However, a significant portion of the literature indicates that the built environment only generates some minor-if any-influence on travel behavior. Through the literature review, we identify four major methodological problems that may have resulted in these conflicting conclusions: self-selection, spatial autocorrelation, inter-trip dependency, and geographic scale. Various approaches have been developed to resolve each of these issues separately, but few efforts have been made to reexamine the built environment-travel behavior relationship by considering these methodological issues simultaneously. The objective of this paper is twofold: (1) to better understand the existing methodological gaps, and (2) to reexamine the effects of built-environment factors on transportation by employing a framework that incorporates recently developed methodological approaches. Using the Seattle metropolitan region as our study area, the 2006 Household Activity Survey and the 2005 parcel and building data are used in our analysis. The research employs Bayesian hierarchical models with built-environment factors measured at different geographic scales. Spatial random effects based on a conditional autoregressive specification are incorporated in the hierarchical model framework to account for spatial contiguity among Traffic Analysis Zones. Our findings indicate that land use factors have highly significant effects on VMT even after controlling for travel attitude and spatial autocorrelation. In addition, our analyses suggest that some of these effects may translate into different empirical results depending on geographic scales and tour types.||LAND-USE; partnership between transit agency and shared mobility company: an incentive program for app-based carpooling||Shen, Qing; Wang, Yiyuan; Gifford, Casey||Transportation||2021||Journal Article||How should public transit agencies deliver mobility services in the era of shared mobility? Previous literature recommends that transit agencies actively build partnerships with mobility service companies from the private sector, yet public transit agencies are still in search of a solid empirical basis to help envision the consequences of doing so. This paper presents an effort to fill this gap by studying a recent experiment of shared mobility public-private partnership, the carpool incentive fund program launched by King County Metro in the Seattle region. This program offers monetary incentives for participants who commute using a dynamic app-based carpooling service. Through descriptive analysis and a series of logistic regression models, we find that the monetary incentive to encourage the use of app-based carpooling generates some promising outcomes while having distinctive limitations. In particular, it facilitates the growth of carpooling by making carpooling a competitive commuting option for long-distance commuters. Moreover, our evidence suggests that the newly generated carpooling trips mostly substitute single-occupancy vehicles, thus contributing to a reduction of regional VMT. The empirical results of this research will not only help King County Metro devise its future policies but also highlight an appealing alternative for other transit agencies in designing an integrated urban transportation system in the era of shared mobility.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/exploring-partnership-between-transit-agency/docview/2572357333/se-2?accountid=14784| |Small-scale and extensive hydrogeomorphic modification and water redistribution in a desert city and implications for regional nitrogen removal||Larson, Elisabeth K.; Grimm, Nancy B.||URBAN ECOSYSTEMS||2012||Journal Article||There are numerous examples of small-scale hydrogeomorphic manipulations within urban ecosystems. These modifications are motivated both by a need to handle storm drainage and by a human desire for aquatic ecosystems as places for recreation and aesthetics. In the Phoenix Arizona metropolitan area, two examples of these local modifications are artificial lakes and stormwater retention basins. Although lakes are not a natural feature of Sonoran Desert ecosystems, numerous artificial lakes are evident in the region. Retention basins are a common landscaping practice for preventing damage from rare but potentially large storm events. Here we attempt to quantify the heretofore unknown number and extent of these designed aquatic ecosystems and consider their potential impact on hydrologic landscape connectivity and regional nitrogen (N) removal. For lakes, we found that official GIS layers from local and state agencies had significant misclassifications and omissions. We used two published GIS datasets and state impoundment-permit information to determine the number, areal extent, and water source for artificial lakes. We discovered that there are 908-1,390 lakes in the Phoenix area, with the number varying according to level of aggregation. There are no existing GIS data on retention basins, so we employed drywell-permit data to estimate that there may be 10,000 retention basins in the region. Basic data on N stocks in these ecosystems are discussed within the context of the regional N budget. Accurate data on the extent and distribution of these designed ecosystems will be vital for water-resources planning and waterfronts are rarely designed to support biodiversity and other ecosystem services, yet have the potential to provide these services. New approaches that integrate ecological research into the design of docks and seawalls provide opportunities to mitigate the environmental impacts of urbanization and recover ecosystem function in urban waterfronts. A review of current examples of ecological design in temperate cities informs suggestions for future action. Conventional infrastructures have significant and diverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems. The impacts of conventional infrastructure are reduced where ecological designs have been implemented, particularly by projects adding microhabitat, creating more shallow water habitat, and reconstructing missing or altered rocky benthic habitats. Opportunities for future research include expanding current research into additional ecosystems, examining ecological processes and emergent properties to better address ecosystem function in ecological design, and addressing the impact of and best practices for continuing maintenance. Planned ecological infrastructure to replace aging and obsolete structures will benefit from design feedback derived from carefully executed in situ pilot studies.||COASTAL DEFENSE STRUCTURES; FIXED ARTIFICIAL Association Between Park Facilities and Duration of Physical Activity During Active Park Visits.||Stewart, Health||2018||Journal Article||Public parks provide places for urban residents to obtain physical activity (PA), which is associated with numerous health benefits. Adding facilities to existing parks could be a cost-effective approach to increase the duration of PA that occurs during park visits. Using objectively measured PA and comprehensively measured park visit data among an urban community-dwelling sample of adults, we tested the association between the variety of park facilities that directly support PA and the duration of PA during park visits where any PA occurred. Cross-classified multilevel models were used to account for the clustering of park visits (n=1553) within individuals (n=372) and parks (n=233). Each additional different PA facility at a park was independently associated with a 6.8% longer duration of PA bouts that included light-intensity activity, and an 8.7% longer duration of moderate to vigorous PA time. Findings from this study are consistent with the hypothesis that more PA facilities increase the amount of PA that visitors obtain while already active at a park.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/association-between-park-facilities-duration/docview/2109029649/se-2| |Lighting energy consumption in ultra-low energy buildings: Using a simulation and measurement methodology to model occupant behavior and lighting controls||Zhu, Panyu; Article||As building owners, designers, and operators aim to achieve significant reductions in overall energy consumption, understanding and evaluating the probable impacts of occupant behavior becomes a critical component of a holistic energy conservation strategy. This becomes significantly more pronounced in ultra-efficient buildings, where system loads such as heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation are reduced or eliminated through high-performance building design and where occupant behavior-driven impacts reflect a large portion of end-use energy. Further, variation in behavior patterns can substantially impact the persistence of any performance gains. This paper describes a methodology of building occupant behavior modeling using simulation methods developed by the Building Energy Research Center (BERC) at Tsinghua University using measured energy consumption data collected by the University of Washington Integrated Design Lab (UW IDL). The Bullitt Center, a six-story 4831 m(2) (52,000 ft(2)) net-positive-energy urban office building in Seattle, WA, USA, is one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world (2013 WAN Sustainable Building of the Year Winner). Its measured energy consumption in 2015 was approximately 34.8 kWh/(m(2)a (TM) yr) (11 kBtu/(ft(2)a (TM) yr)). Occupant behavior exerts an out-sized influence on the energy performance of the building. Nearly 33% of the end-use energy consumption at the Bullitt Center consists of unregulated miscellaneous electrical loads (plug-loads), which are directly attributable to occupant behavior and equipment procurement choices. Approximately 16% of end-use energy is attributable to electric lighting which is also largely determined by occupant behavior. Key to the building's energy efficiency is employment of lighting controls and daylighting strategies to minimize the lighting load. This paper uses measured energy use in a 330 m(2) (3550 ft(2)) open office space in this building to inform occupant profiles that are then modified to create four scenarios to model the impact of behavior on lighting use. By using measured energy consumption and an energy model to simulate the energy performance of this space, this paper evaluates the potential energy savings based on different occupant behavior. This paper describes occupant behavior simulation methods and evaluates them using a robust dataset of 15 minute interval sub-metered energy consumption data. Lighting control strategies are compared via simulation results, in order to achieve the best match between occupant schedules, controls, and energy savings. Using these findings, we propose a simulation methodology that incorporates measured energy use data to generate occupant schedules and control schemes with the ultimate aim of using simulation results to evaluate energy saving measures that target occupant behavior.||CONTROL-SYSTEMS; PATTERNS; OFFICES||lighting |The influence of street environments on fuel insights naturalistic driving||Wang, X.; Liu, C.; Kostyniuk, L.; OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY||2014||Journal Article||Fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector are a result of a three-legged stool: fuel types, vehicle fuel efficiency, and vehicle miles travelled (VMT). While there is a substantial body of literature that examines the connection between the built environment and total VMT, few studies have focused on the impacts of the street environment on fuel consumption rate. Our research applied structural equation modeling to examine how driving behaviors and fuel efficiency respond to different street environments. We used a rich naturalistic driving dataset that recorded detailed driving patterns of 108 drivers randomly selected from the Southeast Michigan region. The results show that, some features of compact streets such as lower speed limit, higher intersection density, and higher employment density are associated with lower driving speed, more speed changes, and lower fuel efficiency; however, other features such as higher population density and higher density of pedestrian-scale retails improve fuel efficiency. The aim of our study is to gain further understanding of energy and environmental outcomes of the urban areas and the roadway infrastructure we plan, design, and build and to better inform policy decisions concerned with sustainable transportation.||TRAVEL; CONSUMPTION; EMISSIONS; |Study on the Ownership of Motorized and Non-motorized Vehicles in Suburban Metro Station Areas: A Structural Equation Approach||Pan, Haixiao; Li, Jing; Chen, large-scale motorization and suburbanization, an ever greater number of households are relocated to suburban towns. The increasing average travel distance surely encourages car growth. China is now the world's largest car consumer, resulting in a series of unforeseen environmental and public health issues. On the other hand, scooters, electric bikes, and motorcycles become attractive options to substitute non-motorized bicycles. The ongoing demographic changes should also be taken in account. China has a rapidly aging population and a higher birth rate following reforms to the one-child policy allowing couples to have a second child. These changes will lead to a dramatic alteration of the household composition in the near future. Under above emerging contexts, this study aims to understand what implies the ownership of motorized and non-motorized vehicles in suburban metro station areas by means of a structural equation model. The data employed in this study are based on a household survey collected from three neighborhoods in Shanghai suburban metro station areas in 2010. The major findings include: (1) Income is a decisive element in car ownership. Specifically, high-income households have higher propensity to own a car, while middle and poor income families tend to own scooters, electric bikes, motorcycles, or bicycles. (2) Workplace built environment features or mode preferences are not essential to understanding vehicle ownership in Chinese context. (3) Stem families are more likely to own cars; the presence of a child or a senior family member increases the probability of owning a car by enlarging the household. (4) The results estimated for core family and DINK (couple with no child) family are highly consistent, and these families are less likely to own cars. Therefore, transport policies may focus more on households. Providing safe, pleasant, and efficient pedestrian and bicycle paths for children and seniors may decrease the attractiveness of owning cars.||Suburban metro station areas; Ownership of motorized and non-motorized vehicles; environment; Mode preferences; Family composition; Structural |Project Risk Factors Facing Construction Management Firms||Park, Kyungmo; Lee, Hyun Woo; Choi, Kunhee; Lee, Seung-Hyun||International Journal of Civil Engineering||2019||Journal Article||Very little is known about the project risk factors that affect construction management (CM) firms, which often struggle due to a lack of effective risk management practices. This study investigates the risk factors critical to project execution in CM firms and ranks them using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) methods. Interviews with executives at the top 15 Korean CM firms are carried out to identify major risk factors in the CM sector, and a survey is used to develop priority ranking. We find that payment delays and project delays are the two most critical risk factors affecting CM firms because of (1) lack of communication between headquarters and field offices, (2) shift of responsibility from headquarters to a field office, (3) absence of regular monitoring of project progress, and (4) ex-post management practices. The findings presented in this study should assist CM firms in establishing more robust risk management practices, thereby improving firms' profitability, project performance, and customer satisfaction.||CM| |COUNTRYSIDE SCENIC ASSESSMENT - TOOLS AND AN APPLICATION||SCHAUMAN, is a band of urban development stretching from the Canadian city of Vancouver, British Columbia to the US city of Eugene, Oregon, The rate and pattern of urbanization there have produced deep public concern over growth related problems and negative environmental consequences, City and regional plans have been prepared in response to these conditions with the common goal of promoting more sustainable urbanization.

Despite extensive research in other industry domains, the construction industry has been passive in exploring the impact of a color scheme: perception-related accidents have been effectively diminished by its implementation. The research demonstrated that the use of appropriate color schemes could improve the actions and psychology of workers on site, thereby increasing their perceptions of potentially dangerous situations. As a preliminary study, the objects selected by rigorous analysis on accident reports were workwear, safety net, gondola, scaffolding, and safety passage. The colors modified on site for temporary facilities were adopted from existing theoretical and empirical research that suggests the use of certain colors and their combinations to improve visibility and conspicuity while minimizing work fatigue. The color schemes were also tested and confirmed through two workshops with workers and managers currently involved in actual projects. The impacts of color schemes suggested in this paper are summarized as follows. First, the color schemes improve the conspicuity of facilities with other on site components, enabling workers to quickly discern and orient themselves in their work environment. Secondly, the color schemes have been selected to minimize the visual work fatigue and monotony that can potentially increase accidents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

P.||Accident Analysis & Prevention||2015||Journal Article||Walking is a popular form of physical activity associated with clear health benefits. Promoting safe walking for pedestrians requires evaluating the risk of pedestrian motor vehicle collisions at specific roadway locations in order to identify where road improvements and other interventions may be needed. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the risk of pedestrian collisions at intersections and mid-blocks in Seattle, WA. The study used 2007-2013 pedestrian motor vehicle collision data from police reports and detailed characteristics of the microenvironment and macroenvironment at intersection and mid-block locations. The primary outcome was the number of pedestrian motor vehicle collisions over time at each location (incident rate ratio [IRR] and 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). Multilevel mixed effects Poisson models accounted for correlation within and between locations and census blocks over time. Analysis accounted for pedestrian and vehicle activity (e.g., residential density and road classification). In the final multivariable model, intersections with 4 segments or 5 or more segments had higher pedestrian collision rates compared to mid-blocks. Non-residential roads had significantly higher rates than residential roads, with principal arterials having the highest collision rate. The pedestrian collision rate was higher by 9% per 10 feet of street width. Locations with traffic signals had twice the collision rate of locations without a signal and those with marked crosswalks also had a higher rate. Locations with a marked crosswalk also had higher risk of collision. Locations with a one-way road or those with signs encouraging motorists to cede the right-of-way to pedestrians had fewer pedestrian collisions. Collision rates were higher in locations that encourage greater pedestrian activity (more bus use, more fast food restaurants, higher employment, residential, and population densities). Locations with higher intersection density had a lower rate of collisions as did those in areas with higher residential property values. The novel spatiotemporal approach used that integrates road/crossing characteristics with surrounding neighborhood characteristics should help city agencies better identify high-risk locations for further study and analysis. Improving roads and making them safer for pedestrians achieves the public health goals of reducing pedestrian collisions and promoting physical activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The sample is drawn from the Seattle Department of Transportation bicycle collision profiles. This study classifies the cyclist injury types as property damage only, possible injury, evident injury, and severe injury or fatality. Our modeling outcomes show that: (1) injury severity is negatively associated with employment density; (2) severe injury or fatality is negatively associated with land use mixture; (3) lower likelihood of injuries is observed for bicyclists wearing reflective clothing; (4) improving street lighting can decrease the likelihood of cyclist injuries; (5) posted speed limit is positively associated with the probability of evident injury and severe injury or fatality; (6) older cyclists appear to be more vulnerable to severe injury or fatality; and (7) cyclists are more likely to be severely injured when large vehicles are involved in crashes. One implication drawn from this study is that cities should increase land use mixture and development density, optimally lower posted speed limits on streets with both bikes and motor vehicles, and improve street lighting to promote bicycle safety. In addition, cyclists should be encouraged to wear reflective clothing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant problem remains the effort which must be expended during ontology construction. This involves collecting the domain-related vocabularies, developing the domain concept hierarchy, and defining the properties of each concept and the relationships between concepts. Recently several engineering handbooks have described detailed domain knowledge by organizing the knowledge into categories, sections, and chapters with indices in the appendix. This paper proposes the extraction of concepts, instances, and relationships from a handbook of a specific domain to quickly construct base domain ontology as a good starting point for expediting the development process of more comprehensive domain ontology. The extracted information can also be reorganized and converted into web ontology language format to represent the base domain ontology. The generation of a base domain ontology from an Earthquake Engineering Handbook is used to illustrate the proposed approach. In addition, quality evaluation of the extracted base ontology is performed and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of Job Hazard Analysis is commonly used to mitigate and control these occupational hazards. This technique analyzes the major tasks in a construction activity, identifies all potential task-related hazards, and suggests safe approaches to reduce or avoid each of these hazards. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of leveraging existing construction safety resources to assist JHA, aiming to reduce the level of human effort required. Specifically, the authors apply ontology-based text classification (TC) to match safe approaches identified in existing resources with unsafe scenarios. These safe approaches can serve as initial references and enrich the solution space when performing JHA. Various document modification strategies are applied to existing resources in order to achieve superior TC effectiveness. The end result of this research is a construction safety domain ontology and its underlying knowledge base. A user scenario is also discussed to demonstrate how the ontology supports JHA in practice.

Eddy-covariance measurements potentially provide detailed data on CO2 exchange and responses to the environment in these forests, but accurate estimates of the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) require careful analysis of data representativity, treatment of data gaps, and correction for systematic errors. This study uses the comprehensive data from our study site in an old-growth tropical rainforest near Santarem, Brazil, to examine the biases in NEE and R-eco potentially associated with the two most important sources of systematic error in Eddy-covariance data: lost nighttime flux and missing canopy storage measurements. We present multiple estimates for the net carbon balance and Reco at our site, including the conventional u* filter, a detailed bottom-up budget for respiration, estimates by similarity with Rn-122, and an independent estimate of respiration by extrapolation of daytime Eddy flux data to zero light. Eddy-covariance measurements between 2002 and 2006 showed a mean net ecosystem carbon loss of 0.25 +/- 0.04 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), with a mean of 8.60 +/- 10.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at our site. We found that lost nocturnal flux can potentially introduce significant bias into these results. We develop robust approaches to correct for these biases, showing that, where appropriate, a site-specific u* threshold can be used to avoid systematic bias in estimates of carbon exchange. Because of the presence of gaps in the data and the day-night asymmetry between storage and turbulence, inclusion of canopy storage is essential to accurate assessments of NEE. We found that short-terrn measurements of storage may be adequate to accurately model storage for use in obtaining ecosystem carbon balance, at sites where storage is not routinely measured. The analytical framework utilized in this study can be applied to other Eddy-covariance sites to help correct and validate measurements of the carbon cycle and its components. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The observation networks of pan evaporation (E-pan) were established and maintained worldwide for a long history. All the pans in the world consist of water body and pan wall, which includes side wall, pan rim and (if any) pan bottom. Since the pan wall will affect E-pan by radiation absorption and heat conduction, once pan wall absorbs and conducts more heat for vaporizing than water body in a pan, observed E-pan dynamics will greatly deviate E-ow causing uncertainties and errors in estimating E-ow. Thus, this study calculated E-pan at 767 meteorological stations in China and quantified the contributions of water body and pan wall on E-pan trends. For China as a whole, E-pan decreased at -3.75 mm/a(2) and increased at 1960-1993 and 1993-2016, respectively. 84% of E-pan trends were contributed by water body. For 767 stations, E-pan trends of 84 and 96 stations were dominated by pan wall during 1960-1993 and 1993-2016, respectively. Since pan wall contributed more than half of E-pan trends for (similar to)23% of the stations in China, the impacts of pan wall on E-pan dynamics cannot be ignored.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/unignorable-impacts-pan-wall-on-evaporation/docview/2253272491/se-2?accountid=14784| |Effects of malocclusion and its treatment on the quality of life of adolescents||Taylor, Kelly Ryan; Kiyak, DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS||2009||Journal Article||Introduction: The relationship between malocclusion and quality of life (QoL) is complex and not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether malocclusion and its treatment influence an adolescent's general and oral health-related QoL. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional design with a longitudinal component was used. Clinical and self-reported data were collected from 293 participants aged 11 to 14. The children were recruited from orthodontic and pediatric dental clinics at the University of Washington and a community health clinic in Seattle. The participants were classified into precomprehensive orthodontic (n = 93), postinterceptive orthodontic (n = 44), and nonorthodontic comparison (n = 156) groups. Assessments of dental esthetics and occlusion were evaluated with the Index of Complexity, Outcome, and Need. Three QoL questionnaires were completed: Youth Quality of Life to assess general QoL, Children's Oral Health-Related Quality of Life to assess oral health QoL, and Treatment Expectations and Experiences to evaluate participants' expectations for changes in specific aspects of their lives. Nonparametric tests were used for all analyses. Results: In general, overall and oral health QoL were high in this population. The instruments were correlated so that when oral health QoL improved, so did general QoL. No differences were found in these measurements between the university and community health clinics. Nor were there differences between the 3 study groups on general QoL and oral health QoL. There was little effect of malocclusion complexity on any QoL measure. Both preorthodontic and postorthodontic participants expected improvements in their health, oral function, appearance, and social well-being after orthodontic treatment; the postinterceptive sample's posttreatment experiences were with pretreatment expectations in all domains. Conclusions: Malocclusion and orthodontic treatment do not appear to affect general or oral health QoL to a measurable degree, despite subjective and objective evidence for improved appearance, oral function, health, and social well-being. Geographic Information Systems for Enhancing Research Relevant to Policy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Weight||Matthews, Stephen A.; Moudon, Anne Vernez; Daniel, Mark||AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE||2009||Journal Article||Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was a theme for one Of the four workgroups convened for the Measures of the Food and Built Environment meeting held in Bethesda, Maryland in November 2007. This summary of group discussions frames several critical conceptual, methodologic, and data challenges regarding the use of GIS to enhance research relevant to policy oil diet, physical activity, and weight. Broad recommendations are offered in five areas: (1) theoretical and conceptual development in framing place effects oil health; (2) contextualizing people and spatial behavior in built environments and improving empirical representations of place; (3) geospatial data availability, quality, and standards; (4) privacy and confidentiality, and, (5) building capacity in GIS personnel and infrastructure. These topics are inter-related. Although our discussion focuses on issues relevant to the role of the built environment in diet and physical activity outcomes, our recommendations also are salient to health and environment research Urban Environment: How Ambient Community Noise Affects Health and What Can Be Done About It||Moudon, Anne Vernez||American Journal of Preventive Medicine||2009||Journal Article||The increasing interest in the potential effects of the community environment on individual health has so far excluded those of the acoustic environment. Yet it has long been recognized that continued exposure to elevated sound levels leads to noise-induced hearing loss. Noise is defined as unwanted sound that disturbs communication and speech intelligibility and interferes with sleep and mental tasks. Evidence points to numerous psychophysiologic outcomes of sustained exposure, including annoyance, reduced performance, aggressive behavior, and increased risk of myocardial infarction. Populated areas have experienced a steady rise in outdoor ambient noise resulting from increases in vehicular traffic and the ubiquitous use of machinery. In 2000, the WHO produced guidelines on occupational and community noise. The European Union mandated noise surveillance and abatement programs in cities. In the U.S., a few cities have revised their noise ordinances, but proactive noise reduction initiatives remain confined to new transportation infrastructure projects, thus leaving a large portion of the population at risk. Adding community noise to the public health agenda seems timely. Research needs to population-wide health effects of involuntary long-term exposure to ambient noise. Further study of the range and severity of co-morbidities will help refine the thresholds used to protect health. Policies and interventions, including health impact assessments, will require detailed data on actual ambient noise levels. Reducing noise at the source will likely require new road standards and lower allowable engine noise levels. Finally, noise abatement programs have an environmental justice dimension and need to target the at-risk population.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine new data and measures of SES for use in health research. Specifically, assessed property values are introduced as a new individual-level metric of wealth and tested for their ability to substitute for conventional area-based SES as measures of neighborhood deprivation. Methods: The analysis was conducted in 2010 using data from 1922 participants in the 2008-2009 survey of the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS). It compared the relative strength of the association between the individual-level neighborhood wealth metric (assessed property values) and area-level SES measures (including education, income, and percentage above poverty as single variables, and as the composite Singh index) on the binary outcome fair/poor general health status. Analyses were adjusted for gender, categoric age, race, employment status, home ownership, and household income. Results: The neighborhood wealth measure was more predictive of fair/poor health status than area-level SES measures, calculated either as single variables or as indices (lower DIC measures for all models). The odds of having a fair/poor health status decreased by 0.85 (95% CI=0.77, 0.93) per $50,000 increase in neighborhood property values after adjusting for individual-level SES measures. Conclusions: The proposed individual-level metric of neighborhood wealth, if replicated in other areas, could replace area-based SES measures, thus simplifying analyses of contextual effects on health.

Purpose: Differences in built environment characteristics were analyzed for home and nonhome locations using GPS data. Methods: GPS data collected in 2007-2008 were analyzed for 41 subjects in the Seattle area in 2010. Environmental characteristics for 3.8 million locations were measured using novel GIS data sets called SmartMaps, representing spatially continuous values of local built environment variables in the domains of neighborhood composition, utilitarian destinations, transportation infrastructure, and traffic conditions. Using bootstrap sampling, CIs were estimated for differences in built environment values for home (<833 m of home address) and nonhome (>1666 m) GPS locations. Results: Home and nonhome built environment values were significantly different for more than 90% of variables across subjects (p < 0.001). Only 51% of subjects had higher counts of supermarkets near than away from home. Different measures of neighborhood parks yielded varying results. Conclusions: SmartMaps helped measure local built environment characteristics for a large set of GPS locations. Most subjects had significantly different home and nonhome built environment exposures. Considering the full range of individuals' environmental exposures may improve understanding of effects of the built environment on behavior and health outcomes.

Purpose: To determine the relation between residential property values and multiple perceived (self-reported) measures of the obesogenic environment. Methods: The Seattle Obesity Study (SOS) used a telephone survey of a representative, geographically distributed sample Of 2,001 King County adults, collected in 2008-2009 and analyzed in 2012-2013. Home addresses were geocoded. Residential property values at the tax parcel level were obtained from the King County tax assessor. Mean residential property values within a 10-minute walk (833-m buffer) were calculated for each respondent. Data on multiple perceived measures of the obesogenic environment were collected by self-report. Correlations and multi-variable linear regression analyses, stratified by residential density, were used to examine the associations among perceived environmental measures, property values, and BMI. Results: Perceived measures of the environment such as crime, heavy traffic, and proximity to bars, liquor stores, and fast food were all associated with lower property values. By contrast, living in neighborhoods that were perceived as safe, quiet, clean, and attractive was associated with higher property values. Higher property values were associated, in turn, with lower BMIs among women. The observed associations between perceived environment measures and BMI were largely attenuated after accounting for residential property values. Conclusions: Environments perceived as obesogenic are associated with lower property values. Studies in additional locations need to explore to what extent other perceived environment measures can be reflected in residential property values.

Anne Vernez||American Journal of Preventive Medicine||2015||Journal Article||Background: Understanding mechanisms linking neighborhood context to health behaviors may provide targets for increasing lifestyle intervention effectiveness. Although associations between home neighborhood and obesogenic behaviors have been studied, less is known about the role of worksite neighborhood. Purpose: To evaluate associations between worksite neighborhood context at baseline (2006) and change in obesogenic behaviors of adult employees at follow-up (2007-2009) in a worksite randomized trial to prevent weight gain. Methods: Worksite property values were used as an indicator of worksite neighborhood SES (NSES). Worksite neighborhood built environment attributes associated with walkability were evaluated as explanatory factors in relationships among worksite NSES, diet, and physical activity behaviors of employees. Behavioral data were collected at baseline (2005-2007) and follow-up (2007-2009). Multilevel linear and logistic models were constructed adjusting for covariates and accounting for clustering within worksites. Product-of-coefficients methods were used to assess mediation. Analyses were performed after study completion (2011-2012). Results: Higher worksite NSES was associated with more walking (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.30, p = 0.01). Higher density of residential units surrounding worksites was associated with more walking and eating five or more daily servings of fruits and vegetables, independent of worksite NSES. Residential density partially explained relationships among worksite NSES, fruit and vegetable consumption, and walking. Conclusions: Worksite neighborhood context may influence employees' obesogenic behaviors. Furthermore, residential density around worksites could be an indicator of access to dietary and physical activity-related infrastructure in urban areas. This may be important given the popularity of worksites as venues for obesity prevention efforts.

Technologic and methodologic developments have led to a revolutionary ability to examine dynamic, high-resolution measures of temporally matched location and behavior data through GPS, accelerometry, and GIS. These advances allow the investigation of spatial energetics, high-spatiotemporal resolution data on location and time-matched energetics, to examine how environmental characteristics, space, and time are linked to activity-related health behaviors with far more robust and detailed data than in previous work. Although the transdisciplinary field of spatial energetics demonstrates promise to provide novel insights on how individuals and populations interact with their environment, there remain significant conceptual, technical, analytical, and ethical challenges stemming from the complex data streams that spatial energetics research generates. First, it is essential to better understand what spatial energetics data represent, the relevant spatial context of analysis for these data, and if spatial energetics can establish causality for development of spatially relevant interventions. Second, there are significant technical problems for analysis of voluminous and complex data that may require development of spatially aware scalable computational infrastructures. Third, the field must come to agreement on appropriate statistical methodologies to account for multiple observations per person. Finally, these challenges must be considered within the context of maintaining participant privacy and security.

This study assesses sociodemographic correlates and trends in the daily time spent walking to and from transit in the U.S. from 2001 to 2017. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2001, 2009, and 2017 National Household Transportation Survey. Data were analyzed in 2019 to assess the daily level of physical activity attained solely by walking to and from transit. Regression models were used to examine predictors of daily transit-associated walking. Results: Compared with the full National Household Transportation Survey sample, transit users who walked to and from transit tended to be younger, from households earning <$25,000 per year, in areas with rail infrastructure, and did not have a household-owned car. Transit walkers spent a median of 20 minutes per day (95% CI=18.5, 21.5) walking to and from transit in 2017, compared with a median of 19 minutes (95% CI=17.5, 20.5) in 2001. Among transit walkers, daily transitassociated physical activity was 27% higher for those residing in areas with rail infrastructure (adjusted coefficient=1.27, 95% CI=1.11, 1.46) and 34% higher for those from households earning <$25,000 per year than those earning >$99,999 per year (adjusted coefficient=1.34, 95% CI=1.15, 1.56). Conclusions: As documented in a growing literature, most public transit trips include at least some walking; thus, efforts to encourage transit use are favorable to public health. Continued monitoring by transportation surveys is important as new forms of mobility and changing demographics may impact future transit use and associated physical activity.

This paper addresses a methodological challenge in environment-behavior research: sampling respondents in relation to their built environmental characteristics. METHODS: A discussion of issues related to traditional neighborhood-based sampling serves to introduce a new spatial sampling strategy. Spatial sampling consists of defining conceptual population of interest, constructing spatial sample frame using parcel-level environmental data in GIS, examining the sample frame, determining the sampling design and size, and drawing the samples. An application of this method is illustrated using a recent study examining environmental correlates of walking and biking. RESULTS: Spatial sampling with parcel-level data ensures sufficient variations in and proper distributions of the environmental variables of interest, while controlling for the conditions of no interest. The use of the individual as unit of analysis offers an economic, generalizable, and easily interpretable approach to environment-behavior research, and discourages the potentially erroneous a priori definition of neighborhoods and aggregation problems.

In order to systematically assess and manage the volatility, this study seeks to create a quantitative decision-support model: Portfolio Analysis for Community-based PV Investment Model (PACPIM). Focusing on residential PV systems, PACPIM determines optimized portfolios by applying the Mean Variance Portfolio theory. The model is intended to play an instrumental role in: (1) maximizing the hourly electricity output of PV systems; (2) minimizing the hourly volatility in electricity output; and (3) optimizing the risk-adjusted performance of community-based PV investment. The application and framework of PACPIM were deployed with an actual residential community consisting of 24 houses and their simulated data utilizing PVWatts (R) for estimating hourly electricity production. Results reveal that the optimized portfolios developed by PACPIM (1) increased annual electricity output of PV systems by 4.6%; (2) reduced the volatility in electricity output by 4.3%; and (3) offered the highest risk-adjusted performance among all possible portfolios based on the Sharpe ratios.

However, there is no existing model available to support probabilistic valuation and design of community solar based on the uncertain nature of system performance over time. In response, the present study applies the Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory to develop a probabilistic model that can be used to increase electricity generation or reduce volatility in community solar. The study objectives include identifying the sources of uncertainties in PV valuation, developing a probabilistic model that incorporates the identified uncertainties into portfolios, and providing potential investors in community solar with realistic financial indicators. This study focuses on physical, environmental, and financial uncertainties to construct a set of optimized portfolios. Monte Carlo simulation is then performed to calculate the return on investment (ROI) and the payback period of each portfolio. Lastly, inclusion vs. exclusion of generation and export tariffs are compared for each financial indicator. The results show that the portfolio with the maximum output offers the highest ROI and shortest payback period while the portfolio with the minimum risk indicates the lowest ROI and longest payback period. This study also reveals that inclusion of tariffs can significantly influence the financial indicators, even more than the other identified uncertainties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiments were performed using a single-parameter monitoring wearable sensor (SPMWS), the ActiGraph GT9X Link, which was worn at six locations on the body, and a multi-parameter monitoring wearable sensor (MPMWS), the Zephyr BioHarnessTM3, which was worn at two body positions. One healthy male was recruited and conducted 10 experiment sessions to repeat measurements of trunk posture within our study. Measurements of upper-body thoracic bending posture during the lifting and lowering of raised deck materials in a laboratory setting were compared against video-captured observations of posture. The measurements from the two sensors were found to be in agreement during slow-motion symmetric bending activities with a target bending of <= 45. However, for asymmetric bending tasks, when the SPMWS was placed on the chest, its readings were substantially different from those of the MPMWS worn on the chest or under the armpit.

Significant work has been done on improving and assessing productivity and activity at task, project, or industry levels. Task level productivity and activity analysis are used extensively within the construction industry for various purposes, including cost estimating, claim evaluation, and day-to-day project management. The assessment is mostly performed through visual observations and after-the-fact analyses even though previous studies show automatic translation of operations data into productivity information and provide spatial information of resources for specific construction operations. An original approach is presented that automatically assesses labor activity. Using data fusion of spatio-temporal and workers' thoracic posture data, a framework was developed for identifying and understanding the worker's activity type over time. This information is used to perform automatic work sampling that is expected to facilitate real-time productivity assessment.

Recently, Physiological Status Monitors (PSMs) were validated as an accurate technology to assess physiological conditions during typical sport science and medicine testing procedures (e.g., treadmill and cycle ergometer protocols). However, sport science and medicine testing procedures cannot simulate routine construction worker movements in a comprehensive manner. Thus, this paper investigated the validity of two PSMs by comparing their measurements with gold standard laboratory instruments' measurements at rest and during dynamic activities resembling construction workforce's routine activities. Two physiological parameters such as heart rate and breathing rate were considered. Ten apparently healthy subjects participated in the study. One of the PSMs proved to be a viable technology in assessing construction workers' heart rate (correlation coefficient >= 0.74; percentage of differences within +/- 11 bpm >= 84.8%).

The safety inspection process, however, suffers from several drawbacks that hinder the efficiency, effectiveness, and analytical learning capacity of the process. Dedicated tools for user-centered information and communications technology could significantly reduce such drawbacks. This paper discusses the use of an original two-step user-centered design approach to develop and evaluate an iPad application that aims to address such drawbacks and improve the day-to-day practices and management of safety inspections. Evaluation results indicate the usefulness and practicality of the application and identify innovative uses not previously envisioned. Furthermore, the developed tool allows consistent data collection that can eventually be used to aid the development of advanced safety and health data analysis techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While conducting a field inspection, quite often safety professionals need to consult applicable construction safety standards. By doing so, they can make informed judgments on the violations and reference applicable standards. Text classification (TC) can be used to classify safety standards based on the types and causes of violations. Safety professionals can therefore use violation types and causes as indices to quickly locate applicable standards. Defining TC categories (or labels) is the first important step in performing TC, because satisfactory results cannot be achieved without appropriate TC categories. Researchers often determine applicable TC categories based on the important topics within a knowledge domain. However, not all TC categories can yield satisfactory TC results because some of them are not associated with strong and specific keywords that can be identified by text classifiers. This paper proposes a methodology with two strength measures for evaluating the appropriateness of candidate TC categories. The measures were tested on two alternative sets of candidate categories that were drafted for supporting construction field inspections. The results showed that the measures could accurately predict the relative TC performance and the satisfaction levels (satisfactory or unsatisfactory) of TC categories. Beyond the construction domain, this research provides a generalized procedure for evaluating the strength of candidate TC categories. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Wearable sensors (e.g., activity trackers and physiological monitors) have facilitated personalized objective measurement of workers' health and wellbeing. Furthermore, the TWH concept is relevant to construction workers, especially roofing workers, as they encounter high on-duty health and safety risks and have poor off-duty lifestyles. This study examined the reliability and usability of wearable sensors for monitoring roofing workers' on-duty and off-duty activities. The results demonstrated the usability of these sensors and recommended a data collection period of three consecutive days for obtaining an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.75 for heart rate, energy expenditure, metabolic equivalents, and sleep efficiency. The participants exhibited significant variations in their physical responses, health statuses, and safety behaviors. Moreover, several issues were identified in the application of wearable sensors to TWH evaluations for construction workers including roofers.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=124933998&site=ehost-live| |Socioeconomic impact construction is reported to affect the social and economic welfare of surrounding residents and local businesses in various ways. However, research studies and practical methodologies aimed at assessing to what extent the choice of a construction plan that reduces such effect are very limited. The objective of this paper is to present the development of an automated assessment methodology to fill this research gap. To this end, two formulations are presented; one based on multi-attributed utility functions and the other based on monetary compensations for disruptions caused by construction operations. Both formulations assess the impacts of construction plans on (1) increased travel distance; (2) residents' relocation; (3) business loss; (4) business closure; and (5) noise inconvenience. The proposed automated methodology is implemented in five sequential phases and utilizes Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Visual Basic Application (VBA). Using the proposed implementation, the two alternative formulations are applied to an infrastructure upgrading project in Cairo, Egypt that had five possible construction scenarios. While the two formulations resulted in the same preference order for the five scenarios, they exhibited different performance in terms of their (1) assessment relative values; (2) required input data and robustness; (3) ease of results interpretation; and (4) comprehensiveness and scalability. The developed framework shows promising results in terms of identifying and sorting the major root causes of the socioeconomic disruptions caused by dense urban construction. Results show that using the proposed methodology informs decision-making and planning at the early stages of a project, which in turn helps to reduce cost overruns and schedule delays.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=129680565&site=ehost-live| |Evidence-driven sound detection for prenotification and identification of hazards and accidents.||Lee, Article||As the construction industry experiences a high rate of casualties and significant economic loss associated with accidents, safety has always been a primary concern. In response, several studies have attempted to develop new approaches and state-of-the-art technology for conducting autonomous safety surveillance of construction work zones such as vision-based monitoring. The current and proposed methods including human inspection, however, are limited to consistent and real-time monitoring and rapid event recognition of construction safety issues. In addition, the health and safety risks inherent in construction projects make it challenging for construction workers to be aware of possible safety risks and hazards according to daily planned work activities. To address the urgent demand of the industry to improve worker safety, this study involves the development of an audio-based event detection system to provide daily safety issues to laborers and through the rapid identification of construction accidents. As an evidence-driven approach, the proposed framework incorporates the occupational injury and illness manual data, consisting of historical construction accident data classified by types of sources and events, into an audio-based safety event detection framework. This evidence-driven framework integrated with a daily project schedule can automatically provide construction workers with prenotifications regarding safety hazards at a pertinent work zone as well as consistently contribute to enhanced construction safety monitoring by audio-based event detection. By using a machine learning algorithm, the framework can clearly categorize the narrowed-down sound training data according to a daily project schedule and dynamically restrict sound classification types in advance. The proposed framework is expected to contribute to an emerging knowledge base for integrating an automated safety surveillance system into occupational accident data, significantly improving the accuracy of audio-based event detection.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=142335755&site=ehost-live| |Neurophysiological testing for assessing construction from heights is the primary cause of death and injuries at construction sites. As loss of balance has a fundamental effect on falling, it is important to understand postural regulation behavior during construction tasks at heights, especially those that require precise focus in an upright standing position (therefore, a dual-task demand on focus). Previous studies examined body sway during a quiet stance and dual tasks to understand latent factors affecting postural balance. Despite the success of these studies in discovering underlying factors, they lack a comprehensive analysis of a task's simultaneous cognitive load, postural sway, and visual depth. To address this limitation, this paper aims to examine construction workers' postural stability and task performance during the execution of visual construction tasks while standing upright on elevated platforms. To that end, two non-intrusive neurophysiological tests, a hand-steadiness task (HST) and a pursuit task (PT), were developed for construction tasks in a virtual environment (VE) as performance-based means to assess the cognitive function of workers at height. Workers' postural stability was measured by recording the mapped position of the Center of Pressure (COP) of the body on a posturography force plate, and the postural sway metrics subsequently calculated. A laboratory experiment was designed to collect postural and task performance data from 18 subjects performing the two batteries of tests in the virtual environment. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in the Root-Mean Square (RMS) of COP along the anterior-posterior axis during the Randomized Pursuit Task (RPT) and maximum body sway of the center of pressure (COP) in the mediolateral direction during both tests. Also, subjects exposed to high elevation predominately exhibit higher accuracy for RPT (P-value = 0.02) and lower accuracy for HST (P-value = 0.05). The results show that the combination of elevation-related visual depth and low-complexity dual tasks impairs task performance due to the elevation-induced visual perturbations and anxiety-driven motor responses. On the other hand, in the absence of visual depth at height, high task complexity surprisingly improves the pursuit tracking performance. As expected, during both tasks, alterations in postural control were manifested in the form of a body sway decrement as a compensatory postural strategy for accomplishing tasks at high elevation.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=142335786&site=ehost-live| |Continent-wide analysis of how urbanization affects bird-window collision America||Hager, Stephen cover surrounding buildings influence the number of bird-window collisions, yet little is known about whether bird-window collisions are associated with urbanization at large spatial scales. We initiated a continent-wide study in North America to assess how bird-window collision mortality is influenced by building characteristics, landscaping around buildings, and regional urbanization. In autumn 2014, researchers at 40 sites (N = 281 buildings) used standardized protocols to document collision mortality of birds, evaluate building characteristics, and measure local land cover and regional urbanization. Overall, 324 bird carcasses were observed (range = 0-34 per site) representing 71 species. Consistent with previous studies, we found that building size had a strong positive effect on bird-window collision mortality, but the strength of the effect on mortality depended on regional urbanization. The positive relationship between collision mortality and building size was greatest at large buildings in regions of low urbanization, locally extensive lawns, and low density structures. Collision mortality was consistently low for small buildings, regardless of large-scale urbanization. The mechanisms shaping broad-scale variation in collision mortality during seasonal migration may be related to habitat selection at a hierarchy of scales and behavioral divergence between urban and rural bird populations. These results suggest that collision prevention measures should be prioritized at large buildings in regions of low urbanization throughout North Behavioral divergence| |Comparative assessment of life cycle impacts of curtain wall mullions||Azari-N, Rahman; Kim, Yong-Woo||Building and Environment||2012||Journal Article||Glass curtain wall (Cw) systems have been inevitable elements of commercial buildings for over a century. The systems mainly consist of mullion materials and glazing units that are selected and designed to achieve the desired structural, thermal and daylighting performances as well as to meet cost and aesthetic concerns. The health and environmental life cycle impacts of CW systems, however, are not usually considered in design. The main objective of this paper is to study how change of mullion materials would affect the health and environmental impacts associated with a typical CW system over its life cycle. The mullion materials studied for the purpose of this paper include extruded aluminum, carbon steel and glulam timber. Also, the health and environmental impact categories of interest include global warming, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity. To achieve the objective, a process-based cradle-to-gate attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method was applied. Results indicate that CW system with glulam timber mullions causes the least and CW system with extruded aluminum mullions causes the most damage to the environment and human health over their life cycle. A CW system with carbon steel mullions falls in-between. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulating per-pixel luminance values and luminance distribution patterns for the entire scene allows us to analyze the occupant centric metrics and performance criteria. However, there are a number of different sky models, complex fenestration models, and simulation techniques that produce either conventional point in time images or annual luminance maps. This paper discusses the similarities and differences between different techniques; and a comparison analyses provides insight about their impact on occupant centric lighting measures. The comparisons for sky modeling include the conventional CIE skies (Clear, Intermediate, and Overcast), measurement based CIE models, Perez all-weather skies, and high dynamic range image based skies. The comparison of simulation techniques include point in time simulations, image based lighting simulations, and annual luminance simulations (threephase and five-phase methods). Results demonstrate that measurement based sky models match real world conditions with reasonable proximity, and generic CIE skies consistently underestimate the indoor lighting conditions. Annual simulation methods provide a large database of temporal luminance variations, where individual instances are comparable to point in time simulations. Long term luminance simulations provide opportunities to evaluate the percentage of the year that a given luminance based criteria is met or violated. (C)2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As one of the key drivers of BIM adopt, BIM users are significantly impact on the success level of BIM implementation. As a factor leading to information system success and indicating the continuance intention after their initial adoption, BIM user satisfaction is studied in this work. Based on the data collected from 118 BIM engineers, this study examined the influence of five potential variables (such as attitude, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, top management support and management by objective) on BIM user satisfaction in AEC industry. The result from PLS (partial least square) showed that the perceived usefulness, top management support and management by objective are significantly associated with BIM user satisfaction, and the influence of management by objective on BIM user satisfaction is much stronger than top management support and perceived usefulness. Besides, perceived ease of use and attitude have a significant influence on perceived usefulness. Moreover, top management support is found to be positive associated with management by objective. Finally, the discussion of these results was presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In China, the rural and the urban are distinguished in deeply dichotomous institutions of government, and peri-urbanization, defined as the disorderly spaces, processes and conditions of becoming urban, would appear to be a temporary stage of transition between an old rural socio-spatial order to a new urban socio-spatial order. The actual contested politics of development as-urbanization suggests otherwise, however, both on a national scale and on a community scale. The definition of development itself is at stake, and emerges unpredictably from peri-urban experience. A view of periurbanization as a process of socio-ecological adaptation is better suited to societies that have evolved in long settled, densely populated anthropogenic agrarian landscapes.

The broader goal of our work and this paper is to address how we, as a team of emerging scholars, understand and investigate 'cities' in the current century as both networked at the global scale and dynamic places for everyday interactions and processes. The paradoxes and complexity inherent to understanding the 'city' and how to address these concerns led us to develop a framework that might enrich grounded urban theory through the 'enabling constraints' of place, technology and public. The productive character of these three concepts, combined with the practical constraints and interrelationships they bring to bear, allowed us to deepen our work and produced the context for our research of Northlake.

Findings from the first wave of the pandemic.||Wang, Lan; Zhang, Surong; Yang, Wenyao; Cao, Buyang||Cities||2021||Journal Article||Effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic via appropriate management of the built environment is an urgent issue. This study develops a research framework to explore the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and influential factors related to protection of vulnerable populations, intervention in transmission pathways, and provision of healthcare resources. Relevant data for regression analysis and structural equation modeling is collected during the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, from counties with over 100 confirmed cases. In addition to confirming certain factors found in the existing literature, we uncover six new factors significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence. Furthermore, incidence during the lockdown is found to significantly affect incidence after the reopening, highlighting that timely quarantining and treating of patients is essential to avoid the snowballing transmission over time. These findings suggest ways to mitigate the negative effects of subsequent waves of the pandemic, such as special attention of infection prevention in neighborhoods with unsanitary and overcrowded housing, minimization of social activities organized by neighborhood associations, and contactless home delivery service of healthy food. Also worth noting is the need to provide support to people less capable of complying with the stay-at-home order because of their occupations or socio-economic disadvantage.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/what-county-level-factors-influence-covid-19/docview/2584777539/se-2?accountid=14784| |An empirical analysis of the influence of urban form on household travel and energy consumption||Liu, Chao; Shen, Qing||Computers, Environment & Urban Systems||2011||Journal Article||Using the 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data, this paper empirically examines the effects of urban land use characteristics on household travel and transportation energy consumption in the Baltimore metropolitan area. The results of regression analysis show that different built environment measures lead to substantially different findings regarding the importance of urban form in influencing travel behavior. Among the built environment variables used in the analysis, accessibility provides much more explanatory power than density, design and diversity measures. Moreover, this study explores approaches to modeling the connection between urban form and household transportation energy consumption. Applying Structural Equation Models (SEMs), we found that urban form does not have a direct effect either on VMT or on vehicle energy consumption. The indirect effect, however, is significant and negative, which suggests that urban form affects household travel and energy consumption through other channels. In addition, household socio-economic characteristics, such as gender and number of vehicles, and vehicle characteristics also show significant relationships between VMT and energy consumption. This empirical effort helps us understand the major data and methodology challenges. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many constructability issues need to be addressed in order to realize the full potential of this alternative. Accelerated paving encompasses three classes of activities: methods to accelerate the rate of strength gain, methods to minimize the construction time, and traffic control strategies to minimize user delay. In this paper a case study will be presented in which an AC intersection was reconstructed with portland cement concrete pavement. The entire reconstruction of the intersection, including demolition of the AC pavement and its replacement with PCCP, took place over a period of three days, starting on Thursday evening and opening the intersection to the traffic on Sunday afternoon. This paper documents this effort in order to provide practitioners additional options for rapid reconstruction of urban intersections and includes documentation of the construction process, traffic management strategies, and an analysis of the costs. The results of this investigation can be used to educate pavement construction professionals and the academic community on the use of PCCP for accelerated reconstruction of major urban intersections with minimal user and traffic disruption, using innovative construction techniques and traffic management optimization principles. This investigation produced valuable information to demonstrate that concrete pavements can be constructed efficiently and quickly. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Less is known about the role of neighborhood context in young adults (YAs), who engage in more disordered forms of alcohol use compared to other age groups. Using data collected monthly, this study examined whether YAs reported more alcohol use and consequences when they were living in neighborhoods with greater concentration of poverty. Method: This study used data from 746 participants aged 18-23 years living in the Seattle, WA, region. Surveys were administered each month for 24 consecutive months. Measures included typical number of drinks per week and past month count of alcohol-related consequences. Residential addresses at each month were geocoded and linked to census-tract level percentage of households living at or below poverty threshold. Multilevel over-dispersed Poisson models were used to estimate associations between standardized monthly deviations in tract-level poverty from one's average and alcohol outcomes. Results: Across 14,247 monthly observations, the mean number of typical drinks per week was 4.8 (SD = 7.4) and the mean number of alcohol consequences was 2.1 (SD = 3.5). On months when they were living in neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty than their average, participants reported significantly higher levels of alcohol consequences (Count Ratio = 1.05; p = .045). Conclusion: YAs may engage in more problematic forms of drinking when they reside in neighborhoods with higher levels of disadvantage. During a time of frequent residential changes, YAs moving to more disadvantaged neighborhoods may benefit from additional supports.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=143682048&site=ehost-live| |Impact of a sweetened beverage tax on beverage prices & HUMAN BIOLOGY||2020||Journal Article||Seattle's Sweetened Beverage Tax is an excise tax of 1.75 cents per ounce on sugar-sweetened beverages and is one of the highest beverage taxes in the U.S. This study examined the impact of Seattle's tax on the prices of beverages. We conducted audits of 407 retail food stores and eating places (quick service restaurants and coffee shops) before and 6 months after the tax was implemented in Seattle and in a comparison area. Ordinary least squares difference-in-differences models with store fixed effects were used to estimate the effect of the tax on prices, stratified by beverage type and store type. In secondary analyses, we assessed the effect of the tax on the price of non-taxed beverages and foods. Results from the adjusted difference-in-differences models indicated the tax was associated with an average increase of 1.58 cents per ounce among Seattle retailers, representing 90 % of the price of the tax. By store type, price increases were highest in smaller grocery stores and drug stores. By beverage type, price increases were highest for energy beverages and soda and lowest for bottled coffee and juice drinks. Prices of some nontaxed beverages also increased while the prices of select healthy foods generally did not. The sweetened beverage tax in Seattle is higher than beverage taxes in most other cities, and nearly the full cost of the tax is being passed through to consumers for many beverage types and stores types.

Life cycle carbon resulting from buildings consists of two components: operational carbon (OC) and embodied carbon (EC). Recent studies have shown the growing significance of EC because much effort has already been invested into reducing OC. In this context, it is important to estimate and reduce EC. Because of the variability and uncertainty contained in a range of conditions, the EC of building needs to be calculated based on probabilistic analysis. This study identifies and analyzes the statistical characteristics of EC emitted from building construction materials. It was aimed at buildings constructed of reinforced concrete and nine representative construction materials. Descriptive statistics analysis, correlation analysis, and a goodness-of-fit test were performed to describe the statistical characteristics of EC. In addition, a case study was carried out to show the difference between the deterministic and probabilistic estimations. Presenting statistical information on EC data and the differences between the deterministic and probabilistic values, the result shows the necessity and reasonability of the probabilistic method for EC estimation.

Attributional LCA considers processes in a supply chain which allows users to identify a process to improve to minimize the environmental impacts. However, the level of detail adopted in traditional attributional LCA is aggregate, not appropriate for process improvement efforts in the construction project context which is characterized as a complex system. This paper proposes Activity-based LCA (ABLCA) which adopts the methodology of the activity-based costing system to carry out the assessment and analysis of environmental impacts for the life cycle. The research carried out a case study on the curtain wall supply chain. The outcome of inventory analysis for each activity and environmental impact assessment showed the curtain wall supply chain process made an impact on five environmental impact categories: global warming air, acidification air, HH criteria air; eutrophication air, and photochemical smog air.

In order to enable a more comprehensive assessment of a building's environmental impact by accounting for seismic events, this project developed an environmental impact database of building component seismic damage - the largest of its kind known to date - by combining data from Carnegie Mellon University's Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) database with cost estimates of repair previously developed for FEMA's Performance Assessment Calculation Tool (PACT), a software that models probabilistic seismic damage in buildings. Fifteen indicators of environmental impacts were calculated for the repair of approximately 800 building components for up to five levels of seismic damage, capturing 'embodied' impacts related to cradle-to-gate manufacturing of building materials, products, and equipment. Analysis of the data revealed that non-structural and architectural finishes often dominated the environmental impacts of seismic damage per dollar spent in repair. A statistical analysis was performed on the data using Principal Component Analysis, confirming that embodied carbon, a popular metric for evaluating environmental impacts in building LCAs, is a suitable proxy for other relevant environmental impact metrics when assessing the impact of repairing earthquake damage of buildings.

Most building LCA studies focus on core and shell (C&S) and rarely assess mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) and tenant improvements (TI). However, C&S typologies in the commercial sector pose particular challenges to achieving net zero carbon due to the numerous renovations these building undergo through during their service life. MEP and TI are installed multiple times over the lifetime of commercial buildings leading to cumulative environmental impact caused by increasing material quantities and embodied carbon (EC). This study aimed to establish a preliminary range of material quantities and embodied carbon impacts for MEP and TI components, focusing on commercial office buildings in the Pacific Northwest. The first research stage involved quantifying material quantities while a second stage aimed to calculate Embodied Carbon Coefficients (ECC) and LCA impacts using different data sources. The embodied carbon estimates ranged from 40 to 75 kg CO(2)e/m(2) for MEP and 45-135 kg CO(2)e/m(2) for TI. However, with recurring instalments during a life span of 60 years the impacts become comparable to known impacts of core and shell systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Until recently, pedestal type PV framing systems for rooftops were basically designed using procedures from the ASCE7-10 Components and Cladding Standard for rooftop equipment. The 2011 Japanese Standard Load design guide on structures for photovoltaic arrays was useful in characterizing the pressure coefficients on rooftops, but the Standard employs different wind speed and importance factors, making its use in the US quite limited, Even the updated 2017 version is written for a different audience. Because rooftop pressure loadings are high due to flow separation, SEAOC and other organizations contracted boundary layer wind tunnel tests of panels attached to rooftops to ascertain if the ASCE7-10 equipment loadings were appropriate. The investigations resulted in new standards for pedestal-style arrays that appear in Chapter 29 of ASCE7-16. However, the new standards are limited to simple geometries and orientations, and the dynamics of the simply-supported thin PV plates do not appear to be considered. Questions regarding the ability of the boundary tunnels to simulate accurately the turbulence at the scale required for the attached panels have been raised. In response, very limited full-scale investigations in large-scale tunnels and in situ have been undertaken to calibrate the tunnel results. The results of this paper represent one of these calibration investigations. Specifically, in situ full-scale net wind pressure loadings on a rooftop PV array in a pedestal-style framing system located on the three story Hogue Technology Building of Central Washington University (CWU) in Ellensburg, Washington were measured. The CWU campus has a rural setting in a region with steady winds: Ellensburg is located in the Kittitas Breezeway portion of the Northwest wind power region. Indeed, the Wild Horse Wind and Solar Farm is located on the outskirts of town. The data described here were collected from April through August 2014. The measured net pressure coefficient time series were similar to those for rooftop pressure loadings for low-rise buildings described in the literature such as the Wind Engineering Research Field Laboratory at Texas Tech University (Ham and Bienkiewicz, 1998 [1]; Levitan and Mehta, 1992 [2]). The analysis of the net pressure time series data included an examination of the minimum, maximum, mean, and RMS values. Preliminary results suggest that the range of the values is larger than assumed in the ASCE7 Standard, and that the magnitude of the loadings vary considerably spatially over the multiple panel array. The pressure loading measurements are ongoing.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/situ-measurement-wind-pressure-loadings-on/docview/2065252963/se-2?accountid=14784| |Evaluating direct energy savings and market transformation effects: A decade of technical design assistance in the northwestern USA||Van den paper documents the direct energy savings and energy efficiency market transformation impacts of a multi-state design assistance program in the northwestern US. The paper addresses four specific aims. (1) It provides a conservative and justified estimate of the direct energy savings associated with design assistance activities of a market transformation program from 2001 to 2010. (2) It provides a rigorous methodology to evaluate direct energy savings associated with design assistance market transformation programs. (3) It provides a low-cost replicable method to predict energy savings in new buildings by evaluating the integrated design process. (4) It provides quantitative indicators useful for estimating indirect energy savings from market transformation. Applying the recommended analysis method and assuming a 12-year measure life, the direct energy savings of the population (626 buildings; 51,262,000 ft(2)) is estimated as 453 aMW (average megawatts) (electric), and 265,738.089 therms (non-electric). If the entire program budget were divided into the electric savings only, the Lab Network cost per kWh saved ranged from $0.0016 to $0.003 using the recommended method and $0.0092/kWh using the most conservative method. These figures do not isolate contextual influences or represent total resource cost. Statistically significant correlations (r(2)=0.1-0.3) between integrated design scores and energy savings are reported. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we analyze disaggregated delinquency information at the project level for the section of the program that serves households in the lowest income range (Faixa 1). Our analysis of program performance in six metropolitan regions shows an overall level of delinquency of 28% as of the end of 2015. We identify four hypotheses to explain this elevated level of delinquency: the peripheral location of the units, insufficient income to cover ongoing costs, moral hazard in the management of the program, and organized crime in some projects. Our analysis shows that in 4 of the 6 regions, low-income projects in peripheral locations exhibit substantially higher non-payment levels and that lower income households have higher levels of delinquency. Based on our analysis, we recommend modifications to program design, including the inclusion of location criteria in subsidy scaling. The findings provide evidence of the limits of MCMV Faixa l's approach to solving Brazilian low-income housing needs and contribute to an emerging body of literature pointing to the importance of location in housing programs.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=134151521&site=ehost-live| |Genetic and environmental influences on residential location in the Glen E.; Dedra||Health & Place||2012||Journal Article||We used a classical twin design and measures of neighborhood walkability and social deprivation, using each twin's street address, to examine genetic and environmental influences on the residential location of 1389 same-sex pairs from a US community-based twin registry. Within-pair correlations and structural equation models estimated these influences on walkability among younger (ages 18-24.9) and older (ages 25+) twins. Adjusting for social deprivation, walkability of residential location was primarily influenced by common environment with lesser contributions of unique environment and genetic factors among younger twins, while unique environment most strongly influenced walkability, with small genetic and common environment effects, among older twins. Thus, minimal variance in walkability was explained by shared genetic effects in younger and older twins, and confirms the importance of environmental factors in walkability of residential locations.

This study observed adults living in the Seattle metropolitan area (n=671) for one week using accelerometer, GPS, and travel diary. Park visits, measured both objectively (GPS) and subjectively (travel diary), were temporally linked to accelerometer-measured PA. Park visits occurred at 1.4 per person-week. Participants who visited parks at least once (n=308) had an adjusted average of 14.3 (95% Cl: 8.9, 19.6) min more daily PA than participants who did not visit a park. Even when park-related activity was excluded, park visitors still obtained more minutes of daily PA than non-visitors. Park visitation contributes to a more active lifestyle, but is not solely responsible for it. Parks may best serve to complement broader public health efforts to encourage PA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed the Automatic Context Measurement Tool, which measures neighborhood environment characteristics from public data for any point location in the United States. We explored these characteristics in home neighborhood environments in relation to walking identified from integrated GPS, accelerometer, and travel log data from 681 residents of King Country, WA. Of 146 neighborhood characteristics, 92 (63%) were associated with walking bout counts after adjustment for individual characteristics and correction for false discovery.

A sample of 375 adults wore a global positioning system (GPS) data logger and accelerometer over 2 weeks under free-living conditions. Analytically, the amount of neighborhood physical activity measured objectively varies substantially, not only due to buffer shape and size, but by how GPS-based activity bouts are identified with respect to containment within neighborhood buffers. To move the neighborhood-effects literature forward, it is critical to delineate the spatial extent of the neighborhood, given how different ways of measuring GPS-based activity containment will result in different levels of physical activity across different buffer types and sizes.||BUILT ENVIRONMENT; |Association of neighborhood physical activity opportunities with incident cardiovascular disease in the Cardiovascular Health Study.||Garg, Parveen K.; Article||We determined associations of cumulative exposures to neighborhood physical activity opportunities with risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). We included 3595 participants from the Cardiovascular Health Study recruited between 1989 and 1993 (mean age = 73; 60% women; 11% black). Neighborhood environment measures were calculated using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and annual information from the National Establishment Time Series database, including the density of (1) walking destinations and (2) physical activity/ recreational facilities in a 1- and 5-km radius around the respondent's home. Incident CVD was defined as the development of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death and associations with time to incident CVD were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 1986 incident CVD cases occurred over a median follow-up of 11.2 years. After adjusting for baseline and time-varying individual and neighborhood-level confounding, a one standard deviation increase in walking destinations and physical activity/recreational facilities within 5 km of home was associated with a respective 7% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-0.99) and 12% (95% CI = 0.73-1.0) decreased risk of incident CVD.

What would be the economic impact to these businesses if a natural or man-made disaster were to make this infrastructure unavailable for a significant period of time? How long would it take for the owners of small businesses, which provide the foundation for economic recovery, to give up and move away? Are metropolitan regions prepared for this risk? This paper draws on publicly available reports of telecom hotel investments to examine the economic risks that such telecommunications hubs pose at the regional scale. New York City and Seattle are two urban areas that depend on key investments in telecom hotels. In the Pacific Northwest, these assets are located downtown, primarily in the center of the urban real estate market of Seattle. Although the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 were directed at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, collateral damage to a major telecommunications hub brought outages during and after the attacks that highlighted the serious risk posed to small- and mid-sized businesses from disruptions in telecommunications service. The Seattle case study illustrates the potential to learn from the experience in Lower Manhattan and apply this knowledge across the United States. Regional economic analysis of the benefits of and the means to protect small- and mid-sized businesses can provide the basis for strategic investments that minimize economic loss and reduce the recovery time.

While they are motivated to capture efficiencies, the public entities increasingly rely on information systems that are dependent on energy and related civil structures. This reliance is incongruous with the widespread awareness of aging infrastructure - decaying for lack of investment - in cities across the United States. Important questions that come up in this environment of persistent expansion of the use of digital assets are the following: What threat does aging infrastructure pose to governmental reliance on computing infrastructures? How are local governments responding to this threat? Are the solutions posed appropriate to the problem, or do they pose new and different threats? This paper uses a case involving the disruption of a local government data center due to the failure of an electrical bus to illustrate how the threats of aging infrastructure grow, quietly and steadily, into emergencies, on par with the catastrophic events encountered in the context of critical infrastructure protection. The decisions precipitating the disruption are routine, borne of circumstances shared by agencies that are pressed to maintain services with scarce resources. Patterns of capital investment and management explain the emergence of crises in routine operations. If, as in the case described in this paper, deferred maintenance motivates public agents to explore private cloud services, then governments may solve several problems, but may also be exposed to new risks as they enter into arrangements from which they are unable to exit.

The results show that earthquake shaking, combined with knowledge that this can cause a tsunami, was the most common source of first awareness about a possible tsunami and that broadcast media were the most common first social sources of warnings. Radio was an important source of additional information, as were face-to-face contacts and phone calls. Contrary to previous research, few of the recommended elements of a warning message were communicated to those at risk and none of these message elements was significantly correlated with evacuation. Nonetheless, two thirds of coastal residents and half of inland residents began evacuations within 15 min after the earthquake. Those who had participated in earthquake hazard awareness meetings had higher risk perceptions but were no more likely to evacuate to higher ground or evacuate promptly. This study's results are broadly consistent with previous findings on disaster response but raise a number of unresolved questions about behavioral response to rapid onset disasters.

To examine how earthquake early warnings might be received on the U.S. West coast, we conducted surveys of residents in the west coast states of Washington, Oregon and California (N=2595) through Google paywall intercept surveys administered in three rounds between September 2014 and September 2015. A majority of residents in all states (61% WA, 54% OR, 70% CA) have personally experienced an earthquake. Those who have experienced an earthquake perceive higher risk and greater potential for effectively reducing that risk with earthquake early warning. Although respondents feel that federal and local government should pay for earthquake early warning, almost two-thirds report being willing to pay something for an Earthquake Early Alert app on [their] smartphone or personal computer. Median willingness to pay per month is $1. Perceived risk, perceived effectiveness of earthquake early warning, and anticipated or experienced emotional responses to earthquakes influence judgments of and preferences for earthquake early warning, although personal experience of earthquakes conditions these influences.

Participants judged each polygon's numerical strike probability (p(s)) and reported the likelihood of taking seven different response actions. The deterministic polygon display produced p(s) that were highest at the polygon's centroid and declined in all directions from there. The deterministic polygon + radar display, the gradient polygon display, and the gradient polygon + radar display produced p(s) that were high at the polygon's centroid and also at its edge nearest the tornadic storm cell. Overall, p(s) values were negatively related to resuming normal activities, but positively correlated with expectations of resuming normal activities, seeking information from social sources, seeking shelter, and evacuating by car. These results replicate the finding that participants make more appropriate p(s) judgments when polygons are presented in their natural context of radar images than when the polygons are presented in isolation and that gradient displays appear to provide no appreciable benefit. The fact that p(s) judgments had moderately positive correlations with both sheltering (a generally appropriate response) and evacuation (a generally inappropriate response) provides experimental confirmation that people threatened by actual tornadoes are conflicted about which protective action to take.||PROTECTIVE ACTION; to prepare after the 2013 Cook Strait Earthquake, N.Z||Doyle, Emma E. H.; McClure, John; Potter, Sally JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION||2018||Journal Article||We investigated responses to the 2013 Cook Strait earthquake sequence, New Zealand. This included two foreshocks (M5.7 and M5.8) and a mainshock doublet pair: M6.5 Cook Strait (CS) earthquake on 21st July and M6.6 Lake Grassmere (LG) earthquake on Friday 16th August. We examined relationships between preparedness, experience and beliefs during the earthquakes, as well as concern and subsequent preparedness actions. Results indicate that earthquake characteristics (e.g., time, location) influence the types of preparedness actions. While there was a reduction in new actions from the first mainshock doublet earthquake (CS) to the second (LG), there were a large number of participants who reviewed or revisited their prior actions, related to their beliefs about impacts, in a form of problem-focused targeted action. Females took more actions than did males, and had a higher rate of immediate aftershock concern. For all participants, concern was greater after the CS earthquake than after the full earthquake sequence, supporting the findings of McClure et al. (2016) that there is a limited window after an event to maximise the opportunity for effective preparedness initiatives. Findings additionally suggest that such post-earthquake preparedness initiatives should consider the impacts that elicited the highest rate of concern in an event, and should tailor messages towards them. While this earthquake sequence resulted in low levels of impact and damage, it presents interesting findings regarding how disruption (in lieu of major damage) influences earthquake preparedness actions, which is particularly important to understand in highly active regions often exposed to smaller impact events.||SEISMIC HAZARD ADJUSTMENTS; RISK COMMUNICATION; June 17, 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand, North India||Lindell, Michael K.; Arlikatti, Sudha; DISASTER RISK REDUCTION||2019||Journal Article||The 2013 Uttarakhand flash flood was such a surprise for those at risk that the predominant source of information for their risk was environmental cues and, secondarily, peer warnings rather than official warnings. Of those who received warnings, few received information other than the identity of the flood threat. A survey of 316 survivors found that most people's first response was to immediately evacuate but some stayed to receive additional information, confirm their warnings, or engage in evacuation preparations. Unfortunately, engaging in these milling behaviors necessarily delayed their final evacuations. Mediation analysis revealed that psychological reactions mediated the relationship between information sources and behavioral responses. Further analyses revealed that immediate evacuation and evacuation delay were both predicted best by information search and positive affect, but correlation analyses indicated that a number of other models were also plausible. Final evacuation was best predicted by immediate evacuation and, to a significantly lesser extent, household together. Overall, results suggest that the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) should be considered a useful framework for examining household responses to flash floods in developing countries like India. It supports the conclusion that a household's first warning source is a function of two distinct detection and dissemination systems within a community-an official system and an informal system.

However, such investments tend to be made in the aftermath of disasters. Very little is known about the proactive planning of flood protection investments that account for uncertainties associated with flooding events. Understanding the uncertainties such as when to invest on these structures to achieve the most optimal cost-saving amount is outmost important. This study fills this large knowledge gap by developing an investment decision-making assessment framework that determines an optimal timing of flood protection investment options. It combines real options with a net present value analysis to examine managerial flexibility in various investment timing options. Historical data that contain information about river water discharges were leveraged as a random variable in the modeling framework because it may help investors better understand the probability of extreme events, and particularly, flooding uncertainties. A lattice model was then used to investigate potential alternatives of investment timing and to evaluate the benefits of delaying investments in each case. The efficacy of the proposed framework was demonstrated by an illustrative example of flood protection investment. The framework will be used to help better inform decision makers.||DECISION-MAKING||Flood protection; Real options theory; Investment decision-making| |Interpretations of aftershock advice and probabilities after the 2013 Cook Strait earthquakes, Aotearoa New Zealand||Doyle, Emma E. H.; McClure, S.; Fraser, Stuart A.; Johnston, David M.||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION||2020||Journal Article||Probabilistic statements can be a valuable tool for natural hazard risk communication, including forecasts. However, individuals often have a poor understanding of such probabilistic forecasts caused by them distorting their interpretations of event likelihoods towards the end of the time window and discounting the risk today. We investigated the use of an 'anchoring' time statement to mitigate this bias via an opportunistic survey run after the 2013 Cook Strait earthquakes, near Wellington, New Zealand. Participants rated their interpretations of likelihoods for an immediate aftershock forecast, and for an earthquake in the future. We explored the influence of aftershock and information concern, emotions and felt shaking, gender and education, as well as preparedness actions. The anchoring time window statement mitigated the skew in interpretations for the short (24 h to within 1 week) aftershock forecast statement. However, the skew still existed for the longer future earthquake forecast (7 days to within 1 year). We also found that heightened sensory experience (felt shaking) or emotional reactions (nervousness, fear, alertness) during the earthquakes was associated with an increase in the perceived likelihoods of future events. Gender was found to significantly influence results, with females rating higher levels of information concern and anxiety, and recording higher perceived likelihoods for the immediate aftershock forecast. Findings, including the importance of 'anchoring' time windows within a forecast to encourage immediate preparedness actions, support recommendations for effective crafting of these forecasts and warnings.||FALSE Michael K.; Joyner, Andrew T.; Johnston, David M.||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION||2021||Journal Article||Caldera systems such as Valley Caldera, California; Taupo, New Zealand; and Campi Flegrei, Italy, experience centuries to millennia without eruption, but have the potential for large eruptions. This raises questions about how local residents' behavioral responses to these low-probability high-consequence events differ from their responses to events, such as wildfires and earthquakes, that have higher probabilities. To examine this issue, a multi-hazard mail survey of 229 households explored perceptions of-and responses to-volcano, earthquake and wildfire hazards in the Long Valley Volcanic Region. Response efficacy was the only significant predictor of emergency preparedness, which suggests that hazard managers can increase household emergency preparedness by emphasizing this attribute of protective actions. In addition to response efficacy, expected personal consequences, hazard intrusiveness, and affective responses were all significantly related to information seeking. This indicates that hazard managers can also increase households' information seeking about local hazards and appropriate protective actions by communicating the certainty and severity of hazard impacts (thus increasing expected personal consequences) and that they communicate this information repeatedly (thus increasing hazard intrusiveness) to produce significant emotional involvement (thus increasing affective Emergency preparedness; Information |Tsunami resilience in the Cascadia Subduction Zone: A multistage model of expected evacuation mode choice||Chen, Chen; Lindell, Michael K.; Wang, Haizhong||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER REDUCTION||2021||Journal Article||Physical scientists have estimated that the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) has as much as a 25% chance to produce a M9.0 earthquake and tsunami in the next 50 years, but few studies have used survey data to assess household risk perceptions, emergency preparedness, and evacuation intentions. To understand these phenomena, this study conducted a mail-based household questionnaire using the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) as a guide to collect 483 responses from two coastal communities in the CSZ: Crescent City, CA and Coos Bay, OR. We applied multistage regression models to assess the effects of critical PADM variables. The results showed that three psychological variables (risk perception, perceived hazard knowledge, and evacuation mode efficacy) were associated with some demographic variables and experience variables. Evacuation intention and evacuation mode choice are associated with those psychological variables but not with demographic variables. Contrary to previous studies, location and experience had no direct impact on evacuation intention or mode choice. We also analyzed expected evacuation mode compliance and the potential of using micro-mobility during tsunami response. This study provides empirical evidence of tsunami preparedness and intentions to support interdisciplinary evacuation modeling, tsunami hazard education, community disaster preparedness, and Article||Building policies require owners to publicly disclose their building's energy performance. In the US, the adoption of such policies is contributing to an increased awareness among tenants and buyers and is expected to motivate the owners of less efficient buildings to invest in energy efficiency improvements. However, there is a lack of studies specifically aimed at investigating the impact of such policies on office buildings among major cities through quantitative analyses. In response, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the benchmarking policy on energy efficiency improvements decision-making and on real estate performances, by applying two interrupted time series analyses to office buildings in downtown Chicago. The initial results indicate a lack of statistically strong evidence that the policy affected the annual vacancy trend of the energy efficient buildings (represented by ENERGY STAR labeled buildings). However, the use of interrupted time series in a more in-depth analysis shows that the policy is associated with a 6.7% decrease in vacancy among energy efficient buildings. The study proposed a method to quantitatively evaluate the impact of energy policies on the real estate performance of office buildings, and the result confirms the positive impact of energy-efficient retrofits on the real estate performance. The study findings support the reasoning behind the owners' decision in implementing energy efficiency improvements in their office buildings to remain competitive in the market.

On-time delivery of PCs is critical for successful project completion because the processes involving precast concrete are the critical paths in most cases. However, existing models for scheduling PC production are not adequate for use in dynamic environments where construction projects have uncertain construction schedules because of various reasons such as poor labor productivity, inadequate equipment, and poor weather. This research proposes a dynamic model for PC production scheduling by adopting a discrete-time simulation method to respond to due date changes in real time and by using a new dispatching rule that considers the uncertainty of the due dates to minimize tardiness. The model is validated by simulation experiments based on various scenarios with different levels of tightness and due date uncertainty. The results of this research will contribute to construction project productivity with a reliable and economic precast concrete supply chain. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The construction process of the curtain wall system is mainly on the critical path and accounts for 10-15% of the total construction cost. Should curtain wall products not be timeously delivered to the construction site, construction projects are likely to fall behind schedule with most relevant activities on curtainwall installation on a critical path. However, due-date uncertainty caused by a contractor's lack of planning reliability causes the curtain wall production schedule to become complex and changes the due date after the initial order. In this regard, this study proposes a discrete event simulation-based dynamic scheduling model for curtain wall production to deliver products on time to the construction site by considering each construction project's planning reliability. Through simulation experiments, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model were tested. The results of this study will help the successful completion of construction projects by ensuring the progress of the curtain wall system construction and follow-up activities following the construction schedule.

First, we argue that mobilities, rather than negating the importance of place, shift our understanding of place and the habitual ways we relate to and bond with places as distinct from a conception of place attachment premised on fixity and stability. Second, we document how the body of research on place attachment has both reinforced and contested 'sedentaristic' assumptions criticized within the so-called 'mobilities turn' in the social sciences. Third, we present a conceptual framework, built around different modes of interrelation between fixity and flow, as a way to re-theorize, link and balance the various studies of place attachment that have grappled with mobility. Finally, we sketch out the main research implications of this framework for advancing our understanding of place attachment in a mobile world.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/between-fixities-flows-navigating-place/docview/2253192941/se-2| |Pan coefficient sensitivity to environment variables across Wei; of Hydrology||2019||Journal Article||Data of open water evaporation (E-ow), such as evaporation of lake and reservoir, have been widely used in hydraulic and hydrological engineering projects, and water resources planning and management in agriculture, forestry and ecology. Because of the low-cost and maneuverability, measuring the evaporation of a pan has been widely regarded as a reliable approach to estimate E-ow through multiplying an appropriate pan coefficient (K-p). K-p is affected by geometry and materials of a pan, and complex surrounding environment variables. However, the relationship between K-p and different environment variables is unknown. Thus, this study chose China D20 pan as an example, used meteorological observations from 767 stations and introduced the latest PenPan model to analyze the sensitivity of K-p to different environment variables. The results show that, the distribution of annual K-p had a strong spatial gradient. For all the stations, annual K-p ranged from 0.31 to 0.89, and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest. The sensitivity analysis shows that for China as a whole, K-p was most sensitive to relative humidity, followed by air temperature, wind speed and sunshine duration. For 767 stations in China, K-p was most sensitive to relative humidity for almost all the stations. For stations north of Yellow River, wind speed and sunshine duration were the next sensitive variables; while for stations south of Yellow River, air temperature was the next sensitive variable. The method introduced in this study could benefit estimating and predicting K-p under future changing environment.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/pan-coefficient-sensitivity-environment-variables/docview/2237500127/se-2?accountid=14784| |Deriving a long-term pan evaporation reanalysis dataset for two Chinese pan types.||Wang, Kaiwen; Liu, Xiaomang; Yuqi; Chen, Fei||Journal of Article||A long-term continuous and consistent pan evaporation (E-pan) reanalysis dataset will augment the analysis of E-pan distributions when the observation network is discontinuous or inconsistent, and assist in the evaluation of the outputs of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Land Surface Models (LSMs). From the 1950s to early 2000s, China had a continuous observation of the D20 pan, but this was replaced by the 601B pan across China around 2002, and thus the E-pan observation network became discontinuous and inconsistent. This study developed a long-term monthly, 0.05 degrees, continuous and consistent reanalysis dataset for both D20 and 6018 pans covering mainland China throughout 1960-2014, based on meteorological data homogenization and interpolation and E-pan assimilation. The PenPan-V3 model used inE(pan) assimilation was successfully validated by observations at 767 and 591 stations for D20 and 601B pans, respectively. Comprehensively considering the physical influence of elevation, radiation, wind speed, humidity, and air temperature, the average annual and seasonal gridded E-pan reanalyses show significant spatial dependent on proximity to the ocean and latitude, consistent with previous studies. The reanalysis dataset can be used to analyze E-pan distributions across China, including the areas without observations, and to estimate the representativeness of E-pan to atmospheric evaporative demand. The dataset has been released in two cloud servers in China and the United States, and it will continue to be maintained and updated.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/deriving-long-term-pan-evaporation-reanalysis/docview/2400452234/se-2?accountid=14784| |Environmental benefits of using hybrid CLT structure in midrise non-residential construction: An LCA based comparative case study in the U.S. Pacific Northwest||Pierobon, Francesca; environmental impact of a hybrid, mid-rise, cross-laminated timber (CLT) commercial building is evaluated and compared to that of a reinforced concrete building with similar functional characteristics. This study evaluates the embodied emissions and energy associated with building materials, manufacturing, and construction. Two alternative designs are considered for fire protection in the hybrid CLT building: 1) a 'fireproofing design', where gypsum wallboard is applied to the structural wood; and 2) a 'charring design', where two extra layers of CLT are added to the panel. The life cycle environmental impacts are assessed using TRACI 2.1 and the total primary energy is evaluated using the Cumulative Energy Demand impact method. Results show that an average of 26.5% reduction in the global warming potential is achieved in the hybrid CLT building compared to the concrete building, excluding biogenic carbon emissions. Except ozone depletion, where the difference in impact between scenarios is < 1%, replacing fireproofing with charring is beneficial for all impact categories. The embodied energy assessment of the building types reveals that, on average, the total primary energy in the hybrid CLT buildings and concrete building are similar. However, the non-renewable energy (fossil-based) use in the hybrid CLT building is 8% lower compared to that of the concrete building. As compared to the concrete building, additional 1,556 tCO(2)(e) and 2,567 tCO(2e) are stored in the wood components of the building (long-term storage of biogenic carbon) in the scenario with fireproofing and with CONCRETE; Biogenic carbon; Carbon storage| |Life-cycle cost and carbon footprint analysis for light-framed residential buildings subjected to tornado wood building construction dominates the single-family residential home market in the United States. Such buildings are susceptible to damage from extreme winds due to hurricanes in coastal areas and tornados in the Midwest. The consequences of extreme winds on the built environment and on social and economic institutions within the community can be severe and are likely to increase in the coming decades as a result of increases in urbanization and economic development and the potential impacts of changing climate in hazard prone areas. Current building practices provide minimum standards for occupant safety and health, including structural integrity, water and sanitation, lighting, ventilation, means of egress and fire protection. However, they generally do not consider building resilience, which includes robustness and an ability to recover following extreme natural hazard events. Nor do they address sustainability, the notion that building design, construction and rehabilitation should not adversely impact the environment. In this paper, we establish a generalized cost and carbon footprint life-cycle analysis methodology for examining the benefits of different building practices for residential light-frame wood construction subjected to tornado hazards. A multiobjective approach is used to reveal tradeoffs between resilient and sustainable practices for typical residential construction. We show that when the life cycle of a typical residence is considered, a balance between resilience, sustainability and cost might be achieved in design and rehabilitation of residential building construction for tornado hazards.||PERFORMANCE; crash frequency and risk in Beijing.||Chen, Peng; Sun, Feiyang; Wang, Zhenbo; Zhimin||Journal of Safety Research||2018||Journal Article||Introduction: Building a safe biking environment is crucial to encouraging bicycle use. In developed areas with higher density and more mixed land use, the built environment factors that pose a crash risk may vary. This study investigates the connection between biking risk factors and the compact built environment, using data for Beijing. Method: In the context of China, this paper seeks to answer two research questions. First, what types of built environment factors are correlated with bike-automobile crash frequency and risk? Second, how do risk factors vary across different types of bikes? Poisson lognormal random effects models are employed to examine how land use and roadway design factors are associated with the bike-automobile crashes. Results: The main findings are: (1) bike-automobile crashes are more likely to occur in densely developed areas, which is characterized by higher population density, more mixed land use, denser roads and junctions, and more parking lots; (2) areas with greater ground transit are correlated with more bike-automobile crashes and higher risks of involving in collisions; (3) the percentages of wider streets show negative associations with bike crash frequency; (4) built environment factors cannot help explain factors contributing to motorcycle-automobile crashes. Practical Applications: In China's dense urban context, important policy implications for bicycle safety improvement drawn from this study include: prioritizing safety programs in urban centers, applying safety improvements to areas with more ground transit, placing bike-automobile crash countermeasures at road junctions, and improving bicycle safety on narrower streets.

First, are built environment features and bicyclist injury severity correlated; and if so, what built environment factors most significantly relate to severe bicyclist injuries? Second, are the identified associations varied substantially among cities with different levels of bicycling and different built environments? Methods: The generalized ordered logit model is employed to examine the relationship between built environment features and bicyclist injury severity. Results: Bicyclist injury severity is coded into four types, including no injury (NI), possible injury (PI), evident injury (El), and severe injury and fatality (SIF). The findings include: (a) higher percentages of residential land and green space, and office or mixed use land are correlated with lower probabilities of El and SIF; (b) land use mixture is negatively correlated with El and SIF; (c) steep slopes are positively associated with bicyclist injury severity; (d) in areas with more transit routes, bicyclist injury is less likely to be severe; (e) a higher speed limit is more likely to correlate with SIF; and (f) wearing a helmet is negatively associated with SIF, but positively related to PI and El. Practical applications: To improve bicycle safety, urban planners and policymakers should encourage mixed land use, promote dense street networks, place new bike lanes in residential neighborhoods and green spaces, and office districts, while avoiding steep slopes. To promote bicycling, a process of evaluating the risk of bicyclists involving severe injuries in the local environment should be implemented before encouraging bicycle activities.

These data can provide objective, low-cost BE data over large regions and are often used in public health research and surveillance. Yet challenges exist in repurposing GIS data for health research. The GIS data do not always capture desired constructs; the data can be of varying quality and completeness; and the data definitions, structures, and spatial representations are often inconsistent across sources. Using the Small Town Walkability study as an illustration, we describe (a) the range of BE characteristics measurable in a GIS that may be associated with active living, (b) the availability of these data across nine U.S. small towns, (c) inconsistencies in the GIS BE data that were available, and (d) strategies for developing accurate, complete, and consistent GIS BE data appropriate for research. Based on a conceptual framework and existing literature, objectively measurable characteristics of the BE potentially related to active living were classified under nine domains: generalized land uses, morphology, density, destinations, transportation system, traffic conditions, neighborhood behavioral conditions, economic environment, and regional location. At least some secondary GIS data were available across all nine towns for seven of the 9 BE domains. Data representing high-resolution or behavioral aspects of the BE were often not available. Available GIS BE data - especially tax parcel data often contained varying attributes and levels of detail across sources. When GIS BE data were available from multiple sources, the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data could be reasonable ensured for use in research. But this required careful attention to the definition and spatial representation of the BE characteristic of interest. Manipulation of the secondary source data was often required, which was facilitated through protocols. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology involves the use of Bayesian hierarchical intrinsic conditional autoregressive model, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneities and spatial autocorrelations. The city of Seattle is selected for this empirical study, and the geospatial unit of analysis is traffic analysis zone. The primary data were obtained from collision profiles available at the Seattle Department of Transportation. The major findings of this study include: (1) the densities of 4-way intersections and more than 5-way intersections and land use mixture are positively correlated with the pedestrian crash frequency and risk; (2) sidewalk density and the proportion of steep areas are negatively associated with the pedestrian crash frequency and risk; (3) areas with a higher bus stop density are likely to have more pedestrian crashes; (4) areas with a greater proportion of industrial land use have lower pedestrian crash frequency; (5) areas with an averagely higher posted speed limit has higher pedestrian crash risk; (6) areas with a higher employment density has lower pedestrian crash risk; (7) the mode share of walking and the total number of trips are positively correlated with the pedestrian crash frequency, and the total number of trips is negatively correlated with the pedestrian crash risk. These findings provide support for planning policy making and road safety programs. Local authorities should improve walkability by providing more sidewalks and separate travel lanes for motorized traffic and pedestrians in areas with different land use purposes.

Relatively dense, mixed-use neighborhoods can have positive impacts on mobility, health, and perceptions of neighborhood safety among nearby residents, primarily through walking activity for both transit and other purposes. To examine how station areas may attract new activity, this study analyzed changes in walking around station areas among people living close to an LRT station before and after the opening of a new transit system. This study examined walking behavior among the subset of 214 participants living within one mile of one of 13 LRT stations from among a sample of residents living close or further away from a new LRT line in Seattle. They completed a survey and a travel log and wore an accelerometer and a GPS for 7 days both before (2008) and after the opening of the Seattle area LRT (2010). Walking bouts were derived using a previously developed algorithm. The main outcome was the individual-level change in the proportion of daily walking within one quarter Euclidean mile of an LRT station. Overall walking decreased from before to after the LRT opening while station area walking did not change significantly, indicating a shift in walking activity to the station areas after the introduction of LRT. Increases in the proportion of station area walking were negatively related to participants' distance between home and the nearest LRT station, peaking at <0.25 mile and decaying beyond >.0.75 mile. Male gender, college education, normal weight status, less access to cars, and frequent LRT use were also significantly associated with greater positive changes in the proportion of station area walking. The shift in walking to station areas after the completion of light rail provides evidence that the local proximate population is attracted to station areas, which may potentially benefit both transit use and TOD area economic activity. The residential catchment area for the shift in LRT area walking was < 0.75 mile of the LRT stations.

Most previous studies were limited by self-reported data on walking. In the present study, walking bouts were determined by integrating one week of accelerometry, GPS, and a travel log data among 675 adult participants in the baseline sample of the Travel Assessment and Community study at Seattle, Washington in the United State. Methods: Home neighborhood was defined as being within 0.5 mile of each participants' residence (a 10-min walk), with home neighborhood walking defined as walking bout lines with at least one GPS point within the home neighborhood. Home neighborhood walkability was constructed with seven built environment variables derived from spatially continuous objective values (SmartMaps). Collinearity among neighborhood environment variables was analyzed and variables that were strongly correlated with residential density were excluded in the regression analysis to avoid erroneous estimates. A Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) served to estimate associations between home neighborhood environment characteristics and home neighborhood walking frequency. Results: The study found that more than half of participants' walking bouts occurred in their own home neighborhood. Higher residential density and job density were the two neighborhood walkability measures related to higher likelihood and more time walking in the home neighborhood, highest tertile residential density (22.4-62.6 unit/ha) (coefficient= 1.62; 1.10-2.37). Conclusions: The large proportion of walking that takes place in the home neighborhood highlights the importance of continuing to examine the impact of the home neighborhood environment on walking. Potential interventions to increase walking behavior may benefit from increasing residential and employment density within residential areas.||BODY-MASS & HEALTH||2019||Journal Article||Objectives: Extending the health benefits of public-transit investment requires understanding how transit use affects pedestrian activity, including pedestrian activity not directly temporally or spatially related to transit use. In this study, we identified where transit users walked on transit days compared with non-transit days within and beyond 400 m and 800 m buffers surrounding their home and work addresses. Methods: We used data collected from 2008 to 2013 in King County, Washington, from 221 non-physically-disabled adult transit users, who were equipped with an accelerometer, global positioning system (GPS), and travel diary. We assigned walking activity to the following buffer locations: less than and at least 400 m or 800 m from home, work, or home/work (the home and work buffers comprised the latter buffer). We used Poisson generalized estimating equations to estimate differences in minutes per day of total walking and minutes per day of non-transit-related walking on transit days compared with non-transit days in each location. Results: We found that durations of total walking and non-transit-related walking were greater on transit days than on non-transit days in all locations studied. When considering the home neighborhood in isolation, most of the greater duration of walking occurred beyond the home neighborhood at both 400 m and 800 m; results were similar when considering the work neighborhood in isolation. When considering the neighborhoods jointly (i.e., by using the home/work buffer), at 400 m, most of the greater duration of walking occurred beyond the home/work neighborhood. However, at 800 m, most of the greater duration of walking occurred within the home/work neighborhood. Conclusions: Transit days were associated with greater durations of total walking and non-transit related walking within and beyond the home and work neighborhoods. Accordingly, research, design, and policy strategies focused on transit use and pedestrian activity should consider locations outside the home and work neighborhoods, in addition to locations within and public health: A selection of twenty project ideas from a US research roadmap||Dannenberg, Andrew L.; Rodriguez, Daniel A.; Sandt, Laura S.||JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH||2021||Journal Article||Background: Transportation policies and projects have multiple impacts on health.

The roadmap identified 44 research gaps and 122 research needs on a wide range of relevant topics. From this list, using pre-established criteria including specificity, equity, potential impact, and long-term usefulness, we selected 20 topics suitable for further research especially in academic settings. Results: We present the questions, context, and possible research approach for each of the 20 topics. These topics cover issues ranging from integrating equity into performance measures and developing forecasting models for active travel to incorporating health questions into routine household travel surveys and examining health impacts of autonomous vehicles. We added questions on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on transportation. Discussion: This list will be useful to faculty, researchers, and students as they consider topics for research in transportation and public health. Results of research on these topics could influence transportation decisions in policy making, planning and community participation, capital programming, project design, and implementation.

Paratransit services provide a lifeline for their clients' essential mobility needs, including access to medical appointments and grocery stores. In the absence of pre-existing pandemic response plans, examining transit agencies' responses to provide paratransit services during the pandemic can help inform planning for post-pandemic recovery and future disruptive events. Methods: In September 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 decision-makers, planners, and drivers working for the primary transit agency in the Seattle region - King County Metro - and its paratransit contractors. Interview questions were designed to identify current services, policy gaps, and critical challenges for recovery planning and post-pandemic paratransit services. Interview transcripts were analyzed using NVivo software to obtain essential themes. Results: The interviewees provided insights about (1) paratransit service changes in response to the pandemic, (2) anticipated impacts of a returning demand on paratransit service efficiency, equity, and quality during the recovery period, and (3) innovative approaches for maintaining post-pandemic equitable paratransit services while balancing safety measures with available resources. Conclusions: Study findings suggest that paratransit service providers should consider (1) developing guidelines for future disruptive events, (2) examining alternative methods for food delivery to clients, (3) planning scenarios for delivering equitable services in the post-pandemic recovery period, and (4) increasing resilience possibly by establishing partnerships with transportation network companies.||Paratransit; Mobility; Equity; COVID19 pandemic; A systematic review of applicable technologies||Nnaji, Chukwuma; Gambatese, John; Lee, Hyun Woo; Zhang, Fan||Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering (English Edition)||2020||Journal Article||Once considered conventional, the construction industry is gradually increasing its reliance on innovations such as the application of technologies in safety management. Given the growing literature on technology applications in safety management and the varying opinions on the utility of applied technologies, a systematic review that streamlines findings from past studies is indispensable to construction stakeholders. Although a number of review studies are available in the building construction sector, the level of fragmentation and uniqueness within the construction industry necessitates a review study specifically targeting the heavy civil sector. In response, the present study applies a three-step approach to identify and review articles pertinent to the safety of highway construction work zones. The factors considered include the number of publications per year, publication locations, and technology types. In addition, the present study proposes to broadly group work zone safety technologies (WZSTs) into three categories based on their primary purpose: speed reduction systems, intrusion prevention and warning systems, and human-machine-interaction detection systems. Key findings include WZST research trends, application of smart work zone systems, and the potential relationship between WZSTs and fatalities. The paper ends with the identification of six additional research areas aimed at deepening the understanding of technology's role in highway safety management. The trend analysis and an in-depth discussion of each technology category alongside the identified research gaps will provide a substantial informative body of knowledge that both benefits current practitioners and directs researchers towards potential future studies.

This paper investigates the role crime policy plays in shaping the trajectory of neighborhoods. Much of the existing research on neighborhood crime was conducted in rising-crime environments, and the evidence was clear: high levels of crime have adverse effects on neighborhoods and resident quality of life, This study examines how private investment in neighborhoods in two cities Chicago and Los Angeles changed as the incidence of neighborhood crime changed during the 2000s, a period when crime was declining city-wide in both places. Using detailed blockface-level data on the location of crime and private investments between 2006 and 2011, the analysis answers the question: Do changes in crime affect private development decisions? The results show that private investment, as represented by building permits, decreases on blocks where crime increases in the past year. We also find that the relationship between crime and private investment is not symmetric private investment appears to only be sensitive to crime in rising crime contexts. The result is present in both cities, and robust to multiple definitions of crime and the elimination of outliers and the main commercial district. These results suggest that crime-reduction policies can be an effective economic development tool, but only in certain neighborhoods facing specific circumstances.||ENTERPRISE ZONES||Crime; Investment; Neighborhoods| |Factors in case study||Rottle, ND||LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING||2006||Journal Article||This paper describes a case study of the 100 mile x 40 mile (161 km x 64 km) Mountains to Sound Greenway (MTSG) in Washington State, USA, as an example of an emerging greenway model that encompasses contiguous working, dwelling, recreational and protected landscapes and which is structured by an interstate highway. This landscape-based greenway, a large-scale, multi-objective greenway type, is defined and related to established greenway typologies and theory. The paper describes a framework of replicable planning, organizational and implementation factors that have contributed to the success of the MTSG, derived from study of the organization and supported by greenway and land planning literature. It presents methods used by the MTSG Trust to advance realization of this pioneering greenway concept, following the proposed planning, organizational, and implementation framework. Significant results in land acquisition, scenic highway status, trail network development, landscape restoration, cultural and educational resources, and preservation of small-town character, farms and forest resource lands are described, while challenges to the long-term viability of the accomplishments are raised.

Extensive studies have shown that the composition of land cover within a watershed can account for much of the variability in water quality and stream ecological conditions. While several studies have addressed the relationship between watershed urbanization and biotic integrity in streams, few have directly addressed the question of how urban patterns influence ecological conditions. These studies typically correlate changes in ecological conditions with simple aggregated measures of urbanization (e.g., human population density or percent impervious surface). We develop an empirical study of the impact of urban development patterns on stream ecological conditions in 42 sub-basins in the Puget Sound lowland region on a gradient of urbanization. We hypothesize that ecological conditions in urbanizing landscapes are influenced through biophysical changes by four urban pattern variables: land use intensity, land cover composition, landscape configuration, and connectivity of the impervious area. Using community measures of benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of in-stream biotic integrity we examined the relationships between urban development patterns and ecological conditions in these basins. Significant statistical relationships were found between landscape patterns - both amount and configuration of impervious area and forest land-and biotic integrity of streams suggesting that patterns of urban development matter to aquatic ecosystems.

Between 1986 and 2007, the amount of urban land cover within the lowland Seattle MSA more than doubled, from 1316 km(2) to 2798 km(2), respectively. Virtually all of the urban expansion was at the expense of forests with the forested area declining from 4472 km(2) in 1986 to 2878 km(2) in 2007. The annual mean rate of urban land cover expansion was 1 +/- 0.6% year(-1). We estimate that the impact of these regional land cover changes on aboveground carbon stocks was an average loss of 1.2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in vegetative carbon stocks. These carbon losses from urban expansion correspond to nearly 15% of the lowland regional fossil fuel emissions making it an important, albeit typically overlooked, term in regional carbon emissions budgets. As we plan for future urban growth and strive for more ecologically sustainable cities, it is critical that we understand the past patterns and consequences of urban development to inform future land development and conservation strategies.

Using a mixed-method approach combining spatial data and interview analyses, we investigate both the structural and behavioral aspects of amenity migration in San Juan and Okanogan counties of Washington State. Results indicate that second-home owners' desire for privacy and escape is reflected in patterns of spatial isolation among second homes in the study area. These patterns have potentially significant ecological effects. Second-home owners also seek to protect their investments by supporting regulations which support their version of a rural idyll. Therefore, policy-makers should be wary of strategies to promote regulations which promote aesthetic rather than social and ecological function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The urban form influences and is influenced by these flows and is therefore critical in understanding and how urban areas affect and are affected by form. Nevertheless, there is a lack of uniformity in how urban form is analyzed. Urban form analyzed from a continuum of a simple urban versus non-urban classification to highly detailed representations of land use and land cover. Either end of the representation spectrum limits the ability to analyze within-urban dynamics, to make cross-city comparisons, and to produce generalizable results. In the framework of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, we identify and define six fundamental aspects of urban form, which are organized within three overarching components. Materials, or the physical elements of the urban landscape, consists of three aspects (1) human constructed elements, (2) the soil-plant continuum, and (3) water elements. The second component is configuration, which includes the (4) two- and three-dimensional space and (5) spatial pattern of urban areas. Lastly, because of the dynamics of human activities and biophysical processes, an important final component is the change of urban form over (6) time. We discuss how a this urban form framework integrates into a broader discussion of urbanization.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/six-fundamental-aspects-conceptualizing/docview/2131851150/se-2?accountid=14784| |Rethinking marine infrastructure policy and practice: Insights from three the marine nearshore is generating profound losses of ecological and geomorphological functions and ecosystem services, as natural environments are replaced with built. With conservation a diminishing option and restoration often unrealistic, there is a need to rethink development and the potential for marine infrastructure to contribute to net environmental gain. Through analysis of 150 years of change associated with the development of three large-scale marinas in the Seattle area, this research identifies the ways in which evolving policy frameworks and ecological understanding determine the nature, efficiency and environmental outcomes of coastal marine developments. Decisions on infrastructure design, mitigation strategies and policy interpretations directly determined the ecological fate of marine biota inhabiting these structures as well as surrounding ecosystems. In spite of increasing evidence of environmental legislation driving mitigation and innovative engineering, the net ecological trajectories remained negative. There were no tested demonstrations of marine mitigation to confirm which measures would succeed. Where scientific understanding existed, the uptake into planning and legislation was slow. More broadly, this research highlights a need and opportunity to consider marine infrastructure as living laboratories to inform a policy shift from a no-net-loss paradigm to net-environmental-gain. This evolution is timely, with sea level rise requiring new approaches to coastal defenses and with marine energy infrastructure increasingly being located offshore, where there is little knowledge of the ecological changes occurring in both time and space.

However, prior research has generally failed to consider RTC among severe offender subgroups (Hodge & Renwick, 2002; Howells & Day, 2007) such as those with psychopathic personality features whom have often been characterized as resistant to treatment (Harris & Rice, 2006; Salekin, 2002). In the current sample of formerly incarcerated persons (N = 70), we explore the relationship between psychopathic personality traits, as measured by the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM; Patrick, 2010), and the unique components of RTC, as measured by an originally constructed assessment called the Change Readiness Scale (CRS). Each item of the CRS has been empirically supported and combined to form five subscales of change readiness (recognition, action, social bonds, human agency, and self efficacy). Results show unique associations between the subscales of the TriPM and aspects of the RTC construct, yielding it necessary to further explore these relationships to better understand how these factors may contribute to treatment and justice system outcomes.||HIGH-RISK; THERAPEUTIC the electrical power distribution of Phoenix, Arizona||Maliszewski, Paul J.; Larson, Elisabeth K.; Perrings, Charles||Reliability Engineering & System Safety||2012||Journal Article||The sustainability of power infrastructures depends on their reliability. One test of the reliability of an infrastructure is its ability to function reliably in extreme environmental conditions. Effective planning for reliable electrical systems requires knowledge of unscheduled outage sources, including environmental and social factors. Despite many studies on the vulnerability of infrastructure systems, the effect of interacting environmental and infrastructural conditions on the reliability of urban residential power distribution remains an understudied problem. We model electric interruptions using outage data between the years of 2002 and 2005 across Phoenix, Arizona. Consistent with perceptions of increased exposure, overhead power lines positively correlate with unscheduled outages indicating underground cables are more resistant to failure. In the presence of overhead lines, the interaction between birds and vegetation as well as proximity to nearest desert areas and lakes are positive driving factors explaining much of the variation in unscheduled outages. Closeness to the nearest arterial road and the interaction between housing square footage and temperature are also significantly positive. A spatial error model was found to provide the best fit to the data. Resultant findings are useful for understanding and improving electrical infrastructure reliability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The Cardiac Arrest Blood Study Repository is a population-based repository of data from adult cardiac arrest patients and population-based controls residing in King County, Washington. We examined the association between the availability of medical facilities near home with SCA risk, using adult (age 18-80) Seattle residents experiencing cardiac arrest (n = 446) and matched controls (n = 208) without a history of heart disease. We also analyzed the association of major medical centers near the event location with emergency medical service (EMS) response time and survival among adult cases (age 18+) presenting with ventricular fibrillation from throughout King County (n = 1537). The number of medical facilities per census tract was determined by geocoding business locations from the National Establishment Time-Series longitudinal database 1990-2010. Results: More pharmacies in the home census tract was unexpectedly associated with higher odds of SCA (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.59), and similar associations were observed for other medical facility types. The presence of a major medical center in the event census tract was associated with a faster EMS response time (-53 s, 95% CI: -84, -22), but not with short-term survival. Conclusions: We did not observe a protective association between medical facilities in the home census tract and SCA risk, orbetween major medical centers in the event census tract and survival.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=131199949&site=ehost-live| |Quantification of impervious surface in the Snohomish Water Resources Inventory Area of Western Washington from 1972\u00c4\u00ec2006||Powell, Scott L.; Cohen, Warren B.; Yang, Alberti, Sensing Article||A 34 year time series (1972-2006) of Landsat imagery for a portion of Snohomish and King Counties, Washington (the Snohomish Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA)) was analyzed to estimate the amount of land that was converted into impervious surface as a result of urban and residential development. Spectral unmixing was used to determine the fractional composition of vegetation, open, and shadow for each pixel. Unsupervised and supervised classification techniques were then used to derive preliminary land cover snaps for each time period. Digital orthophotos were used to create agricultural, forest management, high elevation, and riparian masks. In conjunction with established Urban Growth Areas (UGAs), these masks were utilized for the application of spatial rules that identified impervious surface as a surrogate for urban and residential development. Temporal rules, that minimized classification error, were developed based on each pixel's classified trajectory over the time series of imagery. Overall cross-date classification accuracy for impervious v. non-impervious surface was 95%. The results of the analysis indicate that the area of impervious surface in the Snohomish WRIA increased by 255% over 34 years, from 3285 ha in 1972 to 11,652 ha in 2006. This approach demonstrates the unique value of the 35 year Landsat archive for monitoring impervious surface trends in rapidly urbanizing areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This paper compared and analyzed the development status of UUS planning in China and Japan to study the differences in terms of planning objectives, planning structure, and planning content of UUS, and made suggestions for the future development of China's UUS planning system. Since there are many difficulties in underground master planning in China to predict the planning scale of UUS, planning can only serve to provide planning principles and site selections. Instead, the regulatory detailed planning has legal effect in the planning system and becomes the most direct and powerful tool for the government to control and guide the urban land use. Meanwhile, Japan's underground utilization system is guided by urban agglomeration and can provide an important reference for Chinese development in terms of refined design, human concern, regulation, legislation, and coordination. Urgently, China needs to establish a system for UUS planning and management to promote three-dimensional urban development, establish coordination mechanisms for the detailed planning of UUS, and strengthen the planning of underground transportation networks, complexes, and streets.||DEVELOPMENT TRENDS; RESOURCES||Comparison of underground space planningsystem between China and Japan; Land system; UUS master planning; Environmental and safety| |Research on compactness ratio model of urban underground space and compact development mechanism of rail transit station affected area||Yuan, Hong; He, Yuan; Zhou, Junzheng; Zhongwei||SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY||2020||Journal Article||In order to assess the impact of underground space development on urban compactness, taking Shenzhen Futian Station and Tokyo Station as empirical cases, this paper uses the comprehensive compactness formula to extract influencing factors and to explore the interaction mechanism between underground space utilization and urban compact development. Previous studies have shown that when urban development reaches a certain threshold, the area compactness will be improved. Otherwise, when the development is below the threshold, the area compactness will be reduced. The compactness we discuss in this study is related to the efficiency of underground space development. The average building distance is a core factor affecting urban compactness and the efficiency of underground space development. Increasing total building area of underground space development of rail stations can significantly increase urban compactness.||CITY||Rail transit station affected area; Underground space compactness ratio; Compactness development mechanism; Threshold space building area; Above-ground and underground integration| |Residential property values are associated with obesity among women in King County, WA, USA||Rehm, Colin D.; Moudon, Article||Studies of social determinants of weight and health in the US have typically relied on self-reported education and incomes as the two primary measures of socioeconomic status (SES). The assessed value of one's home, an important component of wealth, may be a better measure of the underlying SES construct and a better predictor of obesity. The Seattle Obesity Study (SOS), conducted in 2008-9, was a cross-sectional random digit dial telephone survey of 2001 adults in King County, Washington State, US. Participants' addresses were geocoded and residential property values for each tax parcel were obtained from the county tax assessor's database. Prevalence ratios of obesity by property values, education, and household income were estimated separately for women and men, after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, household size, employment status and home ownership. Among women, the inverse association between property values and obesity was very strong and independent of other SES factors. Women in the bottom quartile of property values were 3.4 times more likely to be obese than women in the top quartile. No association between property values and obesity was observed for men. The present data strengthen the evidence for a social gradient in obesity among women. Property values may represent a novel and objective measure of SES at the individual level in the US. Measures based on tax assessment data will provide a valuable resource for future health studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assessed the relation between two measures of food spending and diet quality among adult participants (N = 768) in the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS III). All participants completed socio-demographic and food expenditure surveys and the Fred Hutch food frequency questionnaire. Dietary intakes were joined with local supermarket prices to estimate individual-level diet costs. Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015) scores measured compliance with DGA. Multiple linear regressions using Generalized Estimating Equations with robust standard errors showed that lower food spending was associated with younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, and lower socioeconomic status. Even though higher HEI-2015 scores were associated with higher diet costs per 2000 kcal, much individual variability was observed. A positive curvilinear relationship was observed in adjusted models. At lower cost diets, a $100/ month increase in cost (from $150 to $250) was associated with a 20.6% increase in HEI-2015. For higher levels of diet cost (from $350 to $450) there were diminishing returns (2.8% increase in HEI2015). These findings indicate that increases in food spending at the lower end of the range have the most potential to improve diet quality.||HEALTHY shading panels in architecture: A benchmarking study with lab scale physical models under real skies.||Parsaee, impacts on daylighting features in a lab scale model in terms of parameters representing potential human eyes' biological responses identified as image forming (IF) and non-image forming (NIF). IF responses enable vision and NIF responses regulate internal body clocks known as circadian clocks. Human-centric lighting evaluates photopic units, representing IF responses, and melanopic units representing NIF responses, combined with correlated color temperature (CCT) of light for potential biological effects. SPs' impacts on such parameters of daylighting have not yet been studied. Previous research mostly studied panels' impacts on visual comfort and glare related to IF responses. This research explores the impact of SPs' color, reflectance, orientation, and openness on photopic and melanopic units and CCT of daylighting inside a 1:50 physical scale model of a space. Approximately 40 prototypes of SPs were evaluated. An experimental setup was designed under outdoor daylighting conditions to capture high dynamic range (HDR) images inside the model. HDR images were post processed to calculate and render the distribution of photopic and melanopic units, melanopic/photopic (M/P) ratios and CCTs in the captured viewpoint of the model. Results reveal the behavior of SPs' color, reflectance, orientation, and openness in modifying daylighting parameters related to biological responses. Bluish panels, in particular, increase daylighting melanopic units and CCTs whereas reddish panels increase photopic units and reduce CCTs. The research results were discussed to provide an outline for future developments of panels to adapt daylighting to occupants' IF and NIF responses.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/human-centric-lighting-performance-shading-panels/docview/2440683417/se-2?accountid=14784| |Biophilic photobiological adaptive envelopes for buildings: and shading efficient indoor-outdoor connections based on photobiologicalpsychological needs of occupants for positive relationships with the sub-Arctic nature, particularly daylighting and day/night cycles. Envelope configurations of Northern Canada's buildings have not yet considered such requirements. Potentials of adaptive systems are also still limited. This research develops a fundamental model of adaptive multi-skin envelopes for sub-Arctic buildings based on main biophilic and photobiological indicators which characterize efficient indoor-outdoor connections. Biophilic indicators characterize the state of connections among occupants and outdoors which could stimulate biological-psychological responses. Photobiological indicators determine human-centric lighting adaptation scenarios for hourly lighting qualities and sufficient darkness in relation to local day/night cycles and daylighting. Biophilic performance of the proposed envelope was evaluated through 18 numerical models in terms of impacts of window and shading sizes on occupants' field of views. Photobiological lighting performance was evaluated by experimental methods using 23 physical models at 1:10 scale. Surface characteristics of dynamic shading panels, including color, reflectance, orientation, and inclination, were studied for potential photobiological impacts in terms of melanopic/photopic ratios and color temperatures. Results show that the proposed envelope could (i) offer acceptable direct visual connections with the outdoor nature through efficient window sizes for biophilia, and (ii) modify daylighting qualities to address hourly/seasonal photobiological needs of sub-Arctic occupants. Challenges of the proposed envelope to implement under sub-Arctic climatic conditions are underlined especially in terms of energy issues. The research outcomes help architects and decision-makers to improve occupants' wellbeing and healthy buildings in subArctic climates.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/biophilic-photobiological-adaptive-envelopes-sub/docview/2539937296/se-2?accountid=14784| |Built environment factors in explaining the automobile-involved frequencies: A spatial statistic approach||Chen, Peng||SAFETY SCIENCE||2015||Journal Article||The objective of this study is to understand the relationship between built environment factors and bicycle crashes with motor vehicles involved in Seattle. The research method employed is a Poisson lognormal random effects model using hierarchal Bayesian estimation. The Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) is selected as the unit of analysis to quantify the built environment factors. The assembled dataset provides a rich source of variables, including road network, street elements, traffic controls, travel demand, land use, and socio-demographics. The research questions are twofold: how are the built environment factors associated with the bicycle crashes, and are the TAZ-based bicycle crashes spatially correlated? The findings of this study are: (1) safety improvements should focus on places with more mixed land use; (2) off-arterial bicycle routes are safer than on-arterial bicycle routes; (3) TAZ-based bicycle crashes are spatially correlated; (4) TAZs with more road signals and street parking signs are likely to have more bicycle crashes; and (5) TAZs with more automobile trips have more bicycle crashes. For policy implications, the results suggest that the local authorities should lower the driving speed limits, regulate cycling and driving behaviors in areas with mixed land use, and separate bike lanes from road traffic.

It extends the job demands-resources (JD-R) burnout model to show how job characteristics interact with burnout to influence performance. A modified model was designed to measure burnout, with exhaustion and disengagement among unskilled construction workers taken into consideration. An observational study was conducted in a laboratory environment to test the research hypotheses and assess the prediction accuracies of outcome constructs. Twenty-two subjects participated in multiple experiments designed to expose them to varying levels of task-demands and to record their personal resources as they performed common construction material-handling tasks. Specifically, both surveys and physiological measurements using wearable sensors were used to operationalize the model constructs. Moreover, partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to analyze data collected at the task and individual levels. Exhaustion and disengagement exhibited different relationships with productivity and safety performance outcomes as measured by unit rate productivity and ergonomic behavior, respectively. Subjects with high burnout and high engagement showed high productivity but low safety performance. Thus, exhausted workers stand a greater chance of failing to comply with safety. As the sample and the task performed in the experiment do not cover the experience and trade of all construction workers, our findings are limited in their application to entry-level and unskilled workers, whose work is mainly manual material-handling tasks.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/workforce-development-understanding-task-level/docview/2371445580/se-2?accountid=14784| |Rural households' perceptions and behavior expectations in response to seismic hazard in Sichuan, China.||Hua, Chunlin; Huang, Shih-Kai; Lindell, Michael study analyzed data from 663 rural households in the city of Jiangyou, Sichuan, China to examine the correlations of expectations of taking nine indoor seismic hazard response actions to a hypothetical earthquake with preparedness efforts, risk perceptions, and information reliance. The results indicate that respondents expect to rely on TV and local authorities as their principal sources of earthquake information. Respondents have greater expectations of infrastructure disruptions than property damage and casualties. In addition, they have greater expectations of taking some alternative actions, such as running outside of the building and helping others, than recommended in-place protective actions such as drop, cover, and hold. However, some erroneous actions, such as protecting property and ignoring the threat, are the least likely. Furthermore, regression analyses indicated that risk perceptions, together with some demographic characteristics and earthquake experience, are significant predictors of recommended in-place protective actions and helping others, whereas evacuation is related to higher risk perceptions. Unsurprisingly, respondents having previous seismic damage experience tend to be concerned about property protection and, similarly, those having fewer years of education are more likely to ignore the threat. This study also found that residents expect to rely on different channels to receive information before and after an earthquake. Nonetheless, respondents expect to engage in similar patterns of behavior during and after an earthquake. The results of this study indicate a need for greater dissemination of earthquake information in such rural areas to increase residents' risk perceptions and, in turn, understanding of appropriate emergency responses.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=142208342&site=ehost-live| |Application of Prevention through Design (PtD) to improve the safety of solar installations on small buildings.||Ho, Chung; Lee, Hyun Woo; Gambatese, John A.||Safety Science||2020||Journal Article||As a viable, clean and renewable energy resource, solar energy has gained a significant interest in the US residential sector. Most solar systems are installed on rooftops to take advantage of available space and reduce land use. However, this installation environment also exposes workers to unique safety hazards related to existing roof conditions such as slippery roofing materials, irregular roof layouts, and steep roof slopes. Although Prevention through Design (ND) has been widely considered as an effective way to address safety issues during the design phase, little to no studies have applied ND to improve safety in solar energy installations. To fill this knowledge gap, this research aimed to investigate how, during the design phase, to address the safety concerns of solar workers when installing solar energy systems on residential buildings. Through a series of interviews, four case studies, and a seminar, seven solar ND attributes were identified: roofing materials, roof slopes, roof accessories, panel layouts, fall protection systems, lifting methods and electrical systems. Based on the attributes, a ND protocol was developed that can serve as guidance for implementing ND in solar installations. This paper presents the research activities and findings, and feedback gained from solar contractors through a seminar on the study. The study is expected to contribute to reducing safety hazards by implementing ND, help improve safety performance in solar installations on small residential buildings and support the promotion of safety in sustainable construction.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/application-prevention-through-design-ptd-improve/docview/2438721108/se-2?accountid=14784| |The Moving to Health (M2H) approach to natural experiment research: A paradigm shift for studies on built environment and the built environment (BE) is viewed as one strategy to improve community diets and health. The present goal is to review the literature on the effects of BE on health, highlight its limitations, and explore the growing use of natural experiments in BE research, such as the advent of new supermarkets, revitalized parks, or new transportation systems. Based on recent studies on movers, a paradigm shift in built-environment health research may be imminent. Following the classic Moving to Opportunity study in the US, the present Moving to Health (M2H) strategy takes advantage of the fact that changing residential location can entail overnight changes in multiple BE variables. The necessary conditions for applying the M2H strategy to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) databases and to large longitudinal cohorts are outlined below. Also outlined are significant limitations of this approach, including the use of electronic medical records in lieu of survey data. The key research question is whether documented changes in BE exposure can be linked to changes in health outcomes in a causal manner. The use of geo-localized clinical information from regional health care systems should permit new insights into the social and environmental determinants of health.||BODY-MASS Diabetes; Residential mobility| |Not quite a block party: COVID-19 street reallocation programs in Seattle, WA Article||The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed mobility inequities within cities. In response, cities are rapidly implementing street reallocation initiatives. These interventions provide space for walking and cycling, however, other mobility needs (e.g., essential workers, deliveries) may be impeded by these reallocation decisions. Informed by mobility justice frameworks, we examined socio-spatial differences in access to street reallocations in Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia. In both cities, more interventions occurred in areas where people of color, particularly Black and Indigenous people, lived. In Seattle, more interventions occurred in areas where people with disabilities, on food stamps, and children lived. In Vancouver, more interventions occurred in areas where recent immigrants lived, or where people used public transit or cycled to work. Street reallocations could be opportunities for cities to redress inequities in mobility and access to public spaces. Going forward, it is imperative to monitor how cities use data and welcome communities to redesign these temporary spaces to be corridors for their own mobility.||COVID-19; Equity; Inequalities; Built environment; Mobility; metrics not associated with sociodemographic variables, diet or health outcomes in the Seattle Obesity Study II||Drewnowski, Adam; Aggarwal, Anju; Rose, M.||SPATIAL AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY||2019||Journal Article||Background: Activity spaces (AS), captured using GPS tracking devices, are measures of dynamic exposure to the built environment (BE). Methods: Seven days of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) tracking data were obtained for 433 adult participants in the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS II). Heights and weights were measured. Dietary intakes from a food frequency questionnaire were used to calculate Healthy Eating Index (HEI 2010) scores. Linear regression analyses examined associations between AS measures: daily route length, convex hull, and radius of gyration, and diet quality and health outcomes, adjusting for covariates. Results: AS measures did not vary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. AS measures were not associated with diet quality or with self-reported obesity or diabetes. One AS measure, route length (in miles), was associated with being employed, living in the suburbs, and with distance and time commuting to work. Conclusion: Spatial mobility studies based on GPS tracking of environmental exposure need to demonstrate a link to relevant health outcomes. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, we present a case study on the application of UrbanSim, a detailed land use simulation model system, and its integration with a regional travel demand model in the Greater Wasatch Front area of Utah. Like several other metropolitan areas, this region has recently been confronted with legal challenges to proposed highway projects, drawing substantial scrutiny to the land use-transportation connection. We describe the UrbanSim model specification, results from model estimation, and sensitivity analyses conducted with the combined land use and travel model system. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that accounting for the land use effects of a regional transportation plan may produce significant shifts in key transportation evaluation measures such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and hours of congestion delay.

However, few studies have examined the differences in the travel behaviors between holidays and weekdays. This paper compares the choice of travel mode and trip chain between holidays and weekdays tours using travel survey data from Beijing, China. Nested Logit (NL) models with alternative nesting structures are estimated to analyze the decision process of travelers. Results show that there are at least three differences between commuting-based tours on weekdays and non-commuting tours on holidays. First, the decision structures in weekday and holiday tours are opposite. In weekday tours people prefer to decide on trip chain pattern prior to choosing travel mode, whereas in holiday tours travel mode is chosen first. Second, holiday tours show stronger dependency on cars than weekday tours. Third, travelers on holidays are more sensitive to changes in tour time than to the changes in tour cost, while commuters on weekdays are more sensitive to tour cost. Findings are helpful for improving travel activity modeling and designing differential transportation system management strategies for weekdays and holidays. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimated binary logit model of car ownership and nested logit model of commuting mode choice reveal that: (1) proximity to metro stations has a significant positive association with the choice of rail transit as primary commuting mode, but its association with car ownership is insignificant; (2) income, job status, and transportation subsidy are all positively associated with the probabilities of owning car and driving it to work; (3) higher population density in work location relates positively to the likelihood of commuting by the metro, but does not show a significant relationship with car ownership; (4) longer commuting distance is strongly associated with higher probabilities of riding the metro, rather than driving, to work; (5) considerations of money, time, comfort, and safety appear to exert measurable influences on car ownership and mode choice in the expected directions, and the intention to ride the metro for commuting is reflected in its actual use as primary mode for journey to work. These results strongly suggest that rail transit-supported urban expansion can produce important positive outcomes, and that this strategic approach can be effectively facilitated by transportation policies and land use plans, as well as complemented by timely provision of high quality rail transit service to suburban residents.

This study reviewed quantitative and qualitative research and identified eight common factors that influenced the choice of ATS: distance to school, parental fear of traffic and crime, family schedule constraints and values, neighborhood and family resources and culture, weather, and school characteristics. Suggestions were made as to how these barriers and facilitators of ATS could be integrated into the decision to fund local SRTS programs and to improve their effectiveness.

Binary logit model findings provide new insights on who bicycles, and on perceived and actual built environmental conditions associated with the likelihood of cycling in neighborhoods, controlling for socio-demographic variables. A high 21% of the respondents report cycling at least once a week in their neighborhood, more often for recreation or exercise than for transportation. Cycling is more popular among male, younger adults, transit users, and those who are physically active and in good health. Both perceived and objective environmental conditions contribute to the likelihood of cycling. Proximity to trails and the presence of agglomerations of offices, clinics/hospitals, and fast food restaurants, measured objectively, are significant environmental variables. Previously researched correlates of cycling, such as the presence of bicycle lanes, traffic speed and volume, slope, block size, and the presence of parks, are found insignificant when objectively measured. A non-linear relationship is found between the odds of cycling and the perception of traffic problems and automobile-oriented facilities. Overall, cycling is only moderately associated with the neighborhood environment. It appears to be an individual choice that is independent from environmental support. This finding likely reflects the limited bicycle infrastructure in the sample frame-an unfortunate condition found in most US metropolitan regions. Policy and intervention programs could increase cycling by improving both actual and perceived environmental conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The process consists of initial variable screening, variable grouping and selection, variable prioritization, and statistical modeling. Using this method, small subset of correlates is isolated to be strongly associated with walking, that are grouped as destinations, distance, density, and route: the 3Ds + R. Distance measures to routine daily destinations are shown to be simple and effective alternatives to complicated composite measures often used to capture land use mix and street connectivity. The 3Ds + R can serve as the core constructs to quantify neighborhood walkability, and as practical targets for policies and interventions aimed at promoting walkable communities.

Drawing on the 2006 Puget Sound Regional Council Household Activity Survey data, the 2005 parcel and building database, the 2000 US Census data, and emission factors estimated using the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator, we analyze the influence of residential density on road-based transportation emissions. In addition, a Bayesian multilevel model with spatial random effects and instrumental variables is employed to control for spatial autocorrelation and self-selection. The results indicate that the effect of residential density on transportation emissions is influenced by spatial correlation and self-selection. Our results still show, however, that increasing residential density leads to a significant reduction in transportation emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These BE characteristics can be used by transportation researchers to oversample households from areas where walk, transit, or bicycle travel is more likely, resulting in more observations of these uncommon travel behaviors. Little guidance, however, is available on the effectiveness of such built environment oversampling strategies. This article presents measures that can be used to assess the effectiveness of BE oversampling strategies and inform future efforts to oversample households with uncommon travel behaviors. The measures are sensitivity and specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and positive predictive value (PPV). To illustrate these measures, they were calculated for 10 BE-defined oversampling strata applied post-hoc to a Seattle area household travel survey. Strata with an average block size of <10 acres within a 1/4 mile of household residences held the single greatest potential for oversampling households that walk, use transit, and/or bicycle.

Implications for transit oriented development planning.||Pan, Haixiao; Qing; Shi, Cheng||Transportation Research: Part D||2017||Journal Article||Transit oriented development (TOD) has been an important topic for urban transportation planning research and practice. This paper is aimed at empirically examining the effect of rail transit station-based TOD on daily station passenger volume. Using integrated circuit (IC) card data on metro passenger volumes and cellular signaling data on the spatial distribution of human activities in Shanghai, the research identifies variations in ridership among rail transit stations. Then, regression analysis is performed using passenger volume in each station as the dependent variable. Explanatory variables include station area employment and population, residents' commuting distances, metro network accessibility, status as interchange station, and coupling with commercial activity centers. The main findings are: (1) Passenger volume is positively associated with employment density and residents' commuting distance around station; (2) stations with earlier opening dates and serving as transfer nodes tend to have positive association with passenger volumes; (3) metro stations better integrated with nearby commercial development tend to have larger passenger volumes. Several implications are drawn for TOD planning: (1) TOD planning should be integrated with rail transit network planning; (2) location of metro stations should be coupled with commercial development; (3) high employment densities should be especially encouraged as a key TOD feature; and (4) interchange stations should be more strategically positioned in the planning for rail transit network.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=126063920&site=ehost-live| |Differences in behavior, time, location, and built environment between objectively measured utilitarian and recreational walking.||Kang, Bumjoon; D||2017||Journal Article||Objectives: Utilitarian and recreational walking both contribute to physical activity. Yet walking for these two purposes may be different behaviors. We sought to provide operational definitions of utilitarian and recreational walking and to objectively measure their behavioral, spatial, and temporal differences in order to inform transportation and public health policies and interventions. Methods: Data were collected 2008-2009 from 651 Seattle-King County residents, wearing an accelerometer and a GPS unit, and filling-in a travel diary for 7 days. Walking activity bouts were classified as utilitarian or recreational based on whether walking had a destination or not. Differences between the two walking purposes were analyzed, adjusting for the nested structure of walking activity within participants. Results: Of the 4905 observed walking bouts, 87.4% were utilitarian and 12.6% recreational walking. Utilitarian walking bouts were 45% shorter in duration (-12.1 min) and 9% faster in speed (+0.3 km/h) than recreational walking bouts. Recreational walking occurred more frequently in the home neighborhood and was not associated with recreational land uses. Utilitarian walking occurred in areas having higher residential, employment, and street density, lower residential property value, higher area percentage of mixed-use neighborhood destinations, lower percentage of parks/trails, and lower average topographic slope than recreational walking. Conclusion: Utilitarian and recreational walking are substantially different in terms of frequency, speed, duration, location, and related built environment. Policies that promote walking should adopt type-specific strategies. The high occurrence of recreational walking near home highlights the importance of the home neighborhood for this activity.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=126063896&site=ehost-live| |Travel mode choices in small cities of China: A case study of Changting.||Hu, Hong; Xu, Part D||2018||Journal Article||The existing literature on urban transportation planning in China focuses primarily on large cities and neglects small cities. This paper aims to fill part of the knowledge gap by examining travel mode choice in Changting, a small city that has been experiencing fast spatial expansion and growing transportation problems. Using survey data collected from 1470 respondents on weekdays and weekends, the study investigates the relationship between mode choice and individuals' socio-economic characteristics, trip characteristics, attitudes, and home and workplace built environments. While more than 35 percent of survey respondents are car owners, walk, bicycle, e-bike, and motorcycle still account for over 85 percent of trips made during peak hours. E-bike and motorcycle are the dominant means of travel on weekdays, but many people shift to walking and cycling on weekends, making non-motorized and semi-motorized travel especially important for non-commuting trips. Results of multinomial logistic regression show that: (1) job-housing balance might exert different effects on mode choice in different types of urban areas; (2) negative attitude towards e-bike and motorcycle is associated with more walking and cycling; and (3) land use diversity of workplace is related to commuting mode choice on weekdays, while land use diversities of both residential and activity places do not significantly affect mode choice on weekends. Our findings imply that planning and design for small cities needs to differentiate land use and transportation strategies in various types of areas, and to launch outreach programs to shift people's mode choice from motorized travel to walking and cycling.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=128166349&site=ehost-live| |Bicycle parking security and built Feiyang||Transportation Research: Part D||2018||Journal Article||The lack of secure bicycle parking is a serious but often neglected issue that discourages bicycling. Classical environment criminology theories try to explain the pattern of bicycle theft but provide limited insights into the relationship between crime and the built environment. This study examines the association between built environment factors and bicycle theft using a zero inflated negative binomial model to account for data over-dispersion and excess zeros. The assembled dataset provides variables pertaining to the road network, land use, bicycle travel demand, and socio-demographics. The key findings are as follows: (1) Bicycle theft is more likely to occur in areas for commercial purposes, areas with a high population or employment density, and areas with more bike lanes or sidewalks. (2) Bicycle theft is likely to occur at sites with more bike racks or bus stops. (3) Bicycle theft is more likely to occur at mid-blocks than at intersections. (4) Bicycle theft is more likely to occur in neighborhoods with a greater percentage of socially disadvantaged people and in neighborhoods where residents' median age is lower. (5) The likelihood of losing a bicycle is lower in areas with more bicycle trips. In general, the number of bicycle thefts increases in dense areas with more targets and decreases with greater natural guardianship provided by more passersby. With respect to policy implications, governments and transport planners should implement a geographically-differentiated surveillance strategy, encourage bicycling, improve the visibility of bike racks to the public, and promote surveillance and natural guardianship in densely developed areas.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=130792492&site=ehost-live| |Promoting public bike-sharing: A lesson from Jiao, Junfeng||Transportation Seattle implemented its own bike-sharing system, Pronto. However, the system ultimately ceased operation three years later on March 17th, 2017. To learn from this failure, this paper seeks to understand factors that encourage, or discourage, bike-sharing trip generation and attraction at the station level. This paper investigates the effects of land use, roadway design, elevation, bus trips, weather, and temporal factors on three-hour long bike pickups and returns at each docking station. To address temporal autocorrelations and the nonlinear seasonality, the paper implements a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) that incorporates the joint effects of a time metric and time-varying variables. The paper estimates models on total counts of pickups and returns, as well as pickups categorized by user types and by location. The results clarify that effects of hilly terrain and the rainy weather, two commonly perceived contributors to the failure. Additionally, results suggest that users in the University District, presumably mostly university students, tend to use shared bikes in neighborhoods with a higher household density and a higher percentage of residential land use, and make bike-sharing trips regardless workdays or non-workdays. The paper also contributes to the discussion on the relationship between public transportation service and bike-sharing. In general, users tend to use bike-sharing more at stations that have more scheduled bus trips nearby. However, some bike-sharing users may shift to bus services during peak hours and rainy weather. Several strategies are proposed accordingly to increase bike ridership in the future.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=131185420&site=ehost-live| |Dynamic Modal Accessibility Gap: Measurement and Shen, Qing; He, Ying||Transportation Research: Part D||2020||Journal Article||Accessibility is a key concept in transportation research and an important indicator of people's quality of life. With the development of big data analytics, dynamic accessibility that captures the temporal variations of accessibility becomes an important research focus. Few prior studies focus on comparative measures of dynamic accessibility to Points of Interest (POIs) by alternative travel modes. To fill this research gap, we propose a new index called dynamic modal accessibility gap (DMAG), which draws upon available data on residents' real travel routes using different travel modes, as well as the data on POIs. We study the DMAG in the real-travel covered area, assuming POIs are only useful if it is within someone's real-travel covered area. We then apply this DMAG methodology to Shanghai's central city and peripheral area. In both cases, we measure the accessibility for public and private travel modes. As an example, one-week taxi GPS and metro smart card data, and POIs data are used to generate the DMAG index for 30-minute and 60-minute trip durations for weekdays and holidays. Results show that DMAG can reflect the pattern of temporal variations. The proposed DMAG analytical framework, which can be applied at both the user and the system levels, can support urban and transportation planning, and promote social equity and livability.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=142560800&site=ehost-live| |Community response to hurricane threat: Estimates of household evacuation preparation time distributions||Lindell, Michael K.; Sorensen, John H.; Baker, Earl P.||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT||2020||Journal Article||Household evacuation preparation time distributions are essential when computing evacuation time estimates (ETEs) for hurricanes with late intensification or late changing tracks. Although evacuation preparation times have been assessed by expected task completion times, actual task completion times, and departure delays, it is unknown if these methods produce similar results. Consequently, this study compares data from one survey assessing expected task completion times, three surveys assessing actual task completion times, and three surveys assessing departure delays after receiving a warning. In addition, this study seeks to identify variables that predict household evacuation preparation times. These analyses show that the three methods of assessing evacuation preparation times produce results that are somewhat different, but the differences have plausible explanations. Household evacuation preparation times are poorly predicted by demographic variables, but are better predicted by variables that predict evacuation decisions-perceived storm characteristics, expected personal impacts, and evacuation facilitators.||TRAVEL DEMAND DECISION-MAKING; COMMUNICATION; Departure delay time Social milling| |Eco-evolutionary dynamics urbanizing planet.||Alberti, Marina||Trends in Ecology & Evolution||2015||Journal Article||A great challenge for ecology in the coming decades is to understand the role humans play in eco-evolutionary dynamics.

Humans are major selective agents with potential for unprecedented evolutionary consequences for Earth's ecosystems, especially as cities expand rapidly. In this review, I identify emerging hypotheses on how urbanization drives eco-evolutionary dynamics.

However, urban landscape influences the capacity of urban trees to mitigate higher temperatures. We propose that both developed land characteristics and tree cover should be considered to accurately estimate the mitigation effects of canopy cover. We subclassified original land cover based on the canopy cover ratio to capture the within-land cover heterogeneity. We selected two coastal cities with different summertime climatic conditions: Seattle, Washington, USA, and Baltimore, Maryland, USA. We used Landsat-based grid cells (30 m x 30 m) as our spatial analytical unit, with corresponding land surface temperature, canopy area, canopy compactness, population size, and National Land Cover Database (NLCD)-based land cover group. We first used grouped boxplots, Kruskal-Wallis H tests, and post-hoc multiple comparison tests to detect the distribution of land surface temperatures by the land cover group. We then introduced statistical models to test the group effects on the relationship between land surface temperatures and canopy cover variables. We found: (1) land surface temperature increases with level of development, (2) land surface temperature decreases with canopy cover level, (3) the magnitude of the mitigation effects from canopy area differs based on development level and current canopy cover, (4) the differing efficacies of canopy area in decreasing land surface temperature follows a nonlinear threshold relationship, and (5) compactness of canopy cover was not significant in reducing the land surface temperature. These findings suggest the importance of considering heterogeneous canopy cover within developed land cover classes in urban heat island research. Tree planting strategies need to consider the nonlinear relationships between tree canopy cover and land surface temperature alongside environmental equity concerns.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/urban-landscape-heterogeneity-influences/docview/2498234874/se-2?accountid=14784| |The built environment and utilitarian walking in small P.; Vernez||Preventive Medicine||2014||Journal Article||Objectives. The role of the built environment on walking in rural United States (U.S.) locations is not well characterized. We examined self-reported and measured built environment correlates of walking for utilitarian purposes among adult residents of small rural towns. Methods. In 2011-12, we collected telephone survey and geographic data from 2152 adults in 9 small towns from three U.S. regions. We performed mixed-effects logistic regression modeling to examine relationships between built environment measures and utilitarian walking (any versus none; high [>= 150 min per week] versus low [<150 min per week]) to retail, employment and public transit destinations. Results. Walking levels were lower than those reported for populations living in larger metropolitan areas. Environmental factors significantly (p < 0.05) associated with higher odds of utilitarian walking in both models included self-reported presence of crosswalks and pedestrian signals and availability of park/natural recreational areas in the neighborhood, and also objectively measured manufacturing land use. Conclusions. Environmental factors associated with utilitarian walking in cities and suburbs were important in small rural towns. Moreover, manufacturing land use was associated with utilitarian walking. Modifying the built environment of small towns could lead to increased walking in a sizeable segment of the U.S. population.

The locations of physical activity in an urban US setting||Hurvitz, Philip is known about where physical activity (PA) occurs, or whether different demographic groups accumulate PA in different locations. Method. Objective data on PA and location from 611 adults over 7 days were collected in King County, WA in 2008-2009. The relative amounts of time spent in sedentary-to-low and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) were quantified at three locations: home (<125 m from geocoded home locations); near home (125-1666 m, defining the home neighborhood); and away from home (>1666 m). Differences in MVPA by demographics and location were examined. The percent of daily time in MVPA was estimated using a mixed model adjusted for location, sex, age, race/ethnicity, employment, education, BMI, and income. Results. Most MVPA time occurred in nonhome locations, and disproportionately near home; this location was associated with 16.46% greater time in MVPA, compared to at-home activity (p< 0.001), whereas more time spent at away locations was associated with 3.74% greater time in MVPA (p< 0.001). Location was found to be a predictor of MVPA independent of demographic factors. Conclusion. A large proportion of MVPA time is spent at near locations, corresponding to the home neighborhood studied in previous PA research. Away locations also host time spent in MVPA and should be the focus of future research.

New GIS methods allow for geographic mapping of diet quality at a very granular level. Objective. To examine the geographic distribution of two measures of diet quality: Healthy Eating Index (HEI 2005 and HEI 2010) in relation to residential property values in Seattle-King County. Methods. The Seattle Obesity Study (SOS) collected data from a population-based sample of King County adults in 2008-09. Socio-demographic data were obtained by 20-min telephone survey. Dietary data were obtained from food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Home addresses were geocoded to the tax parcel and residential property values were obtained from the King County tax assessor. Multivariable regression analyses using 1116 adults tested associations between SES variables and diet quality measured (HEI scores). Results. Residential property values, education, and incomes were associated with higher HEI scores in bivariate analyses. Property values were not collinear with either education or income. In adjusted multivariable models, education and residential property were better associated with HEI, compared to than income. Mapping of HEI-2005 and HEI-2010 at the census block level illustrated the geographic distribution of diet quality across Seattle-King County. Conclusion. The use of residential property values, an objective measure of SES, allowed for the first visual exploration of diet quality at high spatial resolution: the census block level.

Using police crash report data over a 10-year period (1986-1995). we compare belted and unbelted drivers and front seat occupants, who were seriously injured in crashes, in terms of personal (age, gender, alcohol involvement, etc.) and crash characteristics (time, location, roadway factors, etc.). A logistic regression model combined with the spline method is used to analyze and categorize the salient differences between users and non-users. We find that unbelted occupants are more likely to be male, younger, unlicensed, intoxicated and driving pickup trucks versus other vehicles. Moreover, non-users are more likely than users to be involved in speed-related crashes in rural areas during the nighttime. Passengers are 70 times more likely to be unbelted if the driver is also unbelted than passengers of vehicles with belted drivers. While our general findings are similar to other seat belt studies, the contribution of this paper is in terms of a deeper understanding of the relative importance of various factors associated with non-use among seriously injured occupants as well as demonstrating a powerful methodology for analyzing safety problems entailing the categorization of various groups. While the former has implication for seat belt enforcement and education programs, the latter is relevant to a host of other research questions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

All S||LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING||1998||Journal Article||Restoring nature within American urban areas seems basic to sustainability both in theory (Hough, 1995) and in practice (Sustainable Seattle, 1993). In addition to applicable science, restoration of urban green areas requires two complementary efforts, (1) a plan or process to locate and to rank potential restoration sites and (2) an understanding of how restoration designs will be accepted, and therefore, maintained by nearby residents. The urban Puget Sound region of Washington state has a 10 year history of stream restoration to improve salmonid habitats. This discussion reports on two regional research studies, one dealing with planning (Liberty Bay), the other with restoration design (Urban Streams). The first project, Liberty Bay, studied the feasibility of combining existing physical and political/social data to locate and rank potential restoration sites using a geographic information system. The study area was a small (<4000 ha) urbanizing watershed surrounding a polluted shellfish bay. The Liberty Bay study demonstrate the feasibility and identified the limits of combining physical data with social and political information. The second study, Urban Streams, is an ongoing, multidisciplinary effort to evaluate the efficacy of regional urban stream restoration as to stream dynamics, biotic conditions and human responses. The human response past of the Urban Streams study has two components. One is to analyze visual preferences for stream restoration engineering techniques. Salisbury (1997) used photo-simulated images of a proposed design to survey preferences. Her results demonstrated that respondents could differentiate various restoration designs based on their visual texture trough to refined) and had clear preferences for the 'refined' scenes in this urban regional context. The other study direction is to identify and evaluate human behavior toward urban streams. Initial results of this effort show that the majority of observed behaviors toward urban streams is negative. This result is disconcerting given the fact that the Puget Sound region has a reputation for a high degree of environmental sensitivity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Adaptation measures that integrate technological, nature-based, and social solutions can provide multiple co-benefits to address complex socioecological issues in cities while increasing resilience to potential impacts. However, there remain many challenges to developing and implementing integrated solutions. In this Viewpoint, we consider the value of integrating across the three solution sets, the challenges and potential enablers for integrating solution sets, and present examples of challenges and adopted solutions in three cities with different urban contexts and climates (Freiburg, Germany; Durban, South Africa; and Singapore). We conclude with a discussion of research directions and provide a road map to identify the actions that enable successful implementation of integrated climate solutions. We highlight the need for more systematic research that targets enabling environments for integration; achieving integrated solutions in different contexts to avoid maladaptation; simultaneously improving liveability, sustainability, and equality; and replicating via transfer and scale-up of local solutions. Cities in systematically disadvantaged countries (sometimes referred to as the Global South) are central to future urban development and must be prioritised.

Use of the food permit data showed that large stores, which included supermarkets as healthy food establishments, contained a sizeable number of bakery/delis, fish/meat, ethnic and standard quick-service restaurants and coffee shops, all food sources that, when housed in a separate venue or owned by a different business establishment, were classified as either unhealthy or of undetermined value to health. Conclusions: To fully assess the potential health effects of exposure to the extant food environment, future research would need to establish the health value of foods in many such common establishments as individually owned grocery stores and ethnic food stores and restaurants. Within-venue exposure to foods should also be investigated.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/characterizing-food-environment-pitfalls-future/docview/1836627274/se-2?accountid=14784| |Associations Between Fast-Food Consumption and Body Mass Index: A Cross-Sectional Study in Twins.||Cohen-Cline, Hannah; Anne Research & Human Genetics||2015||Journal Article||Obesity is a substantial health problem in the United States, and is associated with many chronic diseases. Previous studies have linked poor dietary habits to obesity. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the association between body mass index (BMI) and fast-food consumption among 669 same-sex adult twin pairs residing in the Puget Sound region around Seattle, Washington. We calculated twin-pair correlations for BMI and fast-food consumption. We next regressed BMI on fast-food consumption using generalized estimating equations (GEE), and finally estimated the within-pair difference in BMI associated with a difference in fast-food consumption, which controls for all potential genetic and environment characteristics shared between twins within a pair. Twin-pair correlations for fast-food consumption were similar for identical (monozygotic; MZ) and fraternal (dizygotic; DZ) twins, but were substantially higher in MZ than DZ twins for BMI. In the unadjusted GEE model, greater fast-food consumption was associated with larger BMI. For twin pairs overall, and for MZ twins, there was no association between within-pair differences in fast-food consumption and BMI in any model. In contrast, there was a significant association between within-pair differences in fast-food consumption and BMI among DZ twins, suggesting that genetic factors play a role in the observed association. Thus, although variance in fast-food consumption itself is largely driven by environmental factors, the overall association between this specific eating behavior and BMI is largely due to genetic factors.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=108675701&site=ehost-live| |Microsimulation of Urban Development and Location Choices: is a new urban simulation model, developed over the past several years, which is now operational in three urban areas in the United States. The model system is designed to address emerging needs to better coordinate transportation and land use planning as a result of recognition of the strong interactions between land use and transportation, increasing pressure from federal transportation and environmental legislation, and growing adoption of state growth management programs. The model system is implemented as a set of interacting model components that represent the major actors and choices in the urban system, including household moving and residential location, business choices of employment location, and developer choices of locations and types of real estate development, all subject to the influence of governmental transportation and land use policy scenarios. The model design is unusual in the degree of disaggregation of space, time, and agents, and in the adoption of a dynamic disequilibrium approach. The objective of this paper is to describe the entire system at a sufficient level of detail to convey the key specification and design choices made in implementing the system.||urban modeling; microsimulation; land use and transportation; location choice| |Seasonal controls on the exchange of carbon and water in an Amazonian rain forest||Hutyra, Lucy R.; Munger, Article||[1] The long-term resilience of Amazonian forests to climate changes and the fate of their large stores of organic carbon depend on the ecosystem response to climate and weather. This study presents 4 years of eddy covariance data for CO2 and water fluxes in an evergreen, old-growth tropical rain forest examining the forest's response to seasonal variations and to short-term weather anomalies. Photosynthetic efficiency declined late in the wet season, before appreciable leaf litter fall, and increased after new leaf production midway through the dry season. Rates of evapotranspiration were inelastic and did not depend on dry season precipitation. However, ecosystem respiration was inhibited by moisture limitations on heterotrophic respiration during the dry season. The annual carbon balance for this ecosystem was very close to neutral, with mean net loss of 890 +/- 220 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), and a range of -221 +/- 453 (C uptake) to +2677 +/- 488 (C loss) kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) over 4 years. The trend from large net carbon release in 2002 towards net carbon uptake in 2005 implies recovery from prior disturbance. The annual carbon balance was sensitive to weather anomalies, particularly the timing of the dry-to-wet season transition, reflecting modulation of light inputs and respiration processes. Canopy carbon uptake rates were largely controlled by phenology and light with virtually no indication of seasonal water limitation during the 5-month dry season, indicating ample supplies of plant-available-water and ecosystem adaptation for maximum light NUTRITION||2016||Journal Article||BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To compare objective food store and eating-out receipts with self-reported household food expenditures. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The Seattle Obesity Study II was based on a representative sample of King County adults, Washington, USA. Self-reported household food expenditures were modeled on the Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) Module from 2007 to 2009 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Objective food expenditure data were collected using receipts. Self-reported food expenditures for 447 participants were compared with receipts using paired t-tests, Bland-Altman plots and.-statistics. Bias by sociodemographics was also examined. RESULTS: Self-reported expenditures closely matched with objective receipt data. Paired t-tests showed no significant differences between receipts and self-reported data on total food expenditures, expenditures at food stores or eating out. However, the highest-income strata showed weaker agreement. Bland-Altman plots confirmed no significant bias across both methods-mean difference: 6.4; agreement limits: -123.5 to 143.4 for total food expenditures, mean difference 5.7 for food stores and mean difference 1.7 for eating out. The kappa-statistics showed good agreement for each (kappa 0.51, 0.41 and 0.49 respectively. Households with higher education and income had significantly more number of receipts and higher food expenditures. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported food expenditures using NHANES questions, both for food stores and eating out, serve as a decent proxy for objective household food expenditures from receipts. This method should be used with caution among high-income populations, or with high food expenditures. This is the first validation of the FCBS food expenditures question using obesity rates in Seattle and in Paris.||Drewnowski, To compare the associations between food environment at the individual level, socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity rates in two cities: Seattle and Paris. METHODS: Analyses of the SOS (Seattle Obesity Study) were based on a representative sample of 1340 adults in metropolitan Seattle and King County. The RECORD (Residential Environment and Coronary Heart Disease) cohort analyses were based on 7131 adults in central Paris and suburbs. Data on sociodemographics, health and weight were obtained from a telephone survey (SOS) and from in-person interviews (RECORD). Both studies collected data on and geocoded home addresses and food shopping locations. Both studies calculated GIS (Geographic Information System) network distances between home and the supermarket that study respondents listed as their primary food source. Supermarkets were further stratified into three categories by price. Modified Poisson regression models were used to test the associations among food environment variables, SES and obesity. RESULTS: Physical distance to supermarkets was unrelated to obesity risk. By contrast, lower education and incomes, lower surrounding property values and shopping at lower-cost stores were consistently associated with higher obesity risk. CONCLUSION: Lower SES was linked to higher obesity risk in both Paris and Seattle, despite differences in urban form, the food environments and in the respective systems of health care. Cross-country comparisons can provide new insights into the social determinants of weight and health.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=94355120&site=ehost-live| |Health Implications of Adults' Eating at and Living near Fast Food or Quick Service Restaurants||Jiao, J.; Moudon, & DIABETES||2015||Journal Article||BACKGROUND: This paper examined whether the reported health impacts of frequent eating at a fast food or quick service restaurant on health were related to having such a restaurant near home.

In all, 2001 participants in the 2008-2009 Seattle Obesity Study survey were included in the analyses. RESULTS: Results showed eating >= 2 times a week at a fast food or quick service restaurant was associated with perceived poor health status, overweight and obese. However, living close to such restaurants was not related to negative health outcomes.

Methods Weight trajectories over a 5-year period were obtained from electronic health records for 115,260 insured patients aged 18-64 years in the Kaiser Permanente Washington health care system. Home addresses were geocoded using ArcGIS. Built environment variables were population, residential unit, and road intersection densities captured using Euclidean-based SmartMaps at 800-m buffers. Counts of area supermarkets and fast food restaurants were obtained using network-based SmartMaps at 1600, and 5000-m buffers. Property values were a measure of socioeconomic status. Linear mixed effects models tested whether built environment variables at baseline were associated with long-term weight gain, adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, Medicaid insurance, body weight, and residential property values. Results Built environment variables at baseline were associated with differences in baseline obesity prevalence and body mass index but had limited impact on weight trajectories. Mean weight gain for the full cohort was 0.06 kg at 1 year (95% CI: 0.03, 0.10); 0.64 at 3 years (95% kg at 5 years (95% CI: 0.90, 1.00). In adjusted regression models, the top tertile of density metrics and frequency counts were associated with lower weight gain at 5-years follow-up compared to the bottom tertiles, though the mean differences in weight change for each follow-up year (1, 3, and 5) did not exceed 0.5 kg. Conclusions Built environment variables that were associated with higher obesity prevalence at baseline had limited independent obesogenic power with respect to weight gain over time. Residential unit density had the strongest negative association with weight gain. Future work on the influence of built environment variables on health should also examine social context, including residential segregation and residential mobility.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/does-built-environment-have-independent/docview/2563365143/se-2?accountid=14784| |Differential associations of the built environment on weight gain by sex and race/ethnicity but not age||Buszkiewicz, Article||Objective To explore the built environment (BE) and weight change relationship by age, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups in adults. Methods Weight trajectories were estimated using electronic health records for 115,260 insured Kaiser Permanente Washington members age 18-64 years. Member home addresses were geocoded using ArcGIS. Population, residential, and road intersection densities and counts of area supermarkets and fast food restaurants were measured with SmartMaps (800 and 5000-meter buffers) and categorized into tertiles. Linear mixed-effect models tested whether associations between BE features and weight gain at 1, 3, and 5 years differed by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, adjusting for demographics, baseline weight, and residential property values. Results Denser urban form and greater availability of supermarkets and fast food restaurants were associated with differential weight change across sex and race/ethnicity. At 5 years, the mean difference in weight change comparing the 3rd versus 1st tertile of residential density was significantly different between males (-0.49 kg, 95% interaction = 0.011). Across race/ethnicity, the mean difference in weight change at 5 years for residential density was significantly different among non-Hispanic (NH) Whites (-0.47 kg, 95% 0.10, 0.78) (P-value for interaction <0.001). These findings were consistent for other BE measures. Conclusion The relationship between the built environment and weight change differs across demographic groups. Careful consideration of demographic differences in associations of BE and weight trajectories is warranted for investigating etiological mechanisms and guiding intervention development.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/differential-associations-built-environment-on/docview/2600109849/se-2?accountid=14784| |A global horizon scan of the future impacts of robotics and autonomous systems on urban ecosystems||Goddard, Mark A.; Davies, Article||The future challenges and potential opportunities of robotics and autonomous systems in urban ecosystems, and how they may impact biodiversity, are explored and prioritized via a global horizon scan of 170 experts. Technology is transforming societies worldwide. A major innovation is the emergence of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS), which have the potential to revolutionize cities for both people and nature. Nonetheless, the opportunities and challenges associated with RAS for urban ecosystems have yet to be considered systematically. Here, we report the findings of an online horizon scan involving 170 expert participants from 35 countries. We conclude that RAS are likely to transform land use, transport systems and human-nature interactions. The prioritized opportunities were primarily centred on the deployment of RAS for the monitoring and management of biodiversity and ecosystems. Fewer challenges were prioritized. Those that were emphasized concerns surrounding waste from unrecovered RAS, and the quality and interpretation of RAS-collected data. Although the future impacts of RAS for urban ecosystems are difficult to predict, examining potentially important developments early is essential if we are to avoid detrimental consequences but fully realize the benefits.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/global-horizon-scan-future-impacts-robotics/docview/2485325251/se-2?accountid=14784| |Thermal conductance between water and nm-thick WS2: extremely localized using nanosecond energy transport state-resolved Hamidreza; Hunter, Nicholas; Wang, Xinwei||NANOSCALE ADVANCES||2020||Journal Article||Liquid-solid interface energy transport has been a long-term research topic. Past research mostly focused on theoretical studies while there are only a handful of experimental reports because of the extreme challenges faced in measuring such interfaces. Here, by constructing nanosecond energy transport state-resolved Raman spectroscopy interface: water-WS2 nm film. In the studied system, one side of a nm-thick WS2 film is in contact with water and the other side is isolated. WS2 samples are irradiated with 532 nm wavelength lasers and their temperature evolution is monitored by tracking the Raman shift variation in the E-2g mode at several laser powers. Steady and transient heating states are created using continuous wave and nanosecond pulsed lasers, respectively. We find that the thermal conductance between water and WS2 is in the range of 2.5-11.8 MW m(-2) K-1 for three measured samples (22, 33, and 88 nm thick). This is in agreement with molecular dynamics simulation results and previous experimental work. The slight differences are attributed mostly to the solid-liquid interaction at the boundary and the surface energies of different solid materials. Our detailed analysis confirms that nET-Raman is very robust in characterizing such interface thermal conductance. It completely eliminates the need for laser power absorption and Raman temperature coefficients, and is insensitive to the large uncertainties in 2D Lee, Jeasun||URBAN DESIGN Article||This study investigated how the benefits of a walkable neighborhood were reflected in the American real estate market by examining the economic values of urban environmental factors supporting walking activities. Property values were used as a proxy measure for economic value and analyzed in relation to land use characteristics that have been known to correlate with walking at the neighborhood scale. Four aspects of the built environment supporting walking were included in the analyses: development density, land use mix, public open space and pedestrian infrastructure. Hedonic models were employed where the property value was regressed on the measures of the four sets of correlates of walking in a neighborhood. Models were estimated for four land use types - single-family residential, rental multi-family residential, commercial and office. The findings did not support previous arguments that increasing density weakens the quality of a neighborhood. To the contrary, the positive association of higher development density with the value of single-family residential properties detected in King County suggested that high development density might increase surrounding property values. The pedestrian infrastructure and land use mix significantly contributed to increases in rental multi-family residential property values. Higher development density with higher street and sidewalk coverage were also favored by retail service uses. In relation to land use mix, mixing retail service uses and rental multi-family residential uses helped make rental housings more attractive.

However, microeconomic studies indicate the contrary. This paper critically examines the construction labor productivity macroeconomic data in the United States from 1979 to 1998 to determine their validity and reliability. Data collection, distribution, manipulation, analysis, and interpretation are reviewed and problems are identified. The paper also presents a comparison of construction and manufacturing labor productivity during this period. The main conclusion of the study is that the raw data used to calculate construction productivity values at the macroeconomic level and their further manipulation and interpretation present so many problems that the results should be deemed unreliable. The uncertainty generated in the process of computing these values is such that it cannot be determined if labor productivity has actually increased, decreased, or remained constant in the construction industry for the 1979-1998 period.||INDUSTRY CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE||2003||Journal Article||This paper contains a study of build-operate-transfer (BOT) project financing strategies from the perspective of project sponsors. The financing strategy for a BOT project includes the selection of the appropriate mix of equity and debt financing, and the identification of appropriate financing sources. Project sponsors typically wish to minimize their financing costs to ensure their tenders are competitive. Thirteen transportation and power-generation BOT projects in North America and Asia were analyzed. Important considerations and financing strategies were identified and examined. The findings suggest that project risks, project conditions, and availability of financing are the major considerations in selecting a financing strategy. The project risks that were determined to be most significant in financing strategy selection were political, financial, and market risks. Based on the study findings, a decision model was developed that can be used by BOT project sponsors in selecting appropriate financing strategies.||BOT TENDER||financial management; build/operate/tranfer; project A||JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT||2005||Journal Article||The traditional construction education model based on precise well-defined problems and formal definitions is not satisfactorily fulfilling its mission of educating the decision makers of tomorrow. This realization has moved several researchers to explore alternatives where problem solving is carried out in conjunction with the environment, and concepts are embedded in the context promoting learning within the nexus of the activity. Several efforts have been undertaken to develop these environments resulting in a variety of special-purpose situational simulations. However, special-purpose situational simulations exhibit inherent limitations related to their application breadth, flexibility, and promotion of collaborations. These limitations cannot be resolved within the framework of special-purpose learning environments. A general-purpose environment is required to overcome these shortcomings and take full advantage of the situational learning paradigm. This paper describes the conceptual framework and pilot implementation of such an environment called the Virtual Coach.| |Successful delivery of public-private partnerships for infrastructure development||Aziz, Ahmed M. Abdel||JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT||2007||Journal Article||Two common approaches have been used by governments for the implementation of public-private partnerships (PPPs): a finance-based approach that aims to use private financing to satisfy infrastructure needs, and a service-based approach that aims to optimize the time and cost efficiencies in service delivery. The implementation of PPPs, however, may suffer from legal, political, and cultural impediments. In the United States, the federal government enabled a number of acts to ease the impediments and promote PPPs for infrastructure development. Based on a detailed analysis of PPPs in the United Kingdom and British Columbia, Canada, this paper describes principles that would characterize the implementation of PPPs at the program level (e.g., whether the implementation is successful). The principles pertain to the: availability of a PPP legal framework and implementation units; perception of the private finance objectives, risk allocation consequences, and value-for-money objectives; maintenance of PPPs process transparency; standardization of procedures; and use of performance specifications. Guidelines for successful implementation are explained and discussed in the context of the United States PPPs experience and impediments.||PROCUREMENT| |Single versus multiple prime contracting||Rojas, Eddy M.||JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT||2008||Journal Article||Policies regarding public building construction affect the interests of taxpayers, construction authorities, general contractors, specialty contractors, and other stakeholders. At the state level, the debate as to the optimal form such policies should take has become an ongoing struggle among competing interests. This study presents a systematic analysis of the main issues regarding single versus multiple prime contracting with the purpose of providing objective data to illuminate the debate. A statistical analysis of project bids and final costs from a national sample of state construction projects reveals that public construction projects organized with multiple prime contracts tend to have 5% less direct costs than projects using a single prime contractor. Moreover, approximately 80% of these savings are attributable to lower bid costs for multiple prime projects. The results of this study are in agreement with theoretical bidding models and efficient risk allocation models. Theoretical bidding models suggest that, in the absence of disruptions, multiple prime projects should have lower direct costs than single prime jobs. Efficient cost allocation models suggest that when specialty contractors do not bear the risks associated with the single prime contracting method (e.g., bid shopping and payment delays) they are willing to lower their bids, and forego the premium they would normally charge in response to such risks, as seems to be the case in multiple prime jobs.| |Implementing web-based project management systems in the United States and Japan||Dossick, Carrie Sturts; Sakagami, Makoto||JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE||2008||Journal Article||This paper reports on results of research conducted at the University of Washington to investigate the means and methods for overcoming barriers to the implementation of Web-based project management systems (WPMS), and to develop a set of best practices in both the United States and Japanese construction industries. The United States and Japanese economies are high-tech intensive and both cultures have embraced technology. However, a relatively small sector of the construction industry in each country has implemented WPMS. The question posed here is why have these drivers not resulted in the industry's adoption of this new technology, and further, perhaps there are lessons learned from those who have successfully implemented WPMS. This research seeks to broaden our understanding of implementation barriers that are limiting the use of WPMS tools as well as means and methods of overcoming those barriers based on successful implementation in both countries.||CONSTRUCTION; VIEWPOINT; PARADIGM; SITES| |Comparative analysis of project delivery systems cost performance in pacific northwest public schools||Rojas, Eddy M.; Kell, Ian||JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT||2008||Journal Article||Alternative project delivery systems such as construction management at risk (CMR) are increasingly used in public school construction in the United States. CMR is expected to benefit owners with a guaranteed maximum price (GMP), decreased change order cost, and increased cost '' certainty.'' This paper empirically compares cost growth performance of the CMR and design-bid-build (DBB) methods in Pacific Northwest public school projects. Data were collected from state records and previous studies on 297 completed schools in Oregon and Washington. The analysis of the data shows no statistically significant difference between CMR and DBB in construction change order costs, school project costs exceeding the GMP in 75% of the cases, and a statistically significant difference in cost growth between CMR and DBB projects during buy out, making CMR projects less efficient at controlling cost growth at buy out. These results counter some of the traditional expectations of the CMR delivery method.||CONSTRUCTION| |Virtual teams: Guide to EM||JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING||2003||Journal Article||The successful initiation and execution of a virtual team is gaining increasing attention in the design and construction community. From opportunities to integrate international and multidisciplinary teams to the opportunity to leverage the best resources in an organization on a given project, virtual teams can transform the concept of project planning and execution. However, potential barriers exist in several areas to the successful implementation of virtual teams. The needs of increased management emphasis, social and cultural understanding, and emphasis on common goals are only a few of the nontechnical factors that can turn successful virtual teaming into virtual frustration. When combined with traditional technical challenges including compatibility of systems, security, and the selection of appropriate technologies, the line between leveraging virtual technologies for enhanced solutions and introducing additional complications into the project process is one that can be easily crossed. This paper presents the findings of research that addresses the opportunities and potential barriers to successful virtual teams in the engineering, procurement, and construction industry. Combining results from current research, industry practices, and early results from nonconstruction industries, the research findings provide an initial path to successful virtual team implementation.||DISTANCE MATTERS; WEB||project management; resource management; international factors; construction process to support situational simulations||Rojas, EM; Mukherjee, A||JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING||2003||Journal Article||Construction managers are decision makers who administer nontrivial processes.

This paper introduces a conceptual framework for the construction management practice that serves as the foundation for the development of situational simulations. Situational simulations are temporally dynamic clinical exercises with the objective of exposing participants to rapidly unfolding events and the pressure of decision making. The application of situational simulations provides construction managers and other decision makers the opportunity of experiencing and responding to risky events without endangering the success of real projects, further enhancing their decision-making skills. The construction management conceptual framework includes a process, a product, and an information model. The analysis of a basic mathematical representation of the process model is the focus of this paper.||construction management; models; simulation; COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING||2005||Journal Article||The need for contextually rich educational environments in construction engineering and management calls for the development of situational simulations. Situational simulations emulate real processes and provide temporally dynamic clinical exercises that expose participants to rapidly unfolding events and the pressures of decision making. A survey of simulations of construction management processes and construction operations shows that commonly used discrete event simulation paradigms are unsuitable for representing actions and events in interactive general purpose situational simulations for the construction domain. Instead, this paper argues that a definition of the situational environment using the semantics of constraint satisfaction and an interval representation of time is more appropriate for representing activities, events, actions, and situations relevant to the construction domain. This paper also illustrates how this new paradigm facilitates the implementation of a reasoning mechanism that can be used by a software agent to perceive present actions and predict the future evolution of a simulated environment.| |Incorporating domain knowledge and information retrieval techniques to develop an architectural/engineering/construction online product search engine||Lin, Ken-Yu; Soibelman, Lucio||Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering||2009||Journal Article||This paper introduces a domain-specific search engine, which was developed to take advantage of the growing online product information for surveying the virtual product market. Knowledge about a product was uniquely incorporated with query expansion operations and the extended Boolean model retrieval approach to handle issues associated with the search engine development. The search engine was designed to (1) represent and utilize the represented knowledge in the product domain; (2) identify online product information; and (3) then evaluate the collected online product information. A prototype search engine for testing was developed and statistically validated with five data sets with each data set being derived from a different type of product according to MasterFormat (Alexandria, Va.) categorization. The validation results indicated that compared with the tested general search engine or aggregated information service, the prototype was able to identify more distinct product manufacturers for procurement-related decision support.| |Bayesian statistical framework to construct probabilistic commonly used Pauw's formula to predict elastic modulus of concrete is very general and does not address the complexity of modem concretes, such as high-strength concrete, use of different types of aggregates and admixtures, etc. This paper develops a statistical framework to construct probabilistic models for the elastic modulus of concrete and evaluates the influence of different aggregate types, based on a large number of experimental data. The proposed framework to construct probabilistic models expands upon Pauw's formula and properly accounts for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. Bayesian updating is used to assess the unknown model parameters based on experimental data. A Bayesian stepwise deletion process is used to identify important explanatory functions and construct parsimonious models. As an application, the approach is used to develop a probabilistic model for concretes made using crushed limestone and crushed quartz schist coarse aggregates.| |Developing a state-of-the-art facility to support construction research and education: A case study||Rojas, Eddy M.; Dossick, Carrie Sturts||Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice||2008||Journal Article||The University of Washington's Department of Construction Management is in the process of developing interdisciplinary research and experiential education in construction engineering and management (CEM) with the creation of the 28,000 ft(2) Pacific Northwest Center for construction research and education (PNCCRE). In doing so, the department has identified challenges, limitations, and issues centered on bringing industry experience into the classroom and bringing researchers together from diverse disciplines from across the university. The University of Washington envisions the PNCCRE as a place where learners will experience CEM theory and skills firsthand in an interdisciplinary research environment that will foster innovation. This paper focuses on how the Department of Construction Management at the University of Washington is reenvisioning its research and education activities to take advantage of the new PNCCRE facility. In the education front, this paper introduces the experience learning model, a new paradigm to support active contextual learning in CEM. In the research context, this paper presents the interdisciplinary research model, a new approach to encourage collaborations, as well as appropriate organizational systems and work processes to support researchers and educators with diverse backgrounds, as they work together on mutually intersecting problems. The writers do not see these two models as separate endeavors, but as a coupled program, such that research informs the educational setting, and educational experiences inform research. The writers envision the PNCCRE fulfilling the needs of educators and students, researchers and practitioners, as well as the greater communities of industry and academia, by bringing together interdisciplinary teams to tackle the complex problems we face in CEM-a center where experience fosters curiosity, interdisciplinary collaboration broadens experience, and synergy creates a whirlwind of innovation and education.| |Generalized Economic Modeling for Infrastructure and Capital Investment Projects||Aziz, Ahmed M. Abdel; Russell, Alan D.||JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS||2006||Journal Article||Economic modeling and risk analysis are important processes for the appraisal of infrastructure and revenue-generating projects such as build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects. These processes have been commonly implemented using spreadsheets in which the analyst would build several models to analyze a project under varying conditions and risk assumptions. For better efficiencies in building economic structures and evaluation of projects, the current paper defines classifications of estimating and cash flow methods, and develops a generalized model. A classification represents a particular domain-construction, revenues, financing, operation and maintenance, or risk analysis, for example-and holds the estimating methods of that domain. The basic building block behind the model structure is a work package/stream that would have its own properties and estimating methods by direct selection from the relevant classification. By integrating the building blocks together a project economic structure is built and various performance measures are formulated. The model was implemented in a prototype software system called Evaluator. A BOT highway project is used to show an application of the concepts and the generalized model.||Economic Article||Sustainability is often described in terms of the triple bottom line, which refers to its environmental, economic, and social dimensions. However, the economic and environmental impacts of decisions have been easier to determine than have been the social impacts. One area of social sustainability that is particularly applicable to construction projects is that of construction workforce safety and well-being. This is a critical part of sustainability, and a socially sustainable construction industry needs to consider the safety and well-being of construction workers. However, construction activities are generally physically demanding and performed in harsh environments. Monitoring workers' physical strain may be an important step toward enhancing the social sustainability of construction. Recently introduced physiological status monitors (PSMs) have overcome the past limitations, allowing physical strain to be monitored without hindering workers' activities. Three commercially available PSMs have been selected and tested to assess their reliability in monitoring a construction workforce during dynamic activities. The results show that two of the PSMs are suitable candidates for monitoring the physiological conditions of construction workers. A survey was also conducted among industry practitioners to gain insight into industry needs and challenges for physical strain monitoring.||construction industry - environmental factors - labour resources - occupational safety - socio-economic effects - sustainable development||workforce physiological strain monitoring - social sustainability - socioeconomic impacts - environmental impacts - social impacts - construction projects - construction workforce safety - physical strain| |Residential Building Lifespan and Community Clayton||JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING||2020||Journal Article||Environmental impact studies within the built environment rely on predicting building lifespan to describe the period of occupation and operation. Most life cycle assessments (LCAs) are based on arbitrary lifespan values, omitting the uncertainties of assessing service life. This research models the lifespan of American residential housing stock as a probabilistic survival distribution based on available data from the American Housing Survey (AHS). The log-normal, gamma, and Weibull distributions were fit to demolition data from 1985 to 2009 and these three models were compared with one another using the Bayesian information criterion. Analysis revealed that the estimated average housing lifespan in the United States is 130 years given model assumptions, although a probabilistic approach to lifespan can yield higher accuracy on a case-by-case basis.

Approaches used for construction engineering and management research have included experiments, surveys and observational studies, modeling and simulation, theory building, case studies, and various subtypes thereof. Some studies use more than one approach. A particular contribution of this paper is that it reviews different types of validation using examples of studies, analyzes the specific challenges that were found to be significant, and presents how they were successfully overcome in each case. Another contribution is that it describes new opportunities for research validation that are emerging at the horizon as well as ongoing collaborative efforts to enhance the access of construction researchers to validation tools. This paper increases the awareness of the paramount role that validation techniques play in scholarly work by providing readers with recommendations to properly validate their own Gina||JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE||2010||Journal Article||Proponents claim that the adoption of building information modeling (BIM) will lead to greater efficiencies through increased collaboration. In this paper, we present research that examines the use of BIM technologies for mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire life safety systems (often referred to as MEP) coordination and how the introduction of BIM influences collaboration and communication. Using data from over 12 months of ethnographic observations of the MEP coordination process for two commercial construction projects and interviews with 65 industry leaders across the United States, we find that BIM-enabled projects are often tightly coupled technologically, but divided organizationally. This means that while BIM makes visible the connections among project members, it is not fostering closer collaboration across different companies. We outline the competing obligations to scope, project, and company as one cause for this division. Obligations to an individual scope of work or to a particular company can conflict with project goals. Individual leadership, especially that of the MEP coordinator in the teams we studied, often substitutes for stronger project cohesion and organization. Organizational forces and structures must be accounted for in order for BIM to be implemented successfully.||TECHNOLOGY; IMPLEMENTATION; ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT||2010||Journal Article||Many construction planning problems require optimizing multiple and conflicting project objectives such as minimizing construction time and cost while maximizing safety, quality, and sustainability. To enable the optimization of these construction problems, a number of research studies focused on developing multiobjective optimization algorithms (MOAs). The robustness of these algorithms needs further research to ensure an efficient and effective optimization of large-scale real-life construction problems. This paper presents a review of current research efforts in the field of construction multiobjective optimization and two case studies that illustrate methods for enhancing the robustness of MOAs. The first case study utilizes a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and an analytical optimization algorithm to optimize the planning of postdisaster temporary housing projects. The second case study utilizes a MOGA and parallel computing to optimize the planning of construction resource utilization in large-scale infrastructure projects. The paper also presents practical recommendations based on the main findings of the analyzed case studies to enhance the robustness of multiobjective optimization in construction engineering and management.||OPTIMIZING MANAGEMENT||2010||Journal Article||The large-scale and catastrophic impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 challenged the efficacy of traditional postdisaster temporary housing methods. To address these challenges, the U.S. Congress appropriated $400 million to the Department of Homeland Security to support alternative housing pilot programs, which encourage innovative housing solutions that will facilitate sustainable and permanent affordable housing in addition to serving as temporary housing. Facilitating and maximizing the sustainability of postdisaster alternative housing is an important objective that has significant social, economic, and environmental impacts. This paper presents the development of a novel optimization model that is capable of (1) evaluating the sustainability of integrated housing recovery efforts under the alternative housing pilot program and (2) identifying the housing projects that maximize sustainability. An application example is analyzed to demonstrate the use of the developed model and its unique capabilities in maximizing the sustainability of integrated housing recovery efforts after natural disasters.||NORTHRIDGE Improvement Techniques for Data Collection in Asset Management Systems||Migliaccio, G. C.; Bogus, Susan M.; Cordova-Alvidrez, A. A.||Journal of Construction Engineering and Management||2014||Journal Article||Transportation infrastructure assets are among the largest investments made by governmental agencies. These agencies use data on asset conditions to make decisions regarding the timing of maintenance activities, the type of treatment, and the resources to employ. To collect and record these data, agencies often utilize trained evaluators who assess the asset either on site or by analyzing photos and/or videos. These visual assessments are widely used to evaluate conditions of various assets, including pavement surface distresses. This paper describes a Data Quality Assessment & Improvement Framework (DQAIF) to measure and improve the performance of multiple evaluators of pavement distresses by controlling for subjective judgment by the individual evaluators. The DQAIF is based on a continuous quality improvement cyclic process that is based on the following main components: (1)assessment of the consistency over timeperformed using linear regression analysis; (2)assessment of the agreement between evaluatorsperformed using inter-rater agreement analysis; and (3)implementation of management practices to improve the results shown by the assessments. A large and comprehensive case study was employed to describe, refine, and validate the framework. When the DQAIF is applied to pavement distress data collected on site by different evaluators, the results show that it is an effective method for quickly identifying and solving data collection issues. The benefit of this framework is that the analyses employed produce performance measures during the data collection process, thus minimizing the risk of subjectivity and suggesting timely corrective actions. The DQAIF can be used as part of an asset management program, or in any engineering program in which the data collected are subjected to the judgment of the individuals performing the evaluation. The process could also be adapted for assessing performance of automated distress data acquisition systems.| |Computing a Displacement Distance Equivalent to Optimize Plans for Postdisaster Temporary Housing Projects||El-Anwar, Omar; Chen, Lei||Journal of Construction Engineering and Management||2013||Journal Article||Residence in temporary housing is a critical period for the social, economic, and psychological recovery of displaced families following disasters. Temporary housing locations define the displacement distance between families and their essential needs. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel methodology to capture the specific proximity needs and preferences of displaced families. This paper proposes a displacement distance equivalent as an objective metric to evaluate the performance of temporary housing locations in meeting the needs of displaced families. Moreover, the paper describes the development of an integer programming optimization model capable of optimizing temporary housing assignments to minimize total displacement distance equivalent while meeting budget constraints. The main contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is in transforming the purpose of temporary housing programs from offering general accommodation to providing customized housing solutions tailored to the individual proximity needs of each household using the proposed displacement metric. In addition, the proposed optimization model enables decision makers to set budget constraints to ensure the economic feasibility of identified temporary housing solutions.

In global project networks, many firms have adopted virtual collaboration tools to address the challenges imposed by temporal and geographical distance. Some researchers have examined the role of facilitators and found that process facilitation can improve collaboration. Research has also shown that facilitators can be drawn into content interactions, which may negatively impact collaboration effectiveness in virtual workspaces. Research to date has not quantified this negative impact. In this study, the formation and maintenance of transactive memory systems (TMS) in two facilitated and two nonfacilitated global virtual project networks were investigated, each executing a 2-month project. Using TMS formation and cohesive subgroup formation as a proxy for performance, quantitative evidence was found that demonstrates a negative impact on collaboration effectiveness when facilitators engage in content facilitation in virtual project networks. This paper shows that this negative impact restricts the establishment of TMSs. These findings have important implications for understanding and designing appropriate facilitator interactions in global virtual project networks. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000610.

Nowadays, numerous LCAF data sets are available in North America, but they do not include all locations. Hence, LCAFs for unsampled locations need to be inferred through spatial interpolation or prediction methods. Using a commonly used set of LCAFs, this paper aims to test the accuracy of various spatial prediction methods and spatial interpolation methods in estimating LCAF values for unsampled locations. Between the two regression-based prediction models selected for the study, geographically weighted regression analysis (GWR) resulted the most appropriate way to model the city cost index as a function of multiple covariates. As a direct consequence of its spatial nonstationarity, the influence of each single covariate differed from state to state. In addition, this paper includes a first attempt to determine if the observed variability in cost index values could be at least partially explained by independent socioeconomic variables.

Slums represent major national challenges in countries where they exist, especially developing countries. Various intervention strategies can be adopted to upgrade and/or replace slums, but are often faced with serious construction challenges, such as lack of access to sites and poor terrain conditions. Moreover, during the execution of slum upgrading projects, resident families can experience significant social and economic disruptions. The objective of this paper is present an integrated urban-construction planning framework for slum upgrading projects. This framework incorporates participatory upgrading and is designed to achieve three important objectives, including (1)maximizing the benefits of slum upgrading projects by identifying and accelerating the delivery of urgent projects; (2)providing more accurate and practical estimates of upgrading projects costs and timelines, which enables controlling and minimizing the total projects costs and durations; and (3)minimizing the social and economic disruptions for resident families during construction. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework and its core multiobjective optimization process.| |Techniques for Continuous Improvement of Quality of Data Collection in Systems of Capital Infrastructure Management||Migliaccio, G.

The factors that have top management priority for successful accomplishment of a task are termed critical success factors (CSFs). This paper aims to derive the CSFs for four questions commonly asked by companies in the first wave of BIM adoption: (1)What are the CSFs for adopting BIM in a company? (2)What are the CSFs for selecting projects to deploy BIM? (3)What are the CSFs for selecting BIM services? (4)What are the CSFs for selecting company-appropriate BIM software applications? A list of consideration factors was collected for each question, based on a literature review, and then refined through face-to-face interviews based on experiences of BIM experts. An international survey was conducted with leading BIM experts. From the 206 distributed surveys, 52 responses from four continents were collected. This study used quantitative data analysis to derive a manageable number (4-10) of CSFs for each category from dozens of anecdotal consideration factors. The derived CSFs are expected to be used as efficient metrics for evaluating and managing the level of BIM adoption and as a basis for developing BIM evaluation models in the future.| |Empirical Assessment of Geographically Based Surface Interpolation Methods for Adjusting Construction Cost Estimates by Project Migliaccio, Giovanni C.; and Management||2014||Journal Article| |Value Engineering for Roadway Expansion Project over Deep Thick Soft Soils||Kim, Tae-Hyung; Lee, Hyun Woo; Hong, Seok-Woo||Journal of Construction Engineering and Management||2016||Journal Article||A roadway expansion that takes place on soft ground is susceptible to differential settlement because of the high consolidation of soft soils. Therefore, steps must be taken to lessen the risk of such settlement; yet, this often only results in costly drainage solutions. In that, applying a systematic value engineering (VE) process can be beneficial to develop cost-effective design alternatives. However, VE studies specifically targeting for this problem are absent from the field. Thus, the goal of this study is to supplement this knowledge gap by applying a systematic VE process to an expansion project on soft ground to demonstrate the benefits of performing VE. A case study was performed on an expansion project over a soft soil layer approximately 50m thick. Through the VE process, the original design was reviewed, problems were discussed, and three alternatives were proposed. Then value analysis techniques were applied to evaluate these alternatives in terms of cost saving, function improvement, and value improvement with respect to the original design. The VE process and design alternatives as applied in this study are expected to serve as a guideline for engineers and decision-makers in roadway expansion projects on soft ground.

To fill this gap, the major objective of this study is to investigate the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the three most widely adopted rigid pavement choices through a life-cycle assessment approach with custom-built economic input-output life-cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) models. Quantity takeoffs were performed for each alternative assuming a 1-lane-km highway rehabilitation. Subsequently, the construction costs of each alternative were computed in order to determine the present values for a life span of 50years, while at the same time accounting for a different life expectancy for each pavement rehabilitation strategy. The present values were then incorporated into a corresponding EIO-LCA model. The results clearly indicate that continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) is the most sustainable choice and much preferable to the other alternatives for minimizing negative environmental, economic and social impacts from the life-cycle perspective. This finding champions a wider adoption of CRCP for future sustainable transportation infrastructure development projects, as CRCP's relatively high initial construction cost can be recouped by long-term sustained benefits. The results and findings of this study can serve as a solid foundation for industry practitioners and decision-makers to make better-informed project decisions when choosing the most sustainable pavement alternatives from a life-cycle perspective.

To fill this large knowledge gap, a two-stage research methodology drawing on 1,372 highway improvement projects completed in California was adopted for this study. The Stage I study investigated the marginal change-order impacts of two ACPs, pure A+B and I/D combined with A+B. How ACP change orders affect projects' time-cost performance was numerically modeled and successfully validated over the Stage II study. The results clearly showed that both ACPs led to more schedule-change and cost-change orders than conventionally contracted projects, whereas I/D combined with A+B performed significantly better than pure A+B in terms of the magnitude of schedule-change orders. This conveys an important recommendation to state transportation agencies (STAs) that A+B be used with an I/D provision. The results and numerical models of this study would help STAs better assess and justify the impact of change orders on the duration and cost of projects, enabling them to more effectively use contingency amounts. Use of the models can also benefit contractors requesting a change order because the models can provide them with advanced knowledge of the probable time-cost growth rates specifically for the pursued ACP.

Due to this knowledge gap, concerns have been constantly raised over lack of accurate measures of KPPT. To circumvent these challenges, this study investigates and models the macroeconomic KPPT of the industry through spatiotemporal clustering modeling. This study specifically aims to analyze the industry in 14 of its subsectors and subsequently, by 51 geographic spatial areas at a 15-year temporal scale. KPPT and their interdependence were firstly examined by utilizing the interpolated comprehensive U.S. economic census data. A hierarchical spatiotemporal clustering analysis was then performed to create predictive models that can reliably determine firm's profitability as a function of the key parameters. Lastly, the robustness of the predictive models was tested by a cross-validation technique called the predicted error sum of square. This study yields a notable conclusion that three key performance parameterslabor productivity, gross margin, and labor wageshave steadily improved over the study period from 1992 to 2007. This study also reveals that labor productivity is the most critical factor; the states and subsectors with the highest productivity are the most profitable. This study should be of value to decision-makers when plotting a roadmap for future growth and rendering a strategic business decisions.| |Alignment between lean principles and practices and worker safety behavior||Gambatese, John A.; Pestana, Catarina; Lee, Hyun Woo||Journal of Construction Engineering and Management||2017||Journal Article||Alignment and synergy between the areas of lean construction and safety management are expected because all near misses and injury incidents represent waste from the lean perspective. This paper describes a research study of lean and safety principles and practices with regards to worker behavior and safety practices. Specifically, the study aimed to investigate the extent of alignment between lean construction principles/practices and worker behaviors associated with construction safety. To conduct the study, the researchers used a multistep process involving a comprehensive literature review, document content analyses by an expert panel, and a survey of industry practitioners knowledgeable about lean construction. The findings support the perspective that many similarities exist between the application and impacts of lean and safety principles and practices. Lean practitioners surveyed believe that implementation of the last planner system as a lean practice is most beneficial to the following safety practices: management commitment, preproject planning, and pretask planning. The present study revealed that lean principles and practices can provide a valuable opportunity to further improve construction worker safety; however, the findings show that there is a difference between lean construction and safety management practices, revealing a gap with respect to worker behavior. Understanding and eliminating this gap is important for the industry to realize the full benefit that lean principles and practices can have on worker safety. To do so, the authors suggest expanding lean practices to further directly engage field workers and address worker behavior issues along with carefully communicating the lean message to construction personnel.

Unfortunately, location adjustment factors are not available for all locations. To overcome this lack of data, cost estimators in the United States often use adjustment factors from adjacent locations, referred to as the nearest neighbor (NN) method. However, these adjacent locations may not have similar economic conditions, which limit the accuracy of the NN method. This research proposes a new method of using nighttime light satellite imagery (NLSI) to estimate location adjustment factors where they do not exist. The NLSI method for estimating location adjustment factors was evaluated against an established cost index database, and results show that NLSI can be used to effectively estimate location adjustment factors. When compared with NN and other alternative proximity-based location adjustment methods, the proposed NLSI method leads to a 25-40% reduction of the median absolute error. This work contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a more accurate method for estimating location adjustment factors which can improve cost estimates for construction projects where location adjustment factors do not currently exist.

To address this anomaly, traffic control planners are tasked with making decisions geared toward reducing hazardous situations caused by transiting vehicles and construction equipment. The growing application of technologies to enhance worker safety should be considered during the traffic control planning process. In certain cases, decisions such as choosing among technology options are made using experiential individual knowledge without the application of scientific and systematic decision-making methods. Use of experience-based decision making in this context is largely the result of sparse literature on scientific methods of selecting between alternatives in highway construction work zones. By applying the Choosing by Advantages (CBA) decision-making method, a process that achieves sound and effective decisions, the current study aims to fill the gap in practice by proposing a decision-making framework that could enhance the value-cost selection process of safety technologies in highway construction work zones. A situation that applied work zone intrusion alert technologies (WZIATs) was selected as a case study. Using a focus group session and case projects as an evaluation study process, the proposed framework based on the CBA decision-making process was applied to evaluate three WZIATs. Findings from the current study will benefit safety professionals and practitioners by providing a step-by-step approach to make sound decisions that can enhance the level of safety in highway construction work zones.| |Temporal Effect of Construction Workforce Physical Strain on Diminishing Marginal Productivity at the Task Level||Lee, Wonil; Migliaccio, Giovanni C.||Journal of Construction Engineering and Management||2018||Journal Article||Physiological status and environmental stressors are known to influence workforce performance at the individual worker level. A previous study, which conducted a cross-sectional comparison in repetitive material-handling construction activities, suggested that a U-shaped relationship existed between physical strain and productivity at the group level. This research revisits those findings to further investigate the U-curve relationship between physical strain and productivity at the group level and validate the concept of diminishing marginal productivity. Heart rates were measured as an indicator of subjects' physical strain, whereas task productivity was estimated by work sampling. Eighty person-hour data were converted into panel data sets by dividing each subject's 4-h experimental data into 5-min intervals. These data sets were subsequently used to evaluate the effects of time on physical strain and productivity with 5-min lags. The study found a U-curve relationship between physical strain and task-level productivity at the group level while controlling for individual characteristics. The U-shape relationship was constant in the low-performance and high-performance groups, although the degrees of the polynomials differed. Productive workers will remain more productive than low-productive workers with increased physical strain.| |Stackelberg Game Theory-Based Optimization Model for Design of Payment Mechanism in Performance-Based PPPs||Shang, Luming; Aziz, Ahmed M. Abdel||Journal of Construction Engineering and Management||2020||Journal Article||Payment mechanisms lie at the heart of public-private partnership (PPP) contracts. A good design of the payment mechanism should consider the owner's goals in the project, allocate risks appropriately to stakeholders, and assure satisfactory performance by providing reasonable compensation to the private developer. This paper proposes a Stackelberg game theory-based model to assist public agencies in designing payment mechanisms for PPP transportation projects. The interests of both public and private sectors are considered and reflected by a bilevel objective function. The model aims to search for solutions that maximize a project's overall performance for the sake of social welfare while simultaneously maximizing return for the sake of private investment. A variable elimination method and genetic algorithm are used to solve the optimization model. A case study based on a real PPP project is discussed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The solutions provided by the model reveal that the optimal payment mechanism structure could be established such that it would satisfy owners' requirements for overall project performance while optimizing project total payments to contractors.||CM| |The Practice of Roadway Safety Management in Public-Private Partnerships||Aziz, Ahmed M. Abdel||JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT||2021||Journal Article||As a matter of course, the private party in public-private partnerships (PPPs) assumes the responsibility for roadway safety management (RSM). However, because most PPPs are performance-based, public highway agencies must articulate the specifications and methods they develop to enforce RSM practices. Despite the increased interest in PPPs in recent decades, little has been published on developing and propagating the RSM practices used with this delivery system. To fill this research gap and explore RSM practices in PPPs, this work took a synthesis research approach, using content analysis to critically review and analyze 16 PPP agreements in seven states and provinces leading in PPP contracting in North America. The study discovered several methods and organized them under five mechanisms: Mechanism 1, integrating roadway safety into project performance specifications and initiating new tools such as safety compliance orders; Mechanism 2, imposing nonconformance monetary deductions based on point and classification systems; Mechanism 3, regulating safety payments on the basis of crash statistics; Mechanism 4, promoting safety initiative programs; and Mechanism 5, enforcing administrative countermeasures such as work suspension and default/termination triggers for persistent developer noncompliance. Mechanisms 1 and 5 were the default mechanisms in all toll- and availability-based projects, whereas Mechanism 2 was common in availability-only projects. The research reviewed the RSM packages in the PPP agreements, elucidating the particulars of the RSM mechanisms, highlighting RSM design considerations, presenting implementation guidelines, and articulating research needs. The research results were validated against PPP highways in five other states and provinces. This synthesis research provides highway agencies with an extensive practice review to support RSM package design for future PPP projects.||QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; INCENTIVES||Public-private Fusion Real-Time Location Sensing and Physiological Monitoring for Ergonomics Civil Engineering||2013||Journal Article||Previous research and applications in construction resource optimization have focused on tracking the location of material and equipment. There is a lack of studies on remote monitoring for improving safety and health of the construction workforce. This paper presents a new approach for monitoring ergonomically safe and unsafe behavior of construction workers. The study relies on a methodology that utilizes fusion of data from continuous remote monitoring of construction workers' location and physiological status. To monitor construction workers activities, the authors deployed nonintrusive real-time worker location sensing (RTLS) and physiological status monitoring (PSM) technology. This paper presents the background and need for a data fusion approach, the framework, the test bed environment, and results to some case studies that were used to automatically identify unhealthy work behavior. Results of this study suggest a new approach for automating remote monitoring of construction workers safety performance by fusing data on their location and physical strain.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency is exploring alternative housing pilot programs to evaluate the possibility of providing quickly deployable, affordable housing that can serve both as temporary and permanent housing. Because of the complexities and costs associated with these programs, it is impractical to assume that accelerated permanent housing can fully replace the need for traditional temporary housing, especially in cases of large-scale displacements. A novel methodology was developed to evaluate the socioeconomic benefits of candidate configurations of hybrid housing plans, which incorporates both temporary and accelerated permanent housing developments. This paper presents the computational implementation and performance analysis of this novel methodology to offer a practical decision-support tool to emergency planners. To this end, genetic algorithms and integer-programming optimization models are formulated, and their performances are analyzed based on their effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. In lieu of developing the integer-programming model, the paper also presents a linear formulation that overcomes the need to use logical operations to model fixed and variable cost components for developing housing projects. Results show the superior performance of integer programming, whereas genetic algorithms offer higher modeling flexibility.| |Maximizing the Computational Efficiency of Temporary Housing Decision Support Following Disasters||El-Anwar, Omar; Chen, Lei||Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering||2014||Journal Article||Postdisaster temporary housing has long been a challenging problem because of its interlinked socioeconomic, political, and financial dimensions. A significant need for automated decision support was obvious to address this problem. Previous research achieved considerable advancements in developing optimization models that can quantify and optimize the impacts of temporary housing decisions on the socioeconomic welfare of displaced families and total public expenditures on temporary housing as well as other objectives. However, the computational complexity of these models hindered its practical use and adoption by emergency planners. This article analyzes the computational efficiency of the current implementation of the most advanced socioeconomic formulation of the temporary housing problem, which uses integer programming. Moreover, it presents the development of a customized variant of the Hungarian algorithm that has a superior computational performance while maintaining the highest quality of solutions. An application example is presented to demonstrate the unique capabilities of the new algorithm in solving large-scale problems.| |Efficient Optimization of Transportation Networks||El-Anwar, Jin; Orabi, Wallied||Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering||2016||Journal Article||Catastrophes, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis often cause large-scale damage to transportation systems. In the aftermath of these disasters, there is a present challenge to quickly analyze various reconstruction plans and assess their impacts on restoring transportation services. This paper presents a new methodology for optimizing post-disaster reconstruction plans for transportation networks with superior computational efficiency employing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model is capable of optimizing transportation recovery projects prioritization and contractors assignment in order to simultaneously: (1)accelerate networks recovery; and (2)minimize public expenditures. The full methodology is presented in two companion publications, where the focus of this paper is to propose new methods for (1)decomposing traffic analysis; (2)assessing the traffic and cost performance of reconstruction plans; (3)reducing the massive solution search space; and (4)phasing the use of mixed-integer linear programming to optimize the problem. An illustrative example is presented throughout the paper to demonstrate the implementation phases.

However, reconstruction and repair efforts are typically faced by budget constraints that require careful selection among competing contractors. This paper presents an innovative formulation to optimize this complex planning problem in order to maximize the rate of transportation network recovery while minimizing the associated reconstruction costs. This study first contributes to the body of knowledge by offering an effective and efficient means of identifying the optimal schedules for reconstruction projects and the optimal contractor assignments. This is achieved by solving the problem using a new mixed-integer linear programming model. However, there are four main formulation challenges to represent this problem using linear equations because of the need to use logical operators. As such, the second contribution of this study is in offering innovative solutions to overcome these formulation challenges, which are generalizable to other construction scheduling and planning problems. This paper is companion to another paper that describes a holistic optimization and traffic assessment methodology for post-disaster reconstruction planning for damaged transportation networks.

Such decisions can significantly impact the socioeconomic recovery of displaced families and available budgets for other postdisaster activities. To address these challenges, a new holistic temporary housing planning framework is proposed to offer customized housing plans tailored to the specific social, economic, and psychological needs of displaced families while controlling expenditures. This paper presents the theoretical formulation and implementation details of the community-based housing response pool, which is a comprehensive framework that aims at (1)quantifying the specific needs and preferences of each displaced family, (2)evaluating the ability of housing alternatives to meet those needs, (3)computing temporary housing life cycle costs, and (4)optimizing housing decisions accordingly. The paper also presents an application example to demonstrate and evaluate the optimization model capabilities.| |Model for Collecting Replacement Cycles of Building Components: Hybrid Approach of Indirect and Direct Estimations||Kim, Jonghyeob; Lee, Hyun Woo; Bender, William; Hyun, Chang-Taek||Journal of in Civil Engineering||2018||Journal Article||Building maintenance, repair, and replacement (MR&R) costs are estimated to be two to three times larger than initial construction costs. Thus, it is important to accurately estimate and manage MR&R costs in the planning phase and/or design phase of a construction project based on life cycle cost analysis (LCCA). However, the nature of LCCA requires making necessary assumptions for the prediction and analysis of MR&R costs, and the reliability of the assumptions greatly impacts LCCA results. In particular, determining reasonable replacement cycles is especially important given that each replacement typically involves a significant amount of capital. However, conventional approaches largely focus on either collecting component-specific replacement cases or surveying expert opinions, both of which reduce the usability and reliability of replacement cycle data at an early stage. To overcome these limitations, this study aims to develop a replacement cycle collection model that can expedite the data collection by combining indirect estimations with direct estimations. The development of the model involves collecting replacement cases, developing replacement cycle and index estimation methods, and developing an algorithm to implement the suggested model. As a validation, the applicability and effectiveness of the model were illustrated and tested by using simulated cases based on 21 real-world facilities.

Reporting on two action research case studies with two public owners in the US, this research structures rebaselining in four phases: (1) preparing technology enablers, (2) collecting data from existing documents, (3) conducting field verification, and (4) updating asset management databases. These workflows address some of the common challenges in managing existing assets, including the fast-paced changes in asset data requirements, the inaccuracies in data and documentation of these existing assets portfolios, and the need to update data and documents over their life cycle. The findings set the groundwork for implementing workflow by mapping the rebaselining business processes in each phase, listing the technological requirements for these processes, and explaining the feasibility and examples of customizing building information modeling (BIM) platforms for rebaselining workflows. This customization of BIM platforms aims to offer simplified solutions that reduce the facility management staff's need for advanced BIM software knowledge.||CM| |Teaching Life-Cycle Thinking in Construction Materials and Methods: Evaluation of and Deployment Strategies for Life-Cycle Assessment in Construction Engineering and Management Education||Lin, K.

Potential postdisaster hazards can take many forms such as earthquake aftershocks, landslides, postearthquake soil liquefaction, flooding, hazardous material releases, etc. This paper presents the development of a multiobjective optimization methodology to support decision-makers in emergency management organizations in optimizing postdisaster temporary housing arrangements. The developed methodology incorporates (1) a safety model to measure and quantify temporary housing safety in the presence of multiple potential postdisaster hazards; (2) a cost model to minimize total public expenditures on temporary housing; and (3) a multiobjective optimization model to simultaneously maximize temporary housing safety and minimize public expenditures on temporary housing. An application to a large region is presented to illustrate the use of the models and demonstrate their capabilities in optimizing postdisaster temporary housing Giovanni C.; Wulfsberg, H. James||Journal of Legal Affairs and Dispute Resolution in Engineering and Construction||2016||Journal Article||Dispute resolution requires pursuit of mutual agreement and implies accordant resolve between the disputing parties. In truth, mutual agreement stems from acceptable risks and negotiated terms centered upon equity arguments wherein the parties assess, evaluate, negotiate, and battle for high ground. Where the parties clearly understand their respective positions relative to the applicable laws, facts outweigh emotions, and the parties are more likely to avoid disputes. This paper defines high ground based upon legal theory in quantum meruit, which means, as much as he deserves. Equity arguments can trump written contractual provisions. Owners, architects, engineers, and contractors must become wise to these arguments to protect its shareholders' interests. To promote understanding, five different case scenarios are presented using actual disputes experienced on (1) notice provisions, (2) cumulative impact claims, (3) no damages for delay clauses, (4) acceleration, and (5) owner review durations. These case scenarios demonstrate that acquiring high ground requires clear understanding and synchronization of both the contract and the applicable governing laws. Ultimately, the party possessing higher ground will find itself in a more favorable position when disputes occur.

This paper investigates the theories implicit in two prevalent project control systems: the earned value method (EVM) and the last planner system (LPS). The study introduces two fundamental and competing conceptualizations of management: managing by means (MBM) and managing by results (MBR). The EVM is found to be based on MBR. However, project control based on MBR is argued to be inappropriate for managing at the operational level where tasks are highly interdependent. The LPS is found to be based on the MBM view. The empirical evidence from literature and case study suggested that the MBM view is more appropriate to manage works when it is applied to the operation level where each task is highly interdependent.||Last planner system (LPS); Management thinking; Performance measures; Project control| |Study of the Relationship between Procurement Duration and Project Performance in Design-build Projects: Comparison between Water/Wastewater and Transportation Sectors||Bogus, Susan C.; Jin, Ruoyu||Journal of Management in Engineering||2013||Journal Article||Previous studies on building, industrial, and transportation projects found that projects delivered using design-build tend to perform better than projects delivered with the traditional design-bid-build method. However, performance of design-build projects is affected by various factors, with procurement-related factors being among the most influential. Whereas other aspects of procurement have been largely investigated, the effect of procurement duration on project performance has been studied only for design-build transportation projects. In addition, few studies have focused specifically on the delivery of water/wastewater projects. This paper includes the results of a study on the relationship between procurement duration and performance of water/wastewater design-build projects. The study methodology was based on regression analysis of data from a sample of water/wastewater design-build projects. The results show that unlike the transportation sector, procurement duration has little effect on either schedule or cost performance in the water/wastewater sector. Likely reasons for this difference were then explored through a content analysis of procurement documents.

Many Asian countries have used the build-operate-transfer (BOT) approach to develop public infrastructure projects. However, the potential benefits of undertaking a BOT project are accompanied by corresponding risks from the private sector's perspective. The objectives of this study are (1)to identify and discuss major risks inherent in the East Asia and Pacific regions, and (2)to propose risk management strategies for future BOT projects to be successful. This paper reports the results of five case study analyses undertaken to review their primary risks and mitigated methods. In addition, this paper proposes some strategies for future BOT projects. Two main categories of risks were analyzed: general risks and project-specific risks. Risk management strategies were suggested for each category of risk. The main finding of this study indicates that the private sector cannot be the only participant in risk management. The host government's active support is the most essential factor for the profitability and economic viability of a BOT project in the East Asia and Pacific regions.| |Empirical comparison of methods for estimating location cost adjustments factors||Migliaccio, G. C.; Zandbergen, Paul; Martinez, A. A.||Journal of Management in Engineering||2015||Journal Article||Location factors are used to adjust conceptual cost estimates by project location. Presently, the construction industry has adopted a simple, proximity-based interpolation method to estimate location factors for missing locations. Although this approach is widely accepted, its validity has not been statistically substantiated. This study assessed the current method of adjusting conceptual cost estimates by project location and compared its performance against two alternative spatial interpolation methods. A Moran's I test was used to confirm the presence of strong spatial autocorrelation, which supports the use of proximity-based methods. Additional statistical evaluations of current and alternative methods were also conducted. Results provided statistical justification for the current method. However, an alternative method was proven to outperform the current method. Moreover, several opportunities for future research were identified as a result of this exploratory study.

In this paper we focus on distributed teams making joint unanticipated discoveries in virtual environments. We operationalize a definition of messy talk as a process in which teams mutually discover issues, critically engage in clarifying and finding solutions to the discovered issues, exchange their knowledge, and resolve the issue. Can globally distributed teams use messy talk via virtual communication technology? We analyzed the interactions of four distributed student teams collaborating on a complex design and planning project using building information models (BIMs) and the cyber-enabled global research infrastructure for design (CyberGRID), a virtual world specifically developed for collaborative work. Their interactions exhibited all four elements of messy talk, even though resolution was the least common. Virtual worlds support real-time joint problem solving by (1)providing affordances for talk mediated by shared visualizations, (2)supporting team perceptions of building information models that are mutable, and (3)allowing transformations of those models while people were together in real time. Our findings suggest that distributed team collaboration requires technologies that support messy talkand iterative trial and errorfor complex multidimensional problems.

While the EVMS measures project-level costs and scheduling performances, the LPS measures the percent plan complete (PPC), which indicates the level of planning reliability. This paper investigates the relationship between planning reliability at the operational level and project performance at the management level (i.e., the success or failure of a project). Analyzing the empirical data of 23 residential projects of a large construction company, the authors find that, while the production plan in the weekly schedule is correlated rigidly with the daily plan in successful projects, such a rigid correlation is not observed in unsuccessful projects. To understand this finding, the authors further conducted interviews with project stakeholders. Taken together, this study suggests that an emphasis on LPS indices causes subcontractors to engage in myopic behaviors such as modifying operational-level indices. Consequently, management-level production plan rigidity is at risk. The findings in this paper offer valuable insights and help project stakeholders understand the attributes of operational-level and management-level indices and their relationships.

However, the EVM is effective only under the assumption that every activity is independent. Literature shows that the EVM lacks the value generation view even working against the reliability of workflow. The goal of this research is to propose a project metric system to supplement the EVM in terms of the workflow and value generation. The researchers suggest a new metric of customer earned value (CEV), which is defined as the budgeted amount of work completed and is used by the successors on a network. Through a hypothetical case study, this research investigates how the work-in-process between trades and schedule performance in each trade behave under different uncertainties. The result suggests that the proposed metrics can provide project managers with more relevant managerial information on project progress as well as on the level of collaboration. The proposed system with the EVM would facilitate collaboration on project planning and control where variability and interdependency are involved.

Although integration in general and ID in particular have been well theorized by construction management research community, there exists no systematic mechanism in the field to help owners, architects, and managers of green project teams assess the level of integration in their projects' ID team environment in a practical manner. The key objective of the present article is therefore to use a qualitative-quantitative methodology to propose and validate an integration evaluation framework for green project teams and to statistically test the association between integration level and project success. The framework can be used by green project teams for comparison, benchmarking, or educational purposes and for integration evaluation and improvement in ID team environments. This research also provides empirical evidence to anecdotes suggesting positive link between team integration and project success in green projects.| |Fuzzy AHP model for prequalification of engineering consultants public procurement system||Nazari, Vandadian, Shaghayegh; Abdirad, Hamid||Journal of Management in Engineering||2017||Journal Article||Prequalification of engineering consultants in the Iranian public procurement system is suffering from arbitrary processes and criteria that cannot effectively shortlist the increasing number of potential bidders. This study aims to develop a prequalification model that can serve as the basis for revising the existing regulations and criteria. The authors conducted interviews among experts to localize a framework of prequalification criteria. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), accompanied by a survey among industry participants, was used to determine the importance level of decision criteria. The results confirmed that the existing guidelines cannot meet the expectations of the industry due to the overemphasis on the past performance of consultants and disregarding their current capabilities. For the international audience, this study clarifies that (1)the working culture of industry participants impacts their judgments on the importance level of intangible and tangible criteria used for prequalification processes, (2)short-listing consultants for long-term and fragmented data collection in national registration or project prequalification should be avoided, and (3)researchers must test FAHP models with different fuzzy scales because the success of the widely used fuzzy extent analysis method is highly dependent on the scale of fuzzy functions and judgments of decision makers.| |Stakeholder Management in Long-Term Complex of Management in Engineering||2017||Journal Article||This paper identifies 31 critical success factors (CSFs) and suggests a framework for effective stakeholder management in long-term complex megaconstruction (LCM) projects that require more than 10 years for multipurpose development. The results of a survey on the prioritization of these 31 CSFs reveal that LCM projects involve more stakeholders than do general construction projects and require a correspondingly wider range of changes during each project. To identify more systematic and strategic approaches to stakeholder management in LCM projects, a framework was developed through factor analysis and focus-group interviews with project management experts. The framework is composed of the following five agendas: clear understanding of stakeholders, clear definition of the project, effective communication, responding to environmental changes, and social cooperation. The analysis results show that LCM projects require a stronger emphasis on responding to environmental changes and social cooperation. These results, along with the CSF priorities, reveal the necessity of taking customized approaches to LCM projects. The results of this analysis are expected to help LCM project managers effectively manage stakeholders.

Although substantial efforts have been made to implement BIM, previous research highlighted that implementation of BIM tools has not always resulted in satisfaction by users. Grounded in the literature on information systems and enterprise resource planning user satisfaction, this study tries to evaluate the success of BIM in terms of user satisfaction while controlling for the mediating effect of top-management support. The effects of four factors (i.e., system quality, information quality, external service, and top-management support) on BIM user satisfaction in AEC industries were examined through a survey of BIM users from China. Survey responses were analyzed with the partial least-squares method. The major contribution of this work lies in the findings that information quality, external service, and top-management support have a significant influence on BIM user satisfaction, and system quality did not have a significant influence on BIM user satisfaction. Moreover, top-management support acts as a mediating factor between external service and BIM user satisfaction. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil in Engineering||2018||Journal Article||The construction industry has made extensive efforts to improve the safety of its labor force through various approaches, including training. However, many construction workers in the United States are recent immigrants who lack English proficiency and do not possess sufficient literacy levels in their own language for training comprehension. This reduces the effectiveness of traditional text-dominated translated training materials, which depend on both literacy and proficiency in a language. Thus, in this study, the authors used three-dimensional (3D) visualization to overcome the communication barriers that hinder effective safety training for low-literacy (LL) and low-English-proficiency (LEP) construction workers. This article summarizes the contributions of a study sponsored by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Susan Harwood Training Grant Program; it describes the methodology to develop scenario-based 3D training materials on fall safety for LL and LEP workers and to validate the effectiveness of the materials. The results show that 3D training materials improve interaction between trainer and trainee during safety training, facilitate learning processes, and can overcome some of the communication barriers that hinder effective safety training.

In conventional approaches, LCCA assumes that regular and preventive maintenance will be performed according to each replacement cycle for individual components, and replacement for each component is considered independently. However, because the components of equipment used in buildings are installed systemically, replacements of major components may cause unexpected replacements of dependent minor components. Therefore, it is necessary to identify additional replacements based on the associations among these related replacement components to achieve a more reliable LCCA. In response, this study proposes an LCCA model that comprehensively considers the relationships among the maintenance components. The development of the model involves identifying relationships among components using social network analysis (SNA), arranging individual replacement timings of the components that reflect these relationships, and analyzing the life-cycle cost (LCC) based on the arranged timing. To validate the model, its applicability and effectiveness was illustrated and tested using 19 components of a rainwater reuse system. This study makes a theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge by suggesting concepts of synchronous relationships and replacements based on SNA. In addition, the use of the model proposed in this study enables practitioners to analyze LCCs that reflect synchronous replacements, which allows more reasonable decision-making considering hidden costs in conventional LCC.

Using structural equation modeling, we investigate how empowering frontline managers impacts their planning performance. In contrast to prior studies, we find that although psychological empowerment of frontline managers has no direct effect on their production planning reliability or scheduling performance, it has an indirect effect on planning reliability and scheduling performance, as long as the organization supports the empowerment structurally during production planning. This implies that a project manager should provide frontline managers at the operational level with proper formal and informal authority over workflow development, shielding, and resource allocation when planning production in order to enhance job performance through psychological empowerment. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on construction management by exploring the impact of psychological and structural empowerment of frontline managers on their performance of production planning reliability and scheduling Structural equation modeling| Alternative Methods||Choi, Kunhee; Bae, Junseo; Yin, Article||Incentive/disincentive (I/D) and cost-plus-time (A+B) are two of the most widely used alternative contracting methods (ACMs) for accelerating the construction of highway infrastructure improvement projects. However, little is known about the effects of trade-offs in terms of project schedule and cost performance. This study addresses this problem by creating and testing a stochastic decision support model called accelerated alternative contracting cost-time trade-off (ACT(2)). This model was developed by a second-order polynomial regression analysis and validated by the predicted error sum of square statistic and paired comparison tests. The results of a descriptive trend analysis based on a rich set of high-confidence project data show that I/D is effective at reducing project duration but results in higher cost compared to pure A+B and conventional methods. This cost-time trade-off effect was confirmed by the ACT(2) model, which determines the level of cost-time trade-off for different ACMs. This study will help state transportation agencies promote more effective application of ACMs by providing data-driven performance benchmarking results when evaluating competing acceleration strategies and techniques.

Scholars have suggested many tools, techniques, and processes to address the cross-disciplinary complexities of such an approach, but how these elements might be best combined to lead to better project outcomes is yet unknown. To address this, we surveyed architects associated with 33 AIA-COTE award-winning projects on the social, organizational, and technological elements of whole-system design (WSD) practices. We then used fuzzy sets-qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze the interdependencies among those elements. We found three distinct pathways for the design and construction of HEE buildings: information-driven, process-driven, or organization-driven. We also found that HEE buildings share some conditions for success, including having shared goals, owners engagement in the design process, and frequent and participatory interorganizational meetings. Our findings can help practitioners strategize and make decisions on incorporating WSD elements associated with their project types. Moreover, these results provide a launchpad for scholars to investigate complementarities among elements facilitating the design and construction process of HEE projects.||CM| |Structural Equation Modeling for the Determinants of International Infrastructure Investment: Evidence from Chinese Contractors||Wang, Hyun Woo; OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING||2021||Journal Article||International infrastructure investment can effectively accelerate infrastructure development in developing countries and thus support their social and economic progress. However, little is known of the factors that may determine the flow of international infrastructure investment to those countries. This study aims to bridge that knowledge gap, first by identifying the determinants of international infrastructure investment, and then by developing a structural equation model to reveal their underlying interrelationships. The structural equation model is applied to country-level data regarding international infrastructure investment with Chinese contractors in 141 countries worldwide over the 9-year period from 2009 to 2017. The results show that three determinants, namely infrastructure quality, labor supply, and investment interdependency, have a positive relationship with a country's international infrastructure investment inflow. However, another determinant, institutional environment, has a significantly negative impact, which suggests that when making foreign infrastructure investment, Chinese contractors enter countries with a comparatively poor institutional environment with substantial political risks. The results also highlight how much a robust infrastructure development plan can help developing countries avoid the poor-infrastructure trap, a situation in which poor infrastructure quality discourages international infrastructure investment. These research findings may assist international infrastructure investment firms to make informed decisions with regard to financing and managing projects and help policymakers who focus on attracting foreign investment in infrastructure.||FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; Structure equation Belt and road initiative| |Design Management in Design-Build Study||Gatti, U.C.(1); Migliaccio, Laird, L.(1)||Practice Periodical on Structural Design and Construction||2014||Journal Article||The increasing use of the design-build project delivery method has resulted in it now being one of the most popular nontraditional methods for delivering road, bridge, mass transit, and rail projects in the United States. However, although the use of design-build is widespread, there remains a substantial lack of information about how to effectively plan and implement design management procedures for design-build transportation projects. In particular, transportation agencies lack information about how to shape appropriate design management roles for various contractual parties and to manage design activities for design-build megaprojects. To fill this gap, this paper presents a case study of the SR 99 Bored Tunnel project in Seattle, Washington. It provides detailed information on how the owner, the Washington State DOT (WSDOT), incorporated design management procedures into its requirements and how the design-builder, Seattle Tunnel Partners, implemented them within its project management processes.||boring - design engineering - project management - tunnels||design-build megaproject - design-build project delivery method - road project - bridge project - mass transit project - rail project - United States - design-build transportation project - transportation agency - SR 99 Bored Tunnel project - Seattle - Washington State DOT - WSDOT - design management - project management process| |Advancing Impact of Education, Training, and Professional Experience on Integrated Project Delivery||Hyun Woo Lee(1); Anderson, S.M.(2); Yong-Woo Kim(3); Ballard, G.(4)||Practice Periodical on Structural Design and Construction||2014||Journal Article||With the increased interest in applying integrated forms of project delivery to complex and uncertain construction projects, the building industry has been experiencing an increased demand for integrated project delivery (IPD). With the trend, many empirical studies have examined the collaborative characteristics of IPD and reported that participants must make the necessary transition for its contractual, technological, and cultural requirements. However, little study has been done to investigate relevant education, training, or professional experience that can support the transition. In response, this study used an online survey that was designed to investigate the level and type of education, training, and professional experience of project members and their corresponding level of background knowledge for each IPD requirement. The key survey findings include (1) project members have the highest level of background knowledge on the cultural requirements of IPD, but the lowest level on the technological requirements; (2) the group with more design-build experience has more background knowledge; (3) the group that received an IPD kick-off training has more background knowledge; and (4) having a lean construction class can prepare students for the IPD environment. It is expected that the survey findings will advance the education, training, and levels of background knowledge of IPD participants, which will enhance their IPD experience accordingly.||buildings (structures) - construction industry - contracts - cultural aspects - industrial training - professional aspects - project management||construction project - building industry - integrated project delivery - IPD - contractual requirement - cultural requirement - professional experience - design-build experience - training impact - education impact| |Case Study to Evaluate Work-Zone Safety Karakhan, Ali A.; Gambatese, John; on Structural Design and Construction||2020||Journal Article||The construction industry is known for its conservative approach toward adopting new, emerging technologies. This conservative approach for adopting technology is caused by multiple factors including the lack of adequate resources to guide construction practitioners in the process of evaluating whether a construction firm should adopt a certain technology or not. Previous studies have already proposed rigorous protocols for evaluating work-zone technologies, but the implementation of such protocols is still unclear to many construction practitioners. The objective of this study is to provide a case study example of how evaluation protocols can be used in practice to determine whether a firm should adopt a certain work-zone technology. The case study focused on assessing the usefulness of commercially available work-zone intrusion alert technologies (WZIATs). The results of the evaluation revealed that some WZIATs could be more attractive to construction organizations and agencies in terms of providing louder alarms, being more mobile, and allowing a higher transmission range. The case study example discussed in this study is expected to provide invaluable practical information to practitioners in the construction industry interested in evaluating and adopting emerging technologies.||CM| |Comparative Environmental Analysis of Seismic Damage in Buildings||Huang, M.; Simonen, K.||JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING||2020||Journal Article||In studying the environmental impacts of buildings, earthquake hazards are rarely considered, but their environmental impacts can be significant. This case study paper demonstrates how the US Federal Emergency Management Agency's Performance Assessment Calculation Tool (PACT) can be used to analyze the environmental impacts of buildings using probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. PACT was used to evaluate 10 case study buildings that varied by five types of lateral systems and two risk categories. For each building, PACT generated 1,000 realizations at five earthquake intensities. The resulting environmental impacts were analyzed according to their distribution, median, and average values, and the differences among building component types, risk categories, and lateral force-resisting systems were explored. In this study, building components that were categorized under Exterior Enclosures, Interior Finishes, and Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) produced notably higher environmental impacts in response to seismic damage, and their vulnerability to displacement- or acceleration-induced damage could be attributed to the characteristics of the lateral systems. Although these observations are notable, they should not be taken as universally applicable to all buildings. Instead, these findings exemplify how the environmental impact results from PACT can be analyzed and interpreted to address both the seismic and environmental aspects of building design.

The development of low-cost technologies that improve access to unconventional water sources, such as the freshwater contained in fog, is one way to address water scarcity. Passive fog collectors, sited to maximize exposure to orographic and advection fog, are typically constructed using 35% Raschel mesh stretched within a structural frame. To assess improvements to this technology, the fog collection potential of nonwoven turf reinforcement mats ( TRM), underwent preliminary testing in a laboratory fog tunnel and more conclusive testing at a field site in Lima, Peru. In fog tunnel tests, both of the two tested TRM specimens increased fog collection yields over 35% Raschel mesh by 26 and 33% respectively. At one field site, the tested mats increased fog collection yields over 35% Raschel mesh by 62 and 75% respectively. At a second field site, these materials increased collection volumes over the 35% Raschel mesh by 146 and 178% respectively. Differences in TRM performance at different sites were likely due to different orientation to prevailing winds at the two test stations. This work suggests that nonwoven turf reinforcement mats have the potential to improve water access in arid, foggy low income communities.

In the paper an attempt is made to measure the gains (health benefits, capitalized home price increases, visibility benefits) and losses [unemployment risks, price increases (including rents), and tax impacts] to mean-income households across communities and to households of different income groups within the communities for which sufficiently disaggregated data are available. The net welfare gains are substantial for households Living in low-income (typically polluted) cities and for the less well-off households living in most cities. Thus the Los Angeles case generates substantial pro-poor benefits from air quality improvement. This finding could be an important ingredient in public discussions to strengthen community support for the Clean Air Act.| |Dying epistemologies: an analysis of home death and its M; Colton, T||ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE||2001||Journal Article||Within the debate between medical and health geographers there are often calls for methodological and philosophical conciliation. The purpose of this paper is to detail some of the epistemological difficulties in ever achieving that aim. We do so by offering a foundational scientific analysis of home death in Washington State, and then turning to a postmedical deconstruction of that scholarship within the space of a single paper. Although the result is ii reflexive self-critical paper on how we know the geography of home death, it is by no means a resolution of the debate. A key epistemological impasse is identified between the foundationalism in our quantitative analysis and our poststructural critique. This impasse leads to different and irreconcilable aims between the two halves of the paper. In our reflections we stress the need to recognize explicitly this epistemological irreconcilability in order to temper the promise of;ln easy solution to the debate between medical and health geography. We nevertheless suggest that scholarly, ethical, and political insights can be gained from this project.||REFORMED Ken||Environment & Planning A||2011||Journal nature is typically managed through top-down, bureaucratic, and expert-driven approaches that tend to rationalize and simplify the interactions between humans and their surroundings. In the last few decades, there has been a significant push in cultural geography and the design disciplines to develop a relational ontology of urban nature, a perspective that emphasizes the hybrid connections between humans and nonhumans, built and unbuilt, social and natural. This perspective offers new and exciting ways of conceptualizing urban nature but it has not produced alternatives to conventional governance. In other words, thinking differently about urban nature has yet to produce different ways of interacting with it. In this paper we argue that civic environmentalism can enact a relational ontology by engaging urban residents in processes of democratic deliberation and action in the reworking of urban nature. We illustrate this approach with a case study of a community-led project to construct a pedestrian trail along an urban creek in Seattle, Washington.

This is not an easy task, because spatial planning and environmental policy are often in conflict rather than being complementary. Spatial planning in the Netherlands has traditionally been a responsibility of local governments, while the national government has promulgated environmental policy, which local governments are expected to implement. However the approach to dealing with environmental issues has recently undergone rapid change, as these issues have become increasingly complex and with growing recognition that they are importantly related to public local development objectives. This has given rise to the realization that programmes for resolving environmental conflicts can no longer be solely the responsibility of the national government; that local governments are often in the best position to solve environmental-spatial conflicts that are unique in character. The shift in approach and responsibility is presented here in a policy-approach model. This change of policy is narrowing the previous gap between spatial planning and environmental policy in the Netherlands.| |A behavioral simulation model for metropolitan policy analysis and planning: residential location and housing market components of UrbanSim||Waddell, P||ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN||2000||Journal Article||The growing demand for better coordination of metropolitan land use and transportation planning has led to the need for new analytical tools to examine the potential impacts of land-use and transportation policies and investments. In this paper I report on the residential and market-clearing components of the recently developed UrbanSim land-use model, which is currently being implemented in Hawaii, Oregon, and Utah. The model is based on parcel-level land-use data and simulates the interaction between demand and supply of real estate by using a dynamic behavioral approach that operates on an annual time schedule. The model system is now operational, and in this paper the design and calibration results for the Eugene-Springfield, Oregon metropolitan area are described.||LAND-USE; MOBILITY; CHOICE| |Places for gods: and heteropraxy in China.||Abramson, Daniel Benjamin||Environment & Planning D: Society & Space||2011||Journal Article||Among the many revivals of older urban practices in China since the death of Mao and the Reforms of Deng Xiaoping is the resurgence of unofficial folk-religious space. As a national phenomenon, it is an uneven process, but where it has become prevalent, it presents challenges both to official standard urban-planning practice, as well as to the public presentation of planning practice. This paper describes how nonstandard practices can emerge in the current context of rapid urbanization, which itself is a force for standardized urban spatial practices in terms of Chinese domestic cultural and political institutions as well as global capital flows. Both local and translocal actors, navigating among various conflicting standards of practice and discourse, can find room to resist hegemony, maintain identity, and innovate. The political and bureaucratic ritualization of planning practice, however, conceals this fact.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=59617075&site=ehost-live| |Global urban signatures of phenotypic change in Travis M.; Zhou, Yuyu||Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America||2017||Journal Article||Humans challenge the phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of species by affecting the fitness landscapes on which they evolve. Recent studies show that cities might play a major role in contemporary evolution by accelerating phenotypic changes in wildlife, including animals, plants, fungi, and other organisms. Many studies of ecoevolutionary change have focused on anthropogenic drivers, but none of these studies has specifically examined the role that urbanization plays in ecoevolution or explicitly examined its mechanisms. This paper presents evidence on the mechanisms linking urban development patterns to rapid evolutionary changes for species that play important functional roles in communities and ecosystems. Through a metaanalysis of experimental and observational studies reporting more than 1,600 phenotypic changes in species across multiple regions, we ask whether we can discriminate an urban signature of phenotypic change beyond the established natural baselines and other anthropogenic signals. We then assess the relative impact of five types of urban disturbances including habitat modifications, biotic interactions, habitat heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and social interactions. Our study shows a clear urban signal; rates of phenotypic change are greater in urbanizing systems compared with natural and nonurban anthropogenic systems. By explicitly linking urban development to traits that affect ecosystem function, we can map potential ecoevolutionary implications of emerging patterns of urban agglomerations and uncover insights for maintaining key ecosystem functions upon which the sustainability of human wellbeing depends.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/global-urban-signatures-phenotypic-change-animal/docview/1946434052/se-2?accountid=14784| |The association between park facilities and the occurrence of physical activity during park visits||Stewart, LEISURE RESEARCH||2018||Journal Article||Prior research has found a positive relationship between the variety of park facilities and park-based physical activity (PA) but has not provided an estimate of the effect that additional different PA facilities have on whether an individual is active during a park visit. Using objective measures of park visits and PA from an urban sample of 225 adults in King County, Washington, we compared the variety of PA facilities in parks visited where an individual was active to PA facilities in parks where the same individual was sedentary. Each additional different PA facility at a park was associated with a 6% increased probability of being active during a visit. Adding different PA facilities to a park appears to have a moderate effect on whether an individual is active during a park visit, which could translate into large community health impacts when scaled up to multiple park |Differences in Residential Energy Use between US City and Suburban Households||Estiri, Hossein||Regional Studies||2016||Journal Article||This paper applies path analysis to household-level data from the US residential sector to study differences in energy consumption between self-identified city and suburban households. Results show that, on average, suburban households consume more energy in residential buildings than their city-dweller counterparts. This variation in energy consumption is due to differences in: (1) characteristics of the household and the housing unit, independently, and (2) interactions between the household and housing characteristics in the city and suburban households. Findings of this study provide new insights into how regional policies can be implemented differently in suburbs and cities to reduce energy consumption.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/differences-residential-energy-use-between-us/docview/1818405313/se-2?accountid=14784| |The effect of impact fees on the provides new evidence on the effects of impact fees on housing prices, using an inventory of single-family housing sale transactions in the 38 cities and towns within King County, Washington, for the period 1991-2000. Although the effect of impact fees on housing prices has been examined previously, earlier studies have been limited by methodological deficiencies. This paper examines the effect of impact fees on new housing and their differential effect on housing price based on the quality of housing, and finds that the effect of impact fees on the price of new housing is quite significant and elastic, raising new home prices by about 166 per cent of the amount of the fee. The increase is 358 per cent for the higher-quality homes and is statistically insignificant for the lower-quality homes.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=13506757&site=ehost-live| |Urban democracy and the local trap||Purcell, Mark||Urban Studies (Routledge)||2006||Journal Article||This paper argues against the local trap-the tendency to assume that the local scale is preferable to other scales.

It is argued that the right to the city is highly susceptible to the local trap, although it is not inherently so. As we continue to search for innovative new ideas like the right to the city that can help to democratise cities, it is critical to think carefully and strategically about scale.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=22675424&site=ehost-live| |A TAXONOMY OF SUBURBAN OFFICE CLUSTERS - THE CASE OF TORONTO||PIVO, G||URBAN STUDIES||1993||Journal Article||Metropolitan plans are commonly based on a system of suburban office clusters. The large variation among recent plans suggests a poor understanding of their nature and impacts. A taxonomy of office clusters could provide a necessary framework. Six hypotheses on the type, frequency, location, employment base and travel characteristics of suburban clusters were tested in a case-study of the Toronto region. Six physical types were identified and found to be associated with certain locations, employment activities and travel mode characteristics. The Toronto metropolitan plan was found to be successful when it conformed with these findings and unsuccessful when it did not. The results lead to provisional guidelines for future metropolitan plans.| |Building Watershed Narratives: An Approach for Broadening the Scope of Success in Urban Stream Restoration||Yocom, Ken||LANDSCAPE RESEARCH||2014||Journal Article||The success of urban stream restoration is often measured through biophysical attributes, or the progress towards restoration of a notionally intact section of landscape. What remains understudied is how success can be defined across social, economic, as well as ecological parameters. This research offers a narrative approach for urban restoration research that serves as a chronotope for untangling the biophysical and sociocultural complexities of the contemporary urban environment. The framework of this approach is presented through a case study of a recent stream restoration project in Seattle, Washington. The findings highlight the need for urban stream restoration processes to be grounded within a sociocultural context that is interdependent with biophysical conditions, and recommends measures of project success to include community, educational evaluating contractors performance during construction of highway pavement projects||Aziz, Ahmed M. Abdel(1)||Construction Management and Economics||2008||Journal Article||For project control during construction, evaluating the performance of contractors is usually established through progress measurement that compares the actual performance to the planned performance. Corrective actions and/or performance penalties are then established as relative measures that judge the actual performance based on current project plans without considering the performance of other similar projects or the lowest performance that projects could reach while still being successful. To establish a generalized benchmark measure and a non-project-specific project control tool, the concept of minimum performance bounds is explained in relation to their development for highway pavement projects. The bounds were developed using constrained-parameters polynomial regression and cluster analysis for a sample of 497 highway pavement projects in Washington State. Minimum bounds for small, medium and large projects were fairly distinguishable signifying the project size effect on the location and shape of performance bounds. Bounds were also developed for projects classified by asphalt quantities, contract values, project duration and project length, being the common criteria used by highway agencies. Owners would use the minimum performance bounds as control tools when requesting corrective actions, establishing incentives, imposing performance penalties, initiating a default clause for substandard performance, and/ or in pre-qualifying contractors for new projects.||Cluster analysis - Contractors - Highway planning - Pavements - Regression analysis||Cash flow forecasting - Constrained-parameters polynomial regression| |Multifaceted public outreach and cost-benefit analysis Kunhee(1); Lee, Article||A heavily trafficked 4.5km highway stretch on Interstate 15 east of Los Angeles was rebuilt using two extended closures, each spanning nine days with 24/7 operations. Before and during the closures, a multifaceted, extensive, dynamic public outreach programme was implemented to gain public support for the project and to minimize inconvenience to the public. That outreach programme is described, its overall effectiveness in terms of total net benefit and traffic inconvenience during lane closures is assessed, and changes in public perception of the accelerated construction strategy resulting from the outreach programme is examined. Pre- and post-construction surveys performed using the project website mirrored the findings of the traffic measurement study, indicating that the outreach programme effectively reduced traffic demand. The results of two web-based surveys with a combined total of approximately 400 respondents indicated a dramatic change in public perception of the accelerated construction strategy. The survey results showed that strong initial objection to the accelerated project eventually became supportive of future, accelerated projects. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the additional cost of the outreach programme was outweighed by the savings achieved from reduced road user delay costs. \u00a9 2009 Taylor & Francis.||Surveys - Websites||Accelerated constructions - Infrastructure managements - Overall effectiveness - Project strategy - Public outreaches - Public perception - Traffic measurements - Web-based system| |A case study of activity-based costing in allocating rebar fabrication costs to projects||Kim, Yong-Woo(1); Han, Seungheon(2); Shin, Sungwon(2); Choi, Kunhee(3)||Construction Management and Economics||2011||Journal Article||How to improve cost allocation for reinforced steel bar (rebar) is an ongoing topic of debate among construction manufacturers and contractors. Traditionally, many fabrication shops have used a single overhead-cost pool accounting system. However, a new costing method, activity-based costing (ABC), may provide more advantages than the traditional system. In this case study, a single overhead-cost pool system is compared with the ABC method to demonstrate how ABC improves cost allocation and provides other benefits. The case study findings indicate that ABC provides such benefits as (1) accurate manufacturing costs; (2) cost information on processes; and (3) information on cost drivers. This paper also bridges the construction and cost accounting literature. Our study contributes to the construction management literature by offering a different cost allocation method to refine fabrication costs assigned to projects. The findings are expected to serve as a reference for industry professionals who recognize the shortcomings of a traditional single overheadcost pool system and are in need of a more accurate costing system. \u00a9 2011 Taylor & Francis.||Bridges - Costs - Fabrication - Lakes - Project management - Rebar||Accounting system - Activity based costing - Construction management - Fabrication shops - Industry professionals - Manufacturing cost - Overhead costs - Traditional systems| |An exploratory study of the relationship between construction workforce physical strain and task level productivity||Gatti, Umberto C.(1); Migliaccio, Giovanni Management and Economics||2014||Journal Article||The monitoring of construction workforce physical strain can be a valuable management strategy in improving workforce productivity, safety, health, and quality of work. Nevertheless, clear relationships between workforce performance and physical strain have yet to be established. An exploratory investigation of the relationship between task level productivity and physical strain was conducted. Nine participants individually performed a four-hour simulated construction task while a wearable physiological status monitor continuously assessed their physiological condition. Heart rate, relative heart rate, and breathing rate were utilized as predictors of physical strain, and task level-single factor productivity was used as an index of productivity. Numerous regression models were generated using the collected data. This investigation initially unsuccessfully attempted to establish a relationship between physiological condition and productivity at the individual worker level. However, an analysis of the regression models showed that there is a relationship between productivity and either heart rate or relative heart rate at the group level, and that this relationship is parabolic. Breathing rate was proved to not be a significant predictor of productivity. Research results significantly improve understanding of the relationship between work physiology and task productivity. Researchers and practitioners may use the tested monitoring devices, analysis methods, and results to design further applied studies and to improve workforce productivity. \u00a9 2013 \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis.||Heart - Industrial hygiene - Occupational risks - Personnel - Regression analysis||Construction workforces - Management strategies - Occupational health and safety - Operations management - Physiological condition - Physiological status monitors - Work physiology - workforce| |Addressing Correctional Staff Stress through Interaction with Nature: A New Role for Health||2018||Journal Article||Correctional staff are at risk for high levels of stress, and interaction with nature may buffer this stress.

The planning models used by metropolitan planning organizations were generally not designed to address these issues, creating a gap in the ability of planners to systematically assess them. UrbanSim is a new model system that was developed to respond to these emerging requirements and has now been applied in three metropolitan areas. This article describes the model system and its application to Eugene-Springfield, Oregon.||FUTURES MODEL| |When to Partner for Public Infrastructure?||Whittington, Jan||Journal the American Planning Association||2012||Journal Article||Problem, research strategy, and findings: Public agencies traditionally request bids and award contracts to private firms after infrastructure designs are complete (bid-build). They also increasingly partner with private firms, often by folding capital improvements into a contract to design and build (design-build). The latter involves much more than the mere transfer of design work to the private sector, such as time to completion; the merits or problems of design-build strategies can, thus, be difficult to isolate. This article presents a method for doing so. Together with the development of a theory of contracting, the comparative analysis of two very similar highway overpass projects, one design-build and the other bid-build, demonstrates how so-called transaction cost economics can clarify the details of partnership cost-effectiveness. Takeaway for practice: Transaction cost analysis disaggregates and evaluates the costs of completed projects, accounting for factors typically external to economic analysis. My approach reveals tradeoffs between variables of interest to planners, such as the pace of delivery, public participation, environmental compliance, and the transfer of risk of cost overrun to the private sector.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=79987954&site=ehost-live| |Integrated environmental zoning - An innovative Dutch approach to measuring and managing environmental spillovers in urban regions||Miller, D; deRoo, G||JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION||1996||Journal Article||The Dutch development of Integrated Environmental Zoning is an advanced effort to account cumulatively for several environmental spillovers from manufacturing, and to manage their impacts on surrounding residential areas. This national policy initiative involves mapping the spatial patterns of pollution within urban areas, information that informs the development of abatement programs and of land-use regulations to locate manufacturing activities and housing in a sustainable manner. In eleven pilot projects testing this system, it has met with enthusiasm but also aroused public concern over identified cases of acute pollution, and political controversy over the required mitigation measures.| |Field evaluation of permeable pavement systems for improved stormwater management||Booth, DB; Leavitt, J||JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION||1999||Journal Article||The contribution of impervious surfaces to the disrupted runoff processes in an urban watershed is overwhelming. Nearly all the problems ultimately result from the loss of the water-retaining function of the soil in the urban landscape. Traditional solutions for stormwater management have not been widely successful; in contrast, permeable pavements can be one element of a more promising alternative approach to reduce the downstream consequences of urban development. We report on a constructed experimental Facility for measuring water quantity and water quality from four different permeable parking surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate similar runoff performances of the surfaces relative to each other, and significant attenuation of runoff relative to traditional asphalt.||GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; URBANIZATION; RUNOFF| Daniel Benjamin||Planning Perspectives||2007||Journal Article||Chinese cities today represent a historically important case of the relation between city-scale preservation policy and urban design, and the role they play in the rapid transformation of urban environments. This article reviews Beijing's preservation and urban design policies as they existed in 1990, and as they evolved and responded over the following fifteen years of radical change. Beijing's master plan in the 1990s ambitiously attempted to define the preservation-worthy image of the entire old city, but did so in narrowly picturesque terms. The practice of 'protecting' designated historic structures by clearing the space around them, and the dependence on a totalizing view-from-on-high to define Beijing's overall characteristic form (as opposed to an experience of the city from its myriad public and private spaces), produced a city-wide preservation policy that was particularly handicapped in its ability to accommodate change.

The research reveals prior to the 1970s, apartments clustered in downtown areas; throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the development of apartments expanded to the suburbs and along major interstates; and in the 2000s, apartment growth continued in the peripheral areas while returning downtown. During this time period, apartments were developed most often in majority white, high-income and low-poverty neighbourhoods. These geographic and sociodemographic characteristics challenge widespread conceptions that equate multifamily rental housing with central city locations and low-income populations. The findings suggest that multifamily rental housing offers a powerful tool to increase residential density in downtown and suburban locations, while also accommodating a sociodemographically diverse population.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/geographic-sociodemographic-transformation/docview/2249695111/se-2?accountid=14784| |The effect of market conditions on the housing outcomes of subsidized households: the case of the US voucher programme.||Colburn, Gregg||Housing Studies||2019||Journal Article||Since being created in the 1970s, housing vouchers have become the primary mode of federal housing support for low-income households in the US. The voucher programme was designed to provide recipients with the mobility needed to secure higher quality housing in neighbourhoods of their choice. Decades of analysis suggest that the programme has failed to produce the favourable outcomes envisioned by policymakers. To add to our understanding of the outcomes of this important federal programme, this paper seeks to underscore the importance of context-dependent policy analysis. In particular, this study analyses the impact of housing market conditions on the outcomes achieved by voucher recipients. Using neighbourhood and housing outcome data from the American Housing Survey, and median rent and rental market vacancy data, this paper demonstrates the important role that market conditions play in programme outcomes. The results from this study suggest that voucher recipients are successful at improving housing unit quality outcomes regardless of market conditions, but the ability to move to a better neighbourhood is a function of vacancy rates.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effect-market-conditions-on-housing-outcomes/docview/2279758671/se-2?accountid=14784| |Korean apartment complexes and social relationships of the residents.||Gu, Naeun||Housing Studies||2020||Journal Article||Korean apartment housing, where more than half of the population lives, has drawn attention with its spatial, historical, and cultural uniqueness.

Unlike public or social housing programs, demand-side subsidies require recipients to enter the private market to use their benefits. The focus of this study is the experiences of assisted households in the private housing market and the outcomes they achieve. Given the link between policy design and program outcomes and because all housing subsidy programs are not created equal, one might expect the experiences and outcomes of recipients to also vary. To examine this relationship, using data from national housing surveys, this study analyzes cross-national variation in housing support programs and compares the housing and neighbourhood outcomes of subsidized households in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands. The findings of this study highlight that market context and policy design are associated with housing outcomes. In particular, the strong tenant supports and favourable design of housing assistance in the Netherlands is associated with favourable outcomes for subsidized households. In the US and the UK, subsidized households, in general, underperform their unsubsidized peers. This article underscores the importance of institutional context and program design when public assistance programs require recipients to enter the private market to use a benefit.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/use-markets-housing-policy-comparative-analysis/docview/2476820385/se-2?accountid=14784| |To Inhabit Well: Counterhegemonic Movements and the Right to the City||Purcell, Mark||URBAN GEOGRAPHY||2013||Journal Article||A right to the city, understood as a conjoint claim to a right to inhabit urban space well, can be an effective starting point from which diverse urban movements can begin to build broad counterhegemonic coalitions for alternative urban futures.

First, we use housing consumption and residential mobility theories to construct a hypothetical probability distribution function for the consumption of housing services across three phases of household life span. We then hypothesize a second probability distribution function for the offering of housing services based on the distance from city center(s) at the metropolitan scale. Intersecting the two hypothetical probability functions, we develop a phase-based model for the distribution of households in US metropolitan regions. We argue that phase one households (young adults) are more likely to reside in central city locations, whereas phase two and three households are more likely to select suburban locations, due to their respective housing consumption behaviors.

Given the generally increased affordability of cars, most local authorities are making efforts to provide more parking spaces to accommodate additional cars. Although the worldwide paradigm of managing parking is shifting from a supply-focused approach to a restraint mind-set, China has been slow to follow this trend. To untangle the factors that contribute to delays implementing desirable parking policy reforms, this paper examines the development of parking policies in China. This paper characterizes the challenge of parking in Chinese cities as a spatio-temporal mismatch. In the context of rapid motorization, local authorities are subject to political pressure to cater to the increased parking demand by increasing the minimum parking requirements. However, this approach fails to mitigate parking shortages and results in unintended consequences, including relatively high parking density in central and transit-rich areas and imbalanced parking across neighbourhoods. This paper suggests four strategies, including market-based pricing, geographically differentiated supply regulations, and district-based parking management (Parking management is referred to as various policies and programs that result in more efficient use of parking resources). These strategies represent policy-reform targets to establish more efficient parking systems in rapidly motorizing urban settings worldwide.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/parking-policies-chinas-metropolises-rationales/docview/2082819582/se-2?accountid=14784| |ON A CLEAR S||COASTAL JOURNAL||1982||Journal Article| |House Serra, Ana OF REAL ESTATE RESEARCH||2020||Journal Article||This paper examines house price dynamics, bank herding behavior, and the linkages between them.

The result of the analysis also shows that the measure of make-ready process, PCR, has a more significant correlation with the project cost performance than the measure of weekly plan reliability, PPC.||CM| |The Determinants of Executive Compensation in US Factors||Ascherl, Claudia;Schrand, Liesa;Schaefers, Wolfgang;Dermisi, Sofia||Journal of Property Research||2019||Journal Article||The paper examines whether executive compensation packages within the US REIT industry are determined merely by performance or also by CEO power mechanisms that have an essential influence on board-level negotiations. We offer original insights into management compensation arrangements during and after the financial crisis. The relative importance of cash bonuses in CEO compensation contracts has more than halved after the crisis. Simultaneously, after the financial crisis, equity-based compensation became increasingly important. Concerning the pay-for-performance link, our results show no relationship during the financial crisis. However, after the crisis, we find a strong significant link between remuneration packages and corporate success.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/determinants-executive-compensation-us-reits/docview/2324809887/se-2?accountid=14784||Executive compensation , Chief executive officers , Negotiations , Compensation , Packages , Crises , governance Vernez||BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION||2008||Journal Article||Health problems related to physical inactivity have become a global health challenge affecting people from the full spectrum of income, age, and ethnicity. This paper examines if neighbourhood environments are associated with physical activity, especially walking and cycling. It analyses 608 respondent survey data from Washington State in the US and Geographic Information System-derived measures of the neighbourhood environment. Respondents reported traffic volume to be the most significant barrier, and good lighting to be the most important facilitator of walking and cycling. Utilitarian destinations, such as grocery stores, restaurants, retail stores and convenience stores, were significant correlates of walking and moderate-intensity physical activities, while housing type, sports facility and transportation infrastructure were correlated with vigorous physical activities. Active people rated higher for their neighbourhood attributes including safety, visual quality, knowing neighbours, seeing many other people walking and cycling, and the availability of sports facilities, parks, and bike racks. Simple interventions such as street lighting, pavements/sidewalks, street trees, benches, bike lanes or trails, bike racks, and traffic-calming devices appeared to hold some promise in promoting physical activities in neighbourhoods. Long-term solutions should include strategies to enhance overall aesthetics, safety, accessibility, street connectivity, and social interactions among |Disruptive Hamid; Dossick, and Information||2021||Journal Article||The current proliferation of custom information exchange initiatives in projects disrupts information exchange routines of design and construction firms. This paper investigates how firms perceive, interpret, and act upon information exchange requirements that do not align with their existing routines. This case study examines a construction project for which the owner specified highly custom requirements for digital production and delivery of project submittals. Using ethnographic methods, the project parties' existing routines and their patterns of perceiving and responding to the requirements were identified. These patterns showed that the parties perceived disruptions to the existing dispositions and rules that guided their routines and shaped their performance across projects. The project parties used a combination of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning mechanisms to interpret the requirements, expose the inefficiencies associated with their workflows, and set new ground rules for action. The grounded propositions in this study hold that the limited opportunities for inductive reasoning and reflective assessment of workflows in projects can press project parties into identifying alternative workflows through cognitive search and abductive reasoning. This, in turn, results in highly situated, temporary, and fragmented workflows that are not durable and effective to contribute to refinement of existing information exchange routines.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/disruptive-information-exchange-requirements/docview/2484699117/se-2?accountid=14784| |Measuring neighbourhood air pollution: the Planning & Management||2010||Journal Article||Current US regulatory air quality monitoring networks measure ambient levels of pollutants and cannot capture the effects of mobile sources at the micro-scale. Despite the fact that overall air quality has been getting better, more vulnerable populations (children, the elderly, minorities and the poor) continue to suffer from traffic-related air pollution. As development intensifies in urban areas, more people are exposed to road-related air pollution. However, the only consideration given to air quality, if any, is based on ambient measures. This paper uses an inexpensive, portable Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP) to measure Black Carbon (BC) emissions, a surrogate for diesel fuels emissions, in Seattle's International District. With the aid of a GPS receiver, street-level BC data were geocoded in real space-time. It was found that pollution levels differed substantially across the study area. The results show the need for street-level air pollution monitoring, revisions in current land use and transportation policies, and air quality planning practice.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=47307271&site=ehost-live| |Case studies in co-benefits approaches to climate change Benjamin; Joachim||Journal of Environmental Planning & Management||2017||Journal Article||Attempts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or manage the effects of climate change traditionally focus on management or policy options that promote single outcomes (e.g., either benefiting ecosystems or human health and well-being). In contrast, co-benefits approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation address climate change impacts on human and ecological health in tandem and on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The article engages the concept of co-benefits through four case studies. The case studies emphasize co-benefits approaches that are accessible and tractable in countries with human populations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. They illustrate the potential of co-benefits approaches and provide a platform for further discussion of several interdependent principles relevant to the implementation of co-benefits strategies. These principles include providing incentives across multiple scales and time frames, promoting long-term integrated impact assessment, and fostering multidimensional communication networks.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/case-studies-co-benefits-approaches-climate/docview/1867531183/se-2?accountid=14784| |Seattle, the Pacific Basin, and the Sources of Regional Modernism||Ochsner, Jeffrey Karl||FABRICATIONS-THE JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIANS AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND||2016||Journal Article||The emergence of mid-twentieth-century architecture that was both modern and regional in Seattle and nearby areas of Washington State presents a singular case study demonstrating an array of influences from Asia and Latin America as well as the Pacific Coast of the United States. This network of influences is evidence of the complexity of a dissemination that gained momentum in the 1930s as the modern movement began to spread globally, as identified by historian William J. R. Curtis. Although awareness of distant sources primarily influenced design vocabularies from the 1930s to the 1950s in the Pacific Northwest, by the early 1960s, as Seattle architects and landscape architects began to travel to Japan, they developed a much deeper understanding from a broader collection of sites, and this, in turn, shaped surprisingly varied local responses from Rich Haag's ideas of non-striving design to Victor Steinbrueck's increasing interest in Pike Place Market. Untangling the array of Pacific Basin influences that helped shape mid-twentieth-century design in Seattle provides one demonstration of the validity of considering the Pacific as an interdependent region. Thus, Seattle offers a foundational case study towards the future project of writing an encompassing account of the interconnected architectural history of the Pacific Basin.| |To move or not to move: Relationships to place and relocation choices in HOPE VI||Kleit, Rachel Garshick; Manzo, Lynne C.||HOUSING POLICY DEBATE||2006||Journal Article||As the HOPE VI (Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere) program redevelops public housing, residents must relocate. Little is known about how they make the choice to stay or to go, if they are given one. Survey interviews with 200 residents of Seattle's High Point HOPE VI project provide the data to address four questions about such moves. First, what factors predict residents' initial choice to stay on site during redevelopment or to move permanently away? Second, how does the initial choice predict actual behavior? Third; what is the role of place attachment and place dependence on residents' relocation choices? Fourth, what is the role of other trade-offs in decision making? Findings suggest that family situations and place-dependent considerations shape initial relocation preferences of public housing residents and that their family situations may be a more important influence on the actual move. Implications for the HOPE VI program are discussed.||RESIDENTIAL SATISFACTION||community development and revitalization; low-income housing; mobility| |Consolidating ZIP Codes for Small Area Fair Market Rents: A Method for Implementing the New Rule||Walter, Rebecca J.||Housing Policy Debate||2018||Journal Article||Fair Market Rents (FMRs), calculated for an entire metropolitan region, are used to establish payment standards for the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. In response to recent criticism that FMRs do not represent rent disparity and restrict households from moving to high-opportunity areas, a new rule introducing Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs) has been issued. SAFMRs are based on ZIP codes to reflect local market rents and increase the number of payment standards used to administer the HCV program. The purpose of this research is to determine whether the number of payment standards can be reduced by consolidating ZIP codes, while adhering to the primary objectives of the SAFMR rule. The ZIP code grouping process conducted offers one method for reducing the number of payment standards needed to implement the new rule; however, the rent analysis reveals the over- and underestimation of SAFMRs for some Policy Debate||2019||Journal Article||The tightening of mortgage credit in the aftermath of the global financial crisis has been identified as a factor in the decline of homeownership in the United States to 50-year lows.

An Early Evaluation||Reina, Vincent; Acolin, Arthur; Bostic, Raphael W.||Housing Policy Debate||2019||Journal Article||One critique of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)'s Housing Choice Voucher program is that its maximum rent limit is set at the metropolitan level, making more expensive neighborhoods effectively off limits to households who receive rental assistance. As a result, the design of the program limits a voucher household's access to opportunity neighborhood. In response, HUD created the Small Area Fair Market Rent (SAFMR) demonstration program, which calculates the maximum voucher rent at the zip code level so that HUD's rent limits more closely align with local neighborhood rents. In theory, this program should improve a voucher household's choice set and location outcomes. Looking at changes in the location of beneficiaries in the six sites that participated in the SAFMR demonstration program, we find a significant amount of regional variation in the results. Specifically, introduction of the SAFMR rent calculations results in voucher households living in higher opportunity neighborhoods in Dallas, Texas, in lower opportunity neighborhoods in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and mixed effects in other areas. These mixed results highlight some of the potential incremental benefits of the program and reinforce the importance of viewing this policy over a longer period of time, and in the context of other constraints voucher households face in accessing neighborhood opportunity.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/section-8-vouchers-rent-limits-do-small-area-fair/docview/2157717054/se-2?accountid=14784| |Transitioning to Homeownership: Asset Building assesses the asset building of households that take part in shared-equity homeownership (SEH) models. The contribution of this article is a comparison of outcomes for households participating in shared-equity programs with other low- and moderate-income households who rent or own properties without restrictions on appreciation. We matched participants in SEH programs to households with similar characteristics from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) over the 1997-2017 period. The findings indicate that in real terms, median SEH homeowners accumulated about $1,700 in housing wealth annually or around $10,000 during their holding period. This amount is lower than the $2,100 median annual gain in home equity experienced by similar PSID owners but statistically and economically significantly larger than the $16 in annual gain experienced by similar PSID renters. The findings provide evidence that households participating in SEH programs experienced positive, but modest, wealth gains that were slightly lower than those of homeowners in unrestricted units but substantially higher than those of renters.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/transitioning-homeownership-asset-building-low/docview/2604997876/se-2?accountid=14784||Staphylococcal enterotoxin H , Appreciation , , |Housing Wealth and Consumption Over the 2001\u00c4\u00ec2013 Period: The Role of the Collateral Channel.||Acolin, Arthur||Journal of Housing Research||2020||Journal Article||This study estimates changes in the relationship between housing wealth and consumption among homeowners during the recent housing boom and bust in the United States, focusing on the period 2001-2007, during which house prices increased and financial innovations led to an increased availability of products enabling households to extract home equity; and on the period 2007-2013, during which house prices declined and home equity withdrawal products became largely unavailable. The estimated elasticity of consumption with regard to housing wealth increased in 2004 and 2007 (.06) relative to 2001 (.04). The estimated elasticities then decreased in 2010 and 2013 (to below .04). In addition, the increase was larger among borrowing constrained households than unconstrained households. No relationship between housing prices and consumption was found among renters. These additional tests for subpopulations support the hypothesis that the increase in consumption out of housing wealth occurred through the collateral channel.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/housing-wealth-consumption-over-2001-2013-period/docview/2526904487/se-2?accountid=14784| |Autonomous People: Identity, Agency, and Automated Driving||Dunn, Peter T.||JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY||2021||Journal Article||The prevailing discourse on autonomous vehicles (AVs) has not yet developed a sophisticated conceptualization of autonomy and has given insufficient attention to the autonomy of people. In response, this article shifts our attention away from the AV's autonomy and towards that of its user. Autonomy is conceived here as the socially and materially situated capacity of an individual to identify and act on one's own values and desires, a capacity that is desirable for collective political life. This definition is drawn selectively from a survey of thought illustrating the richness of this concept. I then examine how studies of transportation have already made use of certain themes of autonomy in understanding mobility practices beyond dominant utilitarian models. This sets up an examination of AVs, where the existing literature tends to use a narrow conceptualization of autonomy. I then briefly examine two examples of unsettled questions in AV development, discretionary user controls and shared ride systems, in light of autonomy. The goal of this article is both to show how autonomy can be productive in understanding mobility practices, and to argue for personal autonomy as a normative value worth pursuing in the technical, political, and social development of automated mobility A.

The heat fluxes were measured with heat flux meters and mimic boxes. Daily and seasonal measured performances are displayed. A portion of the walls was covered with additional insulation. This allowed comparison of insulated and noninsulated basements and showed that a modest amount of insulation could reduce the annual heat loss by approximately 50%. The local fluxes are shown to vary significantly with depth, and the insulation was most effective when applied to the upper wall surface, which communicated with the ambient air through a relatively short path through the earth at near grade level. Temperature stratification effects are shown to be important, especially with respect to floor heat fluxes.||PARTIALLY INSULATED BASEMENTS; THEORY REVIEW||2014||Journal Article||This paper examines the architecture and planning of the Mostra d'Oltremare in Naplesa national display of colonial expansion that opened in May 1940and the Esposizione Universale di Romaan Olympics of Civilization that was proposed for 1942.

In store promotions and popular accounts, urban retail spaces provide the setting for the materialization of the crowd as the driving engine and mutated body of mass consumption. Store owners and their backers employed the image of shopping hordes on their premises as an advertisement for the success of modern trade. The department store served as a model of a rational utopian order in its operations and spaces. But in popular representations the growing assemblies of bodies and goods often appeared as a potentially unruly force that threatened the constraints of their surroundings. This paper will trace the path of the urban crowd as it flowed from the city streets into the inner recesses of the store, mapping narratives of shopping through the lenses of gender and class.||Crowds; department stores; aftermath of September 11, 2001, Islam has generally been represented in the media as a political ideology and some academics have over-emphasized this political image of Islam. These are not baseless speculations; there are several political Islamic groups worldwide. However, there are also many apolitical Islamic groups. This article analyzes one of the most influential apolitical Islamic movements in the world, the Nurcus, and its founder, Bediuzzaman Said Nursi. Nursi, the author of the Risale-i Nur collection, emphasized the ascetic aspect of Islam: 'Ninety-nine percent of Islam is about ethics, worship, the hereafter, and virtue. Only one percent is about politics; leave that to the rulers.' He also added, 'I seek refuge in God from Satan and [party] politics.' Through the analysis of Nursi's thought and activism, the article will try to answer the following questions: Was Nursi a Sufi? What are the theological and structural bases of Nursi's apolitical interpretation of Islam? What is the impact of the secular state in Turkey on the development of Nursi's apolitical outlook and activism? What does his apolitical understanding of Islam say to non-Turkish Muslims who do not live in a secular state?| |Diverse approaches to the preservation of built vernacular heritage: case study of post-disaster reconstruction of the Xijie Historic District in Dujiangyan City, China.||Kou, Huaiyun; Chalana, Manish; Zhou, Jian||Journal of Architectural Conservation||2020||Journal Article||Preservation of the built vernacular heritage contributes to maintaining a 'sense of place' and cultural diversity; yet, it is often ignored in preservation practices that favour high styled architectures and monumental sites. In China, although the understanding of the value of vernacular expression has shown some progress, technical and methodological efforts are still necessary to address the diversity and complexity of vernacular heritage. In this paper, the Xijie Historic District in Dujiangyan City in China provides an example for the preservation of the built vernacular heritage in the context of neighbourhood revitalization during a post-earthquake reconstruction project. Five types of intervention are examined in this paper, including the repair and restoration of the monuments, restoration of historic buildings, rehabilitation of traditional houses, contextual design of new buildings, and demolition to provide public space and facilities. In particular, the measures implemented to meet the residents' needs while maintaining the diversity of the built vernacular heritage are inspected. This study concludes with three recommendations: the classification of vernacular environments and employment of diverse measures to each type; the adaptation of the vernacular environment to meet residents' expectations and aspirations; and recognition of the development and reasonable control of the changes.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=141822057&site=ehost-live| |Ranci\u00aere and revolution.||Purcell, Mark||Space & Polity||2014||Journal Article||This paper explores what role Ranci\u00aere's work can play in the struggle for a more democratic world. It highlights the strength of Ranci\u00aere's conception of democracy, which clearly identifies democracy as a popular disruption of the prevailing police order. This order claims to have assigned a proper role to all parts of society. Democracy for Ranci\u00aere is when an element emerges that has not been taken account of and demonstrates the police order's claim to be false. Among the many benefits of this way of understanding democracy, it upsets any easy association between hegemony and democracy - as in Laclau & Mouffe - and it refuses utterly the ideological fiising of democracy, capitalism, and the state offered by the liberaldemocratic- capitalist consensus. However, Ranci\u00aere's approach also introduces significant limits on democracy because it denies that democracy can ever do more than disrupt the prevailing order. It does not allow for the possibility that democracy can grow and spread to the point that it becomes pervasive in the polity. This paper uses the case of the Egyptian uprising to show how this limitation closes off important political possibilities. The paper argues that Deleuze & Guattari's theorisation of revolution, when used carefully, is a necessary corrective to Ranci\u00aere's too-restricted concept of democracy [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]; Copyright of Space & Polity is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The typical, superblock-centred approach is an outgrowth of local land use practices that were shaped by widespread collectivist expropriation of property from the 1950s into the 1970s, and drastic resident relocation policies since the early 1990s. A contrasting case, from a city where such levels of expropriation did not occur, reveals a very different, more street-centred approach to urban design that correlates with a more favourable compensation policy for residents.

Tunisia is no exception. The complex relationships between extant architectures of colonialism and current users, designers, and preservationists there are shifting within the context of contemporary globalization. Though ties between Europe, France, and Tunisia are less overt than they once were-now taking the form of international development loans, professional and educational exchanges, tourism programmes, popular culture and the media-they are nonetheless significant in their sustained influence. This article explores the nature and products of neocolonialism in postcolonial heritage management and tourism practices, using several case studies from Tunis including curated medina walking tours, the renovation of the Avenue Bourguiba, and expansion of the renowned Bardo Museum. Rather than dismissing contemporary preservation and tourism management practices, the article invites further debate regarding the influence of foreign actors, conservation approaches, and potential alternatives for the future of heritage management in a rapidly changing Tunisia.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=144667981&site=ehost-live| |Split-Match-Aggregate (SMA) algorithm: integrating sidewalk data with transportation network data in GIS.||Kang, Bumjoon; Scully, Jason Y.; Stewart, Orion; Hurvitz, Geographical Information Science||2015||Journal Article||Sidewalk geodata are essential to understand walking behavior. However, such geodata are scarce, only available at the local jurisdiction and not at the regional level. If they exist, the data are stored in geometric representational formats without network characteristics such as sidewalk connectivity and completeness. This article presents the Split-Match-Aggregate (SMA) algorithm, which automatically conflates sidewalk information from secondary geometric sidewalk data to existing street network data. The algorithm uses three parameters to determine geometric relationships between sidewalk and street segments: the distance between streets and sidewalk segments; the angle between sidewalk and street segments; and the difference between the lengths of matched sidewalk and street segments. The SMA algorithm was applied in urban King County, WA, to 13 jurisdictions' secondary sidewalk geodata. Parameter values were determined based on agreement rates between results obtained from 72 pre-specified parameter combinations and those of a trained geographic information systems (GIS) analyst using a randomly selected 5% of the 79,928 street segments as a parameter-development sample. The algorithm performed best when the distances between sidewalk and street segments were 12m or less, their angles were 25 degrees or less, and the tolerance was set to 18m, showing an excellent agreement rate of 96.5%. The SMA algorithm was applied to classify sidewalks in the entire study area and it successfully updated sidewalk coverage information on the existing regional-level street network data. The algorithm can be applied for conflating attributes between associated, but geometrically misaligned line data sets in GIS.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=102777790&site=ehost-live| |Understanding the motivations of coastal residents to voluntarily purchase federal flood insurance||Brody, Samuel D.; RISK RESEARCH||2017||Journal Article||Federally-backed flood insurance is the primary mechanism by which residents in the United States (US) prepare for and recover from floods. While there is a growing literature on the general uptake of flood insurance, little work has been done to address the factors motivating residents to voluntarily buy and maintain federally-based insurance policies. We address this issue by conducting a survey of coastal residents in four localities in Texas and Florida. Based on survey responses, we quantitatively examine the factors influencing whether residents located outside of the 100-year floodplain obtain insurance policies when it is not required. Using two-sample t-tests and binary logistic regression analysis to control for multiple contextual and psychological variables, we statistically isolate the factors contributing most to the decision to purchase insurance. Our findings indicate that a resident located outside the 100-year floodplain who has voluntarily purchased federal flood insurance can be characterized, on average, as more highly educated, living in relatively expensive homes, and a long-time resident who thinks about flood hazard relatively infrequently but who, nonetheless, thinks flood insurance is relatively affordable. Unexpectedly, the physical proximity of a respondent to flood hazard areas makes little or no discernible difference in the decision to obtain flood OF RISK RESEARCH||2017||Journal Article||Local authorities who believe their water systems are contaminated need to warn those at risk to take protective actions. In the past, such efforts have often achieved only partial success in preventing people from deciding to continue consumption of contaminated drinking water. To examine the possible antecedents of decisions to comply with water consumption advisories, this study examined 110 Boston residents' actual protective actions and 203 Texas students' expected protective actions; their perceptions of three protective actions on seven attributes; and their risk perceptions, water contamination experience, facilitating conditions, and demographic characteristics. The profiles of the protective actions for the hazard-related and resource-related attributes suggest reasons why people preferred to use bottled water rather than boil or personally chlorinate water. In particular, perceived effectiveness in protecting health was the most important correlate of protective action, which means that a protective action can have a high level of implementation even though it has poor ratings on other attributes such as cost. In addition, this study indicates public health officials may also need to address people's misconceptions about the hazard-related and resource-related attributes of any relevant protective actions. Finally, consistent with an extensive body of previous research, students were similar to residents in many important respects even though were some statistically significant differences.||ACTION vs; population samples| |A CASE STUDY OF THE FAILURE OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION TO CROSS KNOWLEDGE BOUNDARIES IN VIRTUAL CONSTRUCTION.||Neff, Gina; Fiore-Silfvast, Brittany; artefacts serve to bridge knowledge barriers across epistemic communities? There have been many studies of the roles new information and communication technologies play within organizations. In our study, we compare digital and non-digital methods of inter-organizational collaboration. Based on ethnographic fieldwork on three construction projects and interviews with 65 architects, engineers, and builders across the USA, we find that IT tools designed to increase collaboration in this setting instead solidify and make explicit organizational and cultural differences between project participants. Our study suggests that deeply embedded disciplinary thinking is not easily overcome by digital representations of knowledge and that collaboration may be hindered through the exposure of previously implicit distinctions among the team members' skills and organizational status. The tool that we study, building information modelling, reflects and amplifies disciplinary representations of the building by architects, engineers, and builders instead of supporting increased collaboration among them. We argue that people sometimes have a difficult time overcoming the lack of interpretive flexibility in digital coordinating tools, even when those tools are built to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=51377225&site=ehost-live| |Exploring Post-Incarceration Residential Trajectories: Indicators of Article||Extant research on housing instability focuses on external housing barriers but limited research exists on individual-level indicators of housing stability for individuals returning to society from incarceration. This study addresses this gap with data collected from 70 individuals recently released from incarceration who returned to Bexar County (San Antonio, Texas) that were not placed in specific housing programmes, leaving them to seek housing independently. The study explores residential trajectories and the utility of individual-level characteristics, specifically readiness for change, in relation to housing stability. The findings reveal the importance of assessing the dynamics of each individual living situation since many of the participants are housed but not in stable housing situations. Furthermore, readiness for change (specifically action, self-sufficiency, and human agency) is found to be a significant indicator of housing stability and may represent an important intervention target for re-entry and reintegration programmes.

This report reviews the characteristics and assesses the effectiveness of health impact assessments (HIAs) conducted in this sector. A total of 30 HIAs conducted in 14 states in the United States were identified using a targeted literature search. Five HIAs illustrative of the different source and sub-sector categories, and with identifiable impacts on decision-making processes were selected for review. An existing conceptual framework (Wismar) was used to assess the effectiveness of the five selected HIAs on decision-making related to non-renewable energy, renewable energy, mining, and energy conservation. The 30 HIAs were performed for a variety of projects and assessed health impacts ranging from metabolic disorders to community livability. Eight of the 30 reports were incorporated into environmental impact assessments. All five selected HIAs were generally effective and raised awareness of the health effects of the projects being assessed; four were directly effective and led to changes in final project decisions. Their variable effectiveness may be related to the extent of community engagement and consideration of equity issues, differences in the details and quality of monitoring and evaluation plans devised as part of the HIA process, and whether the outcomes of monitoring and evaluation are reported.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/use-effectiveness-health-impact-assessment-energy/docview/2139183626/se-2?accountid=14784| |On uncertain ground: being at home in the context of public housing redevelopment.||Manzo, Lynne C.||International Journal of Housing Policy||2014||Journal Article||The recent global financial crisis increased the volatility of housing markets and furthered the ongoing disinvestment in public sector housing. This disinvestment has been manifest in urban restructuring programmes involving both the privatisation and the wholesale demolition of public/social housing. For example, programmes like HOPE VI in the USA have radically altered the landscape of public housing through the demolition of tens of thousands of housing units nationwide. However, what of the people who occupied this housing, and what of the lives they had built there? In such a context, deliberating on the notion of being at home becomes a pressing task, necessitating serious consideration of the lived experience of place and place attachments among those who have been displaced by such programmes. While research has studied outcomes such as the quality of the new neighbourhood and household economic stability, it does not adequately address the lived experience of place and the disruptions that forced relocation can cause. This paper brings the literature on place attachment into the discussion of urban restructuring programmes and discusses the findings of several empirical studies on place attachment to provide a more complete picture of the impacts of such programmes on poor people. It demonstrates how place attachments in the context of public housing are complicated by poverty, power dynamics, ambivalence, and stigma, underscoring how attachments are formed through the interplay of policy and programme rhetoric, and the active processes of meaning making among residents. Policy implications of considering place attachments in public housing redevelopment efforts are also addressed.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/on-uncertain-ground-being-at-home-context-public/docview/1857766777/se-2?accountid=14784| |Evaluating a New Suite of Luminance-Based Design Metrics for Predicting Human Visual Comfort in Offices with Daylight||Van Den Wymelenberg, Kevin; Inanici, Mehlika||LEUKOS||2016||Journal Article||A new suite of visual comfort metrics is proposed and evaluated for their ability to explain the variability in subjective human responses in a mock private office environment with daylight. Participants (n = 48) rated visual comfort and preference factors, including 1488 discreet appraisals, and these subjective results were correlated against more than 2000 unique luminance-based metrics that were captured using high dynamic range photography techniques. Importantly, luminance-based metrics were more capable than illuminance-based metrics for fitting the range of human subjective responses to data from visual preference questionnaire items. No metrics based upon the entire scene ranked in the top 20 squared correlation coefficients, nor did any based upon illuminance or irradiance data, nor did any of the studied glare indices, luminance ratios, or contrast ratios. The standard deviation of window luminance was the metric that best fit human subjective responses to visual preference on seven of 12 questionnaire items (with r(2) = 0.43). Luminance metrics calculated using the horizontal 40. band (a scene-independent mask) and the window area (a scene-dependent mask) represented the majority of the top 20 squared correlation coefficients for almost all subjective visual preference questionnaire items. The strongest multiple regression model was for the semantic differential rating (too dim-too bright) of the window wall (R-adj(2) = 0.49) and was built upon three variables; standard deviation of window luminance, the 50th percentile luminance value from the lower view window, and mean luminance of the 40. horizontal band.||DISCOMFORT GLARE||controls; of daylight in the built environment is often preferred to artificial light sources as its successful application can provide visual comfort and satisfaction along with the potential for significant energy savings. Exposure to daylight is also the primary source for stimulus that establishes a healthy day/night cycle in all living organisms. This is known as circadian rhythm. Newly discovered photoreceptors (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells - ipRGC) within the mammalian eye, including humans, are specifically linked to the portion of the brain responsible for maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm. This discovery has led to a new subject area in the field of lighting design focused on controlling the spectrum of light that these photoreceptors are sensitive to. Currently, work in the field of circadian lighting design is concentrated on the use of artificial light sources for circadian stimulus. This is largely due to the advent of the widespread use of LED technology, which has proven that it can be a significant source of light that can delay or advance the circadian clock. The use of daylight to provide circadian stimulus has been a given in this field of design, however, there has not been very much research into how the built environment affects our ability to effectively receive this stimulus from daylight. In this research, the groundwork is established to start to create a set of guidelines to help architects and designers maximize the potential for daylight to provide circadian stimulus at the earliest stages of a project. This is accomplished through a series of lighting simulations that explore and test various architectural parameters that affect daylight-driven circadian lighting, with simultaneous consideration given to photopic lighting availability and visual comfort. The architectural parameters tested in this study included window head height, building orientation, shading devices, visual obstructions to the sky, and room depth. The results show that informed design decisions could maximize circadian potential in a given space, while achieving visually Index (TELUMI), a Tool to Assess Multimodal Transportation Options in Metropolitan Regions||Moudon, Anne Vernez; Sohn, D. W.; Kavage, Article||The Transportation-Efficient Land Use Mapping Index (TELUMI) is a tool to visualize and to quantify micro-level metropolitan land use and development patterns as they affect travel demand. It can assist transportation and urban planning authorities in identifying zones where land use supports multimodal travel and in determining a region's transportation system efficiency. An application of the TELUMI in the Seattle region showed that residential units and employment concentrated in transportation-efficient areas covering less than 20 percent of the region. An interactive, multi-scaled tool, the TELUMI can also support scenario building to simulate land use changes that improve transportation system performance.||URBAN||Geographic Information Systems; GPS on bicyclist route preferences.||Chen, Peng; Shen, Qing; Childress, Suzanne||International Journal of Sustainable Transportation||2018||Journal Article||This study examines the effects of built environment features, including factors of land use and road network, on bicyclists' route preferences using the data from the city of Seattle. The bicycle routes are identified using a GPS dataset collected from a smartphone application named CycleTracks. The route choice set is generated using the labeling route approach, and the cost functions of route alternatives are based on principal component analyses. Then, two mixed logit models, focusing on random parameters and alternative-specific coefficients, respectively, are estimated to examine bicyclists' route choice. The major findings of this study are as follows: (1) the bicycle route choice involves the joint consideration of convenience, safety, and leisure; (2) most bicyclists prefer to cycle on shorter, flat, and well-planned bicycle facilities with slow road traffic; (3) some bicyclists prefer routes surrounded by mixed land use; (4) some bicyclists favor routes which are planted with street trees or installed with street lights; and (5) some bicyclists prefer routes along with city features. This analysis provides valuable insights into how well-planned land use and road network can facilitate efficient, safe, and enjoyable bicycling.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=126917548&site=ehost-live| |Curriculum to Prepare AEC Students for Anne; Dossick, Carrie of Construction Education & Research||2020||Journal Article||Globalization and the increasing adoption of BIM and other technologies in the AEC industry have changed the way we prepare graduates for the digital workplace. This paper presents curriculum design where students from five universities worked together to develop design and construction proposals. This paper describes a collaborative project executed in two parts. Part I included the University of Washington in the USA and IIT-Madras in India. Part II included Washington State University in the USA, and National Taiwan University and National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. Students from these global universities worked on a multi-disciplinary, interdependent project where teams created 3D models and 4D construction simulations. This curriculum addresses ACCE and ABET accreditation requirements regarding multi-disciplinary teams, ethical and professional responsibilities in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts, and effective teamwork. In this paper, we describe the course design, evaluative criteria, and lessons learned. We found that it was important to emphasize BIM Execution Planning for distributed teams given that communication and coordination can be challenging across time zones and cultural differences. Working through technical challenges of exchanging BIM data, the students learned coordination skills in a globally distributed team environment that simulated real work experiences.

Through an in-depth review of the literature and a set of interviews, a framework of challenges is identified and validated, and it served as the basis of a survey among high-ranked design firms active in public projects. This study shows that there are many barriers to reach design excellence, rooted in general policies and standards, characteristics of clients' organizations, and strategies and organizational factors in design firms. Although many design firms and agencies in Iran have certification of accredited QMSs, realities of architectural design practice show that norms in public projects clearly contradict principles of QMSs and make them ineffective. This study reveals a strong need for developing QMSs that address (1) true definition of design quality in standards and guidelines, (2) importance of final users and public community as true customers of public projects, (3) strategies in design firm management and organizational structures, (4) prerequisites of learning cycle in design projects, and (5) modifications in cultures and interactions among parties involved in design decision-making.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=109420820&site=ehost-live| |Metric-based BIM implementation assessment: a review of research and practice.||Abdirad, Hamid||Architectural Engineering and Design Management||2017||Journal Article||Building information modeling (BIM) is one of the most significant developments in the construction industry, as it introduces new technologies, processes, and interactions into practice. Prior research shows that there is an increasing interest among practitioners and academics to assess maturity, productivity, and performance of BIM implementation. This suggests that as BIM adoption grows, the need for BIM implementation assessment arises to facilitate monitoring, measuring, and improving BIM practices. However, so far, no single study has comprehensively reviewed and reported the existing approaches, metrics, and criteria used for assessing BIM practices. This study aims to review and analyze the literature and synthesize existing knowledge relevant to the topic. The author develops a thematic framework of BIM aspects, BIM goals, and performance evaluation trends to define grounds for assessing BIM implementation. Based on the framework, this research analyzed a total number of 97 references (selected out of 322 studies) to identify, extract, and classify metrics/criteria used for assessing BIM implementation. This study has practical implications for developing future BIM maturity models and BIM assessment tools as it synthesizes the existing developments on this topic, highlights gaps and limitations in metric-based BIM assessment, and provides recommendations for further research and developments.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=120392270&site=ehost-live| |Motorcycle taxi programme is associated with reduced risk of road traffic crash among motorcycle taxi drivers in Kampala, Uganda.||Muni, Kennedy; Kobusingye, Journal of Injury Control & Safety Promotion||2019||Journal Article||SafeBoda is a transportation company that provides road safety training and helmets to its motorcycle taxi drivers in Kampala. We sought to determine whether risk of road traffic crash (RTC) was lower in SafeBoda compared to regular (non-SafeBoda) motorcycle taxi drivers during a 6-month follow-up period. We collected participant demographic and behavioural data at baseline using computer-assisted personal interview, and occurrence of RTC every 2 months using text messaging and telephone interview from a cohort of 342 drivers. There were 85 crashes (31 in SafeBoda and 54 in regular drivers) during follow-up. Over the 6-month follow-up period, SafeBoda drivers were 39% less likely to be involved in a RTC than regular drivers after adjusting for age, possession of a driver's license, and education (RR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.97, p = .04).

Traditional grocery stores will not locate in these neighborhoods for market-based reasons. An alternative model appears feasible based on a literature review of current grocery industry practices and their theoretical application on a study neighborhood. The alternative store could be a satellite of a larger chain, stock a select product mix, and combine technology and customer service to provide groceries and community development. This model is promising: each part works profitably under market conditions, and planners are beginning to understand the need to work creatively with industry and communities to bring stores to underserved areas.

In Seattle, as in other U.S. cities, the pace, intensity and scale of redevelopment has caused dramatic spatial and social transformations. Although research has shown that older built fabric provides economic and social benefit for cities, neither regulations created by planners for guiding redevelopment nor strategies created by preservationists for retaining urban heritage have been successful in reconciling these different, yet interconnected, sets of values. We engage three Seattle neighbourhood case studies to clarify and evaluate policies, programs and strategies used by planners and preservationists for reimagining neighbourhood transformations.

The radical nature of the park lies in its adaptive reuse of waste landscapes, not merely ameliorating contaminated land but transforming it to serve the public. Although officials and residents called for the remains of the industrial plant to be removed, Haag convinced the public to retain elements of the industrial apparatus and, more importantly, to retain and treat the polluted soils. Previous scholarship focuses primarily on the architectural elements, leaving the landscape as mere setting. This article proposes a site narrative as read through the landform. It suggests an alternative reading that gives voice to the site's toxic history.||Gas Works OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE||2016||Journal Article||With the growth of urban campuses in the twenty-first century, how can landscape architecture foster the innovation associated with cities and urban neighbourhoods? In Seattle, West Campus at the University of Washington serves as a good urban neighbour while engaging the traditional experiences of a campus. Additionally, the design suggests how an urban campus might generate the culture of an urban innovation district. The contribution of landscapes to innovation districts has rarely been considered in campus design because the focus has been on the architecture of the buildings and the culture of collaboration as social phenomena. This paper explores how the public landscapes of parks, courtyards, and streets shape the experience of an innovation district and contribute to fostering creativity and serendipity.

Based on the premise of previous studies that demonstrate glare as the most important factor for operating shading devices, GlareShade is introduced as a simulation-based shading methodology driven by occupant's visual comfort. GlareShade not only responds to changing outdoor conditions such as the movement of the sun and the variation of cloud cover, but it also accounts for building specific local conditions. GlareShade draws its strength and flexibility from an occupant-centric approach that is based on the visual field of view of each occupant as the occupant is performing common visual tasks in a given environment, and the developed shading system is linked to a distributed sensing network of multiple occupants. ShadeFan is demonstrated as a proof-of-concept dynamic shading maps provide meaningful evaluations for occupants' visual comfort and perception. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for predicting annual luminance maps from a limited number of point-in-time high-dynamic-range imagery by utilizing a deep neural network. A sensitivity analysis is performed to develop guidelines for determining the minimum and optimum data collection periods for generating accurate maps. The proposed model can faithfully predict high-quality annual panoramic luminance maps from one of the three options within 30 min training time: (i) point-in-time luminance imagery spanning 5% of the year, when evenly distributed during daylight hours, (ii) one-month hourly imagery generated during daylight hours around the equinoxes; or (iii) 9 days of hourly data collected around the spring equinox, summer and winter solstices (2.5% of the year) all suffice to predict the luminance maps for the rest of the year.

In discussing the practice of creating and using knowledge in disaster planning, I draw insights from the interdisciplinary critical studies of science and technology literature, which has been developing rich discussions on the challenges we face in producing geographical knowledge.

By means of a numerical model, capable of computing the interaction curves of reinforced concrete cross sections subjected to combined compressive and bending actions, the mechanical performances of plain and fiber-reinforced concrete are compared. As a result, a new index is introduced to quantify the effectiveness of fiber addition. The higher the efficiency index, the higher the amount of steel reinforcing bar that can be removed from a plain concrete cross section. The application to real concrete linings, where shear resistance is ensured without shear reinforcement, shows that a large volume of rebar can be saved by the presence of steel fibers. This gives significant advantages in terms of durability and rapidity of tunnel construction.||Fiber-reinforced concrete; efficiency index; ultimate framework for studying generic behaviors possible in the interaction between a resource-harvesting technological civilization (an exo-civilization) and the planetary environment in which it evolves. Using methods from dynamical systems theory, we introduce and analyze a suite of simple equations modeling a population which consumes resources for the purpose of running a technological civilization and the feedback those resources drive on the state of the host planet. The feedbacks can drive the planet away from the initial state the civilization originated in and into domains that are detrimental to its sustainability. Our models conceptualize the problem primarily in terms of feedbacks from the resource use onto the coupled planetary systems. In addition, we also model the population growth advantages gained via the harvesting of these resources. We present three models of increasing complexity: (1) Civilization-planetary interaction with a single resource; (2) Civilization-planetary interaction with two resources each of which has a different level of planetary system feedback; (3) Civilization-planetary interaction with two resources and nonlinear planetary feedback (i.e., runaways). All three models show distinct classes of exo-civilization trajectories. We find smooth entries into long-term, sustainable steady states. We also find population booms followed by various levels of die-off. Finally, we also observe rapid collapse trajectories for which the population approaches n=0. Our results are part of a program for developing an Astrobiology of the Anthropocene in which questions of sustainability, centered on the coupled Earth-system, can be seen in their proper astronomical/planetary context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for both the coupled Earth system and for the consideration of exo-civilizations across cosmic history.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=129750283&site=ehost-live| |Critique and Contribute: A Practice-Based Framework for Improving science look like if its key critics were engaged to help improve it, and how might critiques of data science improve with an approach that considers the day-to-day practices of data science? This article argues for scholars to bridge the conversations that seek to critique data science and those that seek to advance data science practice to identify and create the social and organizational arrangements necessary for a more ethical data science. We summarize four critiques that are commonly made in critical data studies: data are inherently interpretive, data are inextricable from context, data are mediated through the sociomaterial arrangements that produce them, and data serve as a medium for the negotiation and communication of values. We present qualitative research with academic data scientists, data for good projects, and specialized cross-disciplinary engineering teams to show evidence of these critiques in the day-to-day experience of data scientists as they acknowledge and grapple with the complexities of their work. Using ethnographic vignettes from two large multiresearcher field sites, we develop a set of concepts for analyzing and advancing the practice of data science and improving critical data studies, including (1) communication is central to the data science endeavor; (2) making sense of data is a collective process; (3) data are starting, not end points, and (4) data are sets of stories. We conclude with two calls to action for researchers and practitioners in data science and critical data studies alike. First, creating opportunities for bringing social scientific and humanistic expertise into data science practice simultaneously will advance both data science and critical data studies. Second, practitioners should leverage the insights from critical data studies to build new kinds of organizational arrangements, which we argue will help advance a more ethical data science. Engaging the insights of critical data studies will improve data science. Careful attention to the practices of data science will improve scholarly critiques. Genuine collaborative conversations between these different communities will help push for more ethical, and better, ways of knowing in increasingly datum-saturated societies.||BIG; COMMUNICATION; POLITICS||critical theory| |Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment: A Review of Research for Temporal Variations in Life Cycle Assessment Studies.||Su, Shu; Li, Xiaodong; Zhu, Chen; Lu, Yujie; Lee, Hyun Woo||Environmental Engineering Science||2021||Journal Article||Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a comprehensive and important environmental management tool around the world.

The research progress, approaches, and limitations of three temporal variation types (i.e., dynamic life cycle inventory, dynamic characterization factors, and dynamic weighting factors) in DLCA studies are systematically analyzed and discussed. It is concluded that: (1) dynamic inventory analysis is usually conducted by collecting time-differentiated data at each time step. Field monitoring, simulation, scenario analysis, and prediction based on historical data are common approaches. (2) Dynamic characterization studies primarily focus on two impact categories: global warming and toxicity. More studies are in need. (3) Various methods and indicators (i.e., dynamic pollution damage cost, temporal environmental policy targets, and discount rates) are used to solve the dynamic weighting issue, and they have specific limitations. Finally, three interesting topics are discussed: comparison between dynamic and static results, the large data amount issue, and the trend of tools development. This review offers a holistic view on temporal variations in DLCA studies and provides reference and directions for future dynamic studies.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=153438980&site=ehost-live| |The Relationship Between Objectively Measured Walking and Risk of Pedestrian--Motor Vehicle Collision.||Quistberg, D. Alex; of Epidemiology||2017||Journal Article||Safe urban walking environments may improve health by encouraging physical activity, but the relationship between an individual's location and walking pattern and the risk of pedestrian-motor vehicle collision is unknown. We examined associations between individuals' walking bouts and walking risk, measured as mean exposure to the risk of pedestrian-vehicle collision. Walking bouts were ascertained through integrated accelerometry and global positioning system data and from individual travel-diary data obtained from adults in the Travel Assessment and Community Study (King County, Washington) in 2008-2009. Walking patterns were superimposed onto maps of the historical probabilities of pedestrian-vehicle collisions for intersections and midblock segments within Seattle, Washington. Mean risk of pedestrian-vehicle collision in specific walking locations was assessed according to walking exposure (duration, distance, and intensity) and participant demographic characteristics in linear mixed models. Participants typically walked in areas with low pedestrian collision risk when walking for recreation, walking at a faster pace, or taking longer-duration walks. Mean daily walking duration and distance were not associated with collision risk. Males walked in areas with higher collision risk compared with females, while vehicle owners, residents of single-family homes, and parents of young children walked in areas with lower collision risk. These findings may suggest that pedestrians moderate collision risk by using lower-risk routes.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=122824343&site=ehost-live| |The Complexity ecosystems by altering the interactions and feedbacks between the fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes that maintain life. Humans in cities alter the eco-evolutionary play by simultaneously changing both the actors and the stage on which the eco-evolutionary play takes place. Urbanization modifies land surfaces, microclimates, habitat connectivity, ecological networks, food webs, species diversity, and species composition. These environmental changes can lead to changes in phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of wild populations that have important consequences for ecosystem function and the essential services that nature provides to human society, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, seed dispersal, food production, and water and air purification. Understanding and monitoring urbanization-induced evolutionary changes is important to inform strategies to achieve sustainability. In the present article, we propose that understanding these dynamics requires rigorous characterization of urbanizing regions as rapidly evolving, tightly coupled human-natural systems. We explore how the emergent properties of urbanization affect eco-evolutionary dynamics across space and time. We identify five key urban drivers of change-habitat modification, connectivity, heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and biotic interactions-and highlight the direct consequences of urbanization-driven eco-evolutionary change for nature's contributions to people. Then, we explore five emerging complexities-landscape complexity, urban discontinuities, socio-ecological heterogeneity, cross-scale interactions, legacies and time lags-that need to be tackled in future research. We propose that the evolving metacommunity concept provides a powerful framework to study urban eco-evolutionary dynamics.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/complexity-urban-eco-evolutionary-dynamics/docview/2476153413/se-2?accountid=14784| |Advancing Urban Ecology toward a Science of is a field encompassing multiple disciplines and practical applications and has grown rapidly. However, the field is heterogeneous as a global inquiry with multiple theoretical and conceptual frameworks, variable research approaches, and a lack of coordination among multiple schools of thought and research foci. Here, we present an international consensus on how urban ecology can advance along multiple research directions. There is potential for the field to mature as a holistic, integrated science of urban systems. Such an integrated science could better inform decisionmakers who need increased understanding of complex relationships among social, ecological, economic, and built infrastructure systems. To advance the field requires conceptual synthesis, knowledge and data sharing; cross-city comparative research, new intellectual networks, and engagement with additional disciplines. We consider challenges and opportunities for understanding dynamics of urban systems. We suggest pathways for advancing urban ecology research to support the goals of improving urban sustainability and resilience, conserving urban biodiversity, and promoting human well-being on an urbanizing planet.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=113586366&site=ehost-live| |Planning for the Future of Urban Biodiversity: A Global Review of City-Scale Article||Cities represent considerable opportunities for forwarding global biodiversity and sustainability goals. We developed key attributes for conserving biodiversity and for ecosystem services that should be included in urban-planning documents and reviewed 135 plans from 40 cities globally. The most common attributes in city plans were goals for habitat conservation, air and water quality, cultural ecosystem services, and ecological connectivity. Few plans included quantitative targets. This lack of measurable targets may render plans unsuccessful for an actionable approach to local biodiversity conservation. Although most cities include both biodiversity and ecosystem services, each city tends to focus on one or the other. Comprehensive planning for biodiversity should include the full range of attributes identified, but few cities do this, and the majority that do are mandated by local, regional, or federal governments to plan specifically for biodiversity conservation. This research provides planning recommendations for protecting urban biodiversity based on ecological knowledge.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=122396993&site=ehost-live| |Cohort Profile: TWINS study of environment, lifestyle Article||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=138130716&site=ehost-live| |The Residential Effect Fallacy in Neighborhood and Health Studies Formal Definition, Empirical Identification, and the urban/rural and socioeconomic organizations of territories and resulting correlation between residential and nonresidential exposures, classically estimated residential neighborhood-outcome associations capture nonresidential environment effects, overestimating residential intervention effects. Our study diagnosed and corrected this residential effect fallacy bias applicable to a large fraction of neighborhood and health studies. Methods: Our empirical application investigated the effect that hypothetical interventions raising the residential number of services would have on the probability that a trip is walked. Using global positioning systems tracking and mobility surveys over 7 days (227 participants and 7440 trips), we employed a multilevel linear probability model to estimate the trip-level association between residential number of services and walking to derive a naive intervention effect estimate and a corrected model accounting for numbers of services at the residence, trip origin, and trip destination to determine a corrected intervention effect estimate (true effect conditional on assumptions). Results: There was a strong correlation in service densities between the residential neighborhood and nonresidential places. From the naive model, hypothetical interventions raising the residential number of services to 200, 500, and 1000 were associated with an increase by 0.020, 0.055, and 0.109 of the probability of walking in the intervention groups. Corrected estimates were of 0.007, 0.019, and 0.039. Thus, naive estimates were overestimated by multiplicative factors of 3.0, 2.9, and 2.8. Conclusions: Commonly estimated residential intervention-outcome associations substantially overestimate true effects. Our somewhat paradoxical conclusion is that to estimate residential effects, investigators critically need information on nonresidential places visited.||SELF-RATED HEALTH; RECORD COHORT; Devices: Accelerometry and explore the usefulness of combining accelerometry, global positioning systems, and geographic information systems, to describe the time spent in different locations and physical activity (PA) duration/count levels by location for 4 children with cerebral palsy (CP) who use assistive devices (AD). Methods: A descriptive multiple-case study. Results: Combining the 3 instruments was useful in describing and differentiating duration by location, and amount and location of PA across differing functional levels and AD. For example, the child classified with a Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level II exhibited large amounts of PA in community settings. In contrast, the child classified with a GMFCS level V had small amounts of PA and spent most measured time at home.

Series B, Biological Sciences||2017||Journal Article||Emerging evidence that cities drive micro-evolution raises the question of whether rapid urbanization of Earth might impact ecosystems by causing systemic changes in functional traits that regulate urban ecosystems' productivity and stability. Intraspecific trait variation-variation in organisms' morphological, from genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity-has significant implications for ecological functions such as nutrient cycling and primary productivity. While it is well established that changes in ecological conditions can drive evolutionary change in species' traits that, in turn, can alter ecosystem function, an understanding of the reciprocal and simultaneous processes associated with such interactions is only beginning to emerge. In urban settings, the potential for rapid trait change may be exacerbated by multiple selection pressures operating simultaneously. This paper reviews evidence on mechanisms linking urban development patterns to rapid phenotypic changes, and differentiates phenotypic changes for which there is evidence of micro-evolution versus phenotypic changes which may represent plasticity. Studying how humans mediate phenotypic trait changes through urbanization could shed light on fundamental concepts in ecological and evolutionary theory. It can also contribute to our understanding of eco-evolutionary feedback and provide insights for maintaining ecosystem function over the long term.

Design/methodology/approach - The research design is based on a two-phase approach. First, the existing literature was studied through a multiple-step content analysis (CA) approach, which combined unsupervised concept mapping with computer aided CA. Using a relational CA approach, statistical-based analysis tools were initially used to identify the relationships between actors and barriers. Later, a Delphi study was administered to a panel of experts, to triangulate, validate, and refine the initial results. Findings - The study revealed that organizational culture is the most relevant barrier, and that clients and professionals are the actors that predominantly influence the adoption of LCC and LCA in projects. Technical and financial barriers, such as the lack and quality of input data and the high costs of implementation are also deemed relevant. Research limitations/implications - The CA was performed by a single rater on a sample that included 50 papers in English language. Future research may focus on enlarging the sample, extending it to other languages, and linking the source (or the expert) to their professional context to evaluate geographical differences in barriers. Originality/value - The adopted approach gives new insights on the relationships behind the rejection of LCA and LCC suggesting that solutions at the organizational level may be more effective than technical ones.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/actors-barriers-adoption-lcc-lca-techniques-built/docview/2081641230/se-2?accountid=14784| |Physiological cost of concrete construction activities||Lee, Wonil; Migliaccio, Giovanni Ciro||Construction Innovation||2016||Journal Article||Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to investigate the physiological cost of concrete construction activities. Design/methodology/approach - Five concrete construction workers were recruited. The workers' three-week heart rate (HR) data were collected in summer and autumn. In this paper, several HR indexes were used to investigate the physiological cost of work in concrete construction trades, including average working HR, relative HR and ratio of working HR to resting HR. Findings - This paper measures how absolute and relative HRs vary throughout a workday and how working HR compares to resting HR for individual workers. Research limitations/implications - Field observations are usually extremely difficult as researchers need to overcome a number of barriers, including employers' resistance to perceived additional liabilities, employees' fear that their level of activity will be reported to managers and many other practical and technical difficulties. As these challenges increase exponentially with the number of employers, subjects and sites, this study was limited to a small number of subjects all working for the same employer on the same jobsite. Still, challenges are often unpredictable and lessons learned from this study are expected to guide both our and other researchers' continuation of this work. Originality/value - The time effect on the physiological cost of work has not been considered in previous studies. Thus, this study is noteworthy owing to the depth of the data collected rather than the breadth of the data.| |Restructuration of architectural practice in integrated project delivery (IPD): two case studies||Abdirad, Hamid; Dossick, Carrie S.||Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management||2019||Journal Article||Purpose The purpose of this paper is to clarify that while integrated project delivery (IPD) methods can be momenta for restructuring architectural practice, they do not predetermine specific patterns of restructuration for the roles, responsibilities and services of architects. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a multiple case study design; two IPD projects were theoretically sampled and studied. The data collection methods included semi-structured interviews and observations. An inductive data analysis approach was applied to frame the phenomena, conduct cross-case comparisons and develop propositions. Findings While IPD implementations set expectations for new structures for practices, it is the project participants' situated decisions that lead to the restructuration of some dimensions of architectural practice. The dimensions in this study included team formation, design leadership and collaboration and architectural services. IPD project participants locally changed and redefined conventional roles, responsibilities and project artifacts (e.g. drawings and models) that concerned design development and coordination. Practical implications - IPD context, by itself, does not predetermine a fixed pattern of change in establishing designers' roles, responsibilities and services because restructuration is highly negotiated amongst the IPD parties and can lead to different responses to this contractual setting. Contracts set expectations for collaborative behavior, but the fulfillment of these expectations is situated and emerging as project participants negotiate to develop practices. Originality/value - While IPD research and guidelines aim to provide recipes for IPD implementation, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by clarifying that IPD is a context in which unprecedented ways of practice restructuration could emerge.||CM| |Normative and descriptive models Dossick, Carrie S.||Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management||2019||Journal Article||Purpose The purpose of this paper is to inquire into the reasons why Construction Operation Building Information Exchange (COBie) has not become mainstream across the construction industry despite the significant attempts to promote it. Design/methodology/approach This paper framed and compared the normative model of COBie to a descriptive model of COBie. The normative model was based on the assumptions and planned procedures outlined in the COBie documentation. The descriptive model was developed through a case study of COBie implementation, with ethnographic observations, interviews and artifact analysis as the data collection methods and thematic analysis as the data analysis method. Findings The comparative analysis of the normative and descriptive models showed that the underlying normative assumptions of COBie can be challenged in its implementation. In the case study, implementing COBie disrupted the conventional practice of few participating firms as the data requirements and the expected sequences and timelines of tasks were not aligned with the industry norms for exchanging data. Furthermore, the normative model of COBie could not account for the unanticipated variability in the internal routines of firms for submittal production. Practical implications - COBie, as an instruction-based model, may not provide enough flexibility for some firms to adapt to its requirements such that COBie tasks become integrated with their existing workflows. COBie tasks may become additional efforts, and at times, conflict with the industry norms and firms' routines, and therefore, disrupt the efficiency goals. Originality/value This paper provides empirical evidence to clarify why implementing COBie has not been as efficient for all industry players as expected.||CM| |The influence of urban design packages on home values||Bitter, Christopher;Krause, Andy||International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis||2017||Journal Article||Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of neighborhood design templates on residential home values in King County, WA, USA. Previous research examines a number of individual design factors; this study combines these factors into typologies and tests for the impacts of the composite set of design features. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes over 27,000 home sales with a hedonic price model to measure the impacts across three large, regional submarkets. Neighborhood design categories are developed using a cluster analysis on a set of individual neighborhood attributes. Findings The key finding from this research is that the impact of more traditional (\"urban\") design packages on home values is highly contextual. For the older and denser neighborhoods in the study area, a more traditional design results in a significantly positive impact on home values. In the new and more suburban regions of the study area, this effect is not found. Originality/value Prior work focused on valuing design attributes individually. The study argues that neighborhood design is better conceived of as a \"package\", as the value of a given design element may depend on other co-located attributes. This is the first study, to the authors' knowledge, to treat physical neighborhood design variables as a composite whole and to attempt to value their impact on home values as such.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/influence-urban-design-packages-on-home-values/docview/1901306012/se-2?accountid=14784||Regional development , Packages , Cluster analysis , Suburban areas Residential areas , Housing , Design , Connectivity , Property values , Urban planning , Emission standards , Neighborhoods , Urban areas , Influence , Household utilities , Design factors , Regional analysis , Housing prices , Land use , Tax assessments , Julie||International Journal of Prisoner Health||2018||Journal Article||Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the impact of a short-term nature-based intervention on the social-emotional well-being of women incarcerated on a mental health unit in a state prison.

This is with the objective of securing liquidity while not unduly compromising the risk-return characteristics of the underlying asset class. This paper considers the best mix of liquid assets at different thresholds for a liquid asset allocation, with the performance then evaluated against that of a direct real estate benchmark index. Design/methodology/approach The authors employ a mean-tracking error optimisation approach in determining the optimal combination of liquid assets that can be added to a real estate fund portfolio. The returns of the optimised portfolios are compared to the returns for portfolios that employ the use of either cash or listed real estate alone as a liquidity buffer. Multivariate generalised autoregressive models are used along with rolling correlations and tracking errors to gauge the effectiveness of the various portfolios in tracking the performance of the benchmark index. Findings The results indicate that applying formal optimisation techniques leads to a considerable improvement in the ability of the returns from blended real estate portfolios to track the underlying real estate market. This is the case at a number of different thresholds for the liquid asset allocation and in cases where a minimum return requirement is imposed.||HEDGE-FUND-REPLICATION; Defined contribution pensions| |A taxonomy for Building Assessment X.; Simonen, Kathrina; Huang, Monica; De Wolf, Catherine||SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT||2019||Journal Article||Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of common parameters in existing tools that provide guidance to carry out Whole Building Life Cycle Assessment (WBLCA) and proposes a new taxonomy, a catalogue of parameters, for the definition of the goal and scope (G&S) in WBLCA. Design/methodology/approach A content analysis approach is used to identify, code and analyze parameters in existing WBLCA tools. Finally, a catalogue of parameters is organized into a new taxonomy. Findings In total, 650 distinct parameter names related to the definition of G&S from 16 WBLCAs tools available in North America, Europe and Australia are identified. Building on the analysis of existing taxonomies, a new taxonomy of 54 parameters is proposed in order to describe the G&S of WBLCA. Research limitations/implications The analysis of parameters in WBLCA tools does not include Green Building Rating Systems and is only limited to tools available in English. Practical implications This research is crucial in life cycle assessment (LCA) method harmonization and to serve as a stepping stone to the identification and categorization of parameters that could contribute to WBLCA comparison necessary to meet current global carbon goals. Social implications The proposed taxonomy enables architecture, engineering and construction practitioners to contribute to current WBLCA practice. Originality/value A study of common parameters in existing tools contributes to identifying the type of data that is required to describe buildings and contribute to build a standardized framework for LCA reporting, which would facilitate consistency across future studies and can serve as a checklist for practitioners when conducting the G&S stage of WBLCA.||Content analysis; Taxonomy; LCA; LCA cycle assessment| |Cluster-Based LSTM Network for Short-Term Passenger Flow Forecasting Transit||Zhang, Jinlei; Chen, Feng; Shen, Qing||IEEE ACCESS||2019||Journal Article||Short-term passenger flow forecasting is an essential component for the operation of urban rail transit (URT). Therefore, it is necessary to obtain a higher prediction precision with the development of URT. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly prevalent, many prediction methods including the long short-term memory network (LSTM) in the deep learning field have been applied in road transportation systems, which can give critical insights for URT. First, we propose a novel two-step K-Means clustering model to capture not only the passenger flow variation trends but also the ridership volume characteristics. Then, a predictability assessment model is developed to recommend a reasonable time granularity interval to aggregate passenger flows. Based on the clustering results and the recommended time granularity interval, the LSTM model, which is called CB-LSTM model, is proposed to conduct short-term passenger flow forecasting. Results show that the prediction based on subway station clusters can not only avoid the complication of developing numerous models for each of the hundreds of stations, but also improve the prediction performance, which make it possible to predict short-term passenger flow on a network scale using limited dataset. The results provide critical insights for subway operators and transportation policymakers.||TRAFFIC Waddell, Paul A.||COMPUTER||2006||Journal Article||he authors present a snapshot of ongoing research into the design of user interactions based on the results from UrbanSim, a large-scale urban simulation system.

Grounded in an ontology of immanence, as presented in Deleuze and Guattari's (9) political philosophy, I argue that attention must be paid to the production and transformation of normativity. Using the redevelopment of the South Lake Union (SLU) neighbourhood of Seattle - (in)famously home to Amazon, but largely envisioned and developed by Paul Allen's investment and philanthropic organisation, Vulcan - as an analytical starting point, this paper sketches out a profile of the blue dimension of the genesis of Seattle's environmental ethic, from early efforts to reshape the region's hydrology and address water pollution in Lake Washington, through efforts by governmental bodies and Vulcan to protect water quality and salmon habitat, and on to a large-scale infrastructure project - the Elliott Bay Seawall replacement - that includes features to enhance biodiversity and ecological functioning in the nearshore environment. In tracking these movements, I identify the emergence of an explicitly post-anthropocentric ethic from what initially appears as an aesthetic concern, while also highlighting the ongoing complexification of an earlier engineering ethic that dates back to the earliest attempts by settlers to manage the natural environment.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=143356854&site=ehost-live| |Building a construction procurement negotiation training game model: Learning experiences and outcomes.||Dzeng, Ren-Jye; Lin, Ken-Yu; Wang, Pei-Ru||British Journal of Educational Technology||2014||Journal Article||Game-based education is a promising method for encouraging student learning. Although learning construction procurement and negotiation require hands-on practice, in most construction management courses at the college level, this subject is taught by using lectures and case studies. In this study, a construction procurement and negotiation game was developed, and paper-based and web-based versions were implemented. The game enables students to play the role of contractors or suppliers and generate profits by negotiating and procuring or selling reinforcing steel in a simulated market with a probabilistic nature. The experimental results indicate that playing both versions of the game increased student learning motivation, satisfaction and outcomes. Students awarded the web-based game higher assessment scores than they did for the paper-based game. Students playing either version of the game also achieved higher test scores than students who were taught using the traditional approach did. However, for students with work experience, playing the paper-based game resulted in higher scores than the web-based game scores.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=98980300&site=ehost-live| |Correlates of bird collisions with buildings across three North American countries||Elmore, Jared A.; Hager, Stephen B.; Cosentino, Bradley J.; Claire W.; with buildings cause up to 1 billion bird fatalities annually in the United States and Canada. However, efforts to reduce collisions would benefit from studies conducted at large spatial scales across multiple study sites with standardized methods and consideration of species- and life-history-related variation and correlates of collisions. We addressed these research needs through coordinated collection of data on bird collisions with buildings at sites in the United States (35), Canada (3), and Mexico (2). We collected all carcasses and identified species. After removing records for unidentified carcasses, species lacking distribution-wide population estimates, and species with distributions overlapping fewer than 10 sites, we retained 269 carcasses of 64 species for analysis. We estimated collision vulnerability for 40 bird species with >= 2 fatalities based on their North American population abundance, distribution overlap in study sites, and sampling effort. Of 10 species we identified as most vulnerable to collisions, some have been identified previously (e.g., Black-throated Blue Warbler [Setophaga caerulescens]), whereas others emerged for the first time (e.g., White-breasted Nuthatch [Sitta carolinensis]), possibly because we used a more standardized sampling approach than past studies. Building size and glass area were positively associated with number of collisions for 5 of 8 species with enough observations to analyze independently. Vegetation around buildings influenced collisions for only 1 of those 8 species (Swainson's Thrush [Catharus ustulatus]). Life history predicted collisions; numbers of collisions were greatest for migratory, insectivorous, and woodland-inhabiting species. Our results provide new insight into the species most vulnerable to building collisions, making them potentially in greatest need of conservation attention to reduce collisions and into species- and life-history-related variation and correlates of building collisions, information that can help refine collision management.||MORTALITY||anthropogenic threats; vulnerability| |Maximising the net social benefit of the construction of post-disaster alternative housing projects.||El-Anwar, Omar||Disasters||2013||Journal Article||The widespread destruction that follows large-scale natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, challenges the efficacy of traditional temporary housing methods in providing adequate solutions to housing needs. Recognising these housing challenges, the Congress of the United States allocated, in 2006, USD 400 million to the Department of Homeland Security to support Alternative Housing Pilot Programs, which are intended to explore the possibilities of providing permanent and affordable housing to displaced families instead of traditional temporary housing. This paper presents a new methodology and optimisation model to identify the optimal configurations of post-shelter housing arrangements to maximise the overall net socioeconomic benefit. The model is capable of quantifying and optimising the impacts of substituting temporary housing with alternative housing on the social and economic welfare of displaced families as well as the required additional costs of doing so. An application example is presented to illustrate the use of the model and its capabilities.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=88105865&site=ehost-live| |Immediate behavioural responses to earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand, and Hitachi, Japan.||Lindell, Michael K.; Prater, Carla S.; Wu, Hao Che; S.; Shiroshita, Hideyuki||Disasters||2016||Journal Article||This study examines people's immediate responses to earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand, and Hitachi, Japan. Data collected from 257 respondents in Christchurch and 332 respondents in Hitachi revealed notable similarities between the two cities in people's emotional reactions, risk perceptions, and immediate protective actions during the events. Respondents' physical, household, and social contexts were quite similar, but Hitachi residents reported somewhat higher levels of emotional reaction and risk perception than did Christchurch residents. Contrary to the recommendations of emergency officials, the most frequent response of residents in both cities was to freeze. Christchurch residents were more likely than Hitachi residents to drop to the ground and take cover, whereas Hitachi residents were more likely than Christchurch residents to evacuate immediately the building in which they were situated. There were relatively small correlations between immediate behavioural responses and demographic characteristics, earthquake experience, and physical, social, or household context.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=112059931&site=ehost-live| |A roadmap for urban evolutionary J.||Evolutionary Applications||2019||Journal Article||Urban ecosystems are rapidly expanding throughout the world, but how urban growth affects the evolutionary ecology of species living in urban areas remains largely unknown. Urban ecology has advanced our understanding of how the development of cities and towns change environmental conditions and alter ecological processes and patterns. However, despite decades of research in urban ecology, the extent to which urbanization influences evolutionary and eco-evolutionary change has received little attention. The nascent field of urban evolutionary ecology seeks to understand how urbanization affects the evolution of populations, and how those evolutionary changes in turn influence the ecological dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Following a brief history of this emerging field, this Perspective article provides a research agenda and roadmap for future research aimed at advancing our understanding of the interplay between ecology and evolution of urban-dwelling organisms. We identify six key questions that, if addressed, would significantly increase our understanding of how urbanization influences evolutionary processes. These questions consider how urbanization affects nonadaptive evolution, natural selection, and convergent evolution, in addition to the role of urban environmental heterogeneity on species evolution, and the roles of phenotypic plasticity versus adaptation on species' abundance in cities. Our final question examines the impact of urbanization on evolutionary diversification. For each of these six questions, we suggest avenues for future research that will help advance the field of urban evolutionary ecology. Lastly, we highlight the importance of integrating urban evolutionary ecology into urban planning, conservation practice, pest management, and public engagement.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=134850250&site=ehost-live| |Socio\u00c4\u00eaeco\u00c4\u00eaevolutionary dynamics complex systems regulated by interactions and feedbacks between nature and human society. Characteristics of human society-including culture, economics, technology and politics-underlie social patterns and activity, creating a heterogeneous environment that can influence and be influenced by both ecological and evolutionary processes. Increasing research on urban ecology and evolutionary biology has coincided with growing interest in eco-evolutionary dynamics, which encompasses the interactions and reciprocal feedbacks between evolution and ecology. Research on both urban evolutionary biology and eco-evolutionary dynamics frequently focuses on contemporary evolution of species that have potentially substantial ecological-and even social-significance. Still, little work fully integrates urban evolutionary biology and eco-evolutionary dynamics, and rarely do researchers in either of these fields fully consider the role of human social patterns and processes. Because cities are fundamentally regulated by human activities, are inherently interconnected and are frequently undergoing social and economic transformation, they represent an opportunity for ecologists and evolutionary biologists to study urban socio-eco-evolutionary dynamics. Through this new framework, we encourage researchers of urban ecology and evolution to fully integrate human social drivers and feedbacks to increase understanding and conservation of ecosystems, their functions and their contributions to people within and outside cities.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=148229618&site=ehost-live| |Climate-driven habitat change causes evolution in Article||Climate change can shape evolution directly by altering abiotic conditions or indirectly by modifying habitats, yet few studies have investigated the effects of climate-driven habitat change on contemporary evolution. We resampled populations of Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) along a latitudinal gradient in California bar-built estuaries to examine their evolution in response to changing climate and habitat. We took advantage of the strong association between stickleback lateral plate phenotypes and Ectodysplasin A (Eda) genotypes to infer changes in allele frequencies over time. Our results show that over time the frequency of low-plated alleles has generally increased and heterozygosity has decreased. Latitudinal patterns in stickleback plate phenotypes suggest that evolution at Eda is a response to climate-driven habitat transformation rather than a direct consequence of climate. As climate change has reduced precipitation and increased temperature and drought, bar-built estuaries have transitioned from The allele has achieved fixation at the driest, hottest southernmost sites, a trend that is progressing northward with climate change. Climate-driven habitat change is therefore causing a reduction in genetic variation that may hinder future adaptation for populations facing across a gradient of urbanization: a study of the Seattle, WA region.||Hutyra, Lucy R.; Yoon, Byungman; Alberti, Marina||Global Change Biology||2011||Journal Article||Most of our global population and its CO2 emissions can be attributed to urban areas. The process of urbanization changes terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes, which, in turn, impact ecosystem functions and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Using the Seattle, WA, region as a case study, this paper explores the relationships between aboveground carbon stocks and land cover within an urbanizing area. The major objectives were to estimate aboveground live and dead terrestrial carbon stocks across multiple land cover classes and quantify the relationships between urban cover and vegetation across a gradient of urbanization. We established 154 sample plots in the Seattle region to assess carbon stocks as a function of distance from the urban core and land cover [urban (heavy, medium, and low), mixed forest, and conifer forest land covers]. The mean (and 95% CI) aboveground live biomass for the region was 89 +/- 22 Mg C ha-1 with an additional 11.8 +/- 4 Mg C ha-1 of coarse woody debris biomass. The average live biomass stored within forested and urban land covers was 140 +/- 40 and 18 +/- 14 Mg C ha-1, respectively, with a 57% mean vegetated canopy cover regionally. Both the total carbon stocks and mean vegetated canopy cover were surprisingly high, even within the heavily urbanized areas, well exceeding observations within other urbanizing areas and the average US forested carbon stocks. As urban land covers and populations continue to rapidly increase across the globe, these results highlight the importance of considering vegetation in urbanizing areas within the terrestrial carbon cycle.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=56943002&site=ehost-live| |Minimization of socioeconomic disruption for El-Rayes, Khaled; Elnashai, Amr||Disasters||2010||Journal Article||In the aftermath of catastrophic natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes, emergency management agencies come under intense pressure to provide temporary housing to address the large-scale displacement of the vulnerable population. Temporary housing is essential to enable displaced families to reestablish their normal daily activities until permanent housing solutions can be provided. Temporary housing decisions, however, have often been criticized for their failure to fulfil the socioeconomic needs of the displaced families within acceptable budgets. This paper presents the development of (1) socioeconomic disruption metrics that are capable of quantifying the socioeconomic impacts of temporary housing decisions on displaced populations; and (2) a robust multi-objective optimization model for temporary housing that is capable of simultaneously minimizing socioeconomic disruptions and public expenditures in an effective and efficient manner. A large-scale application example is optimized to illustrate the use of the model and demonstrate its capabilities ingenerating optimal plans for realistic temporary housing problems.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=51305311&site=ehost-live| |Skilled, cheap, and desperate: Non-tenure-track faculty and the delusion of meritocracy||Purcell, Mark||ANTIPODE||2007||Journal Article||Over the past 25 or so years, geographers have produced sophisticated critical tools to examine systems like patriarchy, racism, and heteronormativity. However, they have not used those critical tools to examine the problem of institutional hierarchy in the academy. There are many kinds of institutional hierarchy, but the paper focuses on one particular structure: the difference between tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty. I call for much greater critical reflection on the existence and experience of non-tenure-track faculty in geography. I argue that it is essential to undermine the structures and assumed wisdom of the hierarchy, for the sake of non-tenure-track faculty, the discipline, and the academy as a whole. Destabilizing the structures requires multiple strategies. I argue that one key strategy is for non-tenure-track faculty to tell their stories, to offer their critical perspective from the lower rungs of the hierarchy. The last part of the paper is an autobiographical account designed to give a better idea of how one such story might look.||GEOGRAPHY; WHITENESS; REFLECTIONS; JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH||2007||Journal Article||This paper argues that research on city-regions could benefit from more sustained and critical attention to the question of democracy. That is, it should examine more closely how decisions in city-regions are made, why they are made that way, and how they can be made more democratically. Much current research on politics in cities has framed the issue in terms of citizenship. That work has produced great insight. However, the attention to citizenship has prompted very little attention to democracy, even though the two concepts are deeply intertwined. Current interest in city-regions opens up the possibility that a vibrant line of research on democracy can be added to and engage with that on citizenship.||COMMUNICATIVE PLANNING-THEORY; POLITICS; GOVERNANCE; Mumbai, India||Chalana, Manish||JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION||2010||Journal Article||Mumbai and other Indian cities are rapidly transforming to address the needs of global commerce and the expanding middle class. Mumbai's vernacular environments, home to most working-class residents, are consequently being redeveloped using supermodern global aesthetics. The urbanism emerging from the current wave of modernism is an unprecedented radical departure from existing patterns of place. Proponents claim the new developments serve low-income residents' interests, when actually they ignore fundamental socio-cultural and economic realities. This paper considers two case studies, Dharavi and Girangaon, highlighting a subset of Mumbai's vernacular environments to argue for their significance and to explore alternative redevelopment approaches.| |Modeling Micro-Spatial Employment Location Patterns: A location patterns in the Puget Sound Region of Washington State at a micro level of geography. Traditional discrete choice modeling using multinomial logit (MNL) models may be problematic at a micro level of geography due to the high dimensionality of the set of alternative locations and the likely violations of the independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption. Count models are free from the IIA assumption and, unlike logit models, actually benefit from large numbers of alternatives by adding degrees of freedom. This study identifies the best-fitting count model as the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model, because this model more effectively addresses the large number of cells with no jobs and reflects a dual process that facilitates the identification of threshold clustering effects such as those found in specialized employment centers. The estimation and prediction results of ZINB are compared with those of MNL with a random sampling of alternatives estimated on an equivalent data set. The ZINB and MNL models largely agree on major trends, with the ZINB model providing more insightful details, but with less capacity to predict large count situations.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=31290735&site=ehost-live| |BRIGHT DAWN SIMULATION COMPARED WITH BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT IN THE TREATMENT OF WINTER DEPRESSION||AVERY, cross-over design, 7 patients with winter depression were treated with a week of a bright (1700 lx) dawn simulation (0400 to 0600) and a week of standard bright (1700 lx) morning (0600 to 0800) light therapy. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores decreased significantly for the standard light therapy (18.9 to 6.6) but not for the bright dawn therapy (18.0 to 11.3). Early morning awakening was a frequent side effect with the bright dawn simulation. Although dawn simulation at a lower illuminance may be an effective treatment, the bright dawn used in this study showed only a nonsignificant trend to lower depression ratings.

Because of its core commitment to the discredited positivist tradition it holds both a false concept of scientific knowledge and misunderstandings concerning clinical decision-making. Strong EBM continues attempts to use flawed adjustments to recover from the unsalvageable base view. Paper three argues that a promising solution is at hand if we can manage several modes of inclusion. A modified original, moderate version of EBM continues though usually overshadowed. As definitively laid out by Sackett in the 1990s, clinical decision making is intended to be person-centered, recognizing and integrating multiple modes of evidence and knowledge that have been marginalized: professional experience, illness narratives, and individual patients' values and preferences. Complementary resources are at hand: interpretative understanding and practice, such as philosophical anthropology, hermeneutical phenomenology, complexity theory, and phronetic practices respond to the major problems and open new possibilities. Phronesis is especially important in regard to public decision making. Within part 3 an additional tone necessarily occurs. While most of papers 1, 2, and 3 are written in the classical mode of contrasting the theoretical-logical and empirical evidence offered by contending positions bearing on the decision making and judgement in clinical practice, a shift occurs when considerations move beyond what is possible for clinical practitioners to accomplish. A different, discontinuous level of power operates in the trans-personal realm of instrumental policy, insurance, and hospital management practices. In this social-economic-political-ethical realm what happens in clinical practice today increasingly becomes a matter of what is done unto clinical practitioners, of what hampers their professional action and thus care of individual patients and clients.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=150515665&site=ehost-live| |Professional judgement in clinical practice (part 1): Recovering original, moderate evidence\u00c4\u00eabased health care.||Mugerauer, Robert||Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice||2021||Journal Article||Evidence-based medicine announced its entry as heralding a new paradigm in health care practices, but it has been widely criticized for lacking a coherent theoretical basis. This paper presents the first part of a three-article series examining the epistemological, practical, and ethical dimensions of strong EBM, as well as considering alternatives that promise potential solutions to chronic conceptual and practical problems. While the focus is on the details of the arguments and evidence in thoughtful debates over the last 30 years, it is worthwhile to keep in mind the overall trajectory of modern thought, because strong EBM continues discredited positivist positions, thus repeating its major assumptions and inadequacies, now transferred to the medical sphere and vocabulary. Part 1 of the series examines the development of strong EBM by clarifying and critiquing its somewhat discontinuous accounts of scientific knowledge and epistemology, evidence, the differences between statistical probability in regard to populations and understanding the health of individuals, and its claims for direct transfer of research findings to clinical settings-all of which raises more questions regarding its application to provider-patient decision making, pedagogy, and policy.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=150515666&site=ehost-live| |Professional judgement in clinical practice (part 2): knowledge into practice.||Mugerauer, Robert||Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice||2021||Journal Article||Rationale, Aims, and Objectives Though strong evidence-based medicine is assertive in its claims, an insufficient theoretical basis and patchwork of arguments provide a good case that rather than introducing a new paradigm, EBM is resisting a shift to actually revolutionary complexity theory and other emergent approaches. This refusal to pass beyond discredited positivism is manifest in strong EBM's unsuccessful attempts to continually modify its already inadequate previous modifications, as did the defenders of the Ptolemaic astronomical model who increased the number of circular epicycles until the entire epicycle-deferent system proved untenable. Methods Narrative Review. Results The analysis in Part 1 of this three part series showed epistemological confusion as strong EBM plays the discredited positivistic tradition out to the end, thus repeating in a medical sphere and vocabulary the major assumptions and inadequacies that have appeared in the trajectory of modern science. Paper 2 in this series examines application, attending to strong EBM's claim of direct transferability of EBM research findings to clinical settings and its assertion of epistemological normativity. EBM's contention that it provides the only valid approach to knowledge and action is questioned by analyzing the troubled story of proposed hierarchies of the quality of research findings (especially of RCTs, with other factors marginalized), which falsely identifies evaluating findings with operationally utilizing them in clinical recommendations and decision-making. Further, its claim of carrying over its normative guidelines to cover the ethical responsibilities of researchers and clinicians is questioned.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=150515667&site=ehost-live| |The spatial clustering of obesity: does the V.; Human Nutrition & Dietetics||2015||Journal Article||BackgroundObesity rates in the USA show distinct geographical patterns. The present study used spatial cluster detection methods and individual-level data to locate obesity clusters and to analyse them in relation to the neighbourhood built environment. MethodsThe 2008-2009 Seattle Obesity Study provided data on the self-reported height, weight, and sociodemographic characteristics of 1602 King County adults. Home addresses were geocoded. Clusters of high or low body mass index were identified using Anselin's Local Moran's I and a spatial scan statistic with regression models that searched for unmeasured neighbourhood-level factors from residuals, adjusting for measured individual-level covariates. Spatially continuous values of objectively measured features of the local neighbourhood built environment (SmartMaps) were constructed for seven variables obtained from tax rolls and commercial databases. ResultsBoth the Local Moran's I and a spatial scan statistic identified similar spatial concentrations of obesity. High and low obesity clusters were attenuated after adjusting for age, gender, race, education and income, and they disappeared once neighbourhood residential property values and residential density were included in the model. ConclusionsUsing individual-level data to detect obesity clusters with two cluster detection methods, the present study showed that the spatial concentration of obesity was wholly explained by neighbourhood composition and socioeconomic characteristics. These characteristics may serve to more precisely locate obesity prevention and intervention programmes.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=110727370&site=ehost-live| Education-Focused Health Impact School Health||2017||Journal Article||BACKGROUNDHealth impact assessment (HIA) provides a structured process for examining the potential health impacts of proposed policies, plans, programs, and projects. This study systematically reviewed HIAs conducted in the United States on prekindergarten, primary, and secondary education-focused decisions. METHODSRelevant HIA reports were identified from web sources in late 2015. Key data elements were abstracted from each report. Four case studies were selected to highlight diversity of topics, methods, and impacts of the assessment process. RESULTSTwenty HIAs completed in 2003-2015 from 8 states on issues related to prekindergarten through secondary education were identified. The types of decisions examined included school structure and funding, transportation to and from school, physical modifications to school facilities, in-school physical activity and nutrition, and school discipline and climate. Assessments employed a range of methods to characterize the nature, magnitude, and severity of potential health impacts. Assessments fostered stakeholder engagement and provided health-promoting recommendations, some of which were subsequently incorporated into school policies. CONCLUSIONSHealth impact assessment is a promising tool that education, health, and other stakeholders can use to maximize the health and well-being of students, families, and communities.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=126016541&site=ehost-live| |POSSIBLE WORLDS: HENRI LEFEBVRE AND THE RIGHT TO THE CITY||Purcell, Mark||JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS||2014||Journal Article||There has been much attention paid recently the idea of the right to the city. This article argues that in order to fully appreciate the power of the idea, we should understand it through a close reading of Henri Lefebvre's body of work on the city and politics. Lefebvre presents a radical vision for a city in which users manage urban space for themselves, beyond the control of both the state and capitalism. However, while it calls for profound change, Lefebvre's vision is also eminently practical; it can very much serve as a guide and inspiration for concrete action to change the city today.| |Ecosystem size shapes antipredator P.||OIKOS||2020||Journal Article||Ecosystem size is known to influence both community structure and ecosystem processes. Less is known about the evolutionary consequences of ecosystem size. A few studies have shown that ecosystem size shapes the evolution of trophic diversity by shaping habitat heterogeneity, but the effects of ecosystem size on antipredator trait evolution have not been explored. Ecosystem size may impact antipredator trait evolution by shaping predator presence (larger ecosystems have longer food chains) and habitat complexity (larger ecosystems may have more diverse habitat structure). We tested these effects using threespine stickleback from bar-built estuaries along the Central Coast of California. These stickleback populations are polymorphic forEctodysplasin-A(Eda), a gene that controls bony lateral plates used as antipredator defense. We inferredEdagenotypes from lateral plate phenotypes and show that the frequency of the complete (C) allele, which is associated with greater number of lateral plates, increases as a function of ecosystem size. Predator presence and habitat complexity are both correlated to ecosystem size. The strongest proximate predictor ofEdaallele frequencies was the presence of predatory fishes (steelhead trout and sculpin). Counter to expectations, habitat complexity did not have a strong modifying effect onEdaallele frequencies. Our results point to the importance of ecosystem size for determining predator presence as being the primary pathway to evolutionary effects. Ecosystem size has received much attention in ecology. Our work shows that it may be an important determinant of adaptive evolution in wild populations.||FOOD-CHAIN Environmental Who Should Be Warned to Do What and When?||Cova, Thomas J.; Dennison, Article||Determining the most effective public warnings to issue during a hazardous environmental event is a complex problem. Three primary questions need to be answered: Who should take protective action? What is the best action? and When should this action be initiated? Warning triggers provide a proactive means for emergency managers to simultaneously answer these questions by recommending that a target group take a specified protective action if a preset environmental trigger condition occurs (e.g., warn a community to evacuate if a wildfire crosses a proximal ridgeline). Triggers are used to warn the public across a wide variety of environmental hazards, and an improved understanding of their nature and role promises to: (1) advance protective action theory by unifying the natural, built, and social themes in hazards research into one framework, (2) reveal important information about emergency managers' risk perception, situational awareness, and threat assessment regarding threat behavior and public response, and (3) advance spatiotemporal models for representing the geography and timing of disaster warning and response (i.e., a coupled natural-built-social system). We provide an overview and research agenda designed to advance our understanding and modeling of warning triggers.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/warning-triggers-environmental-hazards-who-should/docview/1896537438/se-2| |Perceptions and Expected Immediate Reactions to Severe Huang, Shih-Kai; Lindell, Michael K.||Risk Analysis||2019||Journal Article||The National Weather Service has adopted warning polygons that more specifically indicate the risk area than its previous county-wide warnings. However, these polygons are not defined in terms of numerical strike probabilities (p(s)). To better understand people's interpretations of warning polygons, 167 participants were shown 23 hypothetical scenarios in one of three information conditions-polygon-only (Condition A), polygon + tornadic storm cell (Condition B), and polygon + tornadic storm cell + flanking nontornadic storm cells (Condition C). Participants judged each polygon's p(s) and reported the likelihood of taking nine different response actions. The polygon-only condition replicated the results of previous studies; p(s) was highest at the polygon's centroid and declined in all directions from there. The two conditions displaying storm cells differed from the polygon-only condition only in having p(s) just as high at the polygon's edge nearest the storm cell as at its centroid. Overall, p(s) values were positively correlated with expectations of continuing normal activities, seeking information from social sources, seeking shelter, and evacuating by car. These results indicate that participants make more appropriate p(s) judgments when polygons are presented in their natural context of radar displays than when they are presented in isolation. However, the fact that p(s) judgments had moderately positive correlations with both sheltering (a generally appropriate response) and evacuation (a generally inappropriate response) suggests that experiment participants experience the same ambivalence about these two protective actions as people threatened by actual tornadoes.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/perceptions-expected-immediate-reactions-severe/docview/2163188331/se-2?accountid=14784| |Complexity of Coupled Human and Taylor, William W.||Science||2007||Journal Article||Integrated studies of coupled human and natural systems reveal new and complex patterns and processes not evident when studied by social or natural scientists separately.

We sought to determine whether SafeBoda drivers are more likely to engage in safe riding behaviours than regular drivers (motorcycle taxi drivers not part of SafeBoda). Methods We measured riding behaviours in SafeBoda and regular drivers through: (1) computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), where 400 drivers were asked about their riding behaviours (eg, helmet and mobile phone use) and (2) roadside observation, where riding behaviours were observed in 3000 boda-boda drivers and their passengers along major roads in Kampala. Results Across the two cross-sectional studies, a higher proportion of SafeBoda drivers than regular drivers engaged in safe riding behaviours. For instance, helmet use among SafeBoda compared with regular drivers was 21% points higher (95% CI 0.15 to 0.27; p<0.001) based on the CAPI and 45% points higher (95% CI 0.43 to 0.47; p<0.001) based on roadside observation. Furthermore, compared with regular drivers, SafeBoda drivers were more likely to report having a driver's license (66.3% vs 33.5 %; p<0.001) and a reflective jacket (99.5% vs 50.5 %; p<0.001) and were less likely to report driving towards oncoming traffic (4% vs 45.7 %; p<0.001) in the past 30 days. Conclusion The SafeBoda programme is associated with increased safe riding behaviours among motorcycle taxi drivers in Kampala. Therefore, the promotion and expansion of such programmes may lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality due to road injuries.||MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION; HELMET USE; KNOWLEDGE; INJURIES; RIDERS| |Built environment change: a framework to support health-enhancing behaviour through environmental policy and health research||Berke, Ethan M.; Vernez-Moudon, Anne||JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH||2014||Journal Article||As research examining the effect of the built environment on health accelerates, it is critical for health and planning researchers to conduct studies and make recommendations in the context of a robust theoretical framework. We propose a framework for built environment change (BEC) related to improving health. BEC consists of elements of the built environment, how people are exposed to and interact with them perceptually and functionally, and how this exposure may affect health-related behaviours. Integrated into this framework are the legal and regulatory mechanisms and instruments that are commonly used to effect change in the built environment.

Indeed, dense and well-connected built environments and environments with natural vegetation may create opportunities for higher routine physical activity. However, studies have focused primarily on residential environments to define exposure and self-reported methods to estimate physical activity. This study explores the momentary association between minute-level global positioning systems (GPS)-based greenness exposure and time-matched objectively measured physical activity. Methods: Adult women were recruited from sites across the United States. Participants wore a GPS device and accelerometer on the hip for 7 days to assess location and physical activity at minutelevel epochs. GPS records were linked to 250mresolution satellitebased vegetation data and Census Block Group-level U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Smart Location Database walkability data. Minute-level generalized additive mixed models were conducted to test for associations between GPS measures and accelerometer count data, accounting for repeated measures within participant and allowing for deviations fromlinearity using splines. Results: Among 360 adult women (mean age of 55.3 +/- 10.2 years), we observed positive nonlinear relationships between physical activity and both greenness and walkability. In exploratory analyses, the relationships between environmental factors and physical activity were strongest among those who were white, had higher incomes, and who were middle-aged. Conclusions: Our results indicate that higher levels of physical activity occurred in areas with higher greenness and higher walkability. Impact: Findings suggest that planning and design policies should focus on these environments to optimize opportunities for physical activity. (C) Health-Related Quality of Life Following a Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis Varies With Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status||Robinson, Jamaica R. M.; Phipps, PREVENTION||2021||Journal Article||Background: Existing evidence indicates household income as a predictor of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) following a colorectal cancer diagnosis. This association likely varies with neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), but evidence is limited. Methods: We included data from 1,355 colorectal cancer survivors participating in the population-based Puget Sound Colorectal Cancer Cohort (PSCCC). Survivors reported current annual household income; we measured HRQoL via the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Colorectal (FACT-C) tool. Using neighborhood data summarized within a 1-km radial buffer of Census block group centroids, we constructed a multidimensional nSES index measure. We employed survivors' geocoded residential addresses to append nSES score for Census block group of residence. With linear generalized estimating equations clustered on survivor location, we evaluated associations of household income with differences in FACT-C mean score, overall and stratified by nSES. We used separate models to explore relationships for wellbeing subscales. Results: We found lower household income to be associated with clinically meaningful differences in overall FACT-C scores [<$30K: -13.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): and subscale wellbeing after a recent colorectal cancer diagnosis. Relationships were slightly greater in magnitude for survivors living in lower SES neighborhoods. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that recently diagnosed lower income colorectal cancer survivors are likely to report lower HRQoL, and modestly more so in lower SES neighborhoods. Impact: The findings from this work will aid future investigators' ability to further consider the contexts in which the income of survivors can be leveraged as a means of improving HRQoL||BUILT A YOUNG-CHILD IN A DOUBLE SPICA CAST - INCLUDING A PLAN FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A AP; STREISSGUTH, DM||CLINICAL PEDIATRICS||1978||Journal Article| |Low-Income Housing of Housing Development and Neighborhood Characteristics||Tillyer, Marie Skubak; Walter, Rebecca J.||CRIME & DELINQUENCY||2019||Journal Article||This study examines the distribution of crime across various types of low-income housing developments and estimates the main and interactive effects of housing development and neighborhood characteristics on crime.

A Review and Statistical Meta-Analysis of Hurricane Evacuation Studies||Huang, Lindell, S.||ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR||2016||Journal Article||This statistical meta-analysis (SMA) examined 38 studies involving actual responses to hurricane warnings and 11 studies involving expected responses to hypothetical hurricane scenarios conducted since 1991. The results indicate official warnings, mobile home residence, risk area residence, observations of environmental (storm conditions) and social (other people's behavior) cues, and expectations of severe personal impacts, all have consistently significant effects on household evacuation. Other variablesespecially demographic variableshave weaker effects on evacuation, perhaps via indirect effects. Finally, the SMA also indicates that the effect sizes from actual hurricane evacuation studies are similar to those from studies of hypothetical hurricane scenarios for 10 of 17 variables that were examined. These results can be used to guide the design of hurricane evacuation transportation analyses and emergency managers' warning programs. They also suggest that laboratory and Internet experiments could be used to examine people's cognitive processing of different types of warnings| |Comparing Associations Between the Built Environment and Walking in Rural Small Towns and a Large Metropolitan Area||Stewart, Orion T.; BEHAVIOR||2016||Journal Article||The association between the built environment (BE) and walking has been studied extensively in urban areas, yet little is known whether the same associations hold for smaller, rural towns. This analysis examined objective measures of the BE around participants' residence and their utilitarian and recreational walking from two studies, one in the urban Seattle area (n = 464) and the other in nine small U.S. towns (n = 299). After adjusting for sociodemographics, small town residents walked less for utilitarian purposes but more for recreational purposes. These differences were largely explained by differential associations of the BE on walking in the two settings. In Seattle, the number of neighborhood restaurants was positively associated with utilitarian walking, but in small towns, the association was negative. In small towns, perception of slow traffic on nearby streets was positively associated with recreational walking, but not in Seattle.

We test hypotheses about the main and interactive effects of neighborhood and business characteristics on crime at the business, with a focus on busy contexts and busy businesses. Method: Police crime incident data are spatially joined to study area business parcels. Additional data sources include Infogroup USA Business Data, the American Community Survey, and an Environmental Protection Agency traffic activity indicator. Multilevel negative binomial regression models are estimated to observe the main and interactive effects of census block group and business variables on crime at the parcel. Results: Businesses located in block groups with more commercial property and high levels of vehicular traffic experience more crime. In addition, crime is higher at busy businesses, as indicated by employee size, sales volume, and square footage. Busy contexts and busy businesses do not appear to interact to increase crime at the parcel beyond their main effects. Conclusions: Crime is clustered at relatively few businesses, and this variation cannot be explained by business type alone. Both neighborhood and business characteristics are associated with crime at freestanding businesses, with busy businesses and those within busier block groups experiencing more crime.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/busy-businesses-contexts-distribution-sources/docview/2283929115/se-2?accountid=14784| |Moving Three Times Is Like Having Your House on Fire Once: The Experience of Place and Impending Displacement among Public Housing Residents.||Manzo, Lynne C.; Kleit, Rachel G.; Couch, Dawn||Urban Studies (Sage Ltd.)||2008||Journal Article||The HOPE VI programme in the US displaces tens of thousands of low-income households to disperse pockets of poverty and transform sites of 'severely distressed' public housing into mixed- income housing. A complete evaluation of this programme's impacts on residents must examine the meanings and functions of these communities before they are dismantled. Therefore, this paper examines residents' lived experiences of place in one site before redevelopment. This socially well-functioning community allowed residents to lay down roots, form place attachments and create bonds of mutual support with neighbours, contrary to typical depictions of severely distressed housing. Implications for US public housing policy and parallels with the discourse on social housing and social inclusion in western Europe illuminate overarching trends in housing policy for the poor.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=34462601&site=ehost-live| |Transitional Property Rights and Local Developmental History in China.||Abramson, Daniel||Urban Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.)||2011||Journal Article||Among the societies that are moving from a centrally planned economy with weak property rights towards a market-oriented economy with stronger and more privatised property rights, China is undergoing an especially rapid and extensive urbanisation that obscures the diversity and relevance of local pre-Reform property arrangements. Official discourse emphasises the formalisation, clarification and, to some extent, the privatisation of property rights in the name of overall societal development and gradual integration with the global economy. In local informal, popular practice and discourse, however, the invocation of property rights reflects the continuing political relevance of both revolutionary and traditional notions of rights to urban space that challenge a unitary, linear view of the development process.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=57788584&site=ehost-live| |Transport Impacts of Clustered Development in Beijing: Compact Development Jiawen; Shen, Qing; Shen, Jinzhen; He, Canfei||URBAN STUDIES||2012||Journal Article||This research aims to inform the compact city discussion with a case study of Beijing, where urban planning has emphasised clustered suburban development in the past half-century. It uses three decades of census data to describe Beijing's spatial development trajectory and a household survey to assess its transport impacts. The research reveals an overconcentration of urban activities as a result of the featureless expansion of the central built-up area and the absorption of the suburban clusters; and, a lengthened commuting time stemming from the observed spatial development pattern. Beijing's experience adds to the existing literature by informing the search for good city forms in urban areas of high density. It is essential to differentiate compact development from overconcentration when combating sprawling development. Developing and maintaining suburban nodal characteristics around public transit can reduce travel in of electrical power supply is amongst the conditions that inform house purchase decisions in all urban areas. Reliability depends in part on the conditions of the power generation and distribution infrastructures involved, and in part on environmental conditions. Its value to homeowners may be capitalised into the value of the house. In this paper, a hedonic pricing approach is used to estimate the capitalised value of the reliability offered by distribution infrastructures and the environmental conditions with which they interact in Phoenix, Arizona. A first stage estimates the impact of infrastructure and environmental conditions on reliability. In a second stage, the capitalised value of reliability from the marginal willingness to pay for reliability revealed by house purchase decisions is estimated and used to infer the value of both infrastructural characteristics and environmental conditions.||WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY-VALUES; Value Traditional Development?||Bitter, Christopher||URBAN STUDIES||2014||Journal Article||New Urbanism and traditional neighbourhood development (TND) have been championed as solutions to the problems associated with post-war suburban sprawl. However, they have yet to capture a substantial share of the US housing market. The market context for TND is not well understood as the paucity of TND makes it difficult to study directly. This paper takes a novel approach by focusing on the market for 'traditional' development itself, defined as subdivisions recorded prior to World War II, in the sprawling Tucson, Arizona, MSA. The results of the hedonic analysis demonstrate that home buyers value the features embodied in traditional development, as homes in subdivisions platted before 1940 command premiums over those in their modern counterparts, even after carefully controlling for locational and structural characteristics. Moreover, the analysis finds that the premiums have increased through time, which suggests growing demand for traditionally designed subdivisions.||LAND-USE; NEIGHBORHOOD; URBANISM; Initiative' in Taipei.||Hou, Jeffrey||Urban Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.)||2020||Journal Article||With rising concerns for food security and climate adaptation, urban gardening and urban agriculture have emerged as a rising agenda for urban resilience around the world. In East Asia, a variety of initiatives have emerged in recent years with different levels of institutional support. Focusing on Taipei, where a vibrant urban agriculture movement has been unleashed in recent years, this article examines the ongoing outcomes of the city's new 'Garden City Initiative', which supports the establishment of urban gardens including community gardens, rooftop gardens and school gardens. Based on interviews and participant observations during the initial period of advocacy, planning and implementation between 2014 and 2017, this study examines the background of the programme, the involvement of governmental and non-governmental actors and the programme's ongoing implementation. Based on the findings, the article further reflects upon their implications for the practices of urban governance in the face of contemporary environmental, political and social challenges. The case of Taipei suggests a model in which policy formation and implementation may require opportunistic actions involving a variety of actors and organisations in both institutions and the civil society. Rather than dramatic changes or instant institutional realignment, the effort may require strategic adaptation of the existing bureaucratic structure, while mobilising its strengths and resources. In addition, despite the critical role of civil society organisations, the Taipei case also illustrates a considerable public-sector investment, distinct from the predominant model of neoliberal governance that has been associated with urban gardening programmes elsewhere.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/governing-urban-gardens-resilient-cities/docview/2401746198/se-2?accountid=14784| |Housing trajectories of immigrants and their children in France: Between integration and stratification.||Acolin, Arthur||Urban Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.)||2019||Journal Article||Immigrants have been found to exhibit different housing tenure patterns from the rest of the population in a number of contexts. This article tests whether observed differences in tenure in France can be explained by differences in socio-demographic characteristics or whether unexplained differences might result from housing market mechanisms that affect immigrants differentially from the rest of the population, and extends this to the second generation. The article relies on data from TeO, a survey of 21,761 persons designed to oversample and identify immigrants and their children, providing information about the outcomes of children of immigrants that is otherwise lacking in French statistics. The results indicate that while immigrants are significantly less likely to be homeowners, even after controlling for compositional difference, the gap in homeownership between the second generation and the rest of the population is smaller and not statistically significant. This suggests a progressive integration in the housing market over time and over generations rather than overall stratified housing trajectories. Differences in terms of the share of social housing residents, the level of residential crowding, and housing and neighbourhood characteristics also decline across generations. However, children of immigrants from some non-European origins are experiencing higher levels of stratification than other groups, with continued significant differences in tenure.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/housing-trajectories-immigrants-their-children/docview/2251681015/se-2?accountid=14784| |Ancient and current resilience in the Chengdu Plain: Agropolitan development re-'revisited'.||Abramson, Daniel B.||Urban Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.)||2020||Journal Article||The Dujiangyan irrigation system, China's largest, is one of the world's most important examples of sustainable agropolitan development, maintained by a relatively decentralised system of governance that minimises bureaucratic oversight and depends on significant local autonomy at many scales down to the household. At its historic core in the Chengdu Plain, the system has supported over 2000 years of near-continuously stable urban culture, as well as some of the world's highest sustained long-term per-hectare productivity and diversity of grain and other crops, especially considering its high population density, forest cover, general biodiversity and flood management success. During the past decade, rapid urban expansion has turned the Chengdu Plain from a net grain exporter into a grain importer, and has radically transformed its productive functioning and distinctive scattered settlement pattern, reorganising much of the landscape into larger, corporately-managed farms, and more concentrated and infrastructure-intensive settlements of non-farming as well as farming households. Community-scale case studies of spatial-morphological and household socio-economic variants on the regional trend help to articulate what is at stake. Neither market-driven 'laissez-faire' rural development nor local state-driven spatial settlement consolidation and corporatisation of production seem to correlate well with important factors of resilience: landscape heterogeneity; crop diversity and food production; permaculture; and flexibility in household independence and choice of livelihood. Management of the irrigation system should be linked to community-based agricultural landscape preservation and productive dwelling, as sources of adaptive capacity crucial to the social-ecological resilience of the city-region, the nation and perhaps all humanity.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/ancient-current-resilience-chengdu-plain/docview/2401746062/se-2?accountid=14784| |Rediscovering Japanese Urban Space in a World Context||Oshima, Ken Tadashi||JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY||2016||Journal Article||Counter to the rise of the modern metropolis in Japan in the era of high-speed growth following World War II, a movement to embrace elements of traditional townscapes that had been lost as rational urban planning took hold from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s. During this period, the realities of large-scale urban development and increasing urban problems would eventually expose the limitations of functional planning and the need to preserve traditional structures and townscapes. While architects like Bruno Taut had praised the virtues of the farmhouse villages at Shirakawago in the 1930s and Yoshida Tetsur presented traditional Japanese architecture to an international audience as contemporary design before World War II, among others, the discourse subsequently shifted from Japanese objects and structures to urban space in the postwar period. This discourse on Japanese urban space would lead to the publication of Nihon no toshi kukan (Japanese Urban Space) in 1963 (1968 as a book) that presented the work of the Toshi dezain kenkyutai (Urban Design Research Group) including Isozaki Arata (1931-) and architectural historian It Teiji (1922-2010). This article analyzes the origins and implications of this work through a plethora of subsequent design surveys throughout Japan and other trajectories of research and design of Japanese urban space from the 1960s to the present.||Japanese urban space; urban landscape; serial vision; REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW||2000||Journal Article||This research estimates commuting costs associated with Seoul's Greenbelt. It uses a density gradient framework for workers and residents and assumes that the Greenbelt results in a major discontinuity in these gradients that would be eliminated if the Greenbelt did not exist. This means abolition of the Greenbelt would result in both more workers and residents within the Greenbelt and fewer outside (both centrally and peripherally). The commuter distance savings from this reallocation form the basis for measuring the commuting costs. The average savings is 5 percent (a reduction from 7.14 ion to 6.79 km); Greenbelt workers and residents would achieve substantial savings that are not fully offset by modest increases for those in the non-Greenbelt zones. Total commuting costs associated with the current Greenbelt are $65.96 million per year for our-of-pocket costs ($12.01 per commuter), or $395.56 million per year ($72.02 per commuter) including the value FUNCTION.||Alberti, M||International Regional Science Review||2005||Journal Article||Urban ecological systems are characterized by complex interactions among social, economic, institutional, and environmental variables. These interactions generate complex human-dominated landscapes, which significantly influence the functioning of local and global earth ecosystems and the services they provide to humans and other life on earth. Urban development fragments, isolates, and degrades natural habitats; simplifies and homogenizes species and modifies energy flow, and nutrient cycling. Urban areas also appropriate a large share of earth's carrying capacity front other regions in terms of resource input and waste sinks. Change in ecological conditions that result from human actions in urban areas ultimately affect human health and well-being. In this article, the author reviews the empirical evidence on the effects that patterns of urban development have on ecosystem function. Urban development affects the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape (i.e., pattern of variation in land cover) and spread of disturbance (i.e., invasive species). The author proposes that alternative urban patterns generate differential ecological effects. The review; reveals that the interactions between urban development patterns and ecosystem dynamics are still poorly understood. The author draws on an empirical study of the Puget Sound metropolitan region currently developed at the University of Washington to propose directions for future empirical research that can inform strategies to minimize urban impacts on ecosystems.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=16631702&site=ehost-live| |County planners' perceptions of land-use planning tools for environmental hazard mitigation: A survey in the US Pacific states||Ge, Yue 'Gurt'; Lindell, Michael K.||ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN||2016||Journal Article||Land-use planning tools have been extensively applied in the U.S. to achieve environmental sustainability and disaster resiliency for local communities. An important issue related to land-use planning tools is planners' beliefs about the ways in which these tools differ from each other and, thus, how planners choose among these tools for environmental hazard mitigation. A web-based survey collected data from planners in counties (or boroughs) in the five U.S. Pacific states (where county land-use planning is limited to unincorporated areas). The results indicate that planners substantially, but not completely, agreed in their perceptions of planning tools, that planners' perceptions of planning tools are minimally related to their personal characteristics and those of their jurisdictions, and that planners' perceptions of planning tools are significantly correlated with the capacity of their planning agencies. Planners viewed effectiveness (a desirable attribute) as positively correlated with economic costs and other impediments (which are undesirable attributes) so they must make trade-offs among these attributes and choose the most appropriate tool when formulating a growth management states| |Searching for housing in the digital age: Neighborhood representation on internet rental housing platforms across space, platform, and metropolitan segregation||Hess, SPACE||2021||Journal Article||Understanding residential mobility, housing affordability, and the geography of neighborhood advantage and disadvantage relies on robust information about housing search processes and housing markets. Existing data about housing markets, especially rental markets, suffer from accuracy issues and a lack of temporal and geographic flexibility. Data collected from online rental platforms that are commonly used can help address these issues and hold considerable promise for better understanding the full distribution of available rental homes. However, realizing this promise requires a careful assessment of potential sources of bias as online rental listing platforms may perpetuate inequalities similar to those found in physical spaces. This paper approaches the production of rental advertisements as a social process driven by both contextual and property level factors. We compare data from two online platforms for the 100 most populated metropolitan areas in the United States to explore inequality in digital rental listing spaces and understand what characteristics are associated with over and underrepresentation of advertisements in certain areas. We find similar associations for socioeconomic measures between platforms and across urban and suburban parts of these metropolitan areas. In contrast, the importance of racial and ethnic composition, as well as broader patterns of segregation, for online representation differs substantially across space and platform. This analysis informs our understanding of how online platforms affect housing search dynamics through their biases and segmentation, and highlights the potential and limits in using the data available on these platforms to produce small area rental estimates.||FAIR MARKET RENTS; CITIES; OPPORTUNITY||Residential inequality| |Feasibility of using construction occasionally takes place in remote locations, making its document management challenging especially when frequent document revisions occur. With the recent advancement of smartphones and tablets, Quick Response (QR) codes can provide project teams rapid and reliable access to up-to-date documents required for field operations. As a result, the use of QR codes can lead to a reduced need for traveling or meeting for document revisions, and reduce the amount of hardcopy documents and storage space. Despite the potential for significant benefits, there have been few studies aimed at assessing the feasibility of using QR codes in highway construction. In response, the objective of the study was to investigate the benefits of and barriers to using QR codes in highway construction for document management. To conduct the study, first a multi-step process was used, involving an online survey and interviews, with a goal of determining the status quo of highway construction in terms of document management and mobile information technology (IT). The results indicate that hardcopy documentation is still the most prevalent form of document management in highway construction, and hence there is an opportunity for implementing QR codes in conjunction with mobile IT. In the second part of the study, a time study using a real-world infrastructure project was conducted based on three activities: detail look up, specification check, and version check. As a result, the study found statistical evidence that using QR codes can lead to significant time savings.| |Estimating Traffic Volume for Local Streets with Imbalanced RECORD||2019||Journal Article||Annual average daily traffic (AADT) is an important measurement used in traffic engineering. Local streets are major components of a road network. However, automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) used to collect AADT are often limited to arterial roads, and such information is, therefore, often unavailable for local streets. Estimating AADT on local streets becomes a necessity as local street traffic continues to grow and the capacity of arterial roads becomes insufficient. A challenge is that an under-represented sample of local street AADT may result in biased estimation. A synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is applied to oversample local streets to correct the imbalanced sampling among different road types. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is employed to estimate AADT incorporating various independent variables, including factors of roadway design, socio-demographics, and land use. The model is examined with an AADT dataset from Seattle, WA. Results show that: (1) SMOTE helps to correct imbalanced sampling proportions and improve model performance significantly; (2) the number of lanes and the number of crosswalks are both positively associated with AADT; (3) road segments located in areas with a higher population density or more mixed land use have a higher AADT; (4) distance to the nearest arterial road is negatively correlated with AADT; and (5) AADT creates spatial spillover effects on neighboring road segments. The combination of SMOTE and GLMM improves the estimation accuracy on AADT, which contributes to better data for transportation planning and traffic monitoring, and to cost saving on data collection.||AVERAGE; PREDICTION; NETWORK; COUNTY| |Effects of Charging Infrastructure Characteristics on Electric Vehicle Preferences of New and Used Car Buyers in the United States||Zou, Tianqi; Khaloei, Moein; MacKenzie, Don||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2020||Journal Article||The used car market is a critical element for the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). However, most previous studies on EV adoption have focused only on new car markets. This article examines and compares the effects of charging infrastructure characteristics on the preferences for EVs among both new and used car buyers. This study is based on an online stated preference choice experiment among private car owners in the U.S., and the results of comparable binomial logistic models show that new and used car buyers generally share similar patterns in preferences for EVs, with exceptions for sensitivity toward fast charging time, and home charging solutions. Respondents' stated willingness to adopt an EV increases considerably with improvements in driving range, and the effects on new and used car buyers are similar. The study also finds that better availability of charging infrastructure largely increases preference for EVs. The results further reveal that slow and fast charging have complementary effects on encouraging EV adoption as the combination of public slow and fast charging can compensate for the unavailability of home charging.| |Counterfactual planning - What if there had been no greenbelt in Seoul?||Bae, CHC; Jun, MJ||JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH||2003||Journal Article||This article uses a specific and long-established planning policy, Seoul's greenbelt, to explore the concept of counterfactual planning. Suppose the greenbelt had never existed. How would the spatial structure of the metropolitan region have been different? Under both monocentric and polycentric assumptions, both population and employment (in terms of densities and numbers) would have been much lower in the core city and the periphery. The effects would have been m ore dramatic in the core city, suggesting that the greenbelt contributed significantly to densification and congestion. Still, its consequences for leapfrog development were far from negligible. In addition, because the greenbelt policy was reinforced by a strong government strategy to build very large new towns beyond the greenbelt, a significant Jobs-housing imbalance resulted because people decentralized much faster than jobs. Whether these effects are offset by the recreational and other environmental benefits of the greenbelt is unclear.||RESIDENTIAL |The economic value of office clusters - An analysis of assessed property values, regional form, and land use mix in King County, Washington||Sohn, Dong-Wook; Moudon, Anne V.||JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH||2008||Journal Article||This study seeks to provide supportive information for the planning of existing or new employment centers in metropolitan regions. It examines how the spatial concentration of office uses and their combination with other land uses affects the assessed value of office properties. The goal is to measure the spatial clustering of office uses and the clusters' physical characteristics to quantify their association with office property values. The characteristics of interest include cluster size, regional location and relationship to transportation infrastructure, internal land use mix, and transportation network. The study revealed that recent office development has continued to benefit economically from agglomeration. Office property values seemed to be most positively affected by, in order of importance, the intensity of office development, a central regional location, and the clustering or agglomeration |Intermetropolitan Comparison of Transportation Accessibility: Sorting Out Mobility and Proximity in San Francisco and Washington, DC||Grengs, Joe; Levine, Jonathan; Shen, Qing; Shen, Qingyun||JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH||2010||Journal Article||Both mobility and proximity influence transportation accessibility, but they exist in tension with each other. To understand the region-level trade-off between mobility and proximity requires intermetropolitan comparisons of accessibility. With a focus on the two metropolitan cases of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., we first describe a method for comparing regional accessibility and then explain a method that separates out the effects of mobility and proximity on regional accessibility. We find that the San Francisco region enjoys an accessibility advantage over Washington largely because of faster highway speeds but that central Washington offers an advantage from Research on Active Transportation to School and Implications for Safe Routes to School Programs||Stewart, Orion||JOURNAL OF PLANNING LITERATURE||2011||Journal Article||This literature review identified common factors associated with active transportation to school (ATS). It used a conceptual framework of a child's commute mode to school to classify 480 variables from forty-two studies that were tested for association with ATS. Four factors most frequently influenced ATS: distance, income, traffic and crime fears, and parental attitudes and schedules. Regular ATS results in more physical activity but research is lacking on other outcomes. Safe Routes to School, a program designed to increase rates and safety of ATS, can use an understanding of these influences and outcomes to more effectively allocate its limited resources.||PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY LEVELS; techniques have been used in the last decades for the acoustic characterization and performance optimization of sound diffusive surfaces. However, these methods require very long calculation times and do not provide a rapid feedback. As a result, these methods can hardly be applied by designers at early stages of the design process, when successive design iterations are necessary from an aesthetic point of view. A suitable alternative could be the use of parametric modeling in combination with performance investigations during the design process of sound diffusive surfaces. To this aim, this study presents a design process for diffusive surfaces topology optimization based on the combination of parametric models and geometrical acoustic simulations. It aims to provide architects and designers with rapid visual feedback on acoustic performances at a preliminary stage of the design process. The method has been tested on different case studies, which have been modelled based on geometric guidelines for diffusive surface optimization. The sensitivity of the method showed that it could be a very useful tool for comparisons among surface design alternatives. Finally, the advantages and limitations of the integrated optimization in comparison with conventional optimizations that existing critiques of communicative planning become more salient when we consider the challenges posed by neoliberalization, which is understood here to mean the ongoing project to install market logics and competitive discipline as hegemonic assumptions in urban politics and policy-making. I develop how neoliberalization, by its normal operation, produces important legitimacy problems that must be managed. Overcoming these legitimacy problems necessitates decision-making practices that do not fundamentally challenge existing power relations but still confer a high degree of political legitimacy. The article presents existing critiques of Habermasian ideals to argue that communicative and collaborative planning, insofar as they follow these ideals, provide an extremely attractive way for neoliberals to maintain hegemony while ensuring political stability. The article argues therefore that communicative and collaborative approaches are not well-suited to confronting neoliberalization. More promising instead are radical counter-hegemonic mobilizations whose goal is not to neutralize power relations, but to transform Mark||PLANNING THEORY||2016||Journal Article||This article argues that planning should develop a robust conception of publics without the State. We should do so because the State is a necessarily oligarchical arrangement that prevents us from achieving real democracy. We should explore publics without the State in both theory developments in many parts of the world seem likely to exacerbate rather than ameliorate the planetary-scale challenges of social polarization, inequality and environmental change societies face. In this unconventional multi-authored essay, we therefore seek to explore some of the ways in which planning theory might respond to the deeply unsettling times we live in. Taking the multiple, suggestive possibilities of the theme of unsettlement as a starting point, we aim to create space for reflection and debate about the state of the discipline and practice of planning theory, questioning what it means to produce knowledge capable of acting on the world today. Drawing on exchanges at a workshop attended by a group of emerging scholars in Portland, Oregon in late 2016, the essay begins with an introduction section exploring the contemporary resonances of unsettling' in, of and for planning theory. This is followed by four, individually authored responses which each connect the idea of unsettlement to key challenges and possible future directions. We end by calling for a reflective practice of theorizing that accepts unsettlement but seeks to act knowingly and compassionately on the uneven terrain that it creates.||PRAGMATISM; theory; knowledge production; Research & Technology||2019||Journal Article||The human ocular system functions in a dual manner. While the most well-known function is to facilitate vision, a growing body of research demonstrates its role in resetting the internal body clock to synchronize with the 24-hour daily cycle. Most research on circadian rhythms is performed in controlled laboratory environments. Little is known about the variability of circadian light within the built and natural environments. Currently, very few specialized devices measure the circadian light, and they are not accessible to many researchers and practitioners. In this paper, tristimulus colour calibration procedures for high dynamic range photography are developed to measure circadian lighting. Camera colour accuracy is evaluated through CIE trichromatic (XYZ) measurements; and the results demonstrate a strong linear relationship between the camera recordings and a scientific-grade colorimeter. Therefore, it is possible to correct for the colour aberrations and use high dynamic range photographs to measure both photopic and circadian lighting values. Spectrophotometric measurements are collected to validate the methodology. Results demonstrate that measurements from high dynamic range photographs can correspond to the physical quantity of circadian luminance with reasonable precision and repeatability. Circadian data collected in built environments can be utilized to study the impact of design decisions on human circadian entrainment and to create guidelines and metrics for designing circadian friendly environments.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=137511478&site=ehost-live| |Deep learning in design workflows: The elusive design pixel||Mahankali, Ranjeeth; Johnson, Brian R.; Anderson, Alex T.||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING||2018||Journal Article||The recent wave of developments and research in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence is causing the border between the intuitive and deterministic domains to be redrawn, especially in computer vision and natural language processing. As designers frequently invoke vision and language in the context of design, this article takes a step back to ask if deep learning's capabilities might be applied to design workflows, especially in architecture. In addition to addressing this general question, the article discusses one of several prototypes, BIMToVec, developed to examine the use of deep learning in design. It employs techniques like those used in natural language processing to interpret building information models. The article also proposes a homogeneous data format, provisionally called a design pixel, which can store design information as spatial-semantic maps. This would make designers' intuitive thoughts more accessible to deep learning algorithms while also allowing designers to communicate abstractly with design software.||Associative logic; creative Periphery.||Chalana, Manish||Journal of Planning History||2015||Journal Article||This article traces the history of the greenbelt of Chandigarh, India's first modernist city, designed by Le Corbusier.

These facilities set important precedents for design teams seeking operational examples for achieving aggressive energy and interior environmental quality goals. This examination of operational hospitals is intended to offer hospital owners, designers, and building managers a strong case and concrete framework for strategies to achieve exceptionally high performing buildings. BACKGROUND: Energy efficient hospitals have the potential to significantly impact the U.S.'s overall energy profile, and key stakeholders in the hospital industry need specific, operationally grounded precedents in order to successfully implement informed energy reduction strategies. This study is an outgrowth of previous research evaluating high quality, low energy hospitals that serve as examples for new high performance hospital design, construction, and operation. Through extensive interviews, numerous site visits, the development of case studies, and data collection, this team has established thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses of several contemporary hospitals in Scandinavia and the Pacific Northwest. Many Scandinavian hospitals demonstrate a low energy profile, and when analyzed in comparison with U.S. hospitals, such Scandinavian precedents help define the framework required to make significant changes in the U.S. hospital building industry. METHODS: Eight hospitals, four Scandinavian and four Pacific Northwest, were quantitatively compared using the Environmental Protection Agency's Portfolio Manager, allowing researchers to answer specific questions about the impact of energy source and architectural and mechanical strategies on energy efficiency in operational hospitals. RESULTS: Specific architectural, mechanical, and plant systems make these Scandinavian hospitals more energy efficient than their Pacific Northwest counterparts. More importantly, synergistic systems integration allows for their significant reductions in energy consumption. CONCLUSIONS: This quantitative comparison of operational Scandinavian and Pacific Northwest hospitals resulted in compelling evidence of the potential for deep energy savings in the U.S., and allowed researchers to outline specific strategies for achieving such reductions.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=100511062&site=ehost-live| |Arterial roads and area socioeconomic status are predictors of fast food restaurant density in King County, WA||Hurvitz, Philip M.; BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY||2009||Journal Article||Background: Fast food restaurants reportedly target specific populations by locating in lower-income and in minority neighborhoods. Physical proximity to fast food restaurants has been associated with higher obesity rates. Objective: To examine possible associations, at the census tract level, between area demographics, arterial road density, and fast food restaurant density in King County, WA, USA. Methods: Data on median household incomes, property values, and race/ethnicity were obtained from King County and from US Census data. Fast food restaurant addresses were obtained from Public Health-Seattle & King County and were geocoded. Fast food density was expressed per tract unit area and per capita. Arterial road density was a measure of vehicular and pedestrian access. Multivariate logistic regression models containing both socioeconomic status and road density were used in data analyses. Results: Over one half (53.1%) of King County census tracts had at least one fast food restaurant. Mean network distance from dwelling units to a fast food restaurant countywide was 1.40 km, and 1.07 km for census tracts containing at least one fast food restaurant. Fast food restaurant density was significantly associated in regression models with low median household income (p < 0.001) and high arterial road density (p < 0.001) but not with percent of residents who were nonwhite. Conclusion: No significant association was observed between census tract minority status and fast food density in King County. Although restaurant density was linked to low household incomes, that effect was attenuated by arterial road density. Fast food restaurants in King County are more likely to be located in lower income neighborhoods and higher between electric-assist cargo bicycles and delivery trucks in areas.||Sheth, Article||Introduction: Completing urban freight deliveries is increasingly a challenge in congested urban areas, particularly when delivery trucks are required to meet time windows. Depending on the route characteristics, Electric Assist (EA) cargo bicycles may serve as an economically viable alternative to delivery trucks. The purpose of this paper is to compare the delivery route cost trade-offs between box delivery trucks and EA cargo bicycles that have the same route and delivery characteristics, and to explore the question, under what conditions do EA cargo bikes perform at a lower cost than typical delivery trucks? Methods: The independent variables, constant variables, and assumptions used for the cost function comparison model were gathered through data collection and a literature review. A delivery route in Seattle was observed and used as the base case; the same route was then modelled using EA cargo bicycles. Four separate delivery scenarios were modeled to evaluate how the following independent route characteristics would impact delivery route cost - distance between a distribution center (DC) and a neighborhood, number of stops, distance between each stop, and number of parcels per stop. Results: The analysis shows that three of the four modeled route characteristics affect the cost trade-offs between delivery trucks and EA cargo bikes. EA cargo bikes are more cost effective than delivery trucks for deliveries in close proximity to the DC (less than 2 miles for the observed delivery route with 50 parcels per stop and less than 6 miles for the hypothetical delivery route with 10 parcels per stop) and at which there is a high density of residential units and low delivery volumes per stop. Conclusion: Delivery trucks are more cost effective for greater distances from the DC and for large volume deliveries to one stop.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=134786045&site=ehost-live| |Obesity, diet quality, physical activity, and the built environment: the need for behavioral pathways||Drewnowski, HEALTH||2016||Journal Article||Background: The built environment ( BE) is said to influence local obesity rates. Few studies have explored causal pathways between home-neighborhood BE variables and health outcomes such as obesity. Such pathways are likely to involve both physical activity and diet. Methods: The Seattle Obesity Study ( SOS II) was a longitudinal cohort of 440 adult residents of King Co, WA. Home addresses were geocoded. Home-neighborhood BE measures were framed as counts and densities of food sources and physical activity locations. Tax parcel property values were obtained from County tax assessor. Healthy Eating Index ( HEI 2010) scores were constructed using data from food frequency questionnaires. Physical activity ( PA) was obtained by self-report. Weights and heights were measured at baseline and following 12 months' exposure. Multivariable regressions examined the associations among BE measures at baseline, health behaviors ( HEI-2010 and physical activity) at baseline, and health outcome both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results: None of the conventional neighborhood BE metrics were associated either with diet quality, or with meeting PA guidelines. Only higher property values did predict better diets and more physical activity. Better diets and more physical activity were associated with lower obesity prevalence at baseline and 12 mo, but did not predict weight change. Conclusion: Any links between the BE and health outcomes critically depend on establishing appropriate behavioral pathways. In this study, home-centric BE measures, were not related to physical activity or to diet. Further studies will need to consider a broader range of BE attributes that may be related to diets and health.||BODY-MASS INDEX; LOCAL FOOD ENVIRONMENT; behaviors: a comparative analysis between personal activity location measurement system (PALMS) and travel diary.||Kang, Mingyu; Moudon, Anne V.; Health Geographics||2018||Journal Article||BackgroundDevice-collected data from GPS and accelerometers for identifying active travel behaviors have dramatically changed research methods in transportation planning and public health. Automated algorithms have helped researchers to process large datasets with likely fewer errors than found in other collection methods (e.g., self-report travel diary). In this study, we compared travel modes identified by a commonly used automated algorithm (PALMS) that integrates GPS and accelerometer data with those obtained from travel diary estimates.MethodsSixty participants, who made 2100 trips during seven consecutive days of data collection, were selected from among the baseline sample of a project examining the travel behavior impact of a new light rail system in the greater Seattle, WA (USA) area. GPS point level analyses were first conducted to compare trip/place and travel mode detection results using contingency tables. Trip level analyses were then performed to investigate the effect of proportions of time overlap between travel logs and device-collected data on agreement rates. Global performance (with all subjects' data combined) and subject-level performance of the algorithm were compared at the trip level.ResultsAt the GPS point level, the overall agreement rate of travel mode detection was 77.4% between PALMS and the travel diary. The agreement rate for vehicular trip detection (84.5%) was higher than for bicycling (53.5%) and walking (58.2%). At the trip level, the global performance and subject-level performance of the PALMS algorithm were 46.4% and 42.4%, respectively. Vehicular trip detection showed highest agreement rates in all analyses. Study participants' primary travel mode and car ownership were significantly related to the subject-level mode agreement rates.ConclusionsThe PALMS algorithm showed moderate identification power at the GPS point level. However, trip level analyses found lower agreement rates between PALMS and travel diary data, especially for active transportation. Testing different PALMS parameter settings may serve to improve the detection of active travel and help expand PALMS's applicability in geographically different urbanized areas with a variety of travel modes.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=133368494&site=ehost-live| |Probabilistic walking models using built environment and Metrics||2019||Journal Article||BackgroundIndividual sociodemographic and home neighborhood built environment (BE) factors influence the probability of engaging in health-enhancing levels of walking or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Methods are needed to parsimoniously model the associations.MethodsParticipants included 2392 adults drawn from a community-based twin registry living in the Seattle region. Objective BE measures from four domains (regional context, neighborhood composition, destinations, transportation) were taken for neighborhood sizes of 833 and 1666 road network meters from home. Hosmer and Lemeshow's methods served to fit logistic regression models of walking and MVPA outcomes using sociodemographic and BE predictors. Backward elimination identified variables included in final models, and comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined model fit improvements.ResultsBuilt environment variables associated with physical activity were reduced from 86 to 5 or fewer. Sociodemographic and BE variables from all four BE domains were associated with activity outcomes but differed by activity type and neighborhood size. For the study population, ROC comparisons indicated that adding BE variables to a base model of sociodemographic factors did not improve the ability to predict walking or MVPA.ConclusionsUsing sociodemographic and built environment factors, the proposed approach can guide the estimation of activity prediction models for different activity types, neighborhood sizes, and discrete BE characteristics. Variables associated with walking and MVPA are population and neighborhood BE-specific.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=136786840&site=ehost-live| |Evaluation of high dynamic range photography as a luminance data acquisition system||Inanici, M. N.||LIGHTING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY||2006||Journal Article||In this paper, the potential, limitations and applicability of the High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography technique are evaluated as a luminance mapping tool. Multiple exposure photographs of static scenes were taken with a commercially available digital camera to capture the wide luminance variation within the scenes. The camera response function was computationally derived by using Photosphere software, and was used to fuse the multiple photographs into an HDR image. The vignetting effects and point spread function of the camera and lens system were determined. Laboratory and field studies showed that the pixel values in the HDR photographs correspond to the physical quantity of luminance with reasonable precision and repeatability.| |Against the local trap: scale and the study of environment and development.||Purcell, Mark; Brown, J. Christopher||Progress in Development Studies||2005||Journal Article||This paper argues against what we call 'the local trap', in which development researchers and practitioners falsely assume that localized decision-making is inherently more socially just or ecologically sustainable. The local trap constrains research on a range of topics in development research, including productive conservation networks, agro-forestry, community-based natural resource management, common property regimes and community-based collaboration. We use recent research on scale in political and economic geography to argue that scales and scalar arrangements are socially constructed through political struggle; they are never ontologically given. In other words, there is nothing inherent about any scale or scalar arrangement. Therefore, an arrangement in which resources or decisions are controlled locally is no more likely to lead to ecologically sustainable or socially just outcomes than an arrangement in which the regional, national or global scale predominates. Because scales are produced through socio-political struggle, the outcomes of a given scalar arrangement are dependent on the political agenda(s) of those empowered by the arrangement. When we start from the assumption that there is nothing inherent about scale, we cannot assume the political and ecological dynamics of a particular scalar configuration. We must instead make those dynamics the object of critical inquiry. The paper uses a case study of beekeeping in the Brazilian Amazon to illustrate the range of both positive and negative outcomes that can result when decision-making is localized.

Methods Participants living in the greater Seattle area were assessed in 2008-2009 and again 1-2 yr later (2010-2011). At each time point, they wore accelerometers and GPS units and recorded trips and locations in a travel diary for seven consecutive days. These data streams were combined to derive a more objective estimate of walking and total PA. Participants also completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire to provide self-reported estimates of walking and total PA. Regression analyses assessed the associations between within-participant changes in objective and self-reported walking and total PA. Results Data came from 437 participants. On average, a 1-min increase in total walking was associated with an increase in total PA of 1 min, measured by objective data, and 1.2-min, measured by self-reported data. A similar additive effect was consistently found with utilitarian, transportation, or job-related walking, measured by both objective and self-reported data. For recreational walking, the effect of change was mixed between objective and self-reported results. Conclusion Both objective and self-reported data confirmed an additive effect of utilitarian and total walking on PA.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=128068694&site=ehost-live| |Walking Objectively Measured: Classifying Accelerometer Data in Sports & Exercise||2013||Journal Article||Purpose: This study developed and tested an algorithm to classify accelerometer data as walking or nonwalking using either GPS or travel diary data within a large sample of adults under free-living conditions. Methods: Participants wore an accelerometer and a GPS unit and concurrently completed a travel diary for seven consecutive days. Physical activity (PA) bouts were identified using accelerometry count sequences. PA bouts were then classified as walking or nonwalking based on a decision-tree algorithm consisting of seven classification scenarios. Algorithm reliability was examined relative to two independent analysts' classification of a 100-bout verification sample. The algorithm was then applied to the entire set of PA bouts. Results: The 706 participants' (mean age = 51 yr, 62% female, 80% non-Hispanic white, 70% college graduate or higher) yielded 4702 person-days of data and had a total of 13,971 PA bouts. The algorithm showed a mean agreement of 95% with the independent analysts. It classified PA into 8170 walking bouts (58.5 %) and 5337 nonwalking bouts (38.2%); 464 bouts (3.3%) were not classified for lack of GPS and diary data. Nearly 70% of the walking bouts and 68% of the nonwalking bouts were classified using only the objective accelerometer and GPS data. Travel diary data helped classify 30% of all bouts with no GPS data. The mean + SD duration of PA bouts classified as walking was 15.2 + 12.9 min. On average, participants had 1.7 walking bouts and 25.4 total walking minutes per day. Conclusions: GPS and travel diary information can be helpful in classifying most accelerometer-derived PA bouts into walking or nonwalking behavior.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=88340620&site=ehost-live| |The Experience of Prospect and Refuge: Frank as Holding Environments||Ochsner, Jeffrey Karl||AMERICAN IMAGO||2018||Journal Article||REVERIE| |THE PAST AND FUTURE OF PIONEER SQUARE Historic Character and Infill Construction in Seattle's First Historic District||Ochsner, Jeffrey Karl||CHANGE OVER TIME-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT||2017||Journal Article||Seattle designated the Pioneer Square Preservation District, the city's first historic district, nearly fifty years ago. Over the past half century, the district has seen significant infrastructure improvements, a changing resident population, and an evolving mix of businesses. Although many buildings underwent interior alteration, the visible external character of the historic fabric has remained largely intact. The district's Preservation Board reviews a constant stream of small exterior restoration and rehabilitation projects, but it is the relatively few examples of new infill construction that have presented the most challenging questions as the board has had to balance the desire for new development and the activity it brings with the wish to protect historic character. Although the Pioneer Square District ordinance, the Secretary of Interior's Standards, and rules developed by the board all offer guidance, every new design presents questions about the exact meaning of terms like compatible and differentiated. Today, with Seattle's booming economy and growing population, more new projects of a larger scale are being proposed. As a result, the Pioneer Square Preservation District presents a singular case study demonstrating continuing efforts to protect the historic built environment while still allowing appropriate growth.| |Unique Environmental Effects on Physical Activity Participation: A Twin Article||Background: The health benefits of regular physical activity are well established. However, the relative contribution of heritable and environmental factors to physical activity participation remains controversial. Using a cut-point of 60 minutes of total activity per week, data from the GenomEUtwin project revealed consistent genetic influence on physical activity participation in 37,051 twin pairs from seven countries. We hypothesized that the heritability of physical activity participation would be attenuated using the CDC/ACSM recommended minimum threshold of 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week. Methods: Data were obtained from 1,389 twin pairs from the community-based University of Washington Twin Registry. Twin similarity in physical activity participation using both cut-points was analyzed using tetrachoric correlations and structural equation modeling in all same-sex pairs. Results: Correlations were higher in monozygotic (r(MZ) 0.33-0.54) (r(DZ) = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12-0.47) using the 60 minute cut-point. However, differences were attenuated using the 150 minute standard (r(MZ) = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.20-0.40; r(DZ) = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.07-0.42). Using the lower cut-point, the best fitting model of twin resemblance only included additive genetics and unique environment, with a heritability of 45%. In contrast, using the higher threshold, the best fitting model included the common and unique environment, with the unique environment contributing 72% of the variance. Conclusion: Unique environment factors provide the strongest influence on physical activity participation at levels recommended for health benefits.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=55506934&site=ehost-live| |GPS or travel diary: Comparing spatial and temporal characteristics of visits to fast food restaurants and supermarkets.||Scully, Jason between GPS and self-reported measures of location, we examined visits to fast food restaurants and supermarkets using a spatiotemporal framework. Data came from 446 participants who responded to a survey, filled out travel diaries of places visited, and wore a GPS receiver for seven consecutive days. Provided by Public Health Seattle King County, addresses from food permit data were matched to King County tax assessor parcels in a GIS. A three-step process was used to verify travel-diary reported visits using GPS records: (1) GPS records were temporally matched if their timestamps were within the time window created by the arrival and departure times reported in the travel diary; (2) the temporally matched GPS records were then spatially matched if they were located in a food establishment parcel of the same type reported in the diary; (3) the travel diary visit was then GPS-sensed if the name of food establishment in the parcel matched the one reported in the travel diary. To account for errors in reporting arrival and departure times, GPS records were temporally matched to three time windows: the exact time, +/-10 minutes, and +/-30 minutes. One third of the participants reported 273 visits to fast food restaurants; 88% reported 1,102 visits to supermarkets. Of these, 77.3 percent of the fast food and 78.6 percent supermarket visits were GPS-sensed using the +/-10-minute time window. At this time window, the mean travel-diary reported fast food visit duration was 14.5 minutes (SD 20.2), 1.7 minutes longer than the GPS-sensed visit. For supermarkets, the reported visit duration was 23.7 minutes (SD 18.9), 3.4 minutes longer than the GPS-sensed visit. Travel diaries provide reasonably accurate information on the locations and brand names of fast food restaurants and supermarkets participants report visiting.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=122376117&site=ehost-live| |Modern Architecture and Colonialism in the Islamic World||Mclaren, Brian JOURNAL OF E.||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE||2017||Journal Article||Arguably Tunis's premier public space, the iconic Avenue Bourguiba is today the product of over 150 years of manipulation, regulation and interpretation. Its development can be seen as an early example of thematic place branding, thereby complicating the notion that the widespread phenomenon is an exclusively postmodern and western one. In identifying three potential place-brand labels, this article considers the establishment of the 'Parisian Colonial' Avenue by French colonial authorities, its 'Tunisian Modern' modification at independence, and its more recent historicist 'Parisian Global' refurbishment within the contexts of colonialism, authoritarian governance and globalization. On the eve of the January 2011 revolution, the space reinforced the Ben Ali regime's maintenance of control and capitalized on the long-since entrenched image of a dual - eastern and western, traditional and modern - postcolonial city. In the revolution's wake the Avenue has become a reinvigorated public forum with a more complex character. Indeed, while the Avenue's existing form and function remain emblematic of Tunis's hybrid postcolonial identity, the thoroughfare now exemplifies the ongoing 'Arab Spring'. Its cultural brandscape and heritage content, though enhanced with new aspects of democratic empowerment, are likely to endure as the transitioning country continues to participate in the process of globalization.||AFRICA||(post)colonialism; Coe, S||PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING||2004||Journal Article||A methodology was developed to interpret and assess land cover change between 1991 and 1999 in Central Puget Sound, Washington at several scales (landscape, sub-basins, and 90 m grid window) relevant to regional and local decision makers. Land cover data are derived from USGS Landsat (Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper +) images of Central Puget Sound. Landsat data were registered, intercalibrated, and corrected for atmosphere and topography to ensure accuracy of land cover change assessment. We apply a hybrid classification method to each image to address the spectral heterogeneity of urbanizing regions, The method combines a supervised classification approach with a spectral unmixing approach to produce seven classes: >75 percent impervious, 15 to 75 percent impervious, forest, grass, clear cut, bare soil, and water. Land cover change is identified using the direct spatial comparison of classified images derived independently for each time period. We assess that the overall accuracy of each classified image was 91 percent for 1991 and 88 percent for 1999 respectively, which produces an accuracy of 85 percent for the change analysis.

Although there is a growing body of research focusing on a variety of individual, cultural, and organisational factors that affect an individual's perception of risk, only a few studies have adopted a multivariate analytical approach to understand public perceptions of climate change risks. This study extends earlier interdisciplinary research initiatives and proposes a more comprehensive, integrated model for understanding climate change risk perception. Using measures of objective risk, individual climate stress, and individual capacity, we explain public perceptions of climate change risks. The analysis is based on a national representative survey of US citizens. Geographic information systems and spatial analytical techniques are used to supplement the survey data with measures of objective risk associated with the location of each respondent. Analysis of the data using multivariate regression suggests that increased objective risk and individual capacity result in significantly higher perception of risk from climate change, whereas higher individual climate stress results in lower risk perceptions.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/understanding-climate-change-risk-perception-usa/docview/2010909014/se-2?accountid=14784| |WHAT IS A DOOR, NOTES TOWARD A SEMIOTIC GUIDE TO DESIGN||SELIGMANN, C||SEMIOTICA||1982||Journal Article| |[Re]Evaluating Significance: The Environmental and Cultural Older and Historic Buildings||Merlino, Kathryn Rogers||PUBLIC HISTORIAN||2014||Journal Article||Traditionally the value of a building is measured through the historical, cultural, or architectural significance that has emerged from the established traditions of historic preservation policy in the United States.

The activities of cities produce a wide array of data, data that is vastly enriched by ubiquitous computing. Municipal data is opened as it is pushed to, pulled by, and spilled to the public through online portals, requests for public records, and releases by cities and their vendors, contractors, and partners. By opening data, cities hope to raise public trust and prompt innovation. Municipal data, however, is often about the people who live, work, and travel in the city. By opening data, cities raise concern for privacy and social justice. This article presents the results of a broad empirical exploration of municipal data release in the City of Seattle. In this research, parties affected by municipal practices expressed their hopes and concerns for open data. City personnel from eight prominent departments described the reasoning, procedures, and controversies that have accompanied their release of data. All of the existing data from the online portal for the city were joined to assess the risk to privacy inherent in open data. Contracts with third parties involving sensitive or confidential data about residents of the city were examined for safeguards against the unauthorized release of data. Results suggest the need for more comprehensive measures to manage the risk latent in opening city data. Cities should maintain inventories of data assets, produce data management plans pertaining to the activities of departments, and develop governance structures to deal with issues as they arise--centrally and amongst the various departments--with ex ante and ex post protocols to govern the push, pull, and spill of data. In addition, cities should consider conditioned access to pushed data, conduct audits and training around public records requests, and develop standardized model contracts to protect against the spill of data by third parties.

This paper studies occupant preference and acceptance of patterns of luminance using HDR imaging and a repeated measures design methodology in a daylit office environment. Three existing luminance threshold analysis methods [method1: predetermined absolute luminance threshold (for example, 2000 cd/m(2)), method2: scene based mean luminance threshold, and method3: task based mean luminance threshold] were studied along with additional candidate metrics for their ability to explain luminance variability of 18 participant assessments of 'preferred' and 'just disturbing' scenes under daylighting conditions. Per-pixel luminance data from each scene were used to calculate Daylighting Glare Probability (DGP), Daylight Glare Index (DGI), and other candidate metrics using these three luminance threshold analysis methods. Of the established methods, the most consistent and effective metrics to explain variability in subjective responses were found to be; mean luminance of the task (using method3; (adj)r(2) = 0.59), mean luminance of the entire scene (using method2; (adj)r(2) = 0.44), and DGP using 2000 cd/m(2) glare source identifier (using method1; (adj)r(2) = 0.41). Of the 150 candidate metrics tested, the most effective was the 'mean luminance of the glare sources', where the glare sources were identified as 7* the mean luminance of the task position ((adj)r(2) = 0.64). Furthermore, DGP consistently performed better than DGI, confirming previous findings. 'Preferred' scenes never had more than similar to 10 percent of the field of view (FOV) that exceeded 2000 cd/m(2). Standard deviation of the entire scene luminance also proved to be a good predictor of satisfaction with general visual appearance.||GLARE||daylight metrics; luminance based lighting controls; discomfort dynamic range| |Integrating humans into ecology: central paradigm for urban ecology is that cities are emergent phenomena of local-scale, dynamic interactions among socioeconomic and biophysical forces. These complex interactions give rise to a distinctive ecology and to distinctive ecological forcing functions. Separately, both the natural and the social sciences have adopted complex system theory to study emergent phenomena, but attempts to integrate the natural and social sciences to understand human-dominated systems remain reductionist-these disciplines generally study humans and ecological processes as separate phenomena. Here we argue that if the natural and social sciences remain within their separate domains, they cannot explain how human-dominated ecosystems emerge from interactions between humans and ecological processes.

This article uses examples of smartphone-based platforms for urban mobility to argue that platforms create new political arrangements of the city, intermediating the social processes of management and movement that characterize urban life. Its empirical basis is a study of user interfaces, data specifications, and algorithms used in the operation and regulation of ride-hailing services and bike-share systems. I focus on three aspects of urban politics affected by platforms: its location, its participants, and the types of conflict it addresses. First, the programming forums in which decisions are encoded in and distributed through platforms' core digital architecture are new sites of policy deliberation outside the more familiar arenas of city politics. Second, travelers have new opportunities to use platforms for travel on their own terms, but this expanded participation is circumscribed by interfaces that presuppose individual, transactional engagement rather than a participation attentive to a broader social and environmental context. Finally, digital systems show themselves to be well suited to enforcing quantifiable distributional goals, but struggle to resolve the more nuanced relational matters that constitute the politics of everyday city life. These illustrations suggest that digital tools for managing transportation are not only political products, but also reset the stage on which urban encounters play balance of Amazonian rain forests: resolving ecological controls on net ecosystem productivity.||Grant, R. F.; Article||There is still much uncertainty about ecological controls on the rate and direction of net CO2 exchange by tropical rain forests, in spite of their importance to global C cycling. These controls are thought to arise from hydrologic and nutrient constraints to CO2 fixation caused by seasonality of precipitation and adverse chemical properties of some major tropical soil types. Using the ecosystem model ecosys, we show that water uptake to a depth of 8 m avoids constraints to CO2 and energy exchange from soil drying during five-month dry seasons typical for eastern Amazonian forests. This avoidance in the model was tested with eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CO2 and energy fluxes during 2003 and 2004 over an old-growth forest on an acidic, nutrient-poor oxisol in the Tapajs National Forest (TNF) in Par\u00b0, Brazil. Modeled CO2 fixation was strongly constrained by slow phosphorus (F) uptake caused by low soil pH. Daytime CO2 influxes in the model were in close agreement with EC measurements (R2 > 0.8) during both wet and dry seasons. Both modeled and measured fluxes indicated that seasonality of precipitation affected CO2 and energy exchange more through its effect on radiation and air temperature than on soil water content. When aggregated to a yearly scale, modeled and gap-filled EC CO2 fluxes indicated that old-growth forest stands in the TNF remained within 100 g C\u00acm-2\u00acyr-1 of C neutrality in the absence of major disturbance. Annual C transformations in ecosys were further corroborated by extensive biometric measurements taken in the TNF and elsewhere in the Amazon basin, which also indicated that old-growth forests were either small C sources or small C sinks. Long-term model runs suggested that rain forests could be substantial C sinks for several decades while regenerating after stand-replacing disturbances, but would gradually decline toward C neutrality thereafter. The time course of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in the model depended upon annual rates of herbivory and tree mortality, which were based on site observations as affected by weather (e.g., El Ni\u00b1o Southern Oscillation [ENSO] events). This dependence suggests that rain forest NEP is strongly controlled by disturbance as well as by weather.

With no proper training in shell behavior, Christiansen started his career designing cylindrical concrete shells based on the 1952 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Manual 31. This manual, and its approach to solving indeterminate behavior, both directed Christiansen's early design and provided a framework for significant creative work outside its bounds. His designs of long, spanning shells and short, arching shells (between 1954 and 1958) were adapted to a variety of architectural spaces, utilizing emerging structural methods like prestressing. These designs constitute the first era of Christiansen's career, and set the stage for more varied shell geometries to come.||historic a Comparative Framework of Adaptive Planning and Anticipatory Action Regimes in Chile, Japan, and the US: An Exploration of Multiple Contexts Informing Tsunami Risk-Based Relocation||Kuriyama, OF DISASTER RESEARCH||2020||Journal Article||Coastal regions around the Pacific Ring of Fire share the risk of massive earthquakes and tsunamis. Along with their own political-economic, cultural and biophysical contexts, each region has their own history and experiences of tsunami disasters. Coastal areas of Washington State in the U.S. are currently at risk of experiencing a tsunami following a massive Magnitude 9 (M9) earthquake anticipated in the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Looking ahead to consider adaptive planning in advance of a tsunami following this M9 event, this paper explores how lessons from recent megaquake- and tsunami-related experiences of risk-based planning and relocation in coastal areas of Japan and Chile could inform anticipatory action in coastal Washington State. Based on a comparison of earthquake and tsunami hazards, social factors, and the roles of government, this paper outlines a framework to compare policy contexts of tsunami risk-based planning and relocation in three Ring of Fire countries, including factors shaping the possible transfer of approaches between them. Findings suggest some aspects of comparative significance and commonalities shared across coastal communities in the three countries and at the same time highlight numerous differences in governance and policies related to planning and relocation. Although there are limitations to the transferability of lessons in disaster adaptive planning and anticipatory action from one national/regional context to another, we believe there is much more that Washington and the Pacific Northwest can learn from Japanese and Chilean experiences. In any context, risk reduction policies and actions need to garner political support in order to be implemented. Additional case study research and detailed analysis is still needed to understand specific lessons that may be applied to detailed risk-based planning and relocation programs across these different of the Built Environment With Physical Activity and Obesity in Older Persons.||Berke, Ethan M.; Koepsell, Thomas B.||American Journal of Public Health||2007||Journal Article||Objective. We examined whether older persons who live in areas that are conducive to walking are more active or less obese than those living in areas where walking is more difficult. Methods. We used data from the Adult Changes in Thought cohort study for a cross-sectional analysis of 936 participants aged 65 to 97 years. The Walkable and Bikable Communities Project previously formulated a walkability score to predict the probability of walking in King County, Washington. Data from the cohort study were linked to the walkability score at the participant level using a geographic information system. Analyses tested for associations between walkability score and activity and body mass index. Results. Higher walkability scores were associated with significantly more walking for exercise across buffers (circular zones around each respondent's home) of varying radii (for men, odds ratio [OR] = 5.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 34.17 to OR = 9.14; CI = 1.23, 68.11; for women, OR = 1.63; CI = 0.94, 2.83 to OR = 1.77; CI = 1.03, 3.04). A trend toward lower body mass index in men living in more walkable neighborhoods did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions. Findings suggest that neighborhood characteristics are associated with the frequency of walking for physical activity in older people. Whether frequency of walking reduces obesity prevalence is less clear.

We examined whether physical proximity to supermarkets or supermarket price was more strongly associated with obesity risk. Methods. The Seattle Obesity Study (SOS) collected and geocoded data on home addresses and food shopping destinations for a representative sample of adult residents of King County, Washington. Supermarkets were stratified into 3 price levels based on average cost of the market basket. Sociodemographic and health data were obtained from a telephone survey. Modified Poisson regression was used to test the associations between obesity and supermarket variables. Results. Only 1 in 7 respondents reported shopping at the nearest supermarket. The risk of obesity was not associated with street network distances between home and the nearest supermarket or the supermarket that SOS participants reported as their primary food source. The type of supermarket, by price, was found to be inversely and significantly associated with obesity rates, even after adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, and proximity measures (adjusted relative risk = 0.34; 95% confidence interval = 0.19, 0.63) Conclusions. Improving physical access to supermarkets may be one strategy to deal with the obesity epidemic; improving economic access to healthy foods is another.

We explored new ways to identify food deserts. Methods. We estimated physical and economic access to supermarkets for 5 low-income groups in Seattle-King County, Washington. We used geographic information system data to measure physical access: service areas around each supermarket were delineated by ability to walk, bicycle, ride transit, or drive within 10 minutes. We assessed economic access by stratifying supermarkets into low, medium, and high cost. Combining income and access criteria generated multiple ways to estimate food deserts. Results. The 5 low-income group definitions yielded total vulnerable populations ranging from 4% to 33% of the county's population. Almost all of the vulnerable populations lived within a 10-minute drive or bus ride of a low-or medium-cost supermarket. Yet at most 34% of the vulnerable populations could walk to any supermarket, and as few as 3% could walk to a low-cost supermarket. Conclusions. The criteria used to define low-income status and access to supermarkets greatly affect estimates of populations living in food deserts. Measures of access to food must include travel duration and mode and supermarket food E.; Moudon, Anne Vernez; Kang, Journal of Public Health||2014||Journal Article||Objectives. We isolated physical activity attributable to transit use to examine issues of substitution between types of physical activity and potential confounding of transit-related walking with other walking. Methods. Physical activity and transit use data were collected in 2008 to 2009 from 693 Travel Assessment and Community study participants from King County, Washington, equipped with an accelerometer, a portable Global Positioning System, and a 7-day travel log. Physical activity was classified into transit-and non-transit-related walking and nonwalking time. Analyses compared physical activity by type between transit users and nonusers, between less and more frequent transit users, and between transit and nontransit days for transit users. Results. Transit users had more daily overall physical activity and more total walking than did nontransit users but did not differ on either non-transit-related walking or nonwalking physical activity. Most frequent transit users had more walking time than least frequent transit users. Higher physical activity levels for transit users were observed only on transit days, with 14.6 minutes (12.4 minutes when adjusted for demographics) of daily physical activity directly linked with transit use. Conclusions. Because transit use was directly related to higher physical activity, future research should examine whether substantive increases in transit access and use lead to more physical activity and related health improvements.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=95475825&site=ehost-live| |Access to Supermarkets and Fruit and Vegetable Consumption.||Aggarwal, Health||2014||Journal Article||Objectives. We examined whether supermarket choice, conceptualized as a proxy for underlying personal factors, would better predict access to supermarkets and fruit and vegetable consumption than mere physical proximity. Methods. The Seattle Obesity Study geocoded respondents' home addresses and locations of their primary supermarkets. Primary supermarkets were stratified into low, medium, and high cost according to the market basket cost of 100 foods. Data on fruit and vegetable consumption were obtained during telephone surveys. Linear regressions examined associations between physical proximity to primary supermarkets, supermarket choice, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Descriptive analyses examined whether supermarket choice outweighed physical proximity among lower-income and vulnerable groups. Results. Only one third of the respondents shopped at their nearest supermarket for their primary food supply. Those who shopped at low-cost supermarkets were more likely to travel beyond their nearest supermarket. Fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with physical distance but, with supermarket choice, after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions. Mere physical distance may not be the most salient variable to reflect access to supermarkets, particularly among those who shop by car. Studies on food environments need to focus beyond neighborhood geographic boundaries to capture actual food shopping behaviors.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=95476007&site=ehost-live| |Understanding and Improving Arterial Roads to Support Public Journal of Public Health||2017||Journal Article||Arterials are types of roads designed to carry high volumes of motorized traffic. They are an integral part of transportation systems worldwide and exposure to them is ubiquitous, especially in urban areas. Arterials provide access to diverse commercial and cultural resources, which can positively influence community health by supporting social cohesion as well as economic and cultural opportunities. They can negatively influence health via safety issues, noise, air pollution, and lack of economic development. The aims of public health and transportation partially overlap; efforts to improve arterials can meet goals of both professions. Two trends in arterial design show promise. First, transportation professionals increasingly define the performance of arterials via metrics accounting for pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders, and nearby residents in addition to motor vehicle users. Second, applying traffic engineering and design can generate safety, air quality, and livability benefits, but we need evidence to support these interventions. We describe the importance of arterials (including exposures, health behaviors, effects on equity, and resulting health outcomes) and make the case For public health collaborations with the transportation sector.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=124124630&site=ehost-live| |Diffuse pollution abatement - a key component in the integrated effort towards sustainable urban basins||Novotny, V.; Hill, K.||WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY||2007||Journal Article||Water bodies are highly stressed by overdrafts of water for many purposes upstream and in the cities, and effluent domination and excessive point and diffuse pollution downstream. Pollution is also caused by the urban landscape which prefers impervious rather than porous surfaces; fast-conveyance infrastructure rather than softer approaches like ponds and vegetation; and stream channelization instead of natural stream courses, buffers and floodplains, and development in the floodplains. In future, the comprehensive and complex problems of urban pollution must be solved within the framework of the total hydrological cycle concept. This provides a new impetus to diffuse pollution management in urban areas. The best management practices that have been developed in the past could become key components of the new urban total hydrological cycle paradigm for solving the water shortage and pollution problems in an integrated manner, and making the urban systems hydrologically and ecologically sustainable. The paradigm will include landscape changes (less imperviousness, more green space used as buffers and groundwater recharge) as well application of the best management practices that provide water conservation, storage and reuse.||effluent dominated streams; integrated water management; composite sampling was carried out at the inlet and outlet of a street-side bioretention facility in Seattle, Washington, to assess its ability to reduce street runoff quantity and pollutants. Over 2.5 years, 48 to 74% of the incoming runoff was lost to infiltration and evaporation. Outlet pollutant concentrations were significantly lower than those at the inlet for nearly all monitored constituents. In terms of mass, the system retained most of the incoming pollutants. Besides soluble reactive phosphorus (the mass of which possibly increased), dissolved copper was the least effectively retained; at least 58% of dissolved copper (and potentially as much as 79%) was captured by the system. Motor oil was removed most effectively, with 92 to 96% of the incoming motor oil not leaving the system. The results indicate that bioretention systems can achieve a high level of runoff retention and treatment in real-weather conditions. Water Environ.

Objective: We used data extracted from electronic health records to construct a large retrospective cohort of patients. This cohort will be used to explore both the impact of moving between environments and the long-term impact of changing neighborhood environments. Methods: We identified members with at least 12 months of Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) membership and at least one weight measurement in their records during a period between January 2005 and April 2017 in which they lived in King County, Washington. Information on member demographics, address history, diagnoses, and clinical visits data (including weight) was extracted. This paper describes the characteristics of the adult (aged 18-89 years) cohort constructed from these data. Results: We identified 229,755 adults representing nearly 1.2 million person-years of follow-up. The mean age at baseline was 45 years, and 58.0% (133,326/229,755) were female. Nearly one-fourth of people (55,150/229,755) moved within King County at least once during the follow-up, representing 84,698 total moves. Members tended to move to new neighborhoods matching their origin neighborhoods on residential density and property values. Conclusions: Data were available in the KPWA database to construct a very large cohort based in King County, Washington. Future analyses will directly examine associations between neighborhood conditions and longitudinal changes in body weight and diabetes as well as other health conditions.||RESIDENTIAL |A SET PAIR ANALYSIS MODEL FOR SUITABILITY EVALUATION OF HUMAN SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT.||Xiang, Wei-Qi; Yang, Xiao-Hua; Li, Yu-Qi||Thermal Science||2021||Journal Article||The human settlement environment is a dynamic subsystem where people live and produce in the social system.

DB contracts are usually awarded on the basis of a multicriteria evaluation, with price as one of the most salient criteria. To ensure the project's success, an owner usually has to invest enough time and effort during scoping and early design to define a program, scope, and budget, ready for procurement and price generation. However, this process can become a burden for the owner and may lengthen the project development duration. As an alternative to the traditional DB, the progressive design-build (PDB) approach permits the selection of the DB team prior to defining the project program and/or budget. PDB has the advantage of maintaining a single point of accountability and allowing team selection based mainly on qualifications, with a limited consideration of price. Under PDB, the selected team works with the project stakeholders during the early design stage, while helping the owner balance scope and budget. However, the key to the effectiveness of PDB is its provision for the ongoing and complete involvement of the owner in the early design phase. Due to the differences between PDB and the other project delivery methods (e.g., traditional DB), project teams must carefully consider several factors to ensure its successful implementation. The research team conducted a case study of the University of Washington's pilot PDB project to complete the West Campus Utility Plant (WCUP). This paper carefully explores and summarizes the project's entire delivery process (e.g., planning, solicitation, design, and construction), its organizational structures, and the project performance outcomes. The lessons learned from the WCUP project will contribute to best practices for future PDB implementation.||progressive design build; project delivery method| |Implications transportation systems'' (ITS) in influencing metropolitan form and household behavior is reviewed. First, a portrait is drawn of the broad economic, social, and political forces that are expected to govern the evolution of urban settlement and transportation. Next, three ITS technologies are evaluated. Traveler information systems will logically increase the efficiency of driving and be a force for continued decentralization, although impacts will be modest Congestion pricing is contentious: although it clearly can make a difference in travel behavior, it is very unpopular, raises serious ethical concerns, and will not necessarily support the goals of a more compact city. Advanced public transit systems are designed to make transit more effective and attractive; although they may raise transit use, the shift is unlikely to be great enough to influence urban form and travel behavior. We therefore conclude that intelligent transportation systems are a significant extension of the basic logic of the automobile rather than a means to effect any fundamental transformation of the American city.||LAND-USE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; URBAN; CONGESTION; MOBILITY; JOURNEY; WORK| |Physical Activity and Built Environment in Residential Neighborhoods of Seoul and Seattle: An Empirical Study Based on Housewives' GPS Walking Data and Travel Diaries||Park, Sohyun; ARCHITECTURE ENGINEERING||2016||Journal Article||This paper is based on a collaborative pilot-study to ascertain the characteristic walking patterns and neighborhood features in residential areas of Seoul, Korea and Seattle, USA. As for sample sites, four case neighborhoods were selected: two from Seoul and two from in and outside of the Seattle-Shoreline areas. As for participants, thirty Korean housewives in Seoul and thirty Korean-American housewives in the Seattle area were selected respectively, and their socio-demographic characteristics, GPS records, and travel diary data for seven days were collected and analyzed. Considering the typical rainy seasons in the two cities, data collections, including the physical activity assessment by GPS devices, were carried out from May to June and from September to October in Seoul, and from July to October in Seattle during the year 2010. Noteworthy research findings include the following: Korean participants in Seoul walk about 2.6 km on average per day, while Korean-American participants in Seattle walk about 400m on average per day. In the case sites of Seoul, 75% of grocery shopping activities happen within the neighborhood by walking, while only 17% of those activities on foot happen in the case sites of Seattle. As for the most walking activity, about 70% of total walking amounts are related to utilitarian walking in Seoul sites, while 50% of total walking are related to recreational walking in Seattle sites. Recreational walking and utilitarian walking occur separately in Seattle sites, while the two walking types are often combined in Seoul sites, which also contribute to more walking amounts and farther walking distances in Seoul sites. This paper empirically confirms the widely held assumptions in part that residents in Seoul, a relatively high-density and high mixed-use city, walk more than those in Seattle, a relatively low-density and low mixed-use city. This paper also recognizes that in the case of both cities, more walking activities occur in the neighborhood built environment, where finely-grained street networks, small lots and blocks, various pedestrian destinations, public transit access, etc are provided in close connection. The amount and frequency of walking activities, as well as the fineness of neighborhood features, however, are remarkably different in the two cities, whose implications deserve in-depth exploration in further studies.||URBAN DESIGN||physical activity; neighborhood environment; objective measures; GPS walking data; international comparative study| |Risk of Pedestrian Collision Occurrence Case Control Study of Collision Locations on State Routes in King County and Seattle, Washington||Moudon, Anne Vernez; Article||This individual-level case control study analyzed the risk of occurrence of a pedestrian-motor vehicle collision at a given location on a state route in King County, Washington. With the full sample of collisions (1999-2004), binomial logit models estimated the odds of collision occurrence as related to the road and the neighborhood environments and adjusting for exposure. Separate models were run for SR-99, the principal transregional arterial with four-plus lanes (n = 826), and for all the other state routes (n = 1,602). The strongest significant correlates of the risk of collision occurrence were the presence of crosswalks with or without traffic signals, the facility's number of lanes, and the presence of nearby retail uses. Also positively significant were the number of traffic signals and the street-block size near the location and being located outside the city of Seattle. Exposure variables including road-level measures such as average daily traffic and posted speed and neighborhood-level measures such as the number of residential units and bus ridership were significant in at least one of the models. Employment density appeared to be an unreliable measure of exposure. Other pedestrian activity generators such as educational facilities were not significantly associated with the risk of collision occurrence. The strong significance of crosswalks, whether signalized or not, indicated that engineering approaches to safety should likely be complemented by education- and enforcement-based measures. Similarly, facilities in areas with concentrations of retail should become the targets of future safety programs.||LAND-USE; WALKING; SAFETY| |Intermodal Transfer Between Bicycles and Haixiao; Shen, Qing; Xue, Song||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2010||Journal Article||Large cities in China are building rail transit systems as part of a key strategy to address their pressing urban transportation problems. Because the high construction cost of subways and light rail limits the network density of rail transit, urban transport planners must seek effective intermodal connections between rail and other modes. This research examines the challenges and opportunities for improving the bicycle rail connection by using Shanghai as a case study. On the basis of two questionnaire surveys of rail transit riders, the research analyzes the existing mode shares of rail station access and egress trips, the underlying mechanisms for choosing among alternative modes, and the comparative advantages of the bicycle for trips that have certain distance and location characteristics. Empirical results suggest that the potential for travel improvement for rail transit riders lies primarily in the collection and distribution phases. Results point to several promising approaches to improving the bicycle rail connection and utilizing the bicycle more fully as an efficient supplement mode for the rapidly expanding urban rail transportation in China. In addition, the work can be a useful reference for cities in other countries in which rail transit development is accompanied by the continued importance of bicycles in residents' travel.| |Impact of Gasoline Prices on Transit Ridership in Victor W.; Bae, C. -H. Christine||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2011||Journal Article||Gasoline prices in the United States have been extremely volatile in recent years and rose to record high levels during the summer of 2008. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average U.S. gasoline price for the year 2008 was $3.26 a gallon, which was the second highest yearly average in history when adjusted for inflation. Transportation agencies reported changes in travel behavior as a result of the price spike, with transit systems experiencing record ridership and state departments of transportation reporting reductions in traffic volumes. This study examined the impact of changing gasoline prices on transit ridership in Washington State by measuring the price elasticity of demand of ridership with respect to gasoline price. Ordinary least-squares regression was used to model transit ridership for transit agencies in 11 counties in Washington State during 2004 to 2008. The price of gasoline had a statistically significant effect on transit ridership for seven systems studied, with elasticities ranging from 0.09 to 0.47. A panel data model was estimated with data from all 11 agencies to measure the overall impact of gasoline prices on transit ridership in the state. The elasticity from the panel data model was 0.17. Results indicated that transit ridership increased as gasoline prices increased during the study period. The findings were consistent with those from previous studies on the topic.||TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; GAS PRICES; ELASTICITIES; DEMAND| |Evaluating the Impact of Service on Demand and Requirements||Rowe, Daniel H.; Bae, C. -H. Christine; Shen, Qing||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2011||Journal Article||Many jurisdictions in the United States typically set minimum parking requirements for residential multifamily developments based on old data that were collected in suburban settings with little transit availability. Such parking requirements applied to urban settings with adequate transit service often result in an oversupply of parking, which in turn creates a barrier to smart growth. Not only does the oversupply of parking encourage automobile use and reduce housing affordability, but it also increases development costs, consumes land and natural resources, and increases associated air and water pollution. This research examines the relationship of parking demand and transit service in First Hill Capitol Hill (FHCH) and Redmond, two urban centers in King County, Washington. An alternative method to collect parking demand data is explored. The results show a strong relationship between transit service and parking demand. The FHCH urban center, which abuts downtown Seattle, exhibited higher levels of transit service and lower parking demand. Parking demand in FHCH was observed to be 0.52 parking space per dwelling unit, which was about 50% less than parking demand observed in Redmond, a growing mixed-use suburban center, and 50% less than data reported by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. After a review of the parking policies of each urban center, opportunities to improve regulations including adjusting minimum parking requirements and allowing for reductions in required parking when developers implement solutions to reduce demand for parking were identified.| |Exposure of Bicyclists to Air Pollution in Seattle, Washington Hybrid Analysis Using Personal Monitoring and Land Use Regression||Hong, E-Sok Andy; Bae, C. -H. Christine||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2012||Journal Article||The increase in urban bicycling facilities, raises public health concerns for potential exposure of bicyclists to traffic emissions. For an assessment of bicyclists' exposure to local traffic emissions, a hybrid approach is presented; it combines personal monitoring and a land use regression (LUR) model. Black carbon, a proxy variable for traffic-related air pollution, was measured with an Aethalometer along the predesignated bicycle route in Seattle, Washington, for 10 days, during a.m. and p.m. peak hours (20 sampling campaigns). Descriptive statistics and three-dimensional pollution maps were used to explore temporal variations and to identify pollution hot spots. The LUR model was developed to quantify the influence of spatial covariates on black carbon concentrations along the designated route. The results indicated that the black carbon concentrations fluctuated throughout the sampling periods and showed statistically significant diurnal and monthly patterns. The hot spot analysis suggests that proximity to traffic and other physical environments have important impacts on bicyclists' exposure and demand further investigation on the localized effects of traffic emissions on exposure levels. The LUR model explains 46% of the variations in black carbon concentrations, and significant relationships are found with types of bicycle route facility, wind speed, length of truck routes, and transportation and utility land uses. This research is the first application of the LUR approach in quantifying bicyclists' exposure to air pollution in transport microenvironments. This study provides a rationale for encouraging municipalities to develop effective strategies to mitigate the health risks of exposure to local traffic emissions in complex urban bicycling Growth?||Zhao, Zhan; Zhao, Jinhua; Shen, Qing||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2013||Journal Article||On the basis of four comprehensive transportation surveys in Shanghai, China, this study examined the latest trends in Shanghai's travel demand; investigated their social, economic, and spatial drivers; and compared the pace of travel demand growth in three periods: 1980s to early 1990s, early 1990s to mid-2000s, and mid-2000s to the present. The demand growth was relatively slow in the first period and then sped up in the second before it returned to a slower pace in the third period. As for trip purpose, Shanghai's travel is much more diversified than previously, with an increasing share of noncommuting trips (from 28% in 1995 to 46% in 2009). Spatially, travel demand is dispersed from the central district to peripheral districts because of urban expansion and decentralization and from Puxi (west of the Huangpu River) to Pudong (east of the Huangpu River) as a result of significant economic development of the Pudong New Area. Both spatial diffusion and purpose diversification favor the convenience and flexibility of private motor vehicles. Driven by rapid motorization, vehicle travel is growing at a much faster pace than person travel. Overall, the annual growth rate for travel demand in Shanghai reached its peak in 2004 for both person trips and vehicle trips. In absolute numbers, person trip growth has peaked, but vehicle trip growth has not. In response to the growing demand, especially rapid motorization, the local government has made tremendous investments in road infrastructure and public transit, and it has attempted to manage demand through vehicle ownership control.||URBAN; IMPACTS; POLICY| |Quantifying the Impacts of Failures of Departments of Transportation Building Systems on Road System Users||Gatti, Umberto RECORD||2014||Journal Article||Because of the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008 and the subsequent economic downturn, funding for transportation agencies has been consistently reduced. This lack of funds prevents the building assets of transportation agencies from being efficiently maintained, so failures may occur that discontinue employees' operations and activities and affect transportation system users. Thus, to maximize the use of available funding, it is compelling to create innovative tools and techniques capable of estimating how potential failures can affect employees' activities and, eventually, transportation system users. Facility managers and decision makers could use such estimates to make decisions on maintenance of building assets that would minimize the risks of disruptions to employees and transportation system users. Among the capital assets of the Washington State Department of Transportation (DOT), transportation equipment fund (TEF) shops are crucial in ensuring timely and effective care and maintenance of the majority of state vehicles and equipment Therefore, any disruption of the operations of TEF shop facilities could significantly affect not only the Washington State DOT's vehicles and equipment maintenance but also the department's ability to fulfill its core mission. Given the importance of TEF shops, this exploratory case study investigates the failures that have occurred or are likely to occur in these facilities and employs discrete-event simulation to quantify the consequences of such failures on the shop activities and road users.||SIMULATION| |Use of Health Impact Assessment for Transportation Planning Importance of Transportation Agency Involvement in the Process||Dannenberg, Andrew L.; Ricklin, Anna; RECORD||2014||Journal Article||A health impact assessment (HIA) is a tool that can be used to inform transportation planners of the potential health consequences of their decisions. Although dozens of transportation-related HIAs have been completed in the United States, the characteristics of these HIAs and the interactions between public health professionals and transportation decision makers in these HIM have not been documented. A master list of completed HIAs was used to identify transportation-related HIAs. Seventy-three transportation-related HIAs conducted in 22 states between 2004 and 2013 were identified. The HIAs were conducted for projects such as road redevelopments, bridge replacements, and development of trails and public transit. Policies such as road pricing, transit service levels, speed limits, complete streets, and safe routes to schools were also assessed. Five HIAs in which substantial interactions between public health and transportation professionals took place during and after the HIA were examined in detail and included HIAs of the road pricing policy in San Francisco, California; a bridge replacement in Seattle, Washington; new transit lines in Baltimore, Maryland, and Portland, Oregon; and the BeltLine transit, trails, and parks project in Atlanta, Georgia. Recommendations from the HIAs led to changes in decisions in some cases and helped to raise awareness of health issues by transportation decision makers in all cases. HIAs are now used for many topics in transportation. The range of involvement of transportation decision makers in the conduct of HIAs varies. These case studies may serve as models for the conduct of future transportation-related HIAs, because the involvement of transportation agencies may increase the likelihood that an HIA will influence subsequent decisions.||POLICY; INEQUALITIES; BENEFITS; JUSTICE; OREGON| |Measuring Pedestrian Debmalya||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2016||Journal Article||Traffic-related air pollution is dangerous to human health. Although transportation and land use planning policies often focus on making walking more attractive, there is a lack of research on pedestrian exposure to air pollution levels. This research focused on pedestrian exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM-2.5) in the International District (ID) adjacent to downtown Seattle, Washington. Several types of equipment were used: (a) a portable nephelometer (Radiance Research M903) mounted on a backpack (arranged by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency); (b) an AirCasting mobile application (by Habitmap) in a cell phone to record the researcher's location and exposure levels while walking; and (c) a GoPro Hero camera to record visual images of the surrounding built environment, traffic volume, and other activities. The field data were collected three times a day (morning, midday, and evening) for one week in winter (December 31, 2014-January 9, 2015) and one week in spring (March 21-30, 2015) on selected routes in the ID. The study found seasonal and time-of-day variability of exposure levels: there were higher PM-2.5 concentration levels during the winter (57.77 mu g/m(3)) than in the spring (6.99 mu g/m(3)), and higher levels in the morning (25 mu g/m(3)) than in the evening (17 mu g/m(3)). Also, the average PM-2.5 levels of ID data were slightly higher (20.7 mu g/m(3)) than those at the nearest U.S. Environmental Protection Agency monitoring station (19.0 mu g/m(3)). The researchers concluded that the key contributors of pedestrian exposure to air pollution are traffic, construction activities, and smokers on sidewalks.||PARTICULATE Feiyang; Mansury, Yuri S.||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2016||Journal Article||Although developed only in the past 20 years, Chinese high-speed rail (HSR) has overtaken many of its forerunners in its unprecedented scale. However, such a scale raises questions about its implications for regional economic development. Previous studies have discussed the impact of HSR at the regional and city levels, but few have addressed its impact on the individual level, which is crucial for understanding the distribution of the impact. To fill the gap, this study focused on the economic impact of recent HSR development between 2009 and 2012 on Chinese household income and discussed its significance, magnitude, and distribution. The survey data from the China Family Panel Survey were used and a difference-in-differences approach was implemented. Two key explanatory variables, weighted average travel time and probability of living proximate to HSR stations, were included in the models to examine the direct and spillover impacts of HSR. The study shows that these impacts both contribute to the HSR impact but affect urban and rural regions and production sectors differently. In particular, the spillover effect or the agglomeration effect contributes the most and favors more urbanized regions with stronger service sectors. As a consequence, although HSR plays a positive role in stimulating the regional economy, it may further widen the gap between developed regions and underdeveloped regions. From the analyses, it is concluded that HSR projects need more comprehensive studies of the full spectrum of its impact to ensure both economic growth and regional balance and coordination.| |Estimating Daily Bicycle Counts in Seattle, Washington, from Seasonal and Weather Factors||Schmiedeskamp, Peter; Zhao, Weiran||TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD||2016||Journal Article||This paper examines the relationship between several seasonal and weather factors and bicycle ridership from 2 years of automated bicycle counts at a location in Seattle, Washington. The authors fitted a negative binomial model and then estimated quantities of interest using counterfactual simulation. The findings confirm the significance of season (+), temperature (+), precipitation (), as well as holidays (-), day of the week (+ for Monday through Saturday, relative to Sunday), and an overall trend (+). This paper improves on prior work by demonstrating the use of the negative binomial instead of a Poisson model, which is appropriate given the potential for overdispersion, as observed in these data. In addition to validating the significance of factors identified from the literature, this paper contributes methodologically through its intuitive visualization of effect sizes to nonstatistical audiences. The authors believe that the combination of model type and counterfactual simulation and visualization reflects a reasonable compromise between model complexity and interpretability. Results such as these can aid policy makers and planners in understanding bicycle travel demand elasticities and in guiding interventions aimed at increasing rates of bicycling. The methods presented are fully reproducible and invite adaptation to other locations.| |Coping on the inside: Design for therapeutic incarceration interventions - A case study||Wagenfeld, Amy; Winterbottom, Daniel||WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION||2021||Journal Article||BACKGROUND: Adjusting to incarceration is traumatic. An under-utilized strategy understood to buffer and counteract the negative impacts of incarceration are nature interventions. OBJECTIVE: Outcomes of an interdisciplinary design studio course focused on developing masterplans for a women's prison in the Pacific Northwest (US) are presented. Course objectives included comprehension and application of therapeutic and culturally expressive design principles to increase the benefits of environmental design within a carceral setting; collaboration, developing a deeper, more representative understanding of how design processes can improve the lives of marginalized populations; and enhancing design skills, including at masterplan and schematic scale using an iterative process and reflection. METHODS: A landscape architect, occupational therapist, and architect teaching team, with support from architects and justice specialists facilitated an elective design studio course to redesign the Washington Corrections Center for Women campus. RESULTS: In a ten-week academic quarter, six student design teams created conceptual masterplans for therapeutic outdoor spaces at the Washington Corrections Center for Women. Students presented their plans to prison staff, current and ex-offenders, and architects and landscape architects in practice, and then received positive feedback. CONCLUSION: Despite well-documented need for and value of nature interventions to improve health and wellbeing for everyone regardless of circumstance or situation, the project awaits administrative approval to move forward to installation.||RECOVERY; EXPOSURE; HEALTH||Correctional institutions; design studio| |The Benefits and Limits of Urban Tree Planting for Environmental and Human Health||Pataki, Diane E.; EVOLUTION||2021||Journal Article||Many of the world's major cities have implemented tree planting programs based on assumed environmental and social benefits of urban forests. Recent studies have increasingly tested these assumptions and provide empirical evidence for the contributions of tree planting programs, as well as their feasibility and limits, for solving or mitigating urban environmental and social issues. We propose that current evidence supports local cooling, stormwater absorption, and health benefits of urban trees for local residents. However, the potential for urban trees to appreciably mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution over a wide array of sites and environmental conditions is limited. Consequently, urban trees appear to be more promising for climate and pollution adaptation strategies than mitigation strategies. In large part, this is due to space constraints limiting the extent of urban tree canopies relative to the current magnitude of emissions. The most promising environmental and health impacts of urban trees are those that can be realized with well-stewarded tree planting and localized design interventions at site to municipal scales. Tree planting at these scales has documented benefits on local climate and health, which can be maximized through targeted site design followed by monitoring, adaptive management, and studies of long-term eco-evolutionary dynamics.||OUTDOOR THERMAL COMFORT; |Cross Sectional Association Spatially Walking Bouts and Neighborhood Walkability||Hwang, Liang-Dar; Hurvitz, Philip M.; Duncan, Glen E.||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH||2016||Journal Article||Walking is the most popular choice of aerobic physical activity to improve health among U.S. adults. Physical characteristics of the home neighborhood can facilitate or hinder walking. The purpose of this study was to quantify neighborhood walking, using objective methods and to examine the association between counts of walking bouts in the home neighborhood and neighborhood walkability. This was a cross-sectional study of 106 adults who wore accelerometers and GPS devices for two weeks. Walking was quantified within 1, 2, and 3 km Euclidean (straight-line) and network buffers around the geocoded home location. Walkability was estimated using a commercially available index. Walking bout counts increased with buffer size and were associated with walkability, regardless of buffer type or size (p < 0.001). Quantification of walking bouts within (and outside) of pre-defined neighborhood buffers of different sizes and types allowed for the specification of walking locations to better describe and elucidate walking behaviors. These data support the concept that neighborhood characteristics can influence walking among the Immediate Aftermath of Shaking: Earthquakes in Christchurch and Wellington, New Zealand, and Hitachi, Japan||Jon, Ihnji; Lindell, Michael K.; Prater, Carla S.; David Becker, Julia Emily||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH||2016||Journal Article||This study examines people's response actions in the first 30 min after shaking stopped following earthquakes in Christchurch and Wellington, New Zealand, and Hitachi, Japan. Data collected from 257 respondents in Christchurch, 332 respondents in Hitachi, and 204 respondents in Wellington revealed notable similarities in some response actions immediately after the shaking stopped. In all four events, people were most likely to contact family members and seek additional information about the situation. However, there were notable differences among events in the frequency of resuming previous activities. Actions taken in the first 30 mins were weakly related to: demographic variables, earthquake experience, contextual variables, and actions taken during the shaking, but were significantly related to perceived shaking intensity, risk perception and affective responses to the shaking, and damage/infrastructure disruption. These results have important implications for future research and practice because they identify promising avenues for emergency managers to communicate seismic risks and appropriate responses to risk area populations.||ADJUSTMENT; HAZARD; MODEL||earthquakes; post-impact response actions; risk perception| Coworkers' Safety Violations on an Individual Worker: A Social Contagion Effect within the Construction Crew||Liang, Huakang; Lin, Ken-Yu; Zhang, Shoujian; Su, Yikun||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH||2018||Journal Article||This research developed and tested a model of the social contagion effect of coworkers' safety violations on individual workers within construction crews. Both situational and routine safety violations were considered in this model. Empirical data were collected from 345 construction workers in China using a detailed questionnaire. The results showed that both types of safety violations made by coworkers were significantly related to individuals' perceived social support and production pressure. Individuals' attitudinal ambivalence toward safety compliance mediated the relationships between perceived social support and production pressure and both types of individuals' safety violations. However, safety motivation only mediated the effects of perceived social support and production pressure on individuals' situational safety violations. Further, this research supported the differences between situational and routine safety violations. Specifically, we found that individuals were more likely to imitate coworkers' routine safety violations than their situational safety violations. Coworkers' situational safety violations had an indirect effect on individuals' situational safety violations mainly through perceived social support and safety motivation. By contrast, coworkers' routine safety violations had an indirect effect on individuals' routine safety violations mainly through perceived production pressure and attitudinal ambivalence. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications, research limitations, and future directions were discussed.||HEALTH-CARE SETTINGS; learning; social information processing| |Physical and Mental Health Impacts of Household Gardens in an Urban Slum in Lima, Peru||Korn, Abigail; Bolton, Susan M.; Spencer, Benjamin; Alarcon, Jorge A.; Andrews, Leann; Voss, Joachim G.||INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH||2018||Journal Article||Rural poverty and lack of access to education has led to urban migration and fed the constant growth of urban slums in Lima, Peru. Inhabitants of these informal settlements lack land rights and access to a public water supply, resulting in poor sanitation, an inability to grow food, and suboptimal health outcomes. A repeated measures longitudinal pilot study utilizing participatory design methods was conducted in Lima between September 2013 and September 2014 to determine the feasibility of implementing household gardens and the subsequent impact of increased green space on well-being. Anthropometric data and a composite of five validated mental health surveys were collected at the baseline, 6-months, and 12-months after garden construction. Significant increases from the baseline in all domains of quality of life, including: physical (p < 0.01), psychological (p = 0.05), social (p = 0.02), environmental (p = 0.02), and overall social capital (p < 0.01) were identified 12 months after garden construction. Life-threatening experiences decreased significantly compared to the baseline (p = 0.02). There were no significant changes in parent or partner empathy (p = 0.21), BMI (p = 0.95), waist circumference (p = 0.18), or blood pressure (p = 0.66) at 6 or 12 months. Improved access to green space in the form of a household garden can significantly improve mental health in an urban slum setting.||OF-LIFE ASSESSMENT; social capital| |Understanding the Social Contagion Effect of Safety Violations within a Construction Crew: A Hybrid Approach Using System Dynamics and Agent-Based Modeling||Liang, Huakang; Lin, Ken-Yu; Zhang, Shoujian||International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health||2018||Journal Article||Previous research has recognized the importance of eliminating safety violations in the context of a social group. However, the social contagion effect of safety violations within a construction crew has not been sufficiently understood. To address this deficiency, this research aims to develop a hybrid simulation approach to look into the cognitive, social, and organizational aspects that can determine the social contagion effect of safety violations within a construction crew. The hybrid approach integrates System Dynamics (SD) and Agent-based Modeling (ABM) to better represent the real world. Our findings show that different interventions should be employed for different work environments. Specifically, social interactions play a critical role at the modest hazard levels because workers in this situation may encounter more ambiguity or uncertainty. Interventions related to decreasing the contagion probability and the safety-productivity tradeoff should be given priority. For the low hazard situation, highly intensive management strategies are required before the occurrence of injuries or accidents. In contrast, for the high hazard situation, highly intensive proactive safety strategies should be supplemented by other interventions (e.g., a high safety goal) to further control safety violations. Therefore, this research provides a practical framework to examine how specific accident prevention measures, which interact with workers or environmental characteristics (i.e., the hazard level), can influence the social contagion effect of safety violations.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/understanding-social-contagion-effect-safety/docview/2582827119/se-2| |A Time-Based Objective Measure of Exposure to the RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH||2019||Journal Article||Exposure to food environments has mainly been limited to counting food outlets near participants' homes. This study considers food environment exposures in time and space using global positioning systems (GPS) records and fast food restaurants (FFRs) as the environment of interest. Data came from 412 participants (median participant age of 45) in the Seattle Obesity Study II who completed a survey, wore GPS receivers, and filled out travel logs for seven days. FFR locations were obtained from Public Health Seattle King County and geocoded. Exposure was conceptualized as contact between stressors (FFRs) and receptors (participants' mobility records from GPS data) using four proximities: 21 m, 100 m, 500 m, and 1/2 mile. Measures included count of proximal FFRs, time duration in proximity to 1 FFR, and time duration in proximity to FFRs weighted by FFR counts. Self-reported exposures (FFR visits) were excluded from these measures. Logistic regressions tested associations between one or more reported FFR visits and the three exposure measures at the four proximities. Time spent in proximity to an FFR was associated with significantly higher odds of FFR visits at all proximities. Weighted duration also showed positive associations with FFR visits at 21-m and 100-m proximities. FFR counts were not associated with FFR visits. Duration of exposure helps measure the relationship between the food environment, mobility patterns, and health behaviors.

While both location types have been previously studied, comparing results is difficult given the different data and methods used to identify crash-risk locations. In this study, a systematic and replicable protocol was developed in GIS (Geographic Information System) to create a consistent spatial unit of analysis for use in pedestrian crash modelling. Four publicly accessible datasets were used to identify unique intersection and non-intersection locations: Roadway intersection points, roadway lanes, legal speed limits, and pedestrian crash records. Two algorithms were developed and tested using five search radii (ranging from 20 to 100 m) to assess the protocol reliability. The algorithms, which were designed to identify crash-risk locations at intersection and non-intersection areas detected 87.2% of the pedestrian crash locations (r: 20 m). Agreement rates between algorithm results and the crash data were 94.1% for intersection and 98.0% for non-intersection locations, respectively. The buffer size of 20 m generally showed the highest performance in the analyses. The present protocol offered an efficient and reliable method to create spatial analysis units for pedestrian crash modeling. It provided researchers a cost-effective method to identify unique intersection and non-intersection locations.

The aim of this study is to produce a thorough understanding of how the cart condition, tire type, physical environment-related factors, and load interact to influence the ergonomics and productivity of cart handling. Eighteen roofing carts with different conditions, tires, and loads were tested by one subject on three laboratory tracks: one L-shaped, one with ramps within constrained spaces, and one with obstacles within constrained spaces. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to quantify the main and interaction effects of the factors of interest on the cart operations. The research findings confirm that using aged carts increases the injury risk by as much as 30.5% and decreases productivity by 35.4%. Our study also highlights the necessity of keeping an open space for cart operation; the travel distance from a cart to a ramp/obstacle should be greater than 61 cm. Finally, the results suggest the at-risk thresholds for different ramp slopes and obstacle heights, and the safe load capacities for the various working circumstances that are common on construction sites. The evidence created in this study can be translated into administrative controls for cart handling to reduce overexertion injuries and enhance performance.||overexertion in pulling and pushing; material handling; roof construction; ergonomic risk factors; administrative control| |Climate Change Impacts and Workforce Development Needs in Federal Region X: A Qualitative Study of Occupational Health and Safety Professionals' ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH||2021||Journal Article||Climate change is considered one of the top health threats in the United States. This research sought to (1) to understand the perceptions of occupational health and safety (OHS) professionals regarding the impacts of climate-related hazards on OHS in Region X, and (2) to explore the ideas of these OHS professionals regarding the content of future training programs that would better prepare OHS professionals to identify and mitigate climate-related hazards in Region X. Key informant (KI) interviews with 17 OHS professionals familiar with the climate-related hazards and impacts to OHS in Region X were coded and thematically analyzed. Climate hazards, social and economic impacts from climate-related hazards, and sector-specific worker and workplace impacts from climate-related hazards were described as having interacting relationships that influenced worker health and safety impacts. KIs further described how workplace controls could be used to mitigate OHS impacts of climate-related hazards, and how training of the OHS workforce could influence the ability to successfully implement such controls. Our findings suggest that OHS impacts are sector-specific, influenced by social and economic factors, and can be mitigated through workplace controls designed and implemented by a trained OHS workforce. The findings from this work should inform future educational and training programming and additional research and translation activities in the region, while our approach can inform other regions as they develop regionally specific OHS climate change training and programming.||HEAT-RELATED 2019 Conference on and Active Transportation: Research Needs and Opportunities||Berrigan, David; Eisenberg, Yochai; Rodriguez, Daniel A.||International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health||2021||Journal Article||Active transportation (AT) is widely viewed as an important target for increasing participation in aerobic physical activity and improving health, while simultaneously addressing pollution and climate change through reductions in motor vehicular emissions. In recent years, progress in increasing AT has stalled in some countries and, furthermore, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created new AT opportunities while also exposing the barriers and health inequities related to AT for some populations. This paper describes the results of the December 2019 Conference on Health and Active Transportation (CHAT) which brought together leaders from the transportation and health disciplines. Attendees charted a course for the future around three themes: Reflecting on Innovative Practices, Building Strategic Institutional Relationships, and Identifying Research Needs and Opportunities. This paper focuses on conclusions of the Research Needs and Opportunities theme. We present a conceptual model derived from the conference sessions that considers how economic and systems analysis, evaluation of emerging technologies and policies, efforts to address inclusivity, disparities and equity along with renewed attention to messaging and communication could contribute to overcoming barriers to development and use of AT infrastructure. Specific research gaps concerning these themes are presented. We further discuss the relevance of these themes considering the pandemic. Renewed efforts at research, dissemination and implementation are needed to achieve the potential health and environmental benefits of AT and to preserve positive changes associated with the pandemic while mitigating negative ones.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/2019-conference-on-health-active-transportation/docview/2602076973/se-2| |Population Mobility and the Transmission Risk of the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.||Luo, Minghai; Qin, Sixian; Tan, Bo; Cai, Qiangqiang||ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information||2021||Journal Article||At the beginning of 2020, a suddenly appearing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) rapidly spread around the world. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China occurred during the Spring Festival when a large number of migrants traveled between cities, which greatly increased the infection risk of COVID-19 across the country. Financially supported by the Wuhan government, and based on cellphone signaling data from Unicom (a mobile phone carrier) and Baidu location-based data, this paper analyzed the effects that city dwellers, non-commuters, commuters, and people seeking medical services had on the transmission risk of COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan. The paper also evaluated the effects of the city lockdown policy on the spread of the pandemic outside and inside Wuhan. The results show that although the daily business activities in the South China Seafood Wholesale Market and nearby commuters' travel behaviors concentrated in the Hankou area, a certain proportion of these people were distributed in the Wuchang and Hanyang areas. The areas with relatively high infection risks of COVID-19 were scattered across Wuhan during the early outbreak of the pandemic. The lockdown in Wuhan closed the passageways of external transport at the very beginning, largely decreasing migrant population and effectively preventing the spread of the pandemic to the outside. However, the Wuhan lockdown had little effect on preventing the spread of the pandemic within Wuhan at that time. During this period, a large amount of patients who went to hospitals for medical services were exposed to a high risk of cross-infection without precaution awareness. The pandemic kept dispersing in three towns until the improvement of the capacity of medical treatment, the management of closed communities, the national support to Wuhan, and the implementation of a series of emergency responses at the same time. The findings in this paper reveal the spatiotemporal features of the dispersal of infection risk of COVID-19 and the effects of the prevention and control measures during the early days of the pandemic. The findings were adopted by the Wuhan government to make corresponding policies and could also provide supports to the control of the pandemic in the other regions and countries.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/population-mobility-transmission-risk-covid-19/docview/2544848314/se-2| |Development of a Regional Lidar-Derived Above-Ground Biomass Model with Bayesian Model Averaging for Use in Ponderosa Pine and Mixed Conifer Forests in Arizona and New Mexico, USA||Tenneson, management practices in the southwestern US have left forests prone to high-severity, stand-replacement fires. Reducing the cost of forest-fire management and reintroducing fire to the landscape without negative impact depends on detailed knowledge of stand composition, in particular, above-ground biomass (AGB). Lidar-based modeling techniques provide opportunities to increase ability of managers to monitor AGB and other forest metrics at reduced cost. We developed a regional lidar-based statistical model to estimate AGB for Ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forest systems of the southwestern USA, using previously collected field data. Model selection was performed using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to reduce researcher bias, fully explore the model space, and avoid overfitting. The selected model includes measures of canopy height, canopy density, and height distribution. The model selected with BMA explains 71% of the variability in field-estimates of AGB, and the RMSE of the two independent validation data sets are 23.25 and 32.82 Mg/ha. The regional model is structured in accordance with previously described local models, and performs equivalently to these smaller scale models. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of lidar for developing cost-effective, robust regional AGB models for monitoring and planning adaptively at the landscape scale.||LASER SCANNER DATA; LANDSCAPE regression| |Using Urban Landscape Trajectories to Develop a Multi-Temporal Land Cover Database to Modeling.||Hepinstall-Cymerman, Jeffrey; Coe, Stefan; Alberti, Marina||Remote Sensing||2009||Journal Article||Urbanization and the resulting changes in land cover have myriad impacts on ecological systems. Monitoring these changes across large spatial extents and long time spans requires synoptic remotely sensed data with an appropriate temporal sequence. We developed a multi-temporal land cover dataset for a six-county area surrounding the Seattle, Washington State, USA, metropolitan region. Land cover maps for 1986, 1991, 1995, 1999, and 2002 were developed from Landsat TM images through a combination of spectral unmixing, image segmentation, multi-season imagery, and supervised classification approaches to differentiate an initial nine land cover classes. We then used ancillary GIS layers and temporal information to define trajectories of land cover change through multiple updating and backdating rules and refined our land cover classification for each date into 14 classes. We compared the accuracy of the initial approach with the landscape trajectory modifications and determined that the use of landscape trajectory rules increased our ability to differentiate several classes including bare soil (separated into cleared for development, agriculture, and clearcut forest) and three intensities of urban. Using the temporal dataset, we found that between 1986 and 2002, urban land cover increased from 8 to 18% of our study area, while lowland deciduous and mixed forests decreased from 21 to 14%, and grass and agriculture decreased from 11 to 8%. The intensity of urban land cover increased with 252 km(2) in Heavy Urban in 1986 increasing to 629 km(2) by 2002. The ecological systems that are present in this region were likely significantly altered by these changes in land cover. Our results suggest that multi-temporal (i.e., multiple years and multiple seasons within years) Landsat data are an economical means to quantify land cover and land cover change across large and highly heterogeneous urbanizing landscapes. Our data, and similar temporal land cover change products, have been used in ecological modeling of past, present, and likely future changes in ecological systems (e.g., avian biodiversity, water quality). Such data are important inputs for ecological modelers, policy makers, and urban planners to manage and plan for future landscape change.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=47732087&site=ehost-live| |Urban Systems Design Case Article||Meeting the needs of increasing environmental and systematic pressures in urban settlements requires the use of integrated and wholistic approaches. The Urban Systems Design (USD) Conceptual Framework joins the metric-based modeling of rationalized methods with human-driven goals to form a combined iterative design and analysis loop. The framework processes information for the fundamental element of cities-humans-to large-scale modeling and decision-making occurring in district- and ward-level planning. There is a need in the planning and design profession to better integrate these efforts at a greater scale to create smart communities that are inclusive and comprehensive in aspects from data management to energy and transportation networks. The purpose of this study is to examine the applicability of this method as it pertains to a model and design integrated approach. Northern Sumida Ward, located in Tokyo, exemplifies the contextualized needs of Tokyo, and Japan, while forming a coherent internal community. Focusing on methodology, our process explores the creation of typologies, metric-based analysis, and design-based approaches that are integrated into modeling. The results of the analyses provide initial evidence regarding the validity of the USD approach in modeling changes to complex systems at differing design scales, connecting various qualities of the built environment, building and urban forms, and diagnostic comparisons between baseline and change conditions. Because of some inconsistencies and the need for further evidence gathering, the methods and processes show that there is much work to be done to strengthen the model and to continue building a more productive field of USD. However, in this framework's continuing evolution, there is increasing evidence that combining the planning and design of urban systems creates a more resilient, economically viable, sustainable, and comfortable city.||urban planning; A Conceptual Framework for Planning Robert B.; CITIES||2019||Journal Article||Urban systems design arises from disparate current planning approaches (urban design, Planning Support Systems, and community engagement), compounded by the reemergence of rational planning methods from new technology (Internet of Things (IoT), metric based analysis, and big data). The proposed methods join social considerations (Human Well-Being), environmental needs (Sustainability), climate change and disaster mitigation (Resilience), and prosperity (Economics) as the four foundational pillars. Urban systems design integrates planning methodologies to systematically tackle urban challenges, using IoT and rational methods, while human beings form the core of all analysis and objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative three-phase development loop to contextualize, evaluate, plan and design scenarios for the specific needs of communities. An equal emphasis is placed on feedback loops through analysis and design, to achieve the end goal of building smart communities.||urban design; Planning Dylan||SOCIETIES||2021||Journal Article||Gentrification and subsequent displacement are common problems in cities, and result in the removal of poor communities and communities of color from urban areas as they move to cheaper locations in the metropolitan region.

We conclude with policy strategies that can be used to support such redevelopment in Seattle, with understanding that some may be broadly applicable to other cities.||black churches; community Korea||Jung, Meen Chel; Park, Jaewoo; Kim, Sunghwan||Sustainability||2019||Journal Article||Urban structures facilitate human activities and interactions but are also a main source of air pollutants; hence, investigating the relationship between urban structures and air pollution is crucial. The lack of an acceptable general model poses significant challenges to investigations on the underlying mechanisms, and this gap fuels our motivation to analyze the relationships between urban structures and the emissions of four air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and two types of particulate matter, in Korea. We first conduct exploratory data analysis to detect the global and local spatial dependencies of air pollutants and apply Bayesian spatial regression models to examine the spatial relationship between each air pollutant and urban structure covariates. In particular, we use population, commercial area, industrial area, park area, road length, total land surface, and gross regional domestic product per person as spatial covariates of interest. Except for park area and road length, most covariates have significant positive relationships with air pollutants ranging from 0 to 1, which indicates that urbanization does not result in a one-to-one negative influence on air pollution. Findings suggest that the government should consider the degree of urban structures and air pollutants by region to achieve sustainable development.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/spatial-relationships-between-urban-structures/docview/2574330764/se-2| |Transitions in Urban Waterfronts: Imagining, Anne; Yocom, Ken||Sustainability||2021||Journal Article||Urban waterfronts represent hybrid locations of ecological, economic, and social zones of transition and dispersal, spatially reified between land and water. Yet, through advancements in technology and the emergence of globally linked economies, the structure and function of urban waterfronts as economic and industrial drivers is becoming increasingly complex. As cities seek to redevelop their waterfronts in response to these changes, recent research and scholarship has focused on understanding the ecological, social, and economic benefits derived from urban waterfronts. This research reveals that their benefits are unevenly distributed among local and regional populations as sites of accumulated inequity and inaccessibility that are generative for only a relatively small percentage of the people living in a metropolitan area. Set within this paradoxical nexus, this paper frames a call to scientists, planners, academics, and waterfront activists to expand urban waterfront research from an indicator and benefits model to incorporate three conceptual tools for better understanding key dimensions of waterfront reclamation within the context of green infrastructure research: urban hybridity, functional performance and hierarchies of access. We explore these key dimensions in relation to the waterfront redevelopment of Tacoma, Washington, USA. By acknowledging the hybridity of urban waterfronts, we illustrate that their relative performance and accessibility require ongoing empirical study and practical intervention. Our theoretical explorations plot some of the potential areas of investigation for examining the structural and functional transitions of urban waterfronts as critical locations for green infrastructure development for the 21st century.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/transitions-urban-waterfronts-imagining/docview/2524971472/se-2| |Measuring the Urban Forms of Shanghai's City Center and Its New Districts: A Vernez||SUSTAINABILITY||2021||Journal Article||Rapid urban expansion has radically transformed the city centers and the new districts of Chinese cities. Both areas have undergone unique redevelopment and development over the past decades, generating unique urban forms worthy of study. To date, few studies have investigated development patterns and land use intensities at the neighborhood level. The present study aims to fill the gap and compare the densities of different types of developments and the spatial compositions of different commercial uses at the neighborhood level. We captured the attributes of their built environment that support instrumental activities of daily living of 710 neighborhoods centered on the public elementary schools of the entire Shanghai municipality using application programming interfaces provided in Baidu Map services. The 200 m neighborhood provided the best fit to capture the variations of the built environment. Overall, city center neighborhoods had significantly higher residential densities and housed more daily routine destinations than their counterparts in the new districts. Unexpectedly, however, the total length of streets was considerably smaller in city-center neighborhoods, likely reflecting the prominence of the wide multilane vehicular roads surrounding large center city redevelopment projects. The findings point to convergence between the city center's urban forms and that of the new A Web-based system for collecting process-tracing data in dynamic decision tasks.||Lindell, Michael K.; system that supports process-tracing experiments on coupled-system dynamic decision-making tasks.

The problems include severe traffic congestion reflected in very slow traffic speeds; the very low share of urban land devoted to roads; excessive reliance on cars and insufficient provision of the cheaper forms of public transport; major environmental problems with respect to air pollution and noise; the proliferation of agencies involved in transportation; and political obstacles in the way of effective policy innovation. Several policy options are assessed: banning private cars in the core city; investing in more railways; promoting TODs (transit-oriented developments); improving bus services; implementing demand restraints, especially on car travel; designing effective traffic management schemes; facilitating private-sector participation in transportation; and encouraging more decentralisation and suburbanisation. All these policy options are complementary palliatives, not panaceas. Whether sustainable transportation is possible in Bangkok remains problematic.||CITIES; WORLD| |Environmental impacts comparison between on-site Management||2013||Journal Article||In the on-site rebar delivery system, as the common method of rebar supply in the construction industry, reinforced steel bars are delivered in large batches from supplier's facilities through contractor's warehouse to the construction site. Rebars are then fabricated on-site and installed after assembly. In the new delivery system, called prefabrication Just-In-Time (prefab-JIT) system, the off-site cut and bend along with frequent rebar delivery to the site are applied in order to improve the process and increase its efficiency. The main objective of this paper is to assess and compare the environmental impacts resulting from the air emissions associated with the two rebar delivery systems in a case study construction project. Environmental impact categories of interest include global warming, acidification, eutrophication, and smog formation. A process-based cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment methodology is applied to perform the analysis. The results show that the prefab-JIT rebar delivery system causes less contribution to all mentioned environmental impact categories compared with a traditional on-site delivery system.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=91735074&site=ehost-live| |Computerized integrated project management system for a material pull strategy||Kim, Sang-Chul; Kim, Yong-Woo||JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT||2014||Journal Article||The purpose of this paper is to present a computerized integrated project management system and report results of a survey on the effectiveness of the system. The system consists of a scheduling system, material management system, labor/equipment system, and safety/quality control system. The backbone system is a scheduling system that adopts a production planning system and a project scheduling system. The lowest level in the scheduling system is a daily work management system, which is linked to each functional management system (i.e. material management system, labor/equipment system, and safety/quality control system). The paper focuses on the material management and scheduling systems to implement a material pull system to reduce material inventories on site. Details of material management and scheduling systems are discussed, and a sample application is presented to demonstrate the features of the proposed computer application system. The paper presents practitioners and researchers with a practical tool to integrate material management and scheduling systems for site personnel.||CONSTRUCTION||lean construction; material management system; integrated system; daily work management| |Configuration of earthwork equipment considering environmental impacts, cost and schedule.||Kim, Byung-Soo; Kim, Yong-Woo||Journal of Civil Engineering and Management||2016||Journal Article||Along with promotion of public awareness about sustainability, the concept of sustainability has gained in- creasing attention across all industries. The construction industry is one of the largest industries, and at the same time, among the largest polluters. Thus, the concept of sustainability has become increasingly important to construction firms and many contractors have started to reduce the environmental impacts of their construction activities. As part of the effort to achieve sustainability in construction sector, the study develops a method to select earth-moving equipment, based on their environmental impacts as well as duration and cost considerations. To this end, the study initially devel- ops a model for determining construction costs and duration as well as a model for determining monetary environmental impacts on earthwork construction. The study then uses an Improved Weight Decision Method (IWDM) to determine the weight of variables in order to find the best performed equipment configuration. The authors expect that the findings of the study will contribute to the research and practice in configuring earthwork equipment, taking into account associated environmental impacts as well as time and costs.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=111869037&site=ehost-live| |Triggering a Climate Change Dominated Anthropocene: Is model the coupled evolution of a civilization and its host planet through the era when energy harvesting by the civilization drives the planet into new and adverse climate states. In this way, we ask if triggering Anthropocenes of the kind humanity is experiencing might be a generic feature of planet-civilization evolution. This question has direct consequences for both the study of astrobiology and the sustainability of human civilization. Furthermore, if Anthropocenes prove fatal for some civilizations then they can be considered as one form of a Great Filter and are therefore relevant to discussions of the Fermi Paradox. In this study, we focus on the effects of energy harvesting via combustion and vary the planet's initial chemistry and orbital radius. We find that in this context, the most influential parameter dictating a civilization's fate is their host planet's climate sensitivity, which quantifies how global temperatures change as CO2 is added to the atmosphere. Furthermore, this is in itself a function of the planet's atmospheric CO2 level, so planets with low levels of CO2 will have high climate sensitivities and high probabilities of triggering climate change. Using simulations of the coupled nonlinear model combined with semi-analytic treatments, we find that most planets in our initial parameter space experience diminished growth due to climate effects, an event we call a climate-dominated Anthropocene.||HABITABLE PLANETS; COMPLEX LIFE; cities worldwide have begun the process of regenerating and developing their formerly industrial waterfronts into land uses that reflect a post-industrial economic vision of mixed urban uses supporting a diverse economy and wide range of infrastructure. These revitalization projects require distinct planning and management tactics to determine project-defined successes inclusive of economic, ecological, and human well-being perspectives. While empirically developed templates for economic and ecological measures exist, the multi-dimensionality and subjective nature of human well-being is more difficult to assess. Through an extensive review of indicator frameworks and expert interviews, our research proposes an organizational, yet adaptable, human well-being indicators framework for the management and development of urban waterfront revitalization projects. We analyze the framework through the lens of two waterfront projects in the Puget Sound region of the United States and identify several key factors necessary to developing project-specific human well-being indicator frameworks for urban waterfront revitalization projects. These factors include: initially specify goals and objectives of a given project, acknowledge contextual conditions including prospective land uses and projected users, identify the stage of development or management to use appropriate indicators for that stage, and develop and utilize data sources that are at a similar scale to the size of the project.||QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CITY management| |Exposure Path Perceptions and Protective Actions in Biological Water Contamination Emergencies||Lindell, Michael K.; INSIGHTS||2015||Journal Article||This study extends the Protective Action Decision Model, developed to address disaster warning responses in the context of natural hazards, to boil water advisories. The study examined 110 Boston residents' and 203 Texas students' expectations of getting sick through different exposure paths for contact with contaminated water. In addition, the study assessed respondents' actual implementation (for residents) or behavioral expectations (for students) of three different protective actions - bottled water, boiled water, and personally chlorinated water - as well as their demographic characteristics and previous experience with water contamination. The results indicate that people distinguish among the exposure paths, but the differences are small (one-third to one-half of the response scale). Nonetheless, the perceived risk from the exposure paths helps to explain why people are expected to consume (or actually consumed) bottled water rather than boiled or personally chlorinated water. Overall, these results indicate that local authorities should take care to communicate the relative risks of different exposure paths and should expect that people will respond to a boil water order primarily by consuming bottled water. Thus, they should make special efforts to increase supplies of bottled water in their communities during water contamination emergencies.||water contamination; exposure paths; risk perception; protective action| evaluation of environmental instruments||Moudon, AV; Lee, C||AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION||2003||Journal Article||Purpose. This paper reviews existing environmental audit instruments used to capture the walkability and bikability of environments. The review inventories and evaluates individual measures of environmental factors used in these instruments. It synthesizes the current state of knowledge in quantifying the built environment. The paper provides health promotion professionals an understanding of the essential aspects of environments influencing walking and bicycling for both recreational and transportation purposes. It serves as a basis to develop valid and efficient tools to create activity-friendly communities. Data Sources. Keyword searches identified journal articles from the computer-based, Academic Citation Databases, including the National Transportation Library, the Web of Science Citation Database, and MEDLINE. Governmental publications and conference proceedings were also searched. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. All instruments to audit physical environments have been included in this review, considering both recreation- and transportation-related walking and bicycling. Excluded are general methods devised to estimate walking and cycling trips, those used in empirical studies on land use and transportation, and research on walking inside buildings. Data Extraction Methods. Data have been extracted from each instrument using a template of key items developed for this review. The data were examined for quality assurance among three experienced researchers. Data Synthesis. A behavioral model of the built environment guides the synthesis according to three components: the origin and destination of the walk or bike trip, the characteristics of the road traveled, and the characteristics of the areas surrounding the trip's origin and destination, These components, combined with the characteristics of the instruments themselves, lead to a classification of the instruments into the four categories of inventory, route quality assessment, area quality assessment, and approaches to estimating latent demand for walking and bicycling. Furthermore, individual variables used in each instrument to measure the environment are grouped into four classes: spatiophysical, spatiobehavioral, spatiopsychosocial, and polity-based. Major Conclusions. Individually, existing instruments rely on selective classes of variables and therefore assess only parts of built environments that affect walking and bicycling. Most of the instruments and individual measures have not been rigorously tested because of a lack of available data on walking and bicycling and because of limited research budgets. Future instrument development will depend an the acquisition of empirical data on walking and bicycling, on inclusion of all three components of the behavioral model, and on consideration of all classes of variables identified.||PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; DETERMINANTS; PREFERENCES; EXERCISE||travel-related and recreation-related audit prevention Journal of Health Promotion||2007||Journal Article||Purpose. This study established a framework to audit environments supporting walking in neighborhoods. Design. Cross-sectional analysis using a telephone survey and 200 objective environmental variables. Setting. Urbanized King County, WA. Subjects. 608 randomly sampled adults. Measures. Walking measures constructed from survey questions, objective environmental measures taken from parcel-level databases in Geographic Information Systems. Analysis. Multinomial models estimated the odds of people engaging in moderate walking (< 149 min/wk) and in walking sufficiently to meet recommendations for health (150+ min/wk), relative to not walking; and in walking sufficiently, relative to walking moderately. A base model consisted of survey variables, and final models incorporated both survey and environmental variables. Results. Survey variables strongly associated with walking sufficiently to enhance health included household income, not having difficulty walking, using transit, perceiving social support for walking, walking outside of the neighborhood, and having a dog (p < .01). The models isolated 14 environmental variables associated with walking sufficiently (pseudo R-2 up to 0.46). Measures of distance to neighborhood destinations dominated the results: shorter distances to grocery stores/markets, restaurants, and retail stores, but longer distances to Offices or mixed-use buildings (p < .01 or .05). The density of the respondent's parcel was also strongly associated with walking sufficiently (p < .01). Conclusions. The study offered valid environmental measures of neighborhood walkability.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=24993425&site=ehost-live| |Multistate Evaluation of Safe Routes to School Programs.||Stewart, Vernez; Claybrooke, Charlotte||American Journal Article||Purpose. State Safe Routes to School (SRTS) programs provide competitive grants to local projects that support safe walking, bicycling, and other modes of active school travel (AST). This study assessed changes in rates of AST after implementation of SRTS projects at multiple sites across four states. Design. One-group pretest and posttest. Setting. Florida, Mississippi, Washington, and Wisconsin. Subjects. Convenience sample of 48 completed SRTS projects and 53 schools affected by a completed SRTS project. Intervention. State-funded SRTS project. Measures. AST was measured as the percentage of students walking, bicycling, or using any AST mode. SRTS project characteristics were measured at the project, school, and school neighborhood levels. Analysis. Paired-samples t-tests were used to assess changes in AST. Bivariate analysis was used to identify SRTS project characteristics associated with increases in AST. Data were analyzed separately at the project (n = 48) and school (n = 53) levels. Results. Statistically significant increases in AST were observed across projects in all four states. All AST modes increased from 12.9% to 17.6%; walking from 9.8% to 14.2%; and bicycling from 2.5% to 3.0%. Increases in rates of bicycling were negatively correlated with baseline rates of bicycling. Conclusion. State-funded SRTS projects are achieving one of the primary program goals of increasing rates of AST. They may be particularly effective at introducing bicycling to communities where it is rare. The evaluation framework introduced in this study can be used to continue tracking the effect of state SRTS programs as more projects are completed.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=93586686&site=ehost-live| |Site Resource Inventories - a Missing Link in city builds upon the principles of circular economy, which key concepts of reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover lead to a coupling of resources: products and by-products of one production process become the input of another one, often in local vicinity. However, sources, types and available quantities of underutilised resources in cities are currently not well documented. Therefore, there is a missing link in the information flow of the circular city between potential users and site-specific data. To close this gap, this study introduces the concept of a site resource inventory in conjunction with a new information model that can manage the data needed for advancing the circular city. A core taxonomy of terms is established as the foundation for the information model: the circular economy is defined as a network of circular economy entities which are regarded as black boxes and connected by their material and energy inputs and outputs. This study proposes a site resource inventory, which is a collection of infrastructural and building-specific parameters that assess the suitability of urban sites for a specific circular economy entity. An information model is developed to manage the data that allows the entities to effectively organise the allocation and use of resources within the circular city and its material and energy flows. The application of this information model was demonstrated by comparing the demand and availability of required alternative resources (e.g. greywater) at a hypothetical site comprising a commercial aquaponic facility (synergistic coupling of fish and vegetables production) and a residential building. For the implementation of the information model a proposal is made which uses the publicly available geodata infrastructure of OpenStreetMap and adopts its tag system to operationalise the integration of circular economy data by introducing new tags. A site resource inventory has the potential to bring together information needs and it is thus intended to support companies when making their business location decisions or to support local authorities in the planning process.||https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/site-resource-inventories-missing-link-circular/docview/2447466924/se-2||Digital mapping , Economics , By products , Vikramaditya||FUTURE ANTERIOR||2019||Journal Article| |The Geography of Diabetes by Census Tract in a Large Sample of Insured Adults in King County, Washington, 2005-2006||Drewnowski, Adam; Article||Introduction Identifying areas of high diabetes prevalence can have an impact on public health prevention and intervention programs. Local health practitioners and public health agencies lack small-area data on obesity and diabetes. Methods Clinical data from the Group Health Cooperative health care system were used to estimate diabetes prevalence among 59,767 adults by census tract. Area-based measures of socioeconomic status and the Modified Retail Food Environment Index were obtained at the census-tract level in King County, Washington. Spatial analyses and regression models were used to assess the relationship between census tract level diabetes and area-based socioeconomic status and food environment variables. The mediating effect of obesity on the geographic distribution of diabetes was also examined. Results In this population of insured adults, diabetes was concentrated in south and southeast King County, with smoothed diabetes prevalence ranging from 6.9% to 21.2%. In spatial regression models, home value and college education were more strongly associated with diabetes than was household income. For each 50% increase in median home value, diabetes prevalence was 1.2 percentage points lower. The Modified Retail Food Environment Index was not related to diabetes at the census-tract level. The observed associations between area-based socioeconomic status and diabetes were largely mediated by obesity (home value, 58%; education, 47%). Conclusion The observed geographic disparities in diabetes among insured adults by census tract point to the importance of area socioeconomic status. Small-area studies can help health professionals design community-based programs for diabetes prevention and control.||PREVALENCE; OBESITY; US; DISEASE| |BIM curriculum design in education: A systematic review||Abdirad, Hamid; Dossick, Carrie S.||Journal of Information Technology in Construction||2016||Journal Article||In the past several years, Building Information Modeling (BIM) adoption has grown significantly in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. In response to this trend, the industry and academia realized that BIM education in university curricula is an important requirement for satisfying educational demands of the industry, and a notable body of research has reported strategies AEC programs implemented to incorporate BIM in their curricula. However, no study has comprehensively reviewed and synthesized the research on sfrategies adopted by educators. To bridge this gap in the literature, this paper presents a systematic review of research on BIM curriculum design in AEC education. The authors report on the trends of research on BIM curriculum design (e.g. methods, timelines, and contexts) as well as a synthesis of implemented pedagogical strategies with detailed discussions on their implications and effectiveness across different studies and contexts. These strategies address a variety of important pedagogical issues such as enrolment of students, optional or required BIM use, important competencies and skills, tutoring methods, industry engagement, designing assignments, and assessment methods and criteria. This synthesis shows that designing pedagogical sfrategies for BIM education is complex and challenging, and AEC programs need to make trade-offs between advantages and disadvantages associated with these strategies. The results also highlight the need for more diverse research designs and settings to bridge the gaps identified in BIM curriculum research to date. Finally, the authors present a literature-based framework of BIM curriculum design sfrategies as well as a set of recommendations that can be used BIM educators and researchers as a guide for designing or assessing their BIM curricula in future research.| |Free: Accounting for the Costs of the Internet's Most Popular Price.||Hoofnagle, Chris Jay; Whittington, Jan||UCLA Law Review||2014||Journal Article||Offers of free services abound on the Internet. But the focus on the price rather than on the cost of free services has led consumers into a position of vulnerability. For example, even though internet users typically exchange personal information for the opportunity to use these purportedly free services, one court has found that users of free services are not consumers for purposes of California consumer protection law. This holding reflects the common misconception that the costs of free online transactions are negligible when in fact true costs may be quite significant. To elucidate the true costs of these allegedly free services, we apply a transaction cost economics (TCE) approach. Unlike orthodox economic theory, TCE provides a framework for analyzing exchanges in which the price of the product seems to be zero. Under a TCE analysis, we argue that information-intensive companies misuse the term free to promote products and services that involve numerous nonpecuniary costs. In so doing, firms generate contractual hazards for consumers, ignore consumer preferences for privacy, and mislead consumers by creating the impression that a given transaction will be free. While psychological research and behavioral economics may support an outright ban of free offers because of their biasing effects, TCE suggests reforming governance structures to place the business risks associated with free transactions more firmly in the hands of businesses. We suggest alterations to governance structures such as the Federal Trade Commission's Guide Concerning Use of the Word Free (FTC Guide) to curb the incentives of firms to raise transaction costs for consumers. The FTC Guide provides support for two of the consumer protection measures we propose: first, a requirement that free service providers clearly disclose that such providers seek users' personal information in exchange for those services, and, second, the establishment of a regular price before providers can market a service as free. We further argue that the recognition of users of free services as consumers for purposes of consumer protection law would better align incentives and ensure users access to legal redress against some of the most popular services on the Internet. Lastly, we suggest the adoption of alternative governance structures designed to reduce the cost of transacting by curbing the collection of personal information from consumers of free services and by enhancing the rights of consumers to govern the dispersal of personal information from free online services to third parties.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=103535976&site=ehost-live| |The impact of avatars, social norms and copresence on the collaboration effectiveness of AEC virtual teams||Anderson, Anne; Dossick, Carrie Sturts; Iorio, Technology in Construction||2017||Journal Article||A growing number of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms are outsourcing complex design and construction work to international vendors. Due to the significant geographic distances that can separate project team members in global design networks, much of this work is executed in virtual teams, defined as teams composed of geographically separated members who collaborate to accomplish organizational tasks mediated by technology. The challenges of working in geographically distributed networks have prompted the development of alternative, virtual workspaces. Questions remain on how these virtual workspaces support or hinder collaborative work. People are social beings that rely on body language and other non-verbal cues to communicate. What happens to team formation and collaborative effectiveness when non-verbal cues are mediated through avatar actions? In this paper, qualitative ethnographic data collected over four years from studies conducted in a 3D virtual world are used to examine collaboration effectiveness of global virtual engineering project teams. We found that avatar movement and position was effective at communicating nonverbal information, even when done so unintentionally. Avatar actions that map to established social norms in the physical world results in more efficient communication. Collaboration was also enhanced when gesture bubbles were used for backchannel communication and when text chat was used to avoid interrupting voice communication. We found collaboration was hindered when the learning curve was too steep for participants to adapt to tool use or avatar actions in the environment. These findings have important implications for the future of collaboration in virtual environments, particularly in the AEC industry where 3D models can be imported into the virtual environment and explored synchronously by a project team.| |Occupant Perceptions of an Indoor Thermal Environment in is currently being placed on the use of natural ventilation as a means for providing a safe and healthful indoor environment as part of green building programs. There has been an increasing interest in developing natural ventilation design strategies that can furnish adequate fresh air to the building interior and simultaneously control the indoor air quality effectively, while providing significant energy savings. In naturally ventilated spaces, furnishing a suitable air exchange rate between the building exterior and interior can create a thermally comfortable and healthy indoor environment. However, the air exchange must occur such that the indoor air quality of the building is not compromised and thermally comfortable conditions for the occupants can be maintained. Architecture Hall is a recently renovated, naturally ventilated building located on the University of Washington campus in Seattle. The natural ventilation in this building was evaluated using a variety of experimental techniques, which included measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, air exchange rates and air velocities. High CO2 concentrations are a good indicator of inadequate ventilation rates and poor air movement in a space. Hence, a number of standards and certification programs specify the use of outdoor air monitoring based on CO2 concentrations in an occupied space. Occupant surveys, based on a U.S. EPA study, were also administered to understand and analyse occupant perceptions about the indoor thermal environment and to identify the prevalence of any building related illness symptoms. The discussion in this paper will focus on the findings of the occupant surveys and how they relate to the measured CO2 levels, air exchange rates and air velocities in the naturally ventilated spaces. The natural ventilation function in Architecture Hall is largely climate driven. For the period of November through March particularly, outside temperatures are quite low and windows are seldom opened by the occupants, in spite of a large number of occupants being dissatisfied with the indoor environmental quality. Consequently, CO2 concentrations consistently exceed acceptable levels and very little air movement is recorded.

The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Optical Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) night-time light datasets provided consistent and valuable data sources for investigating urbanization processes. This study intends to empirically investigate the relationship between night-time lights, population, and urban development patterns. A novel protocol was developed to integrate heterogeneous datasets into a standardized unit of analysis. Multivariate mixed-effects models were applied to detect correlations within and between provinces in South Korea. To capture physical variations of urban development, four landscape metrics were used and tested in the analyses. Diminishing returns of night-time lights to population were found in all models. In single landscape metric models, all coefficients of landscape metrics were positively related to night-time lights. In combination models, the aggregation index (AI) was no longer statistically significant. The protocol developed in this study provides an effective way to create analytical units for integrating heterogeneous forms of data. Creating standardized units of analyses will make it possible for researchers to compare their results with other studies. Landscape metrics used in this study for capturing the composition and configuration of urban development patterns will enrich the discussion in the future.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=138941202&site=ehost-live| |Good job.'.||Wagner, Fritz||Planning||2006||Letter||A letter is presented in response to the article \"Let the Rebuilding Begin\", in the January 2006 issue of this periodical.||http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=19990575&site=ehost-live||LETTERS; HURRICANE Katrina, 2005| |Residential property values: relation between the size of food-based activity spaces and body THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA||1978||Meeting Abstract| |WALKING ROUTE SAFETY AND OBJECTIVELY D.

These overlapping fields have long attended to problems of conflicting values, aesthetics, recreation, and leisure. Many of the activities and products traditionally associated with design and planning are appropriate to tourism projects. Guidelines for enhancing this framework to treat directly the special problems of ecotourism include early investigation of sociological and ecological features, involvement of broker and local populations in the planning process, and extrasensitivity to issues of site selection, design, scale, and monitoring. In responding to the ecotourism challenge, landscape architects and urban planners will need to hone their abilities to work with multidisciplinary teams and to converse productively about Alberti, Marina||ANTHROPOCENE||2017||Review||We develop a classification scheme for the evolutionary state of planets based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of their coupled systems, including the presence of a biosphere and the possibility of what we call an agency-dominated biosphere (i.e. an energy-intensive technological species). The premise is that Earth's entry into the Anthropocene represents what might be, from an astrobiological perspective, a predictable planetary transition. We explore this problem from the perspective of the solar system and exoplanet studies. Our classification discriminates planets by the forms of free energy generation driven from stellar forcing. We then explore how timescales for global evolutionary processes on Earth might be synchronized with ecological transformations driven by increases in energy harvesting and its consequences ( which might have reached a turning point with global urbanization). Finally, we describe quantitatively the classification scheme based on the maintenance of chemical disequilibrium in the past and current Earth systems and on other worlds in the solar system. In this perspective, the beginning of the Anthropocene can be seen as the onset of the hybridization of the planet-a transitional stage from one class of planetary systems interaction to another. For Earth, this stage occurs as the effects of human civilization yield not just new evolutionary pressures, but new selected directions for novel planetary ecosystem functions and their capacity to generate disequilibrium and JJ||LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING||2006||Review||The effect of urbanization can be immense, yet our understanding is rudimentary. Here, we compile the most recent information on urban impacts on avian populations and communities. Compared to other vertebrates, birds are easily monitored by skilled observers and provide a mechanism to explore urban effects and responses to different urban designs. Taxonomically, bird communities in distinctly different habitats are most different in the least disturbed sites and the most similar in the most urbanized sites. Urbanization tends to select for omnivorous, granivorous, and cavity nesting species. Increased urbanization typically leads to an increase in avian biomass but a reduction in richness. Unlike most passerines, raptors may have home ranges that extend beyond the urban boundary and therefore do not need to meet all their ecological requirements within urban areas. Urban habitats are often of superior quality to raptors because there they are often free from persecution and have an adequate food supply. The processes that underlie the patterns of population and community level responses need more attention, but several areas of have been identified as being important. Birds respond to vegetation composition and structure, and urban areas that retain native vegetative characteristics retain more native species than those that do not. Avian fecundity in urban areas is a reflection of species-specific adaptability to urban resources, and to levels of nest predation and nest parasitism. Additionally, non-consumptive human activities that increase with urbanization are recognized as having negative impacts on avian populations and communities. Avian survivorship in urban areas is influenced by risk of collision with man-made objects, changes in the predator assemblage, food supply, and disease. Missing are thorough investigations in the regions of highest human population growth, e.g. Southeast Asia. Additionally, there is a paucity of information from regions of high avian diversity, e.g. tropical forests. Clearly, local knowledge and study is required before implementation of management policies to reduce urban impacts on bird communities. Hopefully, such policies will include long-term monitoring. Demographic parameters of fecundity and survivorship need to be examined in conjunction with measures of community diversity and density across the urban gradient to better understand the quality of different urban habitats, and the variation of quality among spatial patterns of urbanization within the native habitat matrix.

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters presented in this issue reinforce key aspects of planning: multi-scale, and multi-faceted, yet integrative in its intent, stressing the physical, yet inescapably social. At the same time, they identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Blanco and Alberti focus on the latest findings in climate change science and on planning for adaptation; they highlight the opportunities that planners have to provide leadership in this area. Forsyth, Krizek and Rodriguez take up the issue of non-motorised travel, a topic of increasing interest for urban designers, public health experts and transportation and energy planners. For Talen and Ellis, an emerging challenge is the need to plan for diverse and compact communities. What social factors, policies, programmes and planning processes facilitate compact and diverse communities? (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters in this issue display the different scales and fields of planning, including planning for: disaster recovery; climate change, especially opportunities for mitigation; shrinking cities in the First World; and rapidly urbanising informal and impoverished cities in the global South. At the same time, the chapters identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Olshansky and Chang highlight the increasing losses from catastrophic disasters, and address the need for disaster recovery planning. Wheeler, Randolph and London focus on climate change, and, noting the urgency of action now, their research agenda emphasises opportunities for planners to develop research and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz and Popper look at increasing economic and population trends in many First World cities that result in city 'shrinkage'. They present new opportunities for improving cities' green space networks and natural features, and for research. The trebling of urban population in African cities by 2050, in conditions of poverty and informality, is the major trend driving Parnell, Pietriese and Watson's chapter. They present an agenda for new planning theories and for supporting empirical research to address the actual conditions of African cities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This includes writings on sense of place, place attachment and place identity. A review of this literature suggests that while these concepts are broadly defined and discussed in theory, their application in research does not fully embrace all of the important dimensions they suggest. Empirical research, influenced by the notion of 'home', consequently focuses on residential settings, positive affect and a depoliticized view of individual experiences. This has limited our understanding of a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon. Recent literature demonstrates a need to better incorporate the full magnitude of human experiences into the current discourse on people-place relationships. Recent research that works toward this end is discussed here. Consequently, this paper focuses on several strengths in the literature that warrant further investigation: First, people's emotional relationships to places encompass a broad range of physical settings and emotions. Second, people's relationships to places are an ever-changing, dynamic phenomenon, and as such, they can be a conscious process in which people are active shapers of their lives. Third, people's emotional relationships to places exist within a larger socio-political milieu. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All M||ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN||1999||Review||In this paper I build on current research in urban and ecological simulation modeling to develop a conceptual framework for modeling the urban ecosystem. Although important progress has been made in various areas of urban modeling, operational urban models are still primitive in terms of their ability to represent ecological processes. On the other hand, environmental models designed to assess the ecological impact of an urban region are limited-in their ability to represent human systems. I present here a strategy to integrate these two lines of research into an urban ecological model (UEM), This model addresses the human dimension of:the Puget Sound regional integrated simulation model (PRISM)-a multidisciplinary initiative at the University of Washington aimed at developing a dynamic and integrated understanding of the environmental and human systems in the Puget Sound. UEM simulates the environmental pressures associated with human activities under alternative demographic, economic, policy, and environmental scenarios. The specific objectives of UEM are to: quantify the major sources of human-induced environmental stresses (such as land-cover changes: and nutrient discharges); determine the spatial and temporal variability of human stressors in relation to changes in the biophysical structure; relate the biophysical impacts of these stressors to the variability and spatial heterogeneity in land uses, human activities, and management practices; and predict the changes in stressors in relation to changes in human factors.||CLIMATE-CHANGE; systemic racism in urban environments||Schell, Christopher J.; Dyson, Karen; Fuentes, Lambert, Max R.||SCIENCE||2020||Review||Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological, physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities-specifically racism-and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.||NEW-YORK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; |What Urban Landscape and What of Siberian Cities and Citybuilding||Taylor, Maria||JOURNAL OF common ground: The importance of place attachment to community participation and planning||Manzo, LC; Perkins, DD||JOURNAL OF PLANNING LITERATURE||2006||Review||This article draws connections between the environmental and community psychology literature on place attachment and meaning with the theory, research, and practice of community participation and planning. Each area of inquiry has much to offer the other, yet few links have been made between them. Typically, literature on place attachment focuses on individual feelings and experiences and has not placed these bonds in the larger, sociopolitical context in which planners operate. Conversely, the community planning literature emphasizes participation and empowerment, but overlooks emotional connections to place. Yet these attachments can motivate cooperative efforts to improve one's community. Literature across disciplines is examined and synthesized to develop a framework for understanding the psychological dimensions of people's interactions with community. An ecological model is then proposed that integrates multiple environmental domains and analysis levels. This model can accommodate place attachments and meaning as well as social and political aspects of community| |Perspective: Something Old, Something New? Review of Wasting and Other Mortality in Asteroidea (Echinodermata)||Hewson, Ian; Sullivan, Brooke; A.||FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE||2019||Review||Asteroids (Echinodermata) experience mass mortality events that have the potential to cause dramatic shifts in ecosystem structure. Asteroid wasting describes a suite of body wall abnormalities that can ultimately result in animal mortality. Wasting in Northeast Pacific asteroids has gained considerable recent scientific attention due to its geographic extent, number of species affected, and effects on overall population density in some affected regions. However, asteroid wasting has been observed for over a century in other regions and species. Asteroids are subject to physical injury and adverse environmental conditions, which may result in very similar external manifestations to wasting, making identification of causative processes sometimes problematic. Here we review asteroid health abnormalities reported in years prior to the 2013-present Northeast Pacific wasting mass mortality, and report two additional geographically disparate wasting events that occurred concomitantly with the recent wasting health impact assessments informing agriculture, food, and nutrition policies, programs, and projects in the United States||Cowling, Krycia; OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT||2017||Review||Policies, programs, and projects related to agriculture, food, and nutrition can significantly affect public health. Health impact assessment (HIA) is one tool that can be used to improve awareness of the health effects of decisions outside the health sector, and increasing the use of HIA for agriculture, food, and nutrition decisions presents an opportunity to improve public health. This study identifies and reviews all HIAs completed in the United States on agriculture, food, and nutrition topics. Studies were identified from HIA databases, an Internet search, and expert consultation. Key characteristics were extracted from each study: type of decision assessed, location, level of jurisdiction, lead organization, methods of analysis, and recommendations. Twenty-five eligible HIAs that were conducted between 2007 and 2016 address topics such as regulations on land use for agriculture; food and beverage taxes; and developing grocery stores in food deserts. These HIAs have predominantly supported policy, as opposed to program or project, decisions. Four case studies are presented to illustrate in detail the HIA process and the mechanisms through which HIA findings affected policy decisions. Among other influences, these four HIAs affected the language of legislation and provided guidance for federal regulations. These examples demonstrate several findings: appropriate timing is critical for findings to have an influence; diverse stakeholder involvement generates support for recommendations; and the clear communication of feasible recommendations is highly important. There is substantial scope to increase the use of HIA in the agriculture, food, and nutrition sectors. Challenges include the paucity of monitoring and evaluation of HIAs' effects on health outcomes, and the limited funding available to conduct HIAs. Opportunities include integrating HIAs and community food assessments, and more widely sharing HIA findings to inform related decisions in different jurisdictions and to increase support for additional HIAs that address the "}
