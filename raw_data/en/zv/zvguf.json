People Who Are Immunocompromised Know how to protect yourself and what to do if you get sick Some people who are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system) are more likely to get sick with COVID-19 or be sick for a longer period. People can be immunocompromised either due to a medical condition or from receipt of immunosuppressive medications or treatments. Examples of medical conditions or treatments that may result in moderate to severe immunocompromise include but are not limited to: - Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies - Hematologic malignancies associated with poor responses to COVID-19 vaccines regardless of current treatment status (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute leukemia) - Receipt of solid-organ transplant or an islet transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy - Receipt of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppressive therapy) - Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g., common variable immunodeficiency disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Advanced or untreated HIV infection (people with HIV and CD4 cell counts less than 200/mm3, history of an AIDS-defining illness without immune reconstitution, or clinical manifestations of symptomatic HIV) - Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (i.e., 20 or more mg of prednisone or equivalent per day when administered for 2 or more weeks), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, transplant-related immunosuppressive drugs, cancer chemotherapeutic agents classified as severely immunosuppressive, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, and other biologic agents that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory Talk to your healthcare provider if you have another medical condition or are on medication that may not be reflected above. If you or someone you live or spend time with is immunocompromised, it is important to have a COVID-19 plan to protect yourself from infection and prepare for what to do if you get sick.

The people you live or spend time with can help protect you and themselves by staying up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines too. Since your immune response to COVID-19 vaccination may not be as strong as in people who are not immunocompromised, you may have different recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.
