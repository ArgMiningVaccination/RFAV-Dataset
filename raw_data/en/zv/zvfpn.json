Pathways of infection include horizontal and vertical transmission. Horizontal transmission occurs through blood transfusions, injections, tattoos, eyebrows tattoos, ear piercing, sharing toothbrushes or razors, and sexual intercourse. Vertical transmission refers to the transmission of hepatitis B virus from mother to newborn before and after delivery, with 40 to 50 percent of cases in Taiwan. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine is an injectable inactivated vaccine. The vaccines currently used are manufactured by genetic engineering with high safety. The protective effect of 3 doses is at least 15 years. Currently, newborns in Taiwan are routinely required to be vaccinated. Vaccination suggestions Several years after hepatitis B vaccination, the antibody titer may be reduced to a point where serum antibodies cannot be detected. But according to research, the cellular immunity of most people has not disappeared. Therefore, it is suggested that one booster of hepatitis B vaccine should be added at one's own expense for those at high risk of hepatitis B infection, and a blood test should be given one month later. If the surface antibody is still negative (< 10 mIU/ml), the second and third doses of vaccine can be completed based on the \"0-1-6 months\" schedule. If the revaccination cannot produce antibodies, no further vaccination is needed but relevant preventive measures for hepatitis B should be taken, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) should be tracked regularly or anti-HBc should be tested to exclude low-titer carriers. For non-high-risk groups, it is suggested that they discuss with the doctor whether revaccination should be administered or not. Contraindications to vaccination Those who have a high fever, who have had a severe allergic reaction to previous vaccine or any of the components of the vaccine. Possible side effects and vaccine response after injection - After vaccination, please take a rest under observation for 30 minutes. If there is no discomfort, you can leave hospital. - There are few special reactions after inoculation. There may be redness, swelling and pain at the inoculation site, with occasional fever and tiredness, which usually disappear within 1-2 days. Reminders - Please pay attention to the time of return visit for complete vaccination. - Hepatitis B vaccine: 1 dose or 3 doses according to the doctor's evaluation. Dose 2: One month after the first dose. Dose 3: 6 months after the first dose. - After vaccination, please drink more water and get plenty of rest to reduce discomfort. If you have any questions, please return to the hospital. "}
