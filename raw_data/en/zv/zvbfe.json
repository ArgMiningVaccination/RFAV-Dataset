When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public health care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for recent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in particular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, i f unavailable then report date) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,147,772 for BC overall) and for ye ar 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2021 estimates (n= 5,19 4,137 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: Health Authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data , PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Moni toring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on February 21, 2022 , laboratory data on February 18, 2022 , PIR vaccine coverage date on February 18, 2022, and PCMS hospitalization data on February 21, 2022 .

Due to changes in testing strategies in BC, case counts in this report likely underestimate the true number of COVID -19 cases in BC. This underestimation has increased compared to the period prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant in BC. The provincial i ncidence by episode date decreased from 175 per 100K (9 ,214 cases) in week 5 to 124 per 100K (6,470 cases ) in week 6. Incidence by Health Authority decreased from week 5 to week 6: Fraser Health incidence decr eased from 120 to 80 per 100K Interior Health incidenc e decreased from 354 to 255 per 100K Vancouver Island Hea lth incidence decreased from 152 to 121 per 100K Northern Health incid ence decreased from 426 to 303 per 100K Vancouver Coastal Health incide nce decreased from 98 to 68 per 100K Testing of MSP -funded specimens decreased from the p eak of ~88,900 in week 51 to ~23 ,600 in week 6 . The positivity of MSP -funded specimens decreased from 33.6% in week 5 to 29.6% in week 6. The per capita testing rates decreased in all HAs from week 5 to week 6 . Testing rates decreased or stabilized in all age groups fro m week 5 to week 6 . Age-specific inciden ce rates decreased across all age groups from week 5 to week 6. Incidence rate decreased the most in the 30 -39 and 40 -49 age groups . The number of hospital admissions decreased from 687 in week 5 to 423 in week 6. In week 6, 60-79 year -olds had the highest number of hospital admissions (142 hospitalizations). The weekly number of deaths decreased from 76 in week 5 to 49 in week 6. Those aged 80+ accounted for the highest number of deaths in week 6 (30 deaths). In week 6, 7 new outbreaks were declared , based on earliest case onset date . 13 of the 49 deaths (27%) reported in week 6 were associated with care facility outbreaks. BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 6 Page 2 of 10 A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Due to changes in testing strategies in BC, case counts in this report likely underestimate the true number of COVID -19 cases in BC. This underestimation has increased compared to the period prior to the emergence of the Omi cron variant in BC. Up to week 6 , there have been 340,952 cases for a cumulative incidence of 6,548 per 100K ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ). The provincial incidence by episode date was 124 per 100K (6,470 cases) in week 6 , which has decreased from the most recent peak of 407 per 100K in week 52. Incidence by episode date may increase as data become more complete in recent weeks. As shown in Figure 2 , incidence has decreased in all HAs from week 5 to week 6 . From week 5 to week 6, incidence rates decreased the most in Northern Health (NH) and Interior Health (IH) from 426 per 100K to 303 per 100K and from 354 per 100K to 255 per 100K, respectively. In week 6 , the incidence rate of 303 per 100K in NH was the highest in BC. Table 1.

Test rates and percent positive COVID -19 testing guidelines have been updated to include high -risk individuals with symptoms of COVID -19. As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 3 , testing of MSP -funded specimens has continued to decrease from the peak of ~88,900 in week 51 to ~ 23,600 in week 6 . The positivity of MSP -funded specimens d ecreased from 33.6% in week 5 to 29.6% in week 6 . As shown in Figure 4 , the per capita testing rates (Panel A) decreased in all HAs from week 5 to week 6. From week 5 to week 6, testing rates decreased the most in IH, from 892 per 100K to 731 per 100K. In week 6 , NH had the highest testing rate at 954 per 100K. Percent positivity (Panel B) for MSP -only specimens decreased in all HAs from week 5 to week 6 . Percent positivity in week 6 ranged from 27.9% in VCH to 38.8% in VIHA . Figure 3.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 5 , testing rates dec reased or stabilized in all age groups from week 5 to week 6 . Testing rates in week 6 was highest in those aged 80+ at 1,152 per 100K. As shown by the black dots in Figure 5 , the percent positivity decreased or stabiliz ed in all age groups from week 5 to week 6. The high est percent positivity in week 6 was in the 5-9 and 10 -14 year -olds at 43.9% and 46.3 %, respectively. Case distribution and weekly incidence by age group As shown in Figure 6, age-specific incide nce rates decreased across all age groups from week 5 to week 6 . From week 5 to week 6, i ncidence rate s decreased the most in the 30-39 and 40 -49 age groups from 252 per 100K to 170 per 100K and 230 per 100K to 151 per 100K, respectively .

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of hospital admissions decreased from 687 in week 5 to 423 in week 6. In week 6 , 60-79 year -olds had the highest number of hospital admissions ( 142 hospitalizations). Hospital data include admissions for people diagnosed with COVID -19 through hospital SARS -COV -2 screening practices, and will overestimate the number of people who are hospitalized specifically due to severe symptoms of COVID -19 infection. The weekly number of deaths decreased from 76 in week 5 to 49 in week 6 . Those aged 80+ accounted for the hi ghest number of deaths in week 6 (30 deaths) ( Table 2, Figure 8 ). Detailed information about outcomes by vacc ination status can be accessed at BCCDC COVID -19 Regional Surveillance Dashboard . Cumulatively, there have been 2 4 confirmed cases of Multi -system Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (M IS- C) in BC since January 1, 2020. There has been one new confirmed case of MIS -C since the last report. The median age of all cases is 9 years old (range from 1 to 16 years old). Table 2.

Care facility outbreaks As shown in Table 4 and Figure 9, 589 care facility (acute and long -term care setting) outbreaks were reported in total in BC to the end of week 6. In week 6, based on earliest case onset date , a total of 7 new outbreaks were declared in FH, IH, and VIHA . Since week 1 of 2022, t he number of new outbreaks have been declining and the majority have been in long -term care facilities. 13 of the 49 deaths (27%) reported in week 6 were associated with care facility outbreaks. The number of deaths may increase over time as data becomes m ore complete. Table 4.

Earliest dates of onset of outbreak cases are subject to change as investigations and data are updated. d. As of week 46, VCH and FH no longer declar e outbreaks with single staff cases unless there is evidence of transmission within the facility . G. Modeling Current Rt estimates for BC are considered unreliable due to recent and ongoing changes in the ascertainment of case counts, including capacity limitations of PCR testing and the use of rapid antigen tests . H. Wastewater surveillance The BCCDC and Metro Vancouver have been testing for SARS -CoV-2 in wastewater at five wastewater treatment plants (representing 50% of BC's population) since May 2020 , in order to assess whether COVID -19 virus is present and how it might be changing over time . To account for possible effects of wastewater volume, SARS -CoV-2 concentrations have been normalized by daily wastewater flow. As shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11 , viral signal from the wastewater surveillance correlates with COVID -19 case counts. BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 6 Page 9 of 10 Key m essages with results through to February 16: SARS -CoV-2 viral loads in VCH and FH wastewater continue to decline from their peak in early January, in all five wastewater treatment plants tested.
