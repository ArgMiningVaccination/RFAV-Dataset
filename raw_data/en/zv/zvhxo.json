Patients with depression are common users of complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, either as a replacement for, or adjunct to, their conventional treatments. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the effectiveness of acupuncture in major depressive disorder. Methods: A search of English (Medline, PsychINFO, Google Scholar, and CINAL), Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI) and Wanfang Database), and Korean databases was undertaken from 1980 to November 2018 for clinical trials using manual, electro, or laser acupuncture. Results: Twenty-nine studies including 2268 participants were eligible and included in the meta-analysis. Twenty-two trials were undertaken in China and seven outside of China. Acupuncture showed clinically significant reductions in the severity of depression compared to usual care (Hedges (g) = 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.63), sham acupuncture (g = 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.79), and as an adjunct to anti-depressant medication (g = 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07). A significant correlation between an increase in the number of acupuncture treatments delivered and reduction in the severity of depression (p = 0.015) was found. Limitations: The majority of the included trials were at a high risk of bias for performance blinding. The applicability of findings in Chinese populations to other populations is unclear, due to the use of a higher treatment frequency and number of treatments in China. The majority of trials did not report any post-trial follow-up and safety reporting was poor. Conclusions: Acupuncture may be a suitable adjunct to usual care and standard anti-depressant medication.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-07-31", "cleaned_text": "Acupuncture for Depression: A Systematic Most depressed patients are treated in primary care and do not require hospitalisation. In primary care, guidelines suggest depression is primarily managed with antidepressants [ [2](#B2-jcm-08-01140)]. A range of psychological interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapies, interpersonal therapy, psychotherapy, and counseling, are also recommended treatment options [ [3](#B3-jcm-08-01140)]. When patients fail to respond to a single modality, adjunctive or combined pharmacological and/or psychological treatments are recommended. However, around 30% may remain non responsive or partially responsive, even with augmentation [ [2](#B2-jcm-08-01140)]. [4](#B4-jcm-08-01140), [5](#B5-jcm-08-01140), [6](#B6-jcm-08-01140)], either as an adjunct or replacement [ [4](#B4-jcm-08-01140)] for conventional therapies. [7](#B7-jcm-08-01140)] and with provision either in hospital or in private practice in the United Kingdom [ [8](#B8-jcm-08-01140)]. Traditionally, acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points, called acupuncture points, on the body to achieve a therapeutic effect. Following insertion, needles can be stimulated by hand (called 'manual acupuncture'), or via the application of a small electrical current (called 'electro-acupuncture'). A modern alternative is laser acupuncture, a non-penetrative form of acupuncture that uses low-power laser light to stimulate acupuncture points. [9](#B9-jcm-08-01140)]. Results from animal experiments suggest a multitarget antidepressant effect of acupuncture, which may be related to amino acid metabolism and inflammatory pathways, especially the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway [ [10](#B10-jcm-08-01140)]. In addition, similar to antidepressant medications, acupuncture is capable of affecting the neurotransmitter levels of serotonin and kinase system [ [11](#B11-jcm-08-01140)]. [12](#B12-jcm-08-01140), [13](#B13-jcm-08-01140), [14](#B14-jcm-08-01140)]. Previous research has shown that changing the components of the acupuncture 'dose' appears to change the therapeutic outcomes in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) [ [15](#B15-jcm-08-01140)] and period pain [ [12](#B12-jcm-08-01140), [16](#B16-jcm-08-01140)], with functional MRI (fMRI) studies showing that differing doses modulate brain activity differently [ [17](#B17-jcm-08-01140)]. Our recent Cochrane review on acupuncture for the treatment of depression [ [18](#B18-jcm-08-01140)] showed some evidence of benefits but did not explore the contribution of different dose components on the clinical outcomes for depression, for example, the number and frequency of acupuncture sessions provided. 2. Methods 2.1. Search Strategy - English: Medline, PsychINFO, Google Scholar, and CINAL. - Chinese: China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI) and Wanfang Database. - Korean: the Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS), DBPIA, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Research Information Service System (RISS), Korea Med, Korean Medical Database (KM base), and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS). [18](#B18-jcm-08-01140)]. Both MESH and Non-MESH terms were included in this search. Papers that either had English full text, Korean full text, or Chinese full text available were eligible. Reference lists of full text papers were searched, and any relevant articles identified were screened. [Figure 1](#jcm-08-01140-f001)outlines the search process. 2.2. Eligibility Criteria [19](#B19-jcm-08-01140), [20](#B20-jcm-08-01140), [21](#B21-jcm-08-01140)], the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) [ [22](#B22-jcm-08-01140)], the Criteria for Classification and Diagnosis of Mental Diseases (CCMD-2 or CCMD-3) [ [23](#B23-jcm-08-01140), [24](#B24-jcm-08-01140)], the Clinical Interview Schedule\u2014Revised [ [25](#B25-jcm-08-01140)], or using the Beck Depression Inventory [ [26](#B26-jcm-08-01140)]. - Usual care: This varies depending on geographical location and patient preference and for many participants is likely to incorporate SSRI or SNRI classes of anti-depressant medication; - Sham acupuncture or placebo acupuncture, which could consist of any of the following: - Invasive acupuncture control: This includes the insertion of acupuncture needles into either 'non-acupuncture points', or acupuncture points that are assumed to be unrelated to the treatment of depression. Needles may be inserted superficially or to regular depths; - Acupuncture plus SSRI/SNRI medication: To reflect clinical practice in western countries, where clinical guidelines are unlikely to recommend acupuncture alone as an alternative to SSRI/SNRI medication or to recommend older tri-cyclic antidepressants (TCAs) [ [2](#B2-jcm-08-01140), [3](#B3-jcm-08-01140)], only trials comparing acupuncture as an adjunct to SSRI or SNRI medication were eligible. For clinical relevance, trials using medication that is no longer in use (such as Flupentixol/melitracen) were not eligible; - Psychological intervention, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, or counseling. 2.3. Data Extraction - - - Severity of depression at the end of the intervention; - - - Severity of depression at follow-up (short term, medium term, and long term); - - - Adverse events. [29](#B29-jcm-08-01140)]. [30](#B30-jcm-08-01140)]. When multiple scales were used for the severity of depression, if both clinician and participant reported scales were present, priority was given to clinician reported outcomes. 2.4. Risk of Bias 2.5. Acupuncture Quality [32](#B32-jcm-08-01140)] This recently developed tool is reliable and is recommended to be used in conjunction with the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) checklist [ [33](#B33-jcm-08-01140)]. The NICMAN consists of 11 items and is scored out of 23, with four main domains of appraisal: - (1) - Population Intervention Comparator Outcome measure (PICO) reporting, study design relevance, and paradigm based differential diagnosis (items 1-6); - (2) - Acupuncture point selections and locations, in reference to published literature (items 7 and 9); - (3) - Description of the needle dimensions, needling technique, and number of treatments (items 8 and 10); - (4) - Acupuncturist qualification and training (item 11). 2.6. Meta-Analysis [34](#B34-jcm-08-01140)], along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the estimated effect-size. For more details, please refer to our previous study [ [31](#B31-jcm-08-01140)]. 2.7. Subgroup Analysis - - - Comparison between different acupuncture subtypes (manual, electro-acupuncture, and laser acupuncture)*; - - - Needle retention time* (<20 min versus >20 min); - - - Fixed versus individualised acupuncture. 3. Results [Table 1](#jcm-08-01140-t001)outlines the characteristics of the included studies. 3.1. Design medication alone as the control. Twelve trials used an acupuncture control, with nine trials using sham acupuncture [63](#B63-jcm-08-01140)] using an invasive control. One trial [ [36](#B36-jcm-08-01140)] of acupuncture plus usual care had two control groups, one of counseling plus usual care and one usual care alone. 3.3. Country 3.4. Sample Sizes 3.5. Participant Criteria [41](#B41-jcm-08-01140)], and one trial used both the CCMD-3 and DSM-IV [ [61](#B61-jcm-08-01140)]. 3.6. Interventions 3.6.1. Type of Acupuncture 3.6.2. Frequency of Treatment [52](#B52-jcm-08-01140), [55](#B55-jcm-08-01140), [56](#B56-jcm-08-01140)], five trials used acupuncture treatment once a week on average [ [36](#B36-jcm-08-01140), [57](#B57-jcm-08-01140), [58](#B58-jcm-08-01140), [62](#B62-jcm-08-01140), [63](#B63-jcm-08-01140)]. The frequency of acupuncture treatment was unclear in two trials [ [54](#B54-jcm-08-01140), [59](#B59-jcm-08-01140)]. In English speaking countries, the median frequency of treatments was once per week, while in Chinese speaking countries, the median frequency was treatment every second day (3.5 treatments per week). The median frequency of treatments delivered in China was significantly greater (U = 1, p < 0.00061). 3.6.3. Total Number of Treatments [53](#B53-jcm-08-01140), [60](#B60-jcm-08-01140)] to 40 treatments [ [42](#B42-jcm-08-01140)], with a median of 18 treatments, in the included studies. The total number of acupuncture treatments was unclear in one trial [ [54](#B54-jcm-08-01140)]. All trials in English speaking countries delivered 12 treatments, with trials undertaken in Chinese speaking countries delivering a median of 24 treatments. The median number of treatments delivered in China was significantly greater (U = 14, p = 0.0006). 3.6.4. Duration 3.6.5. Treatment Protocol [61](#B61-jcm-08-01140)] to two points [ [35](#B35-jcm-08-01140), [52](#B52-jcm-08-01140)], with a median number of six points. The number of acupuncture points was not reported in one of the trials using fixed points [ [62](#B62-jcm-08-01140)]. 3.6.6. Needle Retention Times 3.6.7. NICMAN Scores 3.7. Outcome Measures [64](#B64-jcm-08-01140)], one trial [ [37](#B37-jcm-08-01140)] used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [ [26](#B26-jcm-08-01140)], and one trial [ [36](#B36-jcm-08-01140)] used the PHQ-9 [ [65](#B65-jcm-08-01140)]. Only two trials [ [36](#B36-jcm-08-01140), [61](#B61-jcm-08-01140)] collected data for post-treatment follow-up, all others collected data to the end of the intervention. Seven studies reported adverse events. Four studies reported adverse event counts only [ [52](#B52-jcm-08-01140), [59](#B59-jcm-08-01140), [60](#B60-jcm-08-01140), [66](#B66-jcm-08-01140)], two used the Asberg Side Effect Rating Scale (SERS) scale and one used the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) [ [38](#B38-jcm-08-01140)]. 3.8. Risk of Bias in Included Studies [Figure 2](#jcm-08-01140-f002)for a graphical summary of risk of bias assessments performed by review authors for the 29 included studies, based on the seven risk-of-bias domains. No trials were assessed as having a low risk-of-bias across all domains. Three trials were at low risk-of-bias for six domains [ [52](#B52-jcm-08-01140), [53](#B53-jcm-08-01140), [57](#B57-jcm-08-01140)] and four trials were at low Data 3.8.5. Selective Reporting 3.8.6. Other Potential Sources of Bias 3.9. Acupuncture versus Usual Care [36](#B36-jcm-08-01140)] compared acupuncture plus usual care to usual care alone. There was evidence of a moderate benefit in the severity of depression in the acupuncture group compared to usual care g = 0.41 (N = 1, n = 301, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63). 3.10. Acupuncture versus Sham [Figure 3](#jcm-08-01140-f003)) was moderate g = 0.55 (N = 12, n = 646, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.79, Q = 38.15, p < 0.001, I2 = 71.2). When comparing different types of acupuncture, both manual (g = 0.96, N = 7, n = 439, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.4, Q = 25.1, p < 0.001, I2 = 76.1) and laser (g = 0.90, N = 2, n = 63, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.4, Q = 235, p = 0.62, I2 = 0) showed large effect sizes, while electro-acupuncture did not show a significant benefit compared to sham (g = 0.20, N = 3, n = 144, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53, Q = 295, p = 0.863, I2 = 0). Only one study [ [61](#B61-jcm-08-01140)] contributed data for short term follow-up, so no meta-analysis was performed on follow-up data. 3.11. Acupuncture Plus SSRI/SNRI versus SSRI/SNRI Alone [Figure 4](#jcm-08-01140-f004)) was large g = 0.84 (N = 18, n = 1169, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07, Q = 87, I2 = 80.5). When comparing different types of acupuncture in combination with SSRI/SNRI medication, both manual (g = 1.1, N = 12, n = 865, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.49, Q = 74, I2 = 85) and electro-acupuncture (g = 0.85, N = 5, n = 264, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.17, Q = 5.9, I2 = 32.4) showed large effect sizes, while the single study using combined manual and electro-acupuncture showed no evidence of significant benefits (g = 0.02, N = 1, n = 40, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.65). 3.12. Acupuncture versus Psychological Intervention [36](#B36-jcm-08-01140)] compared acupuncture plus usual care to counseling plus usual care. There was no evidence of a significant difference in the severity of depression between groups (g = 0.12, N = 1, n = 453, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.32). 3.13. Adverse Events 3.14. Subgroup Analysis [Figure 5](#jcm-08-01140-f005)). A test for between group differences showed that trials from China had significantly greater reductions in the severity of depression compared to those undertaken outside of China (Q = 12, p < 0.001). [Figure 6](#jcm-08-01140-f006)) found that a greater total number of treatments was related to a greater reduction in the severity of depression (N = 29, n = 2268, B = 0.025, SE = 0.010, Z = 2.44, p = 0.015). Meta-regression showed a trend towards a greater reduction in the severity of depression with more frequent treatment (N = 29, n = 2268, B = 0.095, SE = 0.050, Z = 1.88, p = 0.061). 3.15. Publication Bias [Supplementary Figure S1](#app1-jcm-08-01140)shows the funnel plot for publication bias. A Duval and Tweedie trim and fill analysis did not result in any studies to the left of the mean being trimmed. 4. Discussion 4.1. Principal Findings 4.2. Strengths and Limitations [18](#B18-jcm-08-01140)], within which databases were searched only up to June 2016, the present review differs in several important aspects. This review includes studies published until December 2018, increases clinical relevance by including only patients with depression as the primary presentation, includes a quality assessment measure for the acupuncture delivered in the form of the NICMAN scale, and explores the contribution of various dosage components on depression related clinical outcomes. [68](#B68-jcm-08-01140)], therefore an alternate view is that the high risk of bias of the trials in China may explain the larger effects seen. The percentage of trials assessed as having a low risk of bias in five or more domains conducted in China was 14% (3/22), while in other countries the rate was 57% (4/7). 4.3. Implications for Research and Practice [36](#B36-jcm-08-01140)] included a usual care comparison. More trials of this type are needed to model real-world settings, and in different countries. The results of these trials will provide important evidence for patients when considering the option of acupuncture, for clinicians when considering the referral of their patients to an acupuncturist, for decision-makers when considering providing resources to fund mental health treatments, and for policy-makers when considering questions of health policy related to depression. Moreover, such pragmatic designs provide an ideal framework for a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis, thereby supporting economic-related decision-making. [69](#B69-jcm-08-01140)]. Similar to our findings in this regard, evidence for additional benefits of adding electro-stimulation to acupuncture is unclear when outcomes are not related to pain [ [69](#B69-jcm-08-01140), [70](#B70-jcm-08-01140)]. [71](#B71-jcm-08-01140)]. In cases where multi-morbidity from the perspective of biomedicine is perceived as problematic, research is needed to confirm, or otherwise, whether a multi-faceted acupuncture treatment provides a useful single modality solution. 5.
