In the monastic tradition, the monk's goal was to come to continuous prayer, and their way to this state was the practice of oratio pura (pure prayer) or imageless prayer, which cultivated in them purity of heart or singleness of purpose. John Main OSB drew from this tradition of imageless prayer to teach Christian meditation, a way of prayer that integrates our two centres of intelligence, the head and the heart, and so enables continuous prayer where work and prayer are not separate but flow one from the other. This is the state of continuous prayer that the monk in us yearns for. These talks were given at Sant'Anselmo, Rome, in 2015. The Monastic Tradition of Meditation 1 belongs to the Meditatio Talks Series, a collection of talks designed for sharing the teaching of meditation and for personal reflection. The talks offer encouragement and inspiration for the practice of meditation and a deeper understanding of the spiritual journey. Some titles in the Meditatio Talks Series are: The Prayer that Jesus Taught (2006 A-D) The Ego on Our Spiritual Journey I & II (2008 A-B) In Times of Anxiety (2009 C) "}
