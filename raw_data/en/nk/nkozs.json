T hese are their stories. Throughout 2020, Ochsner heroes dedicated themselves to caring for others. They continue to write a critical chapter in our history today. 5 OCHSNER HEALTH In late 2019, before the world knew what COVID-19 would become, the Ochsner Infection Prevention and Control team began closely monitoring a then unnamed respiratory illness spreading rapidly in China. When the first case in the U.S. was identified, Ochsner flung open the doors of its Incident Command Center with Dr. Katherine Baumgarten, Medical Director of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), and Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, System Medical Director of Hospital Quality leading the team and our overall system response. Together, they helped to convene some of the top thinkers and executors from across the system, while partnering with the Louisiana Department of Health to implement a rapid response plan. Manually reviewing lab results for every Ochsner patient tested for COVID-19, Drs. Baumgarten and Kemmerly provided essential and empathetic counsel during those early and uncertain days. As the months wore on, they adapted as new insights emerged and information changed. Operating as a stable and reliable unit, the doctors helped operationalize and educate the Ochsner Health system as therapies such as dexamethasone, antiviral medications, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines became available. \"The COVID-19 pandemic brought us so many unique challenges and presented so many obstacles,\" said Dr. Kemmerly, \"but witnessing the creative solutions and all the innovation that resulted from it continues to amaze me. I am fortunate to work with such an incredible team as we continue to navigate this unprecedented pandemic.\" Applying learnings from other global health crises, Ochsner set up inpatient units early on that were dedicated to COVID-19 patients. IPC worked closely with operations, information services, supply chain and facilities teams to find additional space for new beds, design areas to optimize PPE use and adapt virtual technologies so that hospital nurses and physicians could limit their exposure to sick patients. Rounding on the COVID-19 units was another critical role for the IPC team. \"Again and again, I watched physicians, nurses and staff step out of their comfort zones to ensure patients felt comfortable and supported during a stressful time when visitors were not allowed,\" recalled Dr. Baumgarten. \"To watch our clinicians treat patients, keep them connected with their families and solve one problem after another with truly incredible solutions was gratifying and humbling. Even when hope felt distant and stress was high, the Ochsner team never faltered. I've learned a lot from my colleagues this year, and working alongside them is a privilege.\" \"To watch our clinicians treat patients, keep them connected with their families and solve one problem after another with truly incredible solutions was gratifying and humbling.\" -Dr. Katherine BaumgartenJumping Into the Deep End Dr. Sandra Kemmerly \u2014 Hospital Quality Dr. Katherine Baumgarten \u2014 Infection Prevention and Control 6 2020 ANNUAL REPORTDuring a crisis, Ochsner's Incident Command Center becomes the epicenter of operations coordination. The COVID-19 center was staffed daily with representatives from infectious diseases, operations, supply chain, communications, information services, facilities, nursing and emergency management who focused on constantly developing data and processes to take the best possible care of our COVID-19 patients and ensure the safety of our employees and other patients. As Incident Commanders, Dawn Pevey, CEO of System Service Lines and Centers of Excellence, and Tracey Moffatt, Chief Nursing Officer and System Vice President of Quality, led the charge of this massive effort.Incident Commanders Direct the Fight Dawn Pevey \u2014 System Service Lines and Centers of ExcellenceTracey Moffatt \u2014 Nursing and Quality \"We prepare for disasters, high volumes of patients, and response plans at all of our campuses,\" said Dawn, \"but we couldn't have known what was ahead of us.\" \"We were calling plays from a playbook that had never been written,\" said Tracey. \"We relied on our knowledge and experience and that of our extremely talented colleagues and leaders, always thinking of our patients first, as well as the safety and well-being of our staff.\" \"Some days we were scared,\" confirmed Dawn. \"Every day was exhausting. But you gather energy from the people around you. We're all here for the same reason: the safety of our patients, co-workers and communities.\" One year later Dawn and Tracey continue to run the COVID-19 operational response, including the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, testing and staffing. \"We were calling plays from a playbook that had never been written.\" -Tracey Moffatt 7 OCHSNER HEALTH \"As a family medicine physician at Ochsner St. Anne Hospital I work with five other internists and family physicians, and we take turns treating hospitalized patients,\" explained Dr. Jack Heidenreich. \"In early March, I saw a patient in our ICU with bilateral pneumonia, a serious infection that causes inflammation and scarring of the lungs. He was experiencing excessively rapid breathing, and we had him on BiPap, a non-invasive ventilation that is used to support breathing. I went in his room without a mask, thinking he may need to be intubated. I felt his breath on my face. He was critical but stable. I wrote some orders and went home. \"That night the 10 o'clock news featured a story about COVID-19 in China. I saw a doctor hold up a chest X-ray, and it looked identical to that of my patient. 'Oh no,' I thought. 'We aren't ready.' I knew COVID-19 was coming \u2014 but none of us were expecting it so soon.\"I immediately called the ICU and told them to mask up and quarantine the patient. Subsequently, I called the Louisiana Department of Health and asked them to test my patient for COVID-19. Three days later, the test came back positive. I was one of the first doctors to diagnose COVID-19 in Louisiana. My reward was a 14-day quarantine. Fortunately, the patient ultimately survived after two weeks in our hospital. \"I returned to work wearing PPE and followed strict CDC guidelines. But I was nervous \u2014 and for good reason. The virus touched our family, entering the nursing home where my father-in-law was a resident, and taking his life. My wife subsequently contracted COVID-19 and I, along with our son and daughter, caught it from her. Fortunately, the four of us recovered \u2014 but it was no cakewalk. \"The leaders at Ochsner have done an amazing job helping us weather this storm. We had great PPE. We experienced ICU nursing staff making the necessary changes and upper-level management keeping the supplies coming. As bad as the last several months have been, COVID-19 is the reason I became a physician.\" Diagnosing One of Louisiana's First COVID-19 Patients Dr. Jack Heidenreich Family Medicine \"I saw a doctor hold up a chest X-ray, and it looked identical to that of my patient. 'Oh no,' I thought. 'We aren't ready.'\" -Dr. Jack Heidenreich 8 2020 ANNUAL REPORTDiagnosing One of Louisiana's First COVID-19 Patients Dr. Jack Heidenreich Family Medicine \"It's mid-April 2020, and the working environment is sometimes exactly what I've been used to in the 10 years I've been practicing in emergency medicine,\" said Dr. Charlane Liles, section head of Emergency Medicine at Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 West Bank Campus. \"And then, for pockets of the day and hours at a time, it is unlike anything that I have ever experienced. It's the number of sick patients, the number of patients on ventilators, the patients who are getting sicker by the minute. You look around, you see the nurses moving faster and everyone in masks and gowns and wearing the PPE that they weren't required to wear three weeks ago, and it becomes surreal. \"As an ER doc, I'm trained to be prepared for mass casualties, to treat people who come in large numbers needing help. But the fact that this could make me sick, that I could be bringing home something to my family \u2014 that adds a whole different level of fear. I understand if colleagues want to walk away. But they don't. They know that this is what they trained for. They're not going to leave, even if they're scared that they could become sick themselves.\" Dr. Liles' colleague, Dr. Abdul Khan, ICU Medical Director at the same West Bank facility, weighed in. \"This is a virus like nothing else we've seen, but we are seeing patients get better. My job is to get people off these ventilators so they can get better and go home to their families. As a team of nurses, respiratory therapists and doctors, this virus has brought everyone in the medical community together like never before. All the walls have been broken, and together we are keeping our eye on the prize: safely caring for our patients so they can go home.\" \"It's just what we do,\" said Dr. Liles. \"In a crisis like this, we run to the front line. As difficult as it is, this experience is not going to change the way I care for patients. It just confirms that I have always been in the right place.\" Amid the Chaos, a Care Team Steps Up Dr. Charlane Liles & Mary Truxillo \u2014 Emergency MedicineDr. Abdul Khan \u2014 Pulmonary Diseases \"In a crisis like this, we run to the front line.\" - Dr. Charlane Liles 9 OCHSNER HEALTH After many harrowing weeks of illness, Bridgette Johnson-Robinson attributes her survival and recovery from COVID-19 to faith, family and the care she received at Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 Northshore. At her side throughout her long and difficult journey was her daughter, Sylvia Johnson, an RN at the same hospital. In March, Bridgette, who's employed as a nursing assistant at a long-term acute care facility in New Orleans, had been isolating at home with COVID-19 when she took a dramatic turn for the worse. Her daughter insisted she come to Ochsner where she was evaluated and admitted. As her medical crisis deepened, Bridgette spent two weeks on a ventilator and, for a time, had to go on dialysis because of damage to her kidneys. According to her daughter, Sylvia, the situation was \"touch and go.\" The physicians treating her were hopeful, but they also prepared the family for the worst. Bridgette's first memory as she regained consciousness was hearing her 11-year-old grandson, Jamal, say, \"Grandma, I need you, I love you, come back to me.\" Later she awakened to see her daughter Sylvia's face at her bedside. \"My daughter is my hero,\" said Bridgette. On May 1, 2020, Bridgette was finally discharged from the hospital for good. It was a cause for celebration, made even more special a few days later when mother and daughter were featured on NBC's TODAY show as part of the program's Nurses Week coverage. During the segment they were serenaded by country music star Blake Shelton. Reflecting on her journey to survive the virus that nearly killed her, Bridgette remarked, \"Praise the Lord. He's not finished with me. I've got more to do.\" A Family Prevails Over a Deadly Disease Sylvia Johnson, RN Bridgette Johnson-Robinson \u2014 Ochsner Patient\"My Johnson-Robinson 10 2020 ANNUAL REPORTAn ICU Nurse Reflects on the Challenges \u2014 and the Triumphs Amy Finnegan, RN Critical Care \"For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a nurse,\" said Amy Finnegan, a critical care RN at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans. \"There was absolute certainty as I followed my mom's footsteps to work in the ICU. It's that perfect blend of compassion, dedication and bravery displayed by every person of the team, working together with the same goal \u2014 to care for our patients. \"Reflecting on 2020, I think about every patient I had to say goodbye to, the trust they placed in me and their very understandable fears. I also think about the risks we take in our jobs every day. We've learned a lot since the pandemic started. \"In the beginning, we were afraid because we had no idea what we were dealing with. We were terrified of bringing the virus home to our families or getting sick ourselves. But still, we showed up for every shift, so our patients didn't have to battle this virus alone. We are a team and a family \u2014 and this is our calling. \"Since then, we've been able to modify our treatments and adapt to better practices with science-based data. We've learned how this disease spreads and how to prevent transmission. And now, I am proud to have received the vaccine for myself, my family, my children and my community. I want to help end COVID-19. \"With every curveball this virus presents, we will continue to use our strength, our minds, our collaboration and our innovation to keep pushing through for the sake of the sick. This is what nurses do. \"Here's to the year of the nurse. 2020 has given us armor and made us superheroes. And when we win this battle, we will celebrate together.\" \"We showed up for every shift, so our patients didn't have to battle this virus alone. We are a team and a family \u2014 and this is our calling.\" -Amy Finnegan 11 OCHSNER HEALTH When the world started talking about an unknown virus spreading throughout China in late 2019, R\u00e9gine Honor\u00e9 Villain, System Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, was already ahead of the game. Tuned into an unrelated and still ongoing global supply disruption that originated in early fall, R\u00e9gine had already ramped up efforts to ensure a more reliable product pipeline. And as the media began covering the novel coronavirus, it became clear that an ailing workforce in China would only add to the problem. China simply would not be able to meet global PPE demands during a potential pandemic. R\u00e9gine instinctively initiated an emergency sourcing and inventory plan with her team to offset any potential impact from the disruption. \"Based on intuition and strategy, we started ramping up purchases of supplies to create a buffer before we found ourselves competing at an international scale over the same limited resources,\" said R\u00e9gine. Once COVID-19 hit home, Ochsner's supply chain team worked around the clock to activate every conventional and non-traditional networking relationship \u2014 and became a catalyst for community engagement. Through a combination of outreach to global suppliers and local business owners, the team supplied the masks, face shields, gowns and hand sanitizers needed to sustain Ochsner's strained workforce early on and throughout the pandemic.The team also amplified its logistics acumen through the rapid set-up of a warehouse operation to distribute supplies throughout the system along with daily reports to highlight PPE inventory by facility. \"If it were me in one of those patient rooms, I would want everyone, including the supply chain and logistics staff, to do all they could to support our healthcare workers,\" said Tahj Joseph, an Ochsner supply chain technician. \"So that's what we did.\" Said R\u00e9gine: \"Between our ability to foreshadow what was coming and our team's dedication to our front line, we maneuvered through this pandemic while keeping our patients and staff sufficiently protected. I am grateful to the supply chain team for remaining committed, resilient and heroic throughout.\" \"If it were me in one of those patient rooms, I would want everyone, including the supply chain and logistics staff, to do all they could to support our healthcare workers. So that's what we did.\" -Tahj JosephEnsuring a Reliable PPE Pipeline R\u00e9gine Honor\u00e9 Villain & the Supply Chain Team 2020 ANNUAL REPORTIt was a challenging set of circumstances: To treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients, time demands on healthcare professionals were intense. Meanwhile, as part of Louisiana's early stay-at-home order to help contain the virus, schools had been closed indefinitely. For Ochsner staff with school-age children and jobs that needed them, the juggling act between work and family had become untenable. So Ochsner stepped in, pulling together a makeshift \"childcare task force\" of administrative leaders to brainstorm options, fast. In just 72 hours, a solution was in place and doors were open. Free childcare options for Ochsner staff in locations across the state through a network of \"kid camps\" to keep children engaged and active \u2014 while adhering to COVID-19 protocols to keep them safe. Dr. Kathy Jo Carstarphen, an internal medicine physician at Ochsner Health in New Orleans, was one of the beneficiaries of the program.Helping Clinicians Keep Their Focus on Patients Dr. Kathy Jo Carstarphen Internal Medicine\"Because my daughter had a safe environment to socialize and exercise, I was able to focus on my job as a frontline physician for COVID-19 patients.\" -Dr. Kathy Jo Carstarphen \"My daughter, who's five years old, received childcare since the beginning of the pandemic. Because she had a safe environment to socialize and exercise, I was able to focus on my job as a frontline physician for COVID-19 patients. My daughter later transitioned into a summer camp through the same Ochsner program. I felt safe, and she was safe, because of the appropriate precautions in that camp,\" recalled Dr. Carstarphen. \"I'm often at the clinic from 7 in the morning to 6 or 7 at night, along with nurses and other clinicians. This program has helped so many of us, especially those colleagues who had no other options. For me, this program has allowed me to wind down in those moments before bedtime with my daughter, and it's not a struggle. I can get sleep, my daughter can get sleep and she's also getting the socialization and exercise she needs. It's exactly what we've all needed during this challenging time.\" 13 OCHSNER HEALTH On March 21, 2020, less than two weeks after admitting our first COVID-19 patient, Ochsner became the first hospital in Louisiana to insource diagnostic testing for the virus. Our ability to lead the state in COVID-19 testing and create an infrastructure that could accurately and rapidly process thousands of test samples each day was the product of careful preparation, quick decision making and innovative approaches by Ochsner's laboratory and pathology team. Months before the pandemic affected Louisiana, an interdisciplinary team began meeting weekly to monitor the emerging coronavirus threat and develop strategies around effective testing criteria. When the first COVID-19 cases emerged here, testing was only available to Ochsner patients through the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH). Because of the manual nature of the department's CDC test and the sudden increase in volume, the LDH simply could not meet demand and turnaround time. A long-term solution built around a high-throughput platform was needed, and quickly. Two automated platforms met Ochsner's strict criteria, and Abbott Laboratories was selected because two of its instruments were already onsite and staff were familiar with its analyzer functionality. After verification tests and facility enhancements to ensure Ochsner's space met the requirements for a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory, the new testing system went live just 11 days after Ochsner's first COVID-19 patient admission. With the installation of a third Abbott instrument, testing capacity increased to more than 1,000 samples per day and, most importantly, patients' test results could be available within 24 hours. As the number of cases continued to increase, the laboratory team needed more staff to cope with the escalating volume. A call went out for volunteers, and nearly overnight Ochsner scientists from chemistry and blood bank to microbiology and pathology answered with overwhelming enthusiasm. The laboratory transformed into a multidisciplinary team, united toward the common goal of curbing the pandemic. Over the next six months, the lab team was involved in a large-scale project to design, build and operationalize a new molecular diagnostics lab. This required implementation of two additional high throughput analyzers, complicated preanalytical workflows geared toward varied patient populations and enhanced STAT testing capabilities. By the end of 2020, Ochsner's lab had collected 800,563 COVID-19 tests. Moving at Ochsner Speed to Insource Testing Dr. Elise Occhipinti & Dr. Tong Yang \u2014 Pathology Dr. Gregory Sossaman, Earlene Goens and Evelyn Smith \u2014 Laboratory Ochsner became the first hospital in Louisiana to insource diagnostic testing for the virus. By the end of 2020, Ochsner's lab had collected 800,563 COVID-19 tests. From left: Dr. Elise Occhipinti, Dr. Gregory Sossaman, Earlene Goens, Dr. Tong Yang 14 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\"On March 11, 2020, Ochsner admitted its first COVID-19 patient,\" explained Crystal Risinger, Director of Nursing in the Emergency Department at Ochsner Medical Center. \"From there, Louisiana's numbers rapidly escalated as our urgent cares and emergency departments filled with patients experiencing symptoms. At that time, all we knew was that the virus was community spread and that we had to isolate these individuals from our other patients needing emergent care. \"Our team mobilized quickly to build a Respiratory Evaluation Unit (REU) as a more streamlined isolation approach for potential COVID-19 patients. Within 72 hours, the REU was up and running, and this became the new norm to care for potential COVID-19 patients while protecting others. \"Our team worked hard to isolate patients. By early April, numbers were reaching new highs. The majority of patients being hospitalized had COVID-19. They were extremely sick, decompensating and deteriorating quickly and being placed on ventilators as we continued to open additional critical care beds to manage capacity. \"Looking back, it was scary to consider how long this would go on. Would we start getting sick, too? Would we hit capacity? Everything in the hospital looked different. There was social distancing among staff, we were fully dressed in PPE and no visitors were allowed. \"I am extremely grateful that through telemedicine, we were able to decrease our virus exposure in COVID-19 rooms while still appropriately caring for patients. And I'm most grateful for the talented team I work with and their countless hours dedicated to caring for our community. Through it all, we have remained resilient. That is who we are.\" Rapidly Isolating COVID-19 Patients to Protect Others Crystal Risinger, RN Emergency Medicine \"Looking back, it was scary to consider how long this would go on. Would we start getting sick, too? Would we hit capacity?\" -Crystal Risinger 15 OCHSNER HEALTH The first Louisiana COVID-19 cases delivered a period of uncertainty as Ochsner leaders sought answers to crucial questions: How large would the coming patient surge be? How many more hospital beds, critical care units, mechanical ventilation machines and clinical staff would be needed to treat the increasing flow of acutely ill patients? The task was especially challenging because, initially, testing capacity was sparse, and results were often delayed. This meant the extent of infection among admitted patients, and in the community, was mostly unknown. Yet the answers would soon come from a team of Ochsner experts comprised of Ochsner Xavier Center for Health Equity and Research Medical Director Dr. Eboni Price-Haywood, Chief Academic Officer Dr. Leo Seoane and Biomedical Research Informatics Specialist Dan Fort, PhD, who possessed deep expertise in data modeling. Early on, the University of Pennsylvania had developed a promising COVID-19 hospital impact model based on assumptions about the current state of the disease, how quickly it spreads and the degree to which interventions like social distancing were slowing the spread of infection. The challenge presented to Dr. Fort and the Ochsner team: how could the model be adapted to provide answers here in Louisiana, where there was so little data and so many unknowns? The ingenuity of the Ochsner team's approach was to focus on hospitalizations for COVID-19-like illness that had not yet been confirmed by testing \u2014 which was possible because the disease presented certain classic characteristics. In March, Dr. Fort applied his data skills to adapt the Pennsylvania model, creating a tool that proved to be immensely valuable far beyond Ochsner Health. The model accurately predicted peak ICU (250) and hospital bed (487) usage by April 6. In response to these model trends, Ochsner worked around the clock to add 130 ICU beds across our hospitals \u2014 additions that allowed Ochsner to cope with the surge of patients. Once the accuracy of Dr. Fort's model was validated, Ochsner created a predictive model of hospitalizations for the greater New Orleans region that was shared with other health systems and with the state. The model guided regional capacity planning, including helping the State of Louisiana avoid a planned expansion of beds at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, which Dr. Fort's model accurately predicted was unnecessary. \"It's exciting that we were able to create a practical, locally informed model to estimate hospital capacity requirements even though the community COVID-19 caseload was unknown,\" said Dr. Fort. \"Our team's model accurately guided decisions not only for Ochsner, but for all stakeholders in the region.\" Predicting the Future Through Data Modeling Dan Fort, PhDBiomedical Research Informatics \"Our team's model accurately guided decisions not only for Ochsner, but for all stakeholders in the region.\" -Dr. Dan Fort 16 2020 ANNUAL REPORTFrom the moment the first COVID-19 case appeared in Louisiana, there was a rapidly growing need to adapt Ochsner's information systems and data resources to document, and help plan to treat, an entirely new disease. Directing that effort was Ochsner Chief Information Officer Laura Wilt, who leads the technology, clinical and corporate applications, cyber security and analytics teams. The whirlwind of activity began even before the first case presented in early March, as Laura and other Ochsner leaders tracked the progress of the virus overseas and added travel-related patient intake questions to the Epic electronic health record system. Once the virus appeared, the early tests were solely available through the state and were paper-based, so Epic was quickly modified to enable the transition from manual to electronic tracking. As the initial surge spiraled upward, a COVID-19 census developed by Laura's team was vital to planning and coordinating additional acute care beds. Two command centers, one IS focused, the other operations focused, were established to process emerging demands and solutions in real time. The technology solutions Using Data in New Ways to Meet the Crisis Laura Wilt Information Services were diverse \u2014 from iPads so clinical staff and patients could stay connected while reducing in-room visits, to additional laptops, printers and bar-code scanners to outfit new acute care facilities, to equipping 25 Ochsner community testing teams with the devices and in-person tech support to perform tests across the state. The IS team built a text-based symptom-tracking app for ongoing monitoring of patients while at home or at work. And, as vaccinations rolled out, bar-code scanners and labeling for vaccination kits were added to create a new type of tracking platform. Looking back at the constant activity, the countless decisions and the rapid deployment of new solutions, Laura said, \"It all demonstrates just how far we've come as an organization. The craziest stuff got thrown at everyone, and it was really hard, but my team feels so appreciative and engaged with what they are doing \u2014 working as one unified team with their clinical colleagues. People really do feel connected to their work and proud of Ochsner. Their connection to our mission has never been stronger.\" \"The craziest stuff got thrown at everyone, and it was really hard, but my team feels so appreciative and engaged with what they are doing \u2014 working as one unified team with their clinical colleagues.\" -Laura Wilt 17 OCHSNER HEALTH Children who test positive for COVID-19 rarely experience severe symptoms, and an even smaller percentage require hospitalization. Unfortunately, 12-year-old Juliet Daly was one of the unlucky few to become profoundly ill from the disease early in the pandemic. Only exceptional care from clinical staff at St. Tammany Parish Hospital (STPH) in Covington, Louisiana, and at Ochsner Hospital for Children in New Orleans saved her life. Juliet's symptoms were not the typical ones \u2014 fever, cough, difficulty breathing \u2014 common to COVID-19 patients. Instead, she suffered from severe abdominal pain. Noticing that Juliet's lips had turned blue and her heart rate was abnormally low, Juliet's parents rushed her to STPH. According to Juliet's physician, Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric cardiologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children, \"When they realized she was critically ill, the STPH emergency department did an incredible job getting her stabilized, intubated and on a ventilator.\" But as Juliet was being prepared for helicopter transport to Ochsner Hospital for Children she went into cardiac arrest and lost her pulse entirely. The team performed CPR for two minutes and was able to bring her back. \"COVID-19 can infect the heart and it can cause the cells in the heart to actually start to die,\" said Dr. Kleinmahon. \"We realized Juliet had myocarditis and were highly suspicious that this was related to COVID-19. Her heart was beating very slowly, and the squeeze of her heart was very poor, so it wasn't getting a whole lot of blood to the rest of her body and organs. And because of that she was going into kidney failure and liver failure.\" The care team at Ochsner quickly began a series of medications to reduce inflammation and stabilize her heart. After confirming her coronavirus diagnosis, doctors gave Juliet an immunoglobulin product used successfully to treat patients with Kawasaki disease. The initial hours were harrowing for her parents as Juliet's heart rate fluctuated widely, and she remained on a ventilator for four days. After several days of treatment Juliet began to improve \u2014 recovering nearly as rapidly as she had fallen ill. \"One of the reasons I love taking care of children is because children are so resilient,\" said Dr. Kleinmahon. \"Juliet came in as sick as you possibly can be, and within 10 days of leaving the hospital she's back to living a totally normal life.\" A Miraculous Return From the Brink of Death Juliet Daly \u2014 Ochsner Patient Dr. Jake Kleinmahon \u2014 Pediatric Cardiology \"Juliet came in as sick as you possibly can be, and within 10 days of leaving the hospital she's back to living a totally normal life.\" -Dr. Jake Kleinmahon 18 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\"I'm a head and neck cancer surgeon and the Medical Director of the Ochsner Cancer Institute,\" explained Dr. Brian Moore. \"Most days you'll find me in the operating room, removing tumors of the throat, mouth, and glands of the head and neck; in the clinic; or working to grow our cancer care program across the region. \"In response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis, last March Ochsner stood up several new intensive care units. A call went out to anyone with critical care experience to staff them. I'm but one of many physicians in surgery and other medical subspecialties who volunteered to be redeployed. \"The experience was a bit like rolling the clock back 21 years to my days as an intern \u2014 leaning on the critical care staff, the ICU nurses and those with a bit more experience to help get you through \u2014 even the residents and fellows in anesthesiology and critical care. When you're specializing in an area like cancer surgery your knowledge grows deep over time \u2014 but it's also narrowly focused. You contribute what you can, but you trust the experience of the nurses, therapists and specialists who do this for a living \u2014 they are amazing and the true heroes. \"The ICU was an environment in which titles and seniority didn't matter. I spent several days working with a critical care attending physician who was just in his first year out of fellowship \u2014 Dr. Louis Cannizarro. He was our leader, he told us what to do, and he was fantastic. I was particularly impressed with how he checked on every member of the team \u2014 from the nurses to the therapists to the ward clerks \u2014 and made sure that they were staying strong in what were some stressful times. \"One night a patient I was assigned to took a sudden turn for the worse. Working at the bedside with a nurse redeployed from the OR, we were trying to make heads or tails of the sudden change. Quickly I turned to find one of the anesthesiology senior residents there to help. And then, help came from every direction. Everybody was rowing in the same direction \u2014 pulling together to save a life. \"And at that moment, with a patient's life hanging in the balance, I was grateful to be a part of our Group Practice with so many talented partners to depend upon.\" Pivoting From Cancer Surgery to Critical Care to Save Lives Dr. Brian Moore Ochsner Cancer Institute \"Everybody was rowing in the same direction \u2014 pulling together to save a life.\" -Dr. Brian Moore OCHSNER HEALTH 19Months later, when nurse Dominque Yancey received her COVID-19 vaccination, she reflected on that special day last April. \"Discharging a patient who fought against COVID-19 with hope, power and resiliency throughout her stay only strengthened my choice for vaccination.\" Just over a month after Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 New Orleans admitted its first COVID-19 patient, the hospital reached an important milestone with the discharge of its 1,500th patient. On April 20, patient Kathleen Bennett was cheered by scores of hospital staffers and serenaded by a musician as she was wheeled out of the hospital by Ochsner RN Dominique Yancey. During such a challenging time for patients and staff, it was finally a cause for celebration. Ms. Bennett had been hit hard by the virus. She was hospitalized at Ochsner for 24 days, including a long stay in the ICU where she experienced complications related to COVID-19 and was placed on a ventilator. Her remarkable recovery was made possible by excellent treatment from her care team, as well as her own courage and resilience.A Meaningful Milestone in the Fight Against COVID-19 Kathleen Bennett \u2014 Ochsner Patient Dominique Yancey, RN Director \u2014 Telemedicine Step Down During such a challenging time for patients and staff, it was finally a cause for celebration. 20 2020 ANNUAL REPORTA Meaningful Milestone in the Fight Against COVID-19 Kathleen Bennett \u2014 Ochsner Patient Dominique Yancey, RN Director \u2014 Telemedicine Step Down \"Because of how COVID-19 could ravage the lungs, pulmonology became one of the most important specialties in healthcare.\" -Dr. David Taylor Given his experience, a virus like COVID-19 wasn't surprising to Dr. David Taylor, Chairman of Pulmonology and Critical Care at Ochsner. But he never predicted the magnitude of what was coming or imagined the frightening challenges he and his team would face. And he certainly didn't expect that Ochsner would be pushed so far, only to push back even harder. \"When I get asked about COVID-19, my mind immediately goes to what prepared us for the unknown,\" said Dr. Taylor. \"As a pulmonologist, I am used to seeing patients who are very, very sick. And during the pandemic, sometimes their lungs simply stopped working. Because of how COVID-19 could ravage the lungs, pulmonology became one of the most important specialties in healthcare, requiring constant rounding, coordination and problem-solving in the ICU. For our team, it has been non-stop COVID-19 care.\" Because the team was learning new things every day about this disease, real-time communication was critical. Along with extending coverage in Ochsner's community hospitals to provide direct patient care and expertise at the bedside, they expanded critical care telemedicine to treat even more people, and to help keep patients and teams safer.Pulmonary Medicine Takes Center Stage Dr. David Taylor & Dr. Suma Jain Pulmonary Diseases \"Acting as a pulmonology/critical care clinician and liaison for Ochsner Medical Center, my world was definitely focused on COVID-19 for most of 2020,\" said Dr. Suma D. Jain, Pulmonary/Critical Care medicine. \"The overwhelming number of patients coming into the ICU generated a great deal of fear and anxiety, but also motivated our group to organize our efforts.\" Because the flow of information was so important, the pulmonology team quickly mobilized a coordinated effort to ensure rapid communications to and from frontline providers, nurses, respiratory therapists and other specialists throughout the system. This ensured the right data got to the right people at the most critical time. \"These efforts bridged a gap for our frontline care teams and our community hospitals, something we will continue beyond COVID-19,\" said Dr. Jain. \"We learned a lot of lessons over the past year,\" added Dr. Taylor. \"I've been at Ochsner for 20 years, and in many ways this felt like another Hurricane Katrina. Ochsner came back stronger after that storm, and I see us coming back the same way from this one. We are all building an Ochsner that is stronger than before.\" 21 OCHSNER HEALTH \"I heard that question loud and clear just a couple of weeks after Ochsner's first COVID-19 diagnosis last March,\" said Jay Britsch, System Vice President, Facilities. \"The writing was already on the wall: the flow of sick patients into our ICUs was only going to increase. With our inpatient census rising by 40 patients a day \u2014 or 377% in the first month \u2014 Ochsner's largest hospital would run out of ICU beds in a matter of weeks. And I needed to figure out what to do about it. \"Fortunately, we had planned for a situation like this. Well, maybe not exactly like this, but at Ochsner we expect the unexpected. We had completed construction of our West Tower expansion in 2018, adding 102 acuity-adaptable single patient rooms and leaving three floors shelled for future use. We needed that space, and we needed to build it out in three months \u2014 that's less than half the time it would normally take. With an experienced Ochsner team, including Chris Blackwell, Director of Facilities, and Jaime Johnston, Director of Furnishings, Fixtures & Equipment, along with a strong and tested partnership with Broadmoor Construction, we made it happen. \"Sometimes I wonder how we did it. Building out another 102 critical care rooms in 90 days requires an incredible range of patient care equipment and building materials along with mechanical design, permitting and the coordination of hundreds of suppliers and contractors. Not to mention we had to do it in the middle of a pandemic \u2014 keeping our teams safe and socially distanced while navigating the movement of construction crews in the same elevators and corridors that carried COVID-19 patients. We came up with a 24/7 schedule \u2014 rotating crews and sectioning out each floor to enable a safe and consistent flow of tradespeople. And we had to consolidate and simplify. That meant one paint color and one floor style, a basic ceiling structure, and strictly functional rooms with casework that could be built off-site and installed later. We held back on visitor space and conference rooms too, since visitor restrictions were already in place. \"It's funny. I joined Ochsner in 1998 and my first project was the design and build of the original West Tower. Across all my projects there's a culture of \"yes\" at Ochsner that makes us who we are. We ask not if we can do something, but how . That's a good way to be.\" \"How Fast Can You Build It?\" Jay Britsch Facilities \"There's a culture of 'yes' at Ochsner that makes us who we are.\" -Jay Britsch 22 2020 ANNUAL REPORTWhen Ochsner's Office of Professional Well-Being was formed in 2019, its members immediately got to work on interventions around practice efficiency and leadership development to improve well-being for all physicians and advanced practice providers. But once COVID-19 hit, the team knew it had to expand support for all Ochsner employees, clinical or not. \"It became clear within a few days that there were a lot of needs not just with our provider staff, but with our nursing staff, frontline employees and management teams,\" said Dr. Nigel Girgrah, Chief Wellness Officer. \"We had to focus on personal and team resilience in crisis management.\" In collaboration with their colleagues in Behavioral Health, Ochsner Health and Wellness Solutions, Ochsner Leadership Institute and others, the team quickly set up \"decompression zones\" where staff could quietly unwind before or after a shift, a COVID-19 crisis support hotline open 24/7 to any staff, over 100 virtual mindfulness sessions and webinars on topics related to resiliency, nutrition, mindfulness, post-traumatic growth and other areas. \"Providing healthcare is inherently stressful,\" said Ashton Sloan, Assistant Vice President of the Office of Professional Well-Being. \"So prioritizing staff well-being is essential to Ochsner's ability to provide the high-quality care our patients deserve.\" They also spearheaded a rapid response unit rounding and staff debriefing program, which became crucial to provide on-demand mental health and emotional support to over 1,000 Ochsner frontline staff and counting. \"Frontline healthcare workers spend their entire shift rounding on patients,\" said Dr. R. John Sawyer II, a clinical neuropsychologist and the Medical Director for Professional Staff Experience. \"We knew it was critical to be on the units, asking: how are you \u2014 really, what do you need, and how can I help you? Most were astonished that someone was checking on them, and we saw the importance of meeting the staff right where they were.\" Despite the ongoing stress the pandemic has caused, Melissa Love, Vice President of Professional Staff Services, sees a silver lining. \"Discussions of fatigue, depression, burnout and confusion are happening daily. This has changed the conversation of mental health to be one of necessity, not stigma.\" Taking Care of Our Caregivers Dr. Nigel Girgrah, R. John Sawyer II, PhD, Melissa Love & Ashton Sloan The Office of Professional Well-Being \"It became clear within a few days that there were a lot of needs not just with our provider staff, but with our nursing staff, frontline employees and management teams.\" -Dr. Nigel Girgrah 23 OCHSNER HEALTH In the earliest days of the COVID-19 outbreak, before any infections had been diagnosed in Louisiana, Ochsner Baton Rouge ICU nurse James Bamber planned extra precautions to keep his family safe. He was concerned about protecting his wife, Katie, pregnant with their fourth child, and his three young children. So, when infected patients came under James' care in early March he went into self-imposed quarantine, moving in with his sister while taking extra shifts in the ICU. The decision to quarantine meant many phone calls and video chat conversations with Katie and the kids. On off days James would drive to his home and sit outside the window to talk to 6-year-old Matthew, 5-year-old William and 3-year-old Grace, while remaining socially distant. His sacrifice was magnified when the day came for delivery. James chose to avoid the delivery room to decrease the risk of exposing his wife and the healthcare team to the virus. Katie was surrounded by Ochsner's labor and delivery team while James remained in the parking lot below, staying connected through FaceTime, photos and videos. Recalled Katie, \"All the nurses and staff were incredible. They made sure everything was the best it could be for us.\" When baby Andrew entered the world, a nurse phoned James and told him to run out to the sidewalk. She held Andrew up to the window, just moments old, while his dad waved from below. \"That was the most emotional part for me,\" said Katie. \"Immediately I got to touch Andrew and hold him, and I can't imagine what that was like for James to be unable to do that.\" Mother and baby were healthy, but it would be nearly two more weeks before the family could all be reunited. On Easter morning James rejoined his family and met his newborn for the first time. \"Our sacrifice is small compared to what those affected by the virus are having to go through. It really ended up being a beautiful experience,\" said James. When Sacrifice Takes on a Whole New Meaning James Bamber, RN Critical Care \"Our sacrifice is small compared to what those affected by the virus are having to go through.\" -James Bamber 24 2020 ANNUAL REPORTThe day the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, Dr. Yvens G. Laborde, Medical Director for Global Health Education, was making a presentation at Ochsner titled, \"Global Health Is Local Health.\" As the pandemic escalated, even Dr. Laborde and his colleagues could not have predicted how prophetic that title would become. Within days of Ochsner's first diagnosed case, Dr. Laborde, together with Dawn Pevey, CEO, System Centers of Excellence and Service Lines, Emily Arata, Vice President, System Community & Public Affairs and their peers across the system in Ochsner's Nursing, Lab, Community Outreach, Pharmacy and Information Systems teams would play a central role in establishing Ochsner's community testing program. \"Being the first in the state to have the capacity to test within our facility was big,\" said Dr. Laborde. \"In order to effectively manage and mitigate the disease, we had to test, not only within the hospital, but in the community to determine the areas where people were getting infected.\" The first community test site was launched within 48 hours of making the decision to move forward, and capacity quickly ramped to 25 unique Ochsner teams testing Louisianans in communities throughout the state. Recalled Dr. Laborde, \"We realized not everybody had access to a primary care doctor and not everyone has insurance. So, the idea of community testing was to make it equitable, to make it widely available to all communities whatever their zip code or ability to get to a facility.\" A partnership with the State of Louisiana was established and the community testing teams were staffed by reassigned Ochsner employees. No out-of-pocket costs were charged for those seeking a test. The operational and logistical details were legion \u2014 from transporting testing supplies to creating an Epic electronic health record for each patient to arranging courier services to get the tests safely back to Ochsner's labs each day. Testing data was crucial in providing state policymakers with real-time information to help make decisions on lockdowns, school operations and other activities. In all, more than 170,000 tests were completed at over 250 community locations in 2020. \"Ochsner's mission is to serve on a local and global scale, and our community testing program represents every aspect of that,\" said Dr. Laborde. \"More than ever before it really established Ochsner as a community asset \u2014 one that benefits everyone.\" Community Testing as a Community Asset Dr. Yvens Laborde Global Health Education \"Not everybody had access to a primary care doctor and not everyone has insurance. So, the idea of community testing was to make it equitable, to make it widely available to all communities.\" -Dr. Yvens Laborde 25 OCHSNER HEALTH Researching the Spread and Impact of COVID-19 Amy Feehan, PhD Research Science \"More than 25,000 residents volunteered, which allowed us to select a randomized group that was demographically representative of the area. That was crucial to accuracy.\" -Dr. Amy FeehanIn the early weeks of the COVID-19 crisis much was unknown about the disease \u2014 including its prevalence and how many people could be infected without ever showing symptoms. Together with the Ochsner Infectious Diseases Research team, Amy Feehan, PhD, saw an opportunity to explore those questions. The goal: actionable data that could help guide Louisiana communities and policymakers to develop strategies to combat the pandemic. Testing at the time included only symptomatic individuals or those who may have been exposed to the disease, but this study targeted a representative cross section of the entire community (a \"mini-New Orleans\" and \"mini-Baton Rouge\") to understand the disease's prevalence. The team utilized the most precise testing regimen possible, including a gold standard antibody test. \"We decided to go to the trouble of collecting a blood draw to use the Abbott system, which has 99.6% specificity and 100% sensitivity for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2\" said Dr. Feehan. The initial analysis targeted the New Orleans metro area, later followed by a Baton Rouge study. Crucial to its success was the willingness of residents to volunteer. \"The support and interest from Orleans and Jefferson parishes was astounding. More than 25,000 residents volunteered, which allowed us to select a randomized group that was demographically representative of the area,\" said Dr. Feehan. \"That was crucial to accuracy.\" In addition to identifying the number of residents that had been infected to date, Dr. Feehan's team calculated a COVID-19 infection fatality ratio of 1.61%, which is 10 to 40 times more deadly than the seasonal flu. Data from both cities found that 61.4% of infected people had low or no symptoms. \"The asymptomatic rate was alarming, because how do you convince someone to wear a mask even if they feel fine?\" said Dr. Feehan. \"This is what makes the virus so insidious.\" The study's findings helped guide decisions by health system administrators and local officials and emphasized the importance of a mandatory mask policy. 26 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\"'How do we provide the safest childcare to help our staff in an unprecedented situation?' That was the big question \u2014 and we didn't have much time,\" said Tracey Schiro, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. \"The Ochsner COVID-19 Emergency Childcare Committee formed on Friday, March 13, 2020, the day the governor announced that schools were closing to in-person instruction,\" Tracey recalled. \"We literally pulled the people within earshot into a room and started brainstorming. Once the idea of partnering with a qualified childcare provider experienced in pop-up childcare materialized, negotiations moved fast. The next 72 hours were spent on phone calls, texts and emails \u2014 anything to keep us moving forward. We relied on each member of our ad-hoc committee to solve a piece of this very large puzzle while following the latest guidelines. We needed our doctors, nurses and clinical staff focused on patient care \u2014 and providing free childcare was one thing we could take off their plates. \"Incredibly, by Monday we had 17 locations ready to open across Louisiana, meal donations organized, craft projects and activities planned and, critically, a safe and high-quality place for every family who needed it. Together with our childcare partner, KidCam Camps, and our Infectious Diseases experts, Philanthropy and Community Outreach teams, Event Planning professionals and trusting parents \u2014 we delivered a degree of normalcy and security to families at a time when nothing felt normal. It was the best kind of team effort \u2014 and something I'll always remember.\" Delivering a Little Bit of Normal Tracey Schiro & the Ochsner COVID-19 Emergency Childcare Committee \"We needed our doctors, nurses and clinical staff focused on patient care \u2014 and providing free childcare was one thing we could take off their plates.\" -Tracey Schiro 27 OCHSNER HEALTH Masking has proven to be an essential tool to reduce the spread of COVID-19. But for some patients and in some settings, obscuring the face and mouth with a traditional mask can create its own set of challenges. With that in mind the innovationOchsner team initiated a windowed mask project just a few months into the pandemic. Concepted and designed in collaboration with a local New Orleans designer, the masks feature a clear vinyl window in the middle of a cloth mask, helping patients more easily see an individual's lips and facial expressions. The new masks were piloted with infants at Ochsner Baptist by speech and language pathologists Hayley Keller and Paula Diannitto. \"We get a lot of cues when we're communicating with people through their facial expressions and being able to read their lips,\" Paula said. \"And infants pay close attention to faces, especially mouths. Early exposure to a caretaker's full face is so important for speech, language and social development. These babies have been here for months, and because of traditional masks they've never seen a mouth. They've never been able to mimic us,\" Hayley said.The Impact of a Smile Hayley Keller & Paula Diannitto Speech and Language Pathology The two speech pathologists found the masks to be a game- changer in their work with newborns. \"Previously it was hard to tell when you're working with them if they're even looking at you,\" Hayley said. \"Now, I'm aware of the difference once we put these masks on. I was like, 'Oh my goodness, this baby has been looking at me the whole time!'\" After the successful field trial, the Ochsner team explored other avenues to leverage the technology. The masks were made available to parents of newborns in Ochsner Labor and Delivery units. And in December, Ochsner Health donated 20,000 windowed masks to schools and school systems across Louisiana. The masks were distributed by the schools and school systems to teachers and staff who rely on students seeing their lips to connect to the subject being taught, such as phonics for young children. \"Now, I'm aware of the difference once we put these masks on. I was like, 'Oh my goodness, this baby has been looking at me the whole time!'\" -Hayley Keller 28 2020 ANNUAL REPORTAs COVID-19 emerged and a period of uncertainty took hold, one of the foremost challenges faced by parents and communities was how to safely educate kids amid a pandemic. Following the initial shutdown, school administrators, educators, children and their families were forced to quickly adapt to remote learning \u2014 along with its inherent limitations and challenges. To help schools and community stakeholders take prudent steps forward, Ochsner Health and Ochsner Hospital for Children established the Safe Return to School Program. Led by Dr. Billy Lennarz, System Chair for Pediatrics, the program provides services and expertise to over 180 schools in Southeast Louisiana serving nearly 120,000 enrolled students. It's a diverse Ochsner team comprised of pediatric physicians from different specialties, behavioral child psychologists, infectious disease experts, research specialists as well as leaders like Allison Sharai, Director of Economic Development & Community Initiatives and Dr. Diana Peterson, Medical Director of the program. The need to devise solutions for a safe return was clear early on. Noted Dr. Lennarz, \"As the pandemic evolved, more and more evidence emerged to show how detrimental school shutdowns are for the emotional and physical health of children. We needed to stop thinking about only one side of the health impact equation when it came to closing schools. With the knowledge that children are less likely to suffer from severe acute COVID-19, we worked quickly to develop protocols to keep both kids and their teachers safe and in the classroom.\" In developing the program, Dr. Lennarz and his team leveraged the learnings obtained from safely reopening hospitals and health systems across the globe. They showed clearly that transmission in schools was rare and, when it did happen, occurred between teachers and school staff \u2014 not children. Now, a year later, much more data has reinforced this finding and informed the very latest guidance from the CDC on school reopening. \"The first step was to make families the first line of defense, to teach them to screen their child every single morning,\" said Dr. Lennarz. Other measures include temperature checkpoints upon arrival, consistent masking for children as young as age three, reducing the risk of transmission by creating small cohorts of children, adjusting hallway traffic flow and decreasing the mixing of large groups of students. According to Dr. Lennarz, \"Children are more adaptive and more resilient than adults, and kids in the schools that we support have adapted easily to masking, distancing and overall pandemic mitigation tactics. In fact, children in schools have been a real force in the fight against COVID-19.\" Helping Nearly 120,000 Children Safely Return to School Dr. Billy Lennarz, Allison Sharai & Dr. Diana PetersonSafe Return to School Program \"The first step was to make the families the first line of defense, to teach them to screen their child every single morning.\" -Dr. Billy Lennarz 29 OCHSNER HEALTH In the early days of the pandemic, it became apparent that Black patients were being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Dr. Eboni Price-Haywood, Medical Director for the Ochsner Xavier Institute for Health Equity and Research, saw an opportunity to leverage Ochsner's vast data resources to quantify those impacts and better understand the racial disparities playing a role in the growing health crisis. The study led by Dr. Price-Haywood was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and was the first of its kind on the topic. Clinical data from nearly 3,500 COVID-19-positive patients were extracted from Ochsner's electronic health record system, Epic, to examine the racial, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, including mortality, of those under Ochsner's care. Co-authored by Ochsner researchers Jeffrey Burton, Ph.D., Daniel Fort, Ph.D., and Chief Academic Officer Dr. Leo Seoane, the study found that 77% of the patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were Black, whereas Black patients comprise only 31% of the Ochsner Health population and 33% of the overall population of Louisiana. While Black patients were much more likely to be hospitalized, once admitted, the risk of death was nearly the same as their white counterparts. Black patients were more likely to have comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease than white patients. \"The larger issue is the role of social determinants of health,\" Dr. Price-Haywood said. \"COVID-19 unveiled things that have been there for decades, but we've had blinders on. No matter how privileged you are, we don't have the luxury to ignore it.\"\"COVID-19 revealed what we already knew about health inequities in the state, and it has taught us that if we all work together, we can manage these huge challenges,\" said Dr. Seoane. \"This study emphasized the disproportionate burden on certain populations, and its findings helped guide our health system, public health officials and elected officials in developing strategies for dealing with the spread in our communities.\" Pioneering Research to Address Health Disparities Dr. Eboni Price-Haywood Internal Medicine and Research \"COVID-19 unveiled things that have been there for decades, but we've had blinders on. No matter how privileged you are, we don't have the luxury to ignore it.\" -Dr. Eboni Price-Haywood 30 2020 ANNUAL REPORTAs New Orleans became an early COVID-19 hot spot, it was evident the Ochsner Research team needed to quickly refocus their efforts to help determine a course of treatment and reduce virus prevalence. Within weeks, they were involved in 30 COVID-19 clinical trials and studies ranging from convalescent plasma treatment and monoclonal antibodies to vaccines. Nothing was off the table. \"Ochsner has a long history of being at the forefront of innovation, research and clinical trials, and being at the center of this unprecedented pandemic was no different,\" said Dr. Julia Garcia-Diaz, Director of Clinical Infectious Diseases Research and Infectious Diseases Specialist, and the principal investigator for 16 COVID-19 trials, including the Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccine trials. \"We continue to see our communities face large The Critical Importance of Being Part of the Solution Dr. Julia Garcia-Diaz \u2014 Clinical Infectious Diseases Research Dr. Victoria Smith \u2014 Family Medicine impacts from COVID-19. It is important that we participate in these studies to better understand how these vaccines best protect all the communities we serve.\" Dr. Victoria Smith, a family medicine physician and Associate Medical Director at St. Charles Parish Hospital, participated in the Pfizer trial in July 2020 and was one of the first patients in the system to enroll. \"I knew I needed to be part of the solution,\" Dr. Smith explained. \"As an African American physician, it was important for me to establish trust within my community. I wanted to be a model to my patients, to communities of color and overall, to encourage people to take part so we could end this pandemic.\" On December 14, 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccines were administered to healthcare workers across the nation. Ochsner played an integral role in making that happen. The following day, Dr. Smith received notification that she had received the vaccine versus a placebo in the double-blinded trial. \"It was a great day,\" she recalled. \"I'm grateful for the opportunity and proud to have been a part of history.\" \"I knew I needed to be part of the solution. As an African American physician, it was important for me to establish trust within my community.\" -Dr. Victoria Smith 31 OCHSNER HEALTH With Phase 2/3 COVID-19 vaccine trials underway by summer 2020, hope intensified for an FDA-approved vaccine under emergency use authorization before the end of the year. In August, Dawn Pevey, CEO of System Service Lines and Centers of Excellence; Debbie Simonson, System Vice President of Pharmacy Services and Centers of Excellence; Dr. Richelle Schiro, Vaccine Physician Chair; Matthew Malachowski, Pharmacy Systems Director and Kim Stewart, Manager of Strategic Programs, created a COVID-19 vaccine task force to begin brainstorming what an effective, widespread distribution would look like once a vaccine was available. Early on, storage and logistics proved daunting \u2014 but Debbie and her pharmacy team were more than ready. Mindsharing for Widespread Vaccine Distribution Dawn Pevey, Dr. Richelle Schiro, Matt Malachowski & Debbie Simonson The COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force \"Well before COVID-19 vaccines were authorized, we had the foresight to assess our total capacity to store vaccines for our own use and to assist with larger state efforts,\" explained Debbie. \"Because of our existing emergency preparedness plan, our experience with the Pfizer vaccine trial and our mind-sharing with hospital pharmacies and pharmacists across the nation, we were prepared for the complexity and large-scale storage and logistics requirements for the Pfizer vaccine. We started to study all of the vaccines in promising national trials and ordered appropriate storage well in advance to avoid potential backorders of the resources we needed.\" That early prep paid off. On December 14, Ochsner became the first in Louisiana to administer a COVID-19 vaccine, delivering first doses into 16,429 arms in the final two weeks of 2020. \"We had a team of hundreds of talented people who made this possible. This has been a rewarding experience and we are one step closer to reaching our goal \u2014 to get as many people vaccinated as we can so we can end this pandemic,\" Dawn said. \"Because of our existing emergency preparedness plan...we were prepared for the complexity and large-scale vaccine storage and logistics requirements.\" -Debbie Simonson 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 32The campus was buzzing on December 14, 2020 as the first 15 employees at OMC-New Orleans anxiously prepared to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Cameras were poised and Governor John Bel Edwards was present as Ochsner was ready to stream the momentous event live nationally via Facebook Live. Mona Moghareh, an inpatient pharmacist, was excited to start administering the vaccine. \"It was an honor to play such an extraordinary role in vaccinating the first person in the state,\" recalled Dr. Moghareh. \"We've been waiting for this day for a long time and it was the first proactive step toward battling this pandemic. I still remember the exhilaration of knowing we finally had something substantial that we could offer the community.\" Debbie Ford, Chief Nursing Officer at Ochsner Medical Center- New Orleans was the first employee to receive the highly anticipated vaccine.\"I was so excited I didn't even feel it,\" said Debbie. \"On the frontlines, we've seen so much death and suffering, and this was the light at the end of the tunnel. Being among my peers and being among the first to receive the vaccine was very emotional.\" As the vaccine continues to roll out, Debbie has a message to her peers and community. \"I would like to encourage everyone to get the vaccine. Together, we can eradicate this virus so we can live long and happy lives with our loved ones.\" Administering Louisiana's First Vaccination Dr. Mona Moghareh, PharmD \u2014 PharmacyDeborah Ford \u2014 Nursing \"We've been waiting for this day for a long time, and it was the first proactive step toward battling this pandemic.\" -Dr. Mona Moghareh 33 OCHSNER HEALTH COVID-19 RESPONSE 2020 Impact 1,000 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100April 7: 1,035 cases May 1: 363 cases March 6: casesJune 16: 113 casesJuly 27: 396 CONFIRMED POSITIVE CASES: Ochsner Owned & Operated | March-December 2020 Treated and discharged home more than 9,500 COVID-19 patients following treatment at an Ochsner hospital.

You just begin. Starting even before Ochsner's first COVID-19 case on March 11, 2020, that's what thousands of Ochsner employees did: prepared and planned for the unknown, and then confidently solved one problem after another, every single day, with courage and determination. This report tells some of these heroic stories. They represent just a few of the more than 32,000 healthcare professionals who delivered \u2014 selflessly, relentlessly \u2014 for our patients and communities. What helped Ochsner not only survive, but in many ways triumph, during such a tumultuous year? Teamwork \u2014 Teamwork is essential to how we serve patients every day. The dedication of Ochsner employees to serve others, around the clock, and even in the face of potential danger, exhaustion and uncertainty, was universal. Innovation \u2014 The pandemic escalated quickly \u2014 we found ourselves responding to our first COVID-19 patient and then, How do you describe the indescribable? How do you summarize a year so challenging, so filled with uncertainty, and so demanding of all our skills, knowledge, energy and faith? For everyone at Ochsner Health, the experience of 2020 was unlike anything we've ever encountered \u2014 or even imagined. Yet it also was a year that spotlighted the power of our purpose: caring for people. just 28 days later, caring for nearly 1,000 across our hospitals. Our ability to adapt quickly, leverage emerging technology and embrace innovative solutions during this period proved essential. From being first in the state to insource and rapidly scale COVID-19 testing, launching a free employee childcare program in under 72 hours, designing and locally manufacturing our own PPE, expanding digital health to increase virtual visits by nearly 10,000% or standing up Louisiana's largest statewide community testing infrastructure \u2014 our teams attacked problems quickly and delivered solutions in hours or days, not weeks or months. Commitment \u2014 We demonstrated our commitment to our employees and communities through deep investments in people. Throughout the year, we successfully redeployed thousands of existing staff and avoided layoffs or furloughs. Instead, we expanded our workforce. We vastly increased resources to care for our caregivers through well-being and wellness services. And we partnered with employers and schools across the state to help thousands safely return to work and the classroom.Leadership Perspectives Letter from Andrew Wisdom, Chair, Board of Directors & Warner Thomas, President & Chief Executive Offi cer 38 2020 ANNUAL REPORTAndrew B.

Reflecting on the past year fills us with immense gratitude. For the clinical and administrative staff who never gave up, for the patients and families who trusted us, for the generous donors who supported our work and for the communities whose confidence continues to inspire us.

Norah Williams, Ochsner Hospital for Children pediatric patient, plays with her mother, Chasity. 56 2020 ANNUAL REPORTHealthy State by 2030: A Bold Agenda to Move Louisiana Forward Ochsner Health has shifted course in our work to build healthier futures for our patients \u2014 moving from a healthcare system to a system that truly delivers on every aspect of health. It's a journey that requires us to view the health of people and communities through a lens of support for the whole person, including their physical, mental, financial and social well-being. To further that objective, in November 2020 we joined with Louisiana state leaders to announce Ochsner's 10-year vision for a healthy state, including a $100 million Ochsner investment during the first five years to address Louisiana's most critical health needs. In the United Health Foundation's most recent Healthy State Index, Louisiana ranked 50th in the nation for health outcomes, with high rates of smoking, obesity and high blood pressure being notable factors. Our state faces several critical challenges \u2014 including some of the country's highest rates of chronic conditions including cancer, diabetes and COPD. Improving the health of Louisiana means leveraging partnerships and innovation to make care more accessible, more affordable and more convenient. Ochsner's Healthy State by 2030 initiative includes investments to support projects that eliminate barriers to healthcare; bring resources into underserved, urban and rural communities; collaborate with partners to research and better understand health disparities; utilize technology and innovation to improve outcomes and invest in Louisiana's next generation of healthcare providers and frontline staff. Our goal is to move Louisiana up 10 points in the rankings within a decade. Highlights of the first phase of this holistic, multidisciplinary initiative include: The opening of 15 Ochsner Community Health Centers in underserved, rural and urban areas of the state over the next three years. A partnership with Xavier University to develop and fund the Ochsner Xavier Institute for Health Equity and Research, which will focus on key strategies to address health inequity in Louisiana. The introduction of the Ochsner Scholars program, which will cover medical school tuition for students who choose to practice psychiatry or primary care in Louisiana with Ochsner and focus on expanding workforce development programs for nursing and allied health professionals. Together these programs will increase our pipeline of skilled healthcare professionals while keeping extraordinary talent right here at home. The Brees Family Dream: Raising the Bar for Service To help realize Ochsner's vision to improve access to care across the state, Brittany and Drew Brees and The Brees Dream Foundation in 2020 made a remarkable $5 million gift to expand Ochsner's community health centers strategy. The first facility supported by their gift has opened in New Orleans East. Noted Drew Brees, retired New Orleans Saints quarterback, \"These community health centers across the region are breaking down barriers and paving the way for families to thrive and access critical healthcare services and resources. We're excited to continue our work with Ochsner to create a healthier state for all.\" 57 OCHSNER HEALTH Our commitment to open 15 Ochsner Community Health Centers in rural, urban and underserved communities is one of our most significant initiatives to drive better health outcomes throughout Louisiana. We asked three Ochsner leaders directing the initiative: Dr. Eboni Price-Haywood, Medical Director, Ochsner Xavier Institute for Health Equity and Research, Kevin Green, Vice President, Community Health Centers and Dr. Wanda Robinson, Medical Director, Community Health Centers, to outline their vision and describe how these facilities will deliver value to patients and communities.Ochsner's Community Health Centers: An Important New Vision Comes to LifeCOMMUNITY COMMITMENT Q: In designing the Community Health Center model, what were your core priorities? Dr. Price-Haywood: We are guided by three principles: building trust in the communities we serve, collaborating with neighborhood residents and creating access to great care that wasn't there before. Building trust is foundational \u2014 both with the patients we treat and the broader community. Providing great clinical care is Dr. Wanda Robinson, Dr. Eboni Price-Haywood and Kevin Green discuss the new health center strategy. not enough. For a patient to trust our medical advice, it needs to be simple to understand, feasible to do and personally relatable. We need to understand what the limitations and resources are in every neighborhood we serve, and tailor our delivery of care accordingly. Our community health model helps address the social determinants that are so important to improving health outcomes. 58 2020 ANNUAL REPORTCOMMUNITY COMMITMENT Dr. Robinson: In addition to recruiting excellent clinical staff, one of our biggest priorities ispositioning a community engagement specialist at each center who is responsible for driving local engagement at the neighborhood level. Their role is to make sure the community outside our health center door knows which resources we have available while helping us understand what the community needs so that we can match the right resources to them. It's an important way we will engage with local businesses, government leaders, clergy and other stakeholders to ensure the centers are effective. Q: What services are available at these health centers, and how do you decide where to locate them? Kevin: Our core service is primary care \u2014 including women's services, pediatrics, diabetes management and education, smoking cessation, hypertension management and, very importantly, behavioral health services \u2014 which is a growing need and one that is often unmet. Data, and our engagement with community stakeholders, drive our decisions on where to site these facilities. Our first group of centers reaches from New Orleans and Baton Rouge in southeast Louisiana, west to Lafayette and Lake Charles, and north to Shreveport and Monroe. It's truly a statewide initiative.Dr. Price-Haywood: As we take this initiative out to these communities, it's important to ask ourselves, \"Well, does that work for everyone? Does one size fit all? Do we really know what's the best way to deliver care for certain segments of the population?\" And that's where data is important. You have to have data transparency. You have to be willing to look at your information in such a way that you can examine your performance across these different domains of what we call the social determinants of health. Q: What are some of the capabilities available from the Community Health Centers that you expect to move the needle to improve overall health outcomes across the state? Kevin: In addition to our core offering, we'll also have targeted specialty services. The key is understanding which specialty needs are most prevalent in that community and where we can offer those services. What has been truly inspiring for me is the outpouring of support from all of our service lines. There's a tremendous willingness among all Ochsner's service line leaders, physicians and administrators to identify what works best for these communities. Dr. Robinson: Preventive care and health screenings are so very important to improving outcomes and addressing health disparities. So you'll see a big emphasis on these things at all of our centers. If we can help people to quit smoking, encourage patients to exercise and receive their cancer, blood pressure and diabetic screenings, we'll take a big step forward toward reaching our goal of a healthy state. 59 OCHSNER HEALTH Ochsner's work to build healthier communities takes many forms \u2014 and one of the most important is our sustained support for community-based programs that share our commitment to change and save lives. In 2020 Ochsner Health deepened that commitment with a new, five-year pledge of $1 million to Son of a Saint, a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the lives of fatherless boys in New Orleans while also inspiring mentorship. Ochsner's support for Son of a Saint will fund critical programmatic staff and enhance the organization's services to promote the whole person \u2014 mind, body and spirit \u2014 through healthcare educators, social workers and mental health providers. It will also provide opportunities for Ochsner's male staff to mentor boys in the program. Noted Ochsner President and CEO Warner Thomas, \"Our partnership with Son of a Saint is not only a monetary donation, but also an investment in the health, wellness and future of the young men of New Orleans.\"The organization's new permanent home in Mid-City is the Ochsner Health Son of a Saint Bivian Lee, Jr. Center. In addition to Ochsner the facility is named after the father of Son of a Saint Founder and CEO Bivian \"Sonny\" Lee III. \"The support from Ochsner Health is going to help deepen our impact,\" said Sonny Lee. \"Currently we have more than 130 boys in the program, and this level of partnership with Ochsner will help us to grow and reach 200 mentees by the end of 2021.\" Building Better Futures for Today's Boys with Son of a Saint \"Sonny\" Lee III, founder of Son of a Saint; Wall of Son of a Saint boys who participate in the community-based program.COMMUNITY COMMITMENT \"The support from Ochsner Health is going to help deepen our impact.

In response, Ochsner teams moved quickly to evacuate patients, deliver needed supplies and provide free virtual care to residents in southwest Louisiana. Hurricane Laura left a devastating impact on homes, businesses and community infrastructure \u2014 including hospitals. With facilities damaged, windows blown out and electric power and water supplies disrupted, the need was clear to act fast to take care of patients. \"So we stepped in,\" said Michael Hulefeld, Ochsner's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. \"Soon after the storm reached Lake Charles, Ochsner's Flight Care team kicked into high gear, working around the clock for 48 hours to transfer the highest-risk patients through air and ground transport. Within four days, Ochsner's Patient Flow Center had coordinated the evacuation of 48 adult and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patients from Lake Charles hospitals, including CHRISTUS Ochsner St. Patrick Hospital, CHRISTUS Ochsner Lake Area Hospital and Lake Charles Memorial Hospital to various Ochsner facilities. Our team is built to handle crises. In fact, that's when we do our best work.\" Unprecedented Storms, Exceptional Response Michael Hulefeld, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, is responsible for Ochsner Health's operations that served more than 900,000 patients from across the world in 2020. In a year filled with extraordinary challenges... Mother Nature presented yet another: an exceptionally active hurricane season, including Hurricane Laura \u2014 the strongest storm to make landfall in Louisiana in more than 150 years. Hurricane Laura damaged not only homes, but the city's power and water supply. Within 48 hours, all high-risk patients were transferred. Ochsner's Patient Flow Center worked around the clock to transfer patients.Sus re esseque es am expe pliquatiur, consectia voluptam et. Ochsner Baton Rouge collected supplies to help their Ochsner Lake Charles colleagues. After packing supplies all day in New Orleans, an 18-wheeler arrives in Lake Charles at sunset.Displaced Lake Charles-based Ochsner employees were provided the opportunity to work in other facilities whose operations were not impacted by the storm. And, just two days after Laura struck, Ochsner delivered an 18-wheeler full of relief supplies to CHRISTUS Ochsner St. Patrick Hospital to help kickstart recovery efforts. In the aftermath of the storm, Ochsner also stepped up to fill care gaps for residents of the Lake Charles region by offering free urgent care telemedicine visits via Ochsner Anywhere Care. The donated service allowed impacted individuals to visit with a doctor on their phone, tablet or computer 24/7. \"Because of the storm's severity, we knew the road to recovery for Lake Charles and other impacted communities would be long,\" said Mike. \"Stepping forward for our employees, our patients and our communities is part of our culture. It's just what we do.\" COMMUNITY COMMITMENT 61 OCHSNER HEALTH COMMUNITY COMMITMENT Accelerating Same Day Prescriptions The world changed as COVID-19 quickly spread, creating hotspots across the globe and in multiple states, including Louisiana. As a result, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a stay-at-home order on March 23, 2020, leading hospital clinics to close and non-emergency appointments to shift to virtual care. But what about healthcare necessities? For many patients, leaving home for a prescription during a mandatory quarantine was out of the question. With patient safety and convenience in mind, the Ochsner Retail Pharmacy and Telemedicine teams moved rapidly, extending their existing same-day prescription delivery service to become one of the first healthcare systems in the country to shift retail prescriptions to a same-day model. This was in addition to mail-order prescriptions, new curbside prescription delivery and limited on-site pickup options. Using technology developed by Ochsner and Phox Health, Retail Pharmacy and Telemedicine worked together on dashboards and armed their delivery couriers with real-time tools to monitor nearly 3,000 deliveries, audit signatures and trend patient ratings. And with the infrastructure in place prior to the pandemic, 500 Ochsner Anywhere Care Health Kits were delivered to quarantined patients, allowing Ochsner doctors to enhance virtual visits so patients felt connected to their care team. With patient safety and convenience in mind, the Ochsner Retail Pharmacy and Telemedicine teams extended their existing same-day prescription delivery service to become one of the first healthcare systems in the country to shift retail prescriptions to a same-day model.

Bottom right: Staff members at the newly expanded pharmacy at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans fill patient prescriptions for both in person pick up and bedside delivery. 62 2020 ANNUAL REPORTOchsner is a recognized leader in digital medicine, and one of our most impactful initiatives is the Connected MOM program, which allows expectant mothers to stay connected to their Ochsner care team from the comfort of home. The program provides moms with a kit of connected devices, including a scale and a blood pressure cuff, that seamlessly communicate with our Epic electronic health record system, allowing clinicians to monitor her well-being wherever she is. \"Through Connected MOM, issues such as high blood pressure or excessive weight gain can be identified earlier,\" said Dr. Jody Morris, System Co-Chair, Women's Services, \"not just when a woman shows up for her routine prenatal appointment.\" Policymakers have taken notice of this Ochsner initiative, recognizing that maternal and infant mortality rates are far too high, especially within underserved communities, and that these outcomes are often preventable. U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician, has joined with three bipartisan Senate co-sponsors to introduce legislation aimed at improving healthcare for expectant mothers. The Connected Maternal Online Monitoring Services (MOM) Act requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) to provide coverage recommendations for remote devices to check blood pressure, blood glucose and pulse rates. The goal of the legislation, named after the Ochsner Health Digital Medicine program, is to improve maternal and infant outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women nationwide. \"Research indicates that roughly 60% of maternal deaths in the United States can be prevented,\" said Dr. Joseph Biggio, System Co-Chair, Women's Services and System Chair, Maternal Fetal Medicine. \"If more broadly available, digital medicine solutions, including devices that can remotely monitor patients' vital signs, can help support the health and well-being of pregnant women and their babies, saving lives and improving outcomes. We're excited about the potential of the Connected MOM Act to drive meaningful change in both Louisiana and the nation.\" Better Connections Mean Better Outcomes for Moms and Their BabiesCOMMUNITY COMMITMENT Samantha Ross, Connected MOM program participant. 63 OCHSNER HEALTH REGIONAL GROWTH Putting expert, compassionate care within reach of more patients in more communities underpins Ochsner's growth agenda. Last year we established new partnerships and deepened existing ones, expanded cancer care facilities, made specialized clinical services more widely available in communities that need them most, and announced major new long-term investments in an array of outpatient and inpatient services across the Gulf South. Dr. Shaunda Grisby, an Ochsner Lafayette General Medical Center provider, discusses plans for regional growth in Lafayette, LA. 64 2020 ANNUAL REPORTWelcome to the Family, Ochsner Lafayette General In October 2020, Lafayette General Health officially joined Ochsner Health, becoming Ochsner Lafayette General (OLG), with a plan to enhance the health of Acadiana residents. Dr. Robert Hart, Ochsner Health Chief Medical Officer, and Dr. Amanda Logue, Ochsner Lafayette General Chief Medical Officer, discuss the benefits of the combination and preview the compelling future ahead. Q: Both Ochsner and Lafayette General were long aligned in how you approach serving patients and communities. Now that you are united together, describe that shared vision. Dr. Logue: For several years both of our health systems have been working toward changes to improve health across our communities and move Louisiana forward. But we recognized that it was hard to do alone. Coming together will accelerate our progress toward achieving those objectives and deliver real benefits to the residents of the Acadiana region. Dr. Hart: Access, quality and the expansion of subspecialty care are important, but so is preventive care, helping patients make healthier choices and expanding digital medicine to deliver care in innovative ways. These are capabilities that we will fully leverage as we work to improve the health of more Louisianans. 65 OCHSNER HEALTH Q: What are some of the benefits Acadiana residents will see as a result of this merger? Dr. Hart: In the near term it starts with a $94 million investment at Ochsner Lafayette General Medical Center to grow capacity and provide better access, including construction of a new hospital tower with six inpatient floors, increasing the number of adult beds by 48 with space for future growth that would include 72 additional beds. We'll also expand women's services, including more labor and delivery rooms and increased NICU beds so that more mothers and babies can receive care locally, together. Also on tap is an expansion of the Cancer Center of Acadiana, which will nearly double its existing size. Dr. Logue: And that's just the first portion of Ochsner's 10-year plan to invest $465 million in Acadiana, which will infuse capital and vital resources needed to expand healthcare access, digital medicine and technology, and workforce opportunities. Community members in Acadiana are really looking forward to the expansion of services and connected care to Ochsner for when there's a need for quaternary services such as transplants. Q: What are some of the other ways the community and your workforce will benefit? Dr. Hart: To advance and help build the talent pipeline we will be investing in graduate medical education to train physicians at OLG by adding approximately 48 new residency positions to help train the physicians of the future. Additionally, a 10-year, $10 million Community Support Fund will be created to advance health and wellness across Acadiana, promote workforce development and address other community priorities.

For both Andrea Charles, an Environmental Services manager, and Hillary Fernell, a dietary technician, this change is already making a massive impact on quality of life for both leaders and frontline staff. \"I've been working with Lafayette General since I was 18 years old,\" said Andrea. \"As a manager, I take pride in personally knowing my employees. I know about their personal lives and their struggles, especially this year with the pandemic and how they've had to rearrange their lives with schools going virtual and daycare closing. \"It was an exciting day to be able to tell my 110 employees about the opportunity and the immediate growth they would see in their next paycheck thanks to the merger with Ochsner Health. I've never seen so many smiling faces at once! I had several employees who were doing two shifts in order to make ends meet who now are able to spend more time with their families. Impact of Minimum Wage Increase \"I've noticed a difference in their overall demeanor at work and I know offering this higher pay will also make it much easier to hire new employees when the time comes.\" \"My job may not be clinical,\" explained Hillary, \"but as a dietary technician, I believe in going over and above for my patients. You never know what someone is walking through in their life. What someone has walked through. My time with each patient may be brief, but my goal each time I walk into a room \u2014 COVID-19 permissible \u2014 is to bring a smile to their face. \"But like them, I too walk through hard things in life,\" Hillary continued. \"I am a newly single mom and this extra income couldn't have come at a better time. It has made all the difference for my children and me. The financial gain is helpful, but the investment I feel in me as an employee, in me as a person, is what matters more.\" 67 OCHSNER HEALTH When Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport was established in 2018, a central goal was to provide more accessible and more efficient care that meets evolving community needs, including more world-class physicians to serve the Northwest Louisiana population. Since the partnership formed, more than 200 new physicians have joined the system. The additional physicians, ranging from primary care to unique subspecialties, have contributed to the increase in number of patients served while training and teaching future physicians in their faculty roles with LSU Health Shreveport \u2014 School of Medicine. The critical importance of access to the best care by the best physicians took on enhanced significance in 2020 as the Northwest Louisiana organization adapted to address the many challenges of the COVID-19 crisis while leveraging the capacity at the Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport \u2014 St. Mary Medical Center. In April, Women's & Children's inpatient services was relocated from its location on Kings Highway to the St. Mary Medical Center, thereby creating space for its ICU expansion of more than 100 additional beds to accommodate a possible surge. By renovating St. Mary Medical Center to accommodate inpatient pediatric, labor and delivery, Neonatal ICU and Pediatric ICU patients, much-needed space was Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport: Expanding and Adapting in Real Time created to expand adult intensive care capacity back at the Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport \u2014 Academic Medical Center hospital. The ICU expansion project followed guidance from state public officials to improve surge capacity for COVID-19 patients and represented a critical step in the re-opening of Northwest Louisiana. The Smallest Miracle Four months after her birth, Dionna Taylor, the smallest-ever baby to be born and discharged from a hospital in Louisiana, left Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport for home. Weighing just 11 ounces at birth, Dionna overcame setbacks and ultimately thrived during her stay at the facility's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Physicians noted that she headed home without many of the developmental challenges many preemies face. \"We didn't know if she was going to make it or not, but the good Lord had other plans. That's why she's my miracle baby,\" her mother Penny Taylor said.

The new $5.3 million, 11,000-square-foot facility offers a full array of primary care, general pediatrics, obstetrics and women's services. The center features 15 examination rooms as well as rooms for ultrasound, pelvic floor therapy and laboratory services. Kiosks and smartphone check-in add safety and convenience for patients when they begin their visits. As patient volumes increase over time, the facility has the capacity to add another 8,000 square feet of space for clinical and other services. Bluebonnet South is yet one more example of Ochsner's sustained investment to add facilities and capabilities in the Baton Rouge Bluebonnet South: Deepening Our Strong Commitment to Baton Rouge region.

Ochsner Cancer Center \u2014 Baton Rouge Opens New Mohs Surgery Center For certain skin cancers, especially those of the head and neck, the preferred treatment option is Mohs micrographic surgery, a specialized procedure to precisely identify and remove the entire tumor layer by layer, while leaving the surrounding healthy tissue intact. In 2020, Ochsner expanded our Baton Rouge dermatology capabilities with the opening of a new $2 million Mohs Surgery Center and the addition of Mohs-trained surgeon Dr. Nicholas Frank. As the most exact and precise method of dermatologic tumor removal, the Mohs procedure minimizes the chance of regrowth and lessens the potential for scarring. Noted Ochsner Baton Rouge dermatologist Dr. Kelli Hall, \"We are extremely excited to offer this procedure to patients in Baton Rouge and the surrounding areas, who for the first time have access to a Mohs surgeon at Ochsner.\" Dr. Frank is thrilled to return to his native Louisiana and launch the new facility. \"This space is state of the art, spacious and comfortable for both the staff and the pa tients. It's been a really great project to see come to fruition.\" REGIONAL GROWTH 69 OCHSNER HEALTH Already renowned as one of the leading comprehensive destinations for cancer care in the Gulf South and beyond, the Gayle and Tom Benson Cancer Center at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans took another important step forward in September 2020 with the completion of a $56 million facility expansion. Made possible by the generosity of Ochsner donors, including a $20 million gift from Mrs. Gayle Benson and her late husband, Tom Benson, the Cancer Center has now doubled in size. With its new capacity, more than 18,000 patients will be cared for here annually by a multidisciplinary team of specialists and subspecialists to treat more than 20 different types of cancers. \"Ochsner's emphasis on treating the whole patient through our Integrative Oncology Program, a holistic approach developed to individually treat the patient in body, mind and spirit, is reflected in the design of the expanded Benson Cancer Center,\" said Dr. Zoe Larned, Chair of Hematology/Oncology. \"That's one of the ways our approach is different.\" Among its features: A new patient wellness space for integrative services like physical therapy, nutrition, acupuncture, meditation and yoga 58 personalized and semi-private chemo infusion stations Dedicated infusion and clinic spaces for bone marrow transplant patients A multidisciplinary clinic where patients benefit from a collaborative approach to cancer care and Ochsner Precision Cancer Therapies Program researchers In conjunction with the expansion, the Lieselotte Tansey Breast Center relocated to the Benson Cancer Center to further integrate the multidisciplinary treatment approach. The Benson Cancer Center remains home to the largest clinical trials network in Louisiana, including early-phase trials that can treat cancer at the molecular level through our Precision Cancer Therapies Program and pinpoint those at the highest risk for cancer through our Hereditary Cancer Program, which supports prevention and early tumor detection through high-risk screenings.

It's the largest building project Ochsner has undertaken on Louisiana's Northshore. The new center more than doubles the space of the previous St. Tammany Cancer Center and will provide west St. Tammany Parish residents \u2014 patients, caregivers and loved ones \u2014 greater access than has ever been possible before to more coordinated cancer services across different specialties. \"When you think about the vulnerability of an individual in the process of treatment or the early stages of awareness that they have a cancer diagnosis, it is so important that they have the resources to surround them and support them and their families,\" said Joan Coffman, President and CEO of St. Tammany Health System. \"Ochsner and St. Tammany's combined resources and expertise are behind this comprehensive cancer care program that covers everything from screening and prevention to treatment, surgery, clinical trials Northshore: Ochsner and St. Tammany Health System Set a New Bar for Cancer CareREGIONAL GROWTH Slidell Memorial Hospital: Extending Critical Partnership and Strong Support During the COVID-19 Surge The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on relationships, both personal and professional. The partnership between Slidell Memorial Hospital (SMH) and Ochsner Health has grown even stronger through this crisis. The partners' shared response helped to bond employees in various units, and the teamwork was incredible. At the start of the pandemic Ochsner and SMH developed a daily call to assess needs, including beds, staffing and equipment. As COVID-19 progressed and Ochsner's South Shore hospitals were inundated with patients, coordination calls that included the Regional Referral Center became critical to alleviating operational pressure. SMH was able to assist in decompressing Ochsner hospitals by taking many of their ICU and medical/surgical patients from places like Oc hsner Medical Center \u2014 West Bank Campus and Ochsner Baptist. Not only were patient transfer needs met, but also equipment needs necessary to care for those patients. Ventilators were exchanged, and PPE needs were readily met to accommodate existing and transferred patients. The communication between the two partner facilities proved invaluable, with both organizations supporting not only each other but also the residents of St Tammany Parish and southwest Mississippi. Partners, indeed. and survivorship. Our multidisciplinary team of expert doctors, clinicians and support specialists offer services to treat the entire person, and in both design and programming our approach reflects a holistic view and a focus on caring for all the unique and complex needs of our patients and their families. This is where we really stand out.\" 71 OCHSNER HEALTH In the year since Teche Regional Medical Center became Ochsner St. Mary, the facility has taken important steps toward realizing the goal of improving access, expanding services and delivering high-quality care to residents of St. Mary Parish and the Bayou region. An acute care, 164-bed hospital, Ochsner St. Mary serves St. Mary Parish and surrounding, mostly rural, communities with a broad array of services including inpatient and outpatient facilities, an intensive care unit, a full-time emergency department, maternity suites and inpatient behavioral health. Since its transition to Ochsner St. Mary in late 2019, one of the most important early initiatives has been implementation of the Epic electronic health record system, critical to ensuring interoperability between the hospital and other Ochsner facilities and partners. \"With the implementation of Epic, patient information can now be securely accessed by all Ochsner providers. That means that no matter where Ochsner St. Mary: Expanding Services and Capabilities in the Bayou Region a patient chooses to visit, the medical staff at that facility will have full access to the patient's medical record, ensuring the highest quality of care,\" said Fernis LeBlanc, CEO of Ochsner St. Mary. With Epic now in place, St. Mary patients also have access to Ochsner's patient portal, MyOchsner, to schedule appointments, place orders for prescription refills, communicate with providers, view lab results, access their health history and more. Part of Ochsner St. Mary's strategic agenda is to continue to expand the range of services to create access and address unmet needs within the community. In 2020, Ochsner St. Mary upgraded its Women's Services program to include a new OB/GYN physician group, added multiple Telemedicine and Behavioral Health services including geriatric psychiatry, and welcomed new sleep disorder services and a comprehensive outpatient wound care center for patients with non-healing wounds. The hospital also enhanced the physical building with upgraded lobbies, roof replacement, an upgraded pharmacy and the renovation of its Emergency Department. Ochsner St. Anne Hospital Recognized for Excellence Ochsner St. Anne Hospital in Raceland, Louisiana, last year earned a 2020 Guardian of Excellence Award awarded by Press Ganey, a firm that provides healthcare solutions that address safety, clinical excellence, patient experience and workforce engagement. The Guardian of Excellence Award recognizes top-performing healthcare organizations that have achieved the 95th percentile or above for performance in patient experience.

In 2020 that collaboration was strengthened with the establishment of a new strategic partnership between the organizations that expands access to Ochsner and Singing River: Delivering Care to Mississippi's Gulf Coast Expanding Family Care in Long Beach In 2020 we expanded Ochsner's presence in the Mississippi Gulf Coast region with the addition of a new clinic in Long Beach, providing greater access to quality care for residents of Harrison County. The new facility provides access to primary care, pediatrics and related services, with the look and feel of a small group practice while sharing in the support and resources of Ochsner Health. \"This new clinic is yet another example of Ochsner's commitment to providing healthcare options to the Mississippi Gulf Coast,\" said Wilson Thomas, CEO, Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 Hancock. \"It represents a meaningful investment in the construction of the new facility, and in new jobs for Mississippians in healthcare.\" high-quality, innovative and cost-effective care in the communities throughout the region. According to Singing River Health System CEO Lee Bond, the partnership creates an array of benefits for Singing River and the communities it serves. \"Partnering with Ochsner Health brings Singing River the scale that we need to grow our services and our technological and digital capabilities in areas such as telehealth, digital monitoring and artificial intelligence. In addition, Singing River benefits from expanded access to clinical research and clinical education opportunities to train the next generation of healthcare leaders.\" In October the Ochsner-Singing River partnership expanded with the acquisition of Garden Park Medical Center in Gulfport, creating Ochsner Singing River Gulfport. It is a full-service, 130-bed acute care hospital including a Level III trauma center and family birth center, and like the partnership's other facilities in the region, it's known for exceptional patient care. Singing River's three hospitals located in Gulfport, Ocean Springs and Pascagoula, along with Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 Hancock, are recognized by the Leapfrog Group with an \"A\" Hospital Safety Grade. The four hospitals provide half a million community residents with access to high-quality care along the Mississippi Gulf Coast and surrounding areas. REGIONAL GROWTH Lee Bond, CEO of Singing River Health Systems, speaks at the ribbon cutting of Singing River Hospital - Gulfport, in partnership with Ochsner Health.

To continue to strengthen our workplace culture, we launched a range of consequential initiatives around diversity, equity and inclusion, expanded our commitment to professional well-being and celebrated the essential role of the nurse and midwife in delivering compassionate, expert care. Carmen Floyd, RN, utilizes a decompression space, a dedicated area where staff can quietly unwind before or after a shift. 74 2020 ANNUAL REPORTHelping Staff Stay Strong in Challenging Times In the best of times and even for the most experienced clinicians, providing exceptional care to patients brings with it a certain amount of stress. In the worst of times, during a year that brought a rapidly increasing flow of desperately ill people, the stress that clinicians and support staff manage can become unimaginable. In 2020, faced with an unprecedented crisis, programs designed to address the normal stresses of healthcare had to be entirely reconsidered. According to Dr. Nigel Girgrah, Chief Wellness Officer, the focus of Ochsner's Office of Professional Well-Being rapidly pivoted. \"We shifted from helping clinical teams realize their full potential and a sense of belonging in the workplace, to really having to think about physiological safety at work. People can't do a good job if they're worried about being infected with COVID-19, worried for their own safety, worried about whether or not they will continue to get a paycheck or whether their colleagues are going to be furloughed.\" Robust and transparent communication across every level of the organization addressed those concerns, as did a commitment to providing adequate PPE, safe and accessible childcare and a safe workplace.Within the first week, the office partnered with the Behavioral Health service line to create 24/7 crisis intervention lines, not just for physicians and APPs, but for any staff in need of immediate support. Instead of waiting for exhausted clinical staff to seek assistance, the team reached out to conduct rounds, checking on teams' well-being and offering assistance. R. John Sawyer II, PhD, clinical neuropsychologist and Medical Director for Professional Staff Experience, said, \"We talked to them a lot about how you get meaning out of this experience, because with trauma, if you don't get meaning you get stuck worrying about what you could or should have done. Once people recognize that they are all experiencing this same trauma, it becomes less isolating, and they can talk about it. Something as simple as a debrief with a mental health professional at the end of a shift or at the end of a week's work can be very beneficial.\" Dr. Sawyer conducted one such debrief with a group of Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 Kenner ICU nurses coming off their shifts. \"Leading up to this, I could see the team was struggling with anxiety and the loss of so many patients,\" shared Dr. Alisha Lacour, Associate Medical Director of OMC \u2014 Kenner. \"The session was very well-received and a lot of great information was shared about coping strategies and reframing. Little did I know how well it was received. The next night, every single outgoing nurse came to the session. \"We talked to them a lot about how you get meaning out of this experience, because with trauma, if you don't get meaning you get stuck worrying about what you could or should have done.\" -Dr. R.

An RN and an attorney, Deb brings decades of healthcare experience through leadership roles in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), quality and compliance. Her expertise could not have come to Ochsner at a more consequential time. We asked Deb to reflect on her experiences and new initiatives in the first year of her new role.Leading an Intentional Strategy to Drive Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Q: 2020 was an unprecedented year for Ochsner and for all Americans. As you reflect on the year, what stands out? Deb: I've called it a year of two pandemics. The first, of course, was COVID-19. But we also had the pandemic of social unrest and the fight for racial justice. And what those two pandemics did was highlight the inescapable need for the work that I've been passionate about for my entire career \u2014 longstanding economic and racially driven health disparities. COVID-19 and the events of the last year converged and ignited the need and the desire for us to go big in this area in a way we haven't seen in many years.

Bottom row from left: Cameron Tillman, Director, Ochsner Medical Center-New Orleans; Deborah Grimes, System Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer; Arina Riley, Director, Northshore.WORKPLACE STRENGTH Q: The Ochsner Health Board of Directors laid out the vision and identified the need to create this new role back in 2019, and you hit the ground running in the first year. Share with us some of the progress Ochsner is making in DEI. Deb: Our work is guided by a five-pillar strategy: provide equitable care; develop diverse and inclusive leadership; create an inclusive environment for patients, their families, our employees and clinicians; establish a comprehensive supplier diversity program; and, finally, develop an inclusive internal and external DEI communications strategy. The infrastructure we have created and the array of initiatives we launched in 2020 all tie back to those five pillars. We now have hundreds of people 76 2020 ANNUAL REPORTWORKPLACE STRENGTH working to own this strategy across the system, including nine regional DEI directors who are partnered with every community hospital CEO to take what we're doing at the system level and hardwire it at the regional and campus level. Q: It seems that listening to and engaging with Ochsner employees across the system is a big part of your work. Deb: It is, and it includes our engagement with our eight Ochsner Resource Groups that represent more than 4,400 employees, the work of our System DEI Leadership Council and our more than 155 listening sessions last year that cracked open honest and raw conversations with our teams. In this space, doing the right thing is a personal journey, and it is one that has to be done with respect and humility. It is a partnership. It is not us deciding what the right thing is. It's listening and then responding to what we heard from employees \u2014 and then doing something about it.Q: In terms of recruitment, hiring and workforce development, what are some of the opportunities for improvement? Deb: We are not as diverse as we want to be, and we are on a journey to do something about that. We have a great talent management process, but it was not yielding the diversity we want, so you have to find out why. We implemented the first house-wide implicit bias training for all of our leaders. Now, before we begin interviewing for a position, we're committed to making sure we have a racially diverse slate of candidates. We also implemented a range of training and mentorship programs to get high-performing candidates ready for the next step in their careers. That's what success looks like: it's intentional, it's creative, it's giving people the tools and support to grow into increased responsibility. Q: Given your long career in this field, what stands out to you about Ochsner? Deb: I can honestly say I don't think I could have gone through this past year with a better group of leaders. A crisis helps you to see people at their most vulnerable, and you learn a lot from an organization that's able to adjust so quickly and to actually thrive in the middle of a pandemic. That's a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and so what a great opportunity for me to be a part of that journey. \"That's what success looks like: it's intentional, it's creative, it's giving people the tools and support to grow into increased responsibility.\" -Deb Grimes 77 OCHSNER HEALTH Even as Ochsner employees worked on the front lines battling COVID-19, providing expert, compassionate care to thousands of patients while helping communities strengthen their response to the pandemic, there was another crisis that impacted all of us in 2020: social unrest and the fight for racial justice. While Ochsner's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is not new, the events of the year brought into sharper focus the opportunities to raise our goals, expand our initiatives and strengthen our workplace culture \u2014 work that we undertook with a sense of passion and urgency. A broad spectrum of DEI accomplishments highlighted the year, beginning with the hiring of Ochsner's first Chief Diversity Officer, Deb Grimes. Working in collaboration with other senior Ochsner leaders and our Board, Deb and her team deepened employee engagement around DEI goals and objectives, expanded training programs We Believe: Deepening Ochsner's Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and implemented new measures to advance our supplier diversity goals. Included among the year's achievements: Grew the number of Ochsner Resource Groups (ORGs) to eight, adding two new ORGs created for Asian-American and Pacific Islander staff and for those with disabilities. Formed Ochsner's first System DEI Leadership Council comprised of ORG presidents, system leaders and Board members. Hired Ochsner's first DEI team members, including nine regional directors to align system and local strategies, and team members to manage the ORGs and the supplier diversity strategy. Launched DEI education and training programs across the system, including those focused on unconscious bias, which attracted significant levels of employee participation. WORKPLACE STRENGTH 78 2020 ANNUAL REPORTEvery day we recognize Ochsner's more than 7,000 talented and committed nursing team members who provide the heart and soul of our outstanding patient care. So, we were particularly gratified when the World Health Organization named 2020 The Year of the Nurse and Midwife globally \u2014 a year to educate, create awareness and spotlight the incredible work that takes place in nursing practice around the world. As 2020 began, we could not anticipate what these dedicated professionals would be called upon to do. As Ochsner Health's Chief Nursing Officer and System Vice President of Quality Tracey Moffatt noted, \"2020 truly became nursing's finest hour \u2014 right here in Louisiana and all around the world. I watched as so many heroes, but especially our nurses, flew into action. Our team rose to the occasion and went far beyond anyone's expectations.\" Across our system, Ochsner nurses, like nurses everywhere, battled a wide range of challenges: The isolation. The uncertainty of the virus and the fear of the unknown. The concern that they could become infected themselves or infect their family and loved ones. The challenge of social distancing and being unable to hug patients and their families. The need to somehow remain positive while dealing with their own uncertainties. Even in the midst of these unprecedented challenges Ochsner nursing continued to gain recognition at the highest levels. Two of our campuses, Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 New Orleans and Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 Baton Rouge, were designated as a Hospital of the Year by the Louisiana State Nurses Association. The Year of the Nurse and Midwife \u2014 And One Like No Other Meanwhile, the nurses on Ochsner's Flight Care team assisted with transporting COVID-19 and other critically ill patients in response to the most challenging hurricane season in years. And to address the pressing need for increased personnel, the Collaborative Staffing Resource Center team sourced and secured over 500 additional nursing staff in just over a month to support new hospital units dedicated to caring for COVID-19 patients. \"Our nurses made enormous sacrifices to lead and serve,\" said Tracey. \"But nobody signed up for what 2020 delivered. It was a hard, messy year that brought bigger challenges than we've ever experienced. But Ochsner's thousands of nurses showed up, they fought valiantly \u2014 and they won.\" smartphone to learn more about the Ochsner nurses profiled through the Dear World project. 79 OCHSNER HEALTH ACADEMICS & EDUCATION The academic pipeline for the next generation of medical professionals must grow \u2014 and Ochsner continues to deepen our commitment to meeting that challenge. Among important initiatives: a new partnership with Loyola University to establish a four-year undergraduate nursing program and the Ochsner Scholars Program, offering a tuition-free education to medical students annually committed to practicing primary care or psychiatry at Ochsner. Jennifer Pritchett, special education teacher at Bonnabel High School, utilizes Ochsner's clear masks to teach her students. 80 2020 ANNUAL REPORTAcademic Focus: Building a Robust and Diverse Pipeline Long committed to programs that train the next generation of healthcare professionals, Ochsner in 2020 continued to raise the bar with new academic partnerships and investments. Chief Academic Officer Dr. Leo Seoane and Chief Nursing Officer Tracey Moffatt discuss their priorities and the strategic framework behind these initiatives. Q: Ochsner has shown a sustained commitment to academic programs that expand the pipeline of healthcare professionals. Let's set the stage: why are these programs so necessary? Dr. Seoane: We simply do not have enough clinicians in Louisiana today and, if current trends continue, the shortage of trained professionals will only worsen over time. At the national level, there's a projected shortage of up to 122,000 physicians by 2032, including a shortfall of as many as 55,000 primary care physicians. The availability of primary care providers is one of the most important measures in assessing the health of a state \u2014 it's closely correlated with health outcomes. Louisiana ranks in the bottom quartile in that category, and these shortages are particularly acute in rural and underserved communities. Expanding the pipeline of clinicians is a part of how we advance Ochsner's Healthy State objectives. Tracey: The data around nursing in our state also points to the need to do more. About 37% of Louisiana's RNs are over age 50, 17% are over age 60, and a substantial number of today's nurses indicate they plan to leave their jobs or retire soon. Perhaps most concerning is the fact that, last year, about 31% of qualified applicants to RN training programs were denied admission because Louisiana schools lack the capacity and the faculty to train them. In order to have enough nurses in the coming years, we must address this gating factor. Q: How will the Ochsner Scholars Program help meet some of these challenges? Dr. Seoane: Ochsner has committed approximately $15 million over the next five years to cover medical school tuition for eligible physicians practicing psychiatry and primary care who commit to practice at an Ochsner facility for at least five years. As populations continue to grow and age and healthcare demands increase, the supply of primary care doctors and mental health specialists is just not there. Offering a tuition-free medical education provides a strong incentive for students with an interest in primary care and psychiatry 81 OCHSNER HEALTH while also removing the barrier of heavy student loan debt. We expect the program to ramp up to support 30 students annually at LSU Health Shreveport and the University of Queensland Ochsner Clinical School. And to help advance our health equity objectives and ensure we have providers who represent the communities they serve, we will prioritize students from underrepresented groups. Q: Tell us about your expanded commitment to academic nursing programs. Tracey: In 2018, we established an alliance with Chamberlain University College of Nursing in which students have the exclusive opportunity to complete their clinical rotations at Ochsner facilities. That program now has nearly 300 students enrolled and is on track to graduate more than 100 RNs annually. In 2020, we were thrilled to announce a new partnership with Loyola University to establish a four-year, full-time undergraduate nursing program. Ochsner will provide Loyola undergraduate nursing students with clinical faculty and clinical placements \u2014 eliminating a common barrier nursing programs encounter when seeking clinical experience for their students.Q: How would you assess your progress in addressing the shortages of medical professionals? Dr. Seoane: We believe these programs, along with others, are positioned to not only expand the pipeline, but also increase the number of diverse medical professionals. That's especially relevant in roles like physician assistants, where minorities are very underrepresented. Ochsner's partnership with Xavier University goes back to the 1980s and today it includes several initiatives, including the recently launched physician assistant program. Xavier has the distinction of having placed more Black or African American providers in medical school than any other university in the United States. They have a terrific record, and we're excited to partner with them in a variety of new initiatives. Tracey: Pursuing workforce development in such a comprehensive way is a heavy lift, and the work we're doing feels good. As the state's largest healthcare provider, I believe Ochsner has that obligation, but not every organization picks up that mantle. We are truly privileged to be in a position to work with colleges and universities to invest in, shape and build the kind of workforce we need for Louisiana, Mississippi and the entire Gulf South. Xavier Physician Assistant Program Welcomes Inaugural Class The Xavier University Physician Assistant (PA) Program, established in partnership with Ochsner, welcomed its inaugural class of 39 students in January 2020. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19 and virtual and hybrid learning, engagement remained high during a successful first y ear. PA students have now begun to complete approximately 2,000 hours of hands-on clinical experience through 11 rotations at various Ochsner facilities. The 28-month master's level program is one of several Ochsner-Xavier collaborative partnerships aimed at increasing the number of medical professionals. More than 56% of the entering 2021 class are diverse students \u2014 advancing Ochsner's commitment to train more healthcare providers who resemble the communities we serve. Says Xavier Program Director Varsha Castro Gusman: \"The future of the healthcare system is projected to be collaborative and diverse, with many different prof essions working at their highest levels to care for patient needs,\" said Varsha. \"Our PA program has the potential to have a great impact on the health of our communities. Graduates will acquire the knowledge and skills needed to advocate for patients, reduce disparities in access to healthcare, recognize and treat disorders, and advance prevention of chronic disease.\" ACADEMICS & EDUCATION 82 2020 ANNUAL REPORTACADEMICS & EDUCATION Top: Receiving a white coat is an iconic rite of passage for a doctor-in-training.

But 2020 was anything but normal \u2014 and in the face of a global health crisis more than 150 students stepped forward to take on new roles to assist members of the public and families of COVID-19 patients. Like so many others, Ochsner medical students ran toward the front lines in a time of crisis. On March 14, Donald Chang, an Ochsner Clinical School medical student and President of the Ochsner Medical Student Association, received a call from Dr. Dodd Denton, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs at Ochsner, explaining that Ochsner's COVID-19 hotline had been overwhelmed with more than 1,500 calls almost overnight. \"'Could medical students help fill the gap?' That was the ask,\" said Donald. \"Within 24 hours we heard from more than 150 interested students. The following Monday the Ochsner Clinical School standardized testing center was transformed into a makeshift call center, and students were onboarded to learn the nurse triage call center procedure. The response was swift and represented what makes Ochsner medical students great.\" The 168 student volunteers triaged patients calling in with COVID-19-related symptoms or questions, logging more than 2,800 support hours. Then another call for help came in \u2014 this time from the front lines. The Family Communication Champion Project was created because physicians were spending hours each day calling patients' worried families with updates, as hospitals were no longer allowing visitors. The need to communicate, while essential, was impairing physicians' ability to provide care, so students became liaisons and lifelines, offering families timely updates and The University of Queensland-Ochsner Clinical School Student Volunteers Step Up As the crisis unfolded, Ochsner Clinical School students stepped forward to fill the gaps, including these students taking calls at the busy phone center.ACADEMICS & EDUCATION The 168 student volunteers triaged patients calling in with COVID-19-related symptoms or questions, logging more than 2,800 support hours.keeping channels of communication open so physicians could spend more time with patients and families could feel more connected to loved ones. \"At Ochsner, we rolled up our sleeves and met this pandemic head-on,\" said Donald. \"The dedication, commitment and tenacity Ochsner medical students showed reflected why we pursued medicine to begin with. And that's to help people.\" 84 2020 ANNUAL REPORTSeveral years ago, Ochsner took hands-on clinical training to an entirely new level when we created the Ochsner Clinical Simulation and Patient Safety Center \u2014 known as the Sim Center.

Featuring high-fidelity human patient simulators to mimic the physiologic functions of a real patient, it allows medical personnel to acquire and practice clinical skills in a safe but realistic environment. As the pandemic arrived in Louisiana, the Sim Center was tasked with an entirely new and essential role \u2014 helping Ochsner team members rapidly adapt to the unique demands presented by COVID-19. \"Personal protective equipment (PPE) training was an obvious early need, both for protecting those providing care and limiting waste,\" said Dr. Michael Smith, Medical Director of the Sim Center. \"Across the country, other clinical staff shared best practices, such as moving pumps and monitors outside of the patient's room so they could be adjusted without the need to fully don PPE.\" Under normal circumstances, most healthcare workers do not wear full PPE. So, in addition to promoting the importance of rigorous Simulation Center: A Relentless Commitment to Staying Prepared handwashing, the Sim Center helped create videos and educational materials addressing proper PPE practices. A collaborative effort between Infection Control and Nursing Professional Development learners, the videos focused on proper use of PPE, both putting it on and taking it off while avoiding contamination. A substantial element in Ochsner's COVID-19 response was the reassignment of team members to take on new roles in areas where they were most needed. With its comprehensive training capabilities, the Sim Center helped prepare frontline workers to successfully make the transition to their new assignments. The Center also sought answers to a range of practical clinical questions during the early period of the fast-moving crisis. \"We investigated barriers during intubation, tested devices to 'split' a ventilator \u2014 thankfully never needed \u2014 and examined how much aerosolization occurs with nebulizer treatments and noninvasive ventilation,\" said Dr. Smith. A focus on adaptability and a relentless commitment to staying prepared positioned the Sim Center to fully prepare team members to meet the clinical challenges of COVID-19. Dr. Michael Smith is the Medical Director of the Ochsner Clinical Simulation and Patient Safety Center.

In addition, our recognized leadership in digital medicine technologies helped safely treat and monitor thousands of patients \u2014 keeping them healthy throughout the crisis. 86 2020 ANNUAL REPORTAs the largest academic medical center in Louisiana, Ochsner's research is targeted to respond to our communities' greatest needs. The entire Ochsner Research team, from physician-scientists to residents to medical students, is dedicated to the goals of continuously improving patient care, treatment outcomes and community health. The unprecedented events of 2020 caused Ochsner's research leaders and teams to direct their focus to a range of research initiatives that could help clinicians develop better therapies and address the myriad challenges presented by the global health crisis. The effort was led by Dr. Julia Garcia-Diaz, Director, Clinical Infectious Diseases Research and Medicine Subspecialties and Samantha Bright, Director, Clinical Research. \"These research leaders nimbly and swiftly mobilized our resources and energy into decisive actions that brought therapeutic COVID-19 clinical trials across the spectrum of the pandemic crisis,\" said Dr. W. Mark Roberts, Ochsner's Dean of Research. \"In two of these multi-country trials, Ochsner was at the leading edge of research contributions, enrolling the first U.S. subject in one and the first subject in the world in the other. Additionally, our Center for Outcomes and Health Services Research promptly established a library of COVID-19-infected patients' clinical information, which served as the basis for nearly 40 projects that have led to a far greater understanding of the COVID-19 disease.\"A Research Focus Aligned to Meet Emerging Challenges Clinical trials like the prevention and treatment trials for COVID-19 can lead to therapeutic breakthroughs and bring hope to patients nationwide. Ochsner's research studies and clinical trials examined health disparities in COVID-19 incidence and outcomes, the safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody treatments, and the safety and efficacy of the drug tocilizumab to \"calm the storm\" of cytokine release syndrome in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Ochsner also took part in the HERO-HCQ study, designed to determine whether hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, could be effective to help prevent high-risk health workers from contracting the illness. Beyond clinical trials, Ochsner's Biobank collected COVID-19 patient specimens, leading to studies that characterized the nature of the virus to better understand and correlate its biology with the clinical course observed in infected patients. The contributions of our research team in 2020 exemplified Ochsner's commitment to meeting the needs of patients in the communities we serve and tackling the most pressing health challenges of our time. \"In two of these multi-country trials, Ochsner was at the leading edge of research contributions, enrolling the first U.S. subject in one and the first subject in the world in the other.\" -Dr. W. Mark Roberts Hannah Knight (left) and Almedina Tursunovic (right) are technicians in the molecular microbiology lab. 87 OCHSNER HEALTH INNOVATION & RESEARCH innovationOchsner: A Fast-Moving Team Drives Innovation in Crisis Fast design. Fast prototyping. Fast user feedback. Fast product delivery. When faced with a rapidly escalating health crisis and a potential shortage of necessary supplies, the ability to rapidly innovate is not just nice \u2014 it's essential. innovationOchsner (iO), an innovation lab founded in 2015 by Ochsner Health, has a bold mission to reimagine and revolutionize the experience and delivery of healthcare. As the pandemic reached Louisiana, the iO team immediately got to work designing and building response projects that leveraged the team's diverse expertise in digital health, engineering and data analytics. Said Pete November, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, \"While Ochsner had a sufficient level of PPE throughout the crisis thanks to the ingenuity and planning of our Supply Chain team, iO mobilized quickly and worked with Supply Chain and other internal teams to be proactive about finding additional sources. We were operating in our natural state: maximizing relationships built on collaboration and teamwork to solve complex problems under very uncertain conditions.\" The first and most time-sensitive project was producing protective face shields for frontline staff, and multiple products followed thereafter. Recalled Aimee Quirk, innovationOchsner CEO and Interim Senior Vice President of Digital Health, \"We tapped into our prototyping expertise in iO and the manufacturing expertise of the local entrepreneurial community, which had available capacity due to the pandemic. These partnerships were a win-win because we were able to produce our own supply to keep our staff and community safe, while creating economic opportunity for local businesses.\"According to Dr. Korak Sarkar, Medical Director of Ochsner's Neurosciences Medical 3D Lab, \"We leveraged the lab's engineering and manufacturing expertise along with existing local materials and fabrication resources. We deployed additive manufacturing \u2014 usually referred to as 3D printing \u2014 to create a prototype, integrate clinical feedback and quickly crystalize design. Once design was finalized, we moved to production at scale.\" iO partnered with local organizations like NOLA Couture, a high-end clothing and accessories firm, to develop and manufacture protective masks and isolation gowns. \"Really what it took was just expanding the team we had,\" explained NOLA Couture owner Cecile Hardy. \"It's been wonderful to keep our staff working. After just a few weeks we had hired 96 outside sewers to create thousands of gowns and masks for Ochsner's frontline providers.\" Production was underway within a week, and more than 30,000 shields were manufactured and delivered to multiple hospitals throughout the Ochsner Health system. It was the first of iO's many projects to help fill the gaps. The team prototyped 15 products and produced eight different PPE items for distribution in Ochsner facilities in 2020, including face shields, isolation gowns, several types of face masks, hand sanitizer and others. Said Dr. Sarkar, \"We were working fast, but diligently and professionally, to ensure that we were providing quality, effective and safe equipment to our frontline providers. Our success is a testimony to the ingenuity, flexibility and collaborative nature of our clinicians, non-clinical support staff, administrators and community.\" From left: Pete November, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Sorting PPE in an Ochsner storage facility. 88 2020 ANNUAL REPORTOchsner is a recognized national leader in telehealth and digital medicine programs \u2014 adept at leveraging innovation and technology to share clinical expertise across facilities, and solutions to better manage chronic disease, keep pregnant moms healthy, and enhance access and convenience in primary care. Those capabilities proved especially valuable in 2020, as both patients and providers had to quickly adapt to a socially distant and increasingly virtual environment. Early in the pandemic it became apparent that individuals with chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension were at a much greater risk of experiencing negative health outcomes from COVID-19. The Ochsner Diabetes and Hypertension Digital Medicine Program provided these vulnerable patients with a tangible solution to manage chronic conditions from home, reducing the number of in-person visits required while keeping them tethered to their health team. Ochsner's digital medicine programs help patients balance medication and lifestyle changes needed to keep chronic conditions under control. \"Our dedicated care team monitors patients' digital device readings while driving personalized results through lifestyle coaching and medication management,\" said Dr. David Houghton, System Chair of Telemedicine. Our virtual direct-to-consumer urgent and primary care Ochsner Anywhere Care program also proved invaluable to connect with, and treat, patients with COVID-19 symptoms, as well as those with more routine needs. The program experienced explosive growth in 2020 as Ochsner performed nearly 325,000 virtual visits \u2014 up from just 3,300 in 2019. Our comprehensive telehealth and digital medicine infrastructure and solutions also produced high levels of patient satisfaction, earning a Net Promoter Score of 87.5 out of 100 \u2014 even higher than those of consumer services like Amazon and Netflix.Telehealth and Digital Medicine Deliver for Patients \u2014 and Providers In the inpatient setting, digital solutions that allow clinicians to consult with one another about patient care, and to remotely monitor patients, added significant value. Telehealth at Ochsner began more than a decade ago with a hospital-based pediatric echocardiogram program and subsequently expanded to include programs for stroke and psychiatry, among others. In 2020 Ochsner performed nearly 100,000 provider-to-provider encounters across our health facilities and partnerships. In addition, remote vitals monitors were deployed to 174 patient beds to limit staff exposure as they kept continuous watch over patients. Our comprehensive telehealth and digital medicine infrastructure and solutions also produced high levels of patient satisfaction, earning a Net Promoter Score of 87.5 out of 100 \u2014 even higher than those of consumer services like Amazon and Netflix.INNOVATION & RESEARCH Jennie Miele, RN, a nurse in the eRN program, answers a call from the Ochsner Medical Center \u2014 West Bank Campus 5th floor COVID-19 step-down unit. This program leverages existing technology to provide bedside nurses redeployed during COVID-19 24/7 access to consultations with experienced nurses through video conferencing. 89 OCHSNER HEALTH Changed Forever, Overnight \"Over the past five years, Ochsner Health Network has grown to include more than 3,000 doctors and advanced practice providers focused on revolutionizing patient care delivery with value-driven care concepts,\" explained Dr. David Carmouche, Executive Vice President of Value Based Care and Network Operations and President of the Ochsner Health Network. \"And overnight, the COVID-19 global pandemic shined light on the critical staying power of value-based care.\" \"When the world hit the pause button with strict COVID-19 social distancing and quarantine mandates, healthcare performance scores tanked across the country. That's when OHN gathered some of our brightest minds and biggest hearts to overcome pandemic barriers. We rose to the occasion,\" said Dr. Carmouche. In 2020, one in three U.S. patients did not receive their age-based recommended cancer screenings, while two in five missed their wellness checkups. And for the first time in 60 years, U.S. healthcare spending was down \u2014 and by an astounding $76 billion. For OHN, our patient care statistics beat those alarming trends by a mile. With OHN's powerful Epic-based digital medicine tools, Healthy Planet platform and population health insights, our team adapted to a \"new normal\" in patient care delivery \u2014 both behind the scenes and, for the first time in healthcare history, at the virtual bedside. OHN's efforts to support providers clinically and operationally, especially with telehealth, created an important bridge during the pandemic. These efforts translated to virtual connections with patients, ensuring their needs, like blood pressure control, blood sugar monitoring, weight management and other disease-specific support services were managed, as indicated in the table below. Meanwhile, the newly adopted virtual capabilities allowed clinicians to preserve their practices. Overall, Ochsner conducted nearly 325,000 virtual visits in 2020 \u2014 a 10,000% increase over 2019. Thanks to forward-thinking team leadership and sophisticated network infrastructure, OHN successfully supported the preservation of more than 500 million patient-provider relationships, despite unprecedented challenges caused by the biggest healthcare crisis in a century.
