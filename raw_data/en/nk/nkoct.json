During their fourth and final year, students complete month-long advanced practice experiences at practice sites at UMMC, throughout Mississippi, and other states. The University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy has been serving the state's pharmacy educational needs since 1908. The school consists of four academic departments - BioMolecular Sciences, Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery, Pharmacy Administration, and Pharmacy Practice - and a Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Within RIPS is the National Center for Natural Products Research, the Pii Center, and the Center for Pharmaceutical Marketing and Management, with a fourth center - the Center for Clinical and Translational Science - opening in July 2017. Pharmacy research spans the translational spectrum from basic science to clinical trials and community-based research. Research initiatives are aimed at finding breakthroughs that will allow patients to live fuller, healthier lives. Pharmacy students and residents often participate in these efforts, as well as in advocacy for their profession and for patients. UMMC is home to SOP Clinical Affairs, Department of Pharmacy Practice faculty, staff, and residents, NCNPR/Biomolecular Sciences faculty, the Division of Pharmacy Professional Development, and soon the Center for Clinical and Translational Science.
