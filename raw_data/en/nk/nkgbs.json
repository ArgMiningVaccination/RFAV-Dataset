Science has shown that getting vaccinated is much safer than getting sick. Side effects from vaccines are minimal, and vaccine benefits are significant. Vaccines protect children against dangerous and potentially deadly diseases that can cause serious illness, paralysis, deafness, brain damage and even death.

Health experts have studied how long it takes for vaccines to give children immunity for each disease, and created a safe vaccine schedule to keep kids protected. You can still get infected if you have been vaccinated, but it's less likely.
