There are so many options and factors to be educated on to make sure you are choosing the right products for you. The amount of research that goes into creating a skin-care product and testing its efficacy takes years. Most of the progress and discovery in skin-care science, such as ingredient discovery, is thanks to medical-grade skin-care companies like the notable SkinCeuticals, the dermatologist favorite EltaMD, and Obagi Medical. The formulations are potent \u2014 usually a step below, if not comparable to, prescription products, and they are backed by testing and clinical trials. This type of skin care is usually sold exclusively in dermatologists' offices, medical spas and clinics, and at Dermstore. This retailer is at the forefront of research and innovation, and that's often reflected in the price. However, your whole routine doesn't have to be medical-grade to reap the benefits. We highly suggest having one to three medical-grade products maximum in your routine \u2014 the rest can be affordable finds from the drugstore or department stores.
