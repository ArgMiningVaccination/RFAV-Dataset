The basis of Oriental Medicine is found in the processes of nature - in the environment's ability to undergo change and regain balance. The Chinese classic, the I Ching, states that, \"Everything is subject to change and therefore in motion.....there are interlocking cycles of change...one cannot bid the winds and waves to cease, but one can learn to navigate treacherous currents by conducting ourselves in harmony with the prevailing processes of transformation - and thus weather the storms of life.\" Eastern medicine, including acupuncture, is based on the idea that all of life functions as nature does, shifting from moment to moment. Change is a dynamic, essential process that can seem intimidating and feel unfamiliar......but it can also be the adventure of a lifetime! Commonly Treated Conditions...

What is Oriental medicine and how does it work? Oriental Medicine is the oldest, professional, continually practiced medicine in the world. This medical system's written literature stretches back almost 2,500 years and archaeological evidience of acupuncture extends back as far as 4,000 years ago. Oriental Medicine works by re-establishing balance and harmony within the body. this means balance between Yin and Yang; between the Five Elements of fire, earth, metal, water, and wood; and between the Qi, Blood , and Body Fluids. Balance is re-established by supporting the body's healthy energy and dispersing any unhealthy energy. What methods are used to re-establish balance? The main professionally applied methods of re-establishing blance are acupuncture and oriental herbal medicine. These methods regulate and build the body's life force energy of \"Qi\", which circulates through pathways in the body called \"meridians\". In addition, practicioners may use moxibustion (stimulation of acupuncture points using heat), nutritional counseling, traditional cupping and exercises such as Meditation, Tai Qi, or Qi Gong to address their patient's conditions.
