She joined a competitive club in fifth grade, excelled at the sport in high school and was recruited to play in college. Her freshman year at the University of Iowa, Nasenbenny ran, kicked and dodged her way through the first full game of the varsity season. The next day at practice, the unexpected happened. Nasenbenny tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her right knee. \"It was a major bummer,\" Nasenbenny recalled. She had surgery in Iowa to repair the torn ACL and dedicated herself to rehab. Her efforts paid off, and she was able to play soccer again the following summer. iNjUry d \u00e9j\u00e0 vU Her knee health was short-lived. Later that season during a game at Purdue University, Nasenbenny made a hard cut to her right and instantly knew she had reinjured her ACL. Her parents\u2014who were in the stands at that game\u2014received a fervent recom - mendation from other local parents for NorthShore Orthopaedic Institute Surgeon Mark Bowen, MD. Dr. Bowen, a sports medicine specialist with knee and shoulder injury expertise, has worked with many professional athletes and serves as team physician for the Chicago Bears. After the initial consultation, Nasenbenny and her parents felt totally confident that Dr. Bowen was the right choice to repair her knee. \"I researched him and really liked what he had to say.

Femur (ACL) is the most important of the four ligaments that stabilize the knee. Injuries to this ligament are common and can lead to knee instability and further damage to other structures in the knee. Surgeries to reconstruct the ACL have been refined over the last 30 years. In the advanced CoLS \u00ae repair technique\u2014available at NorthShore Orthopaedic Institute\u2014the patient's own hamstring tendon is harvested and quadrupled, then grafted to the bone to replace the torn ACL. The hamstring graft is suspended by tapes that are secured into the femur and tibia using screws. This strong fixation minimizes slippage while the graft heals into the bone.Did You k now? \"We looked at what Dr. Bowen had accom - plished in his surgical career and were confident in his talent,\" said Nasenbenny's father, Dane. \"But even more importantly, he made us feel like Katie was his only patient. My wife and I have been in sports our whole lives, and this guy is the best. His bedside manner and how he explains things are everything you would look for in an orthopaedic surgeon.\" trAilbl AziNG exPerti Se A recognized expert in the innovative CoLS \u00ae technique, Dr. Bowen was one of the first American surgeons to perform the advanced reconstructive procedure that involves harvesting one of the patient's hamstring tendons, which is then quadru-pled and used as a graft to repair the torn ACL. The tissue-sparing procedure is less painful and results in an easier rehab than the traditional method of using the patellar tendon to repair the knee, explained Dr. Bowen. \"One of the main benefits of the CoLS technique is the strength of the graft,\" said Dr. Bowen, who describes it as a superior fixation for the graft, by drilling sockets in the bone to implant the new graft rather than the conventional technique of drilling all the way through the bone for attachment. \"The chance of these grafts slipping is much, much less,\" he said. There were additional challenges in Nasenbenny's surgery, as Dr. Bowen had to navigate around previous hardware used to secure the original graft performed in Iowa, but the CoLS procedure was a complete success. Dr. Bowen has performed hundreds of these procedures on amateur and professional athletes alike and now teaches the technique to other surgeons. Nasenbenny again devoted herself to rehab and was able to return to college soccer. \"I wasn't ever the best player or the most talented player, but no one worked harder than I did,\" she said. During her junior year, the Iowa women's team took second place in the Big Ten Conference tournament and made it to the NCAA playoffs, the first time in the school's history. \"It was awesome. I played a lot and was proud of our success,\" said Nasenbenny. \"I wouldn't have been able to do that if Dr. Bowen hadn't fixed my knee.\" Are Wome N more SUScePtible? ACL tears are not uncommon in college and professional sports. But female soccer players are among the highest-risk groups. \"There's been a lot of research and a lot of theories,\" said Dr. Bowen, who believes it is likely that a combination of factors\u2014including the intensity of the game, anatomy and limb alignment\u2014account for the high injury rate. Sadly, before her final season, Nasenbenny suffered another injury. This time she tore her ACL in her left knee during practice. \"I knew right away,\" she said. \"We just needed to pick a date that would work with my schedule and get back home for surgery with Dr. Bowen.\" Nasenbenny had another successful surgical repair with Dr. Bowen using the same CoLS technique. Now a college graduate, the 23-year-old is no longer playing soccer. After rehab from her last surgery, Nasenbenny is once again back to full strength but channeling her athletic pursuits in new directions. She runs, bikes and swims, and she plans someday to do a marathon and perhaps an Iron Man triathlon. \"She can absolutely continue as an active athlete,\" said Dr. Bowen. \"It's very rewarding as a surgeon to cheer for patients like Katie.\" 7 orthopaedic i nstitute Surgeon Dr. Mark Bowen is a recognized expert in the advanced coLS technique, which uses patients' own hamstring tendon to repair their torn ac L. after suffering her second ac L injury, Katie Nasenbenny's parents Dane and Mary received multiple recommendations to consult NorthShore orthopaedic i nstitute Surgeon Dr. Mark Bowen .Avert Injury Follow these tips to reduce your risk for an ACL injury: WArM uP: Get blood circulating to your muscles and joints before you start any physical activities.

But rather than providing relief, the medication only bred frustration. Opioids are designed to reduce the intensity of pain signals reaching the brain, but they did not work in Cirrincione's case. \"These strong pain relievers may be standard protocol for this kind of condition,\" he explained, \"but they didn't relieve my pain. I actually felt much better after taking ibuprofen instead.\" Cirrincione's experience illustrates how a person's unique DNA can affect his or her response to certain medications. This burgeoning area of medicine\u2014known as pharmacogenomics\u2014is transforming patient treatment and outcomes through NorthShore's new Center for Personalized Medicine. eye-oPeNiNG iNS iGH tS Curious about the importance of genetics in prescribing medica - tion, Cirrincione had a simple cheek swab at NorthShore's Pharmacogenomics Clinic. \"Tony underwent genetic testing to study 15 genes specifically involved in metabolizing and transporting drugs,\" explained Mark Dunnenberger, PharmD, BCPS. \"NorthShore's Pharmacogenomics Clinic is the only clinic of its kind nationwide with services available to all patients regardless of condition or disease. It focuses on how an individual's genetic makeup, or DNA, influences his or her response to medications.\" Cirrincione was wowed by the results. \"The findings surprised me because the results had specific information related to me\u2014and to my family,\" he said. \"Now this data is in my medical record and can serve as an important reference point when my doctors need to make deci - sions about my care.\" The Clinic includes a team of genetic counselors, specially trained pharmacists and medical geneticists who help patients understand and use genetic test results to optimize current and future treatment with targeted, effective therapies. By providing information about specific genes, pharmacogenomics improves the likelihood that patients will receive the safest and most effective drug and dosage when they need drug therapy. Drugs most affected by a person's genetic makeup include some medications to treat heart conditions, depression, gastrointestinal disorders, infectious disease, epilepsy and chronic pain. miNimizi NG triAl ANd e rror \"Tony's case is a perfect example of how pharmacogenomics is most valuable when a patient needs medication,\" said Dr. Dunnenberger. \"When we looked at his genetic test results, we found that he has two variants in his mu opioid receptor gene. This means he inherited a gene mutation and has no normal receptors to respond to opioids. If he had these results up front, his physicians would have been able to provide pain relief sooner.\" Cirrincione's results also revealed that based on his genetics, his body would not respond to certain anticoagulants\u2014or blood thinners\u2014such as Plavix\u00ae. \"My parents and brother died of cardiovascular disease,\" he added. \"Having this information in my medical record ahead of time will influence treatment decisions if I ever develop heart disease myself.\" In addition to benefiting patients with individually tailored drug therapy, pharmacogenomics gives physicians a powerful clinical decision-making tool with immediate and practical applications. \"Typically, physicians use evidence-based information on which medication is most likely to work and prescribe it on a trial-and-error basis,\" said Dr. Dunnenberger. \"Pharmacogenomics now empowers them to get ahead of a medical problem by giving them discrete, concrete data to better choose the best drug therapy for an individual patient with a particular condition.\"NorthShore's new Pharmacogenomics Clinic at the Center for Personalized Medicine offers genetic testing and interpretation to enhance drug therapy, from selection to dosage.

For Geneva Fulwiley, a Chicago Heights resident, eating and drinking became a distant memory following treatment for throat cancer in 2006. Fulwiley had retired her dreams of dining at restaurants or relishing the taste of desserts, as her doctors at the time offered no solutions. \"The hardest part was always the holidays, to see the cake coming out and see everybody gathered,\" said 59-year-old Fulwiley. \"I would leave the room and pour my meal into the feeding tube.

It is a healthcare partnership that has served her well, especially when a dangerous health scare surfaced five years ago. Following unexplained weight loss, Kowal's affiliated primary care physician Jeffrey Geohas, MD, sent her for a CT scan that found a mass in her right lung confirmed to be cancer. \"I've always had good health,\" Kowal said, \"but when I was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer, it was life-changing.

His father was one of six sons. His mother is one of seven. Flanagan himself has five siblings, and he and his wife have five children. Thirty members of the Flanagan clan recently traveled together for a family vacation. Now this close-knit family has a new, shared mission. It revolves around their health and identifying common genetic factors that predispose them to cardiovascular disease. Flanagan's paternal grandfather died of a heart attack at the age of 47, and three of his dad's brothers died prematurely from coronary disease. \"My dad is the oldest living Flanagan male at 77,\" he said. The family always thought that some of the uncles probably did not take great care of themselves. But then tragedy struck the next generation, when a cousin suffered a serious cardiac event at age 47 and another died of cardiac arrest at age 53. tHe Po Wer o F Ge Nomic S Hoping to change the course of his family's health history, Flanagan turned to NorthShore's new Center for Personalized Medicine, which customizes patient care and treatment based on an individual's unique genetic characteristics and health history. Flanagan decided it was time for his family to learn more about what they could do to cut their risk factors for serious illness. \"The first step was to test one person from each family,\" explained NorthShore Cardiologist David Davidson, MD, who has specialized expertise and board certification in lipidology\u2014or managing cholesterol. Joseph Flanagan was the first to undergo blood tests, and Dr. Davidson was able to quickly identify a fairly common genetic abnormality called lipoprotein(a) or LP(a)\u2014which creates bad cholesterol more prone to forming coronary blockages.Extended Clan l earns the Value of personalized, p reventive h ealthcare By Susan J. White continued on the next pageFFaMilY FoC us 14 connections FALL 2015 \"When you look at a normal cholesterol panel, the numbers might not look that bad. But with this genetic factor and a family history, it needs to be more aggressively treated,\" said Dr. Davidson. Testing of additional family members revealed that Flanagan's brothers also carry the same LP(a) genetic mutation. \"Dr. Davidson said this is likely the gene that contributed to our uncles' shortened lives,\" Flanagan recalled. \"We're trying to past generation.\" tArGeted, Preve Ntive Str AteGieS A former college basketball player, 51-year-old Flanagan already had fairly healthy habits, exercising several times a week and eating a reasonably healthy diet. Dr. Davidson conducted several more tests, including a cardiac ultrasound, to rule out any immediate problems and develop a baseline to measure against. Based on that data, he increased the statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) Flanagan was on, prescribed some supplements and offered personalized dietary recommendations.One by one, Dr. Davidson is now addressing each Flanagan family member's risk factors and treating them with personalized and specific treatments including medication, dosage and dietary changes. \"The more you can get rid of the bad cholesterol, the less chance of it attaching and blocking arteries,\" he added. \"Across our family, we started sharing our medical tests, and all the boys have this gene, which gives us a higher risk,\" noted Flanagan. \"We can all lose a little weight, and we're trying to eat as healthy as we can and exercise more. I really like Dr. Davidson's measured approach. He's not judgmental, and he's practical about his recommendations and talking to us about eating better. We're all embracing this together.\" Flanagan is hoping his cousins will embrace the process, too, and ultimately he and his siblings will involve their children as well. \"Without NorthShore's focus on Personalized Medicine, this wouldn't have happened,\" said Flanagan. \"It's amazing seeing the power of this all integrated with my family.

But last year, Herring found it more difficult to maintain her active lifestyle when she developed pelvic organ prolapse. A common condition among women who have had children, pelvic organ prolapse occurs when the muscles and tissue surrounding the uterus and bladder weaken. It often leads to pain, pressure and urinary problems. \"Prolapse is something women typically don't like to talk about,\" said Herring. \"Most women who have the condition just live with it, because they're unaware of treatments that can help.\" rePAir W itHoUt Hy Sterectomy That was not the case for Herring, who went online and read about a pioneering technique at NorthShore developed by Urogynecologist Roger Goldberg, MD, to repair prolapse without a hysterectomy. Herring recalled saying to herself, \"He's the one who's going to do my surgery.\" \"In the past, the only option women had for certain types of pelvic organ prolapse was total hysterectomy,\" explained Dr. Goldberg, who holds an academic appointment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. \"But new surgical techniques to preserve the uterus now offer patients more effective and diverse treatment options than ever before.\" diScoveri NG Ne W t reAtme Nt oP tio NS Dr. Goldberg has led NorthShore's efforts in developing minimally invasive uterine preservation surgery and studying its safety and effectiveness. His research recently was published in the International Urogynecology Journal . He has been invited all over the world to teach the new procedure. Physicians also have traveled to NorthShore to observe and learn. \"I'm proud that NorthShore has contributed this innovative technique in women's health and that I work with talented partners to offer such a wide array of treatments,\" he added. Additionally, a three-year National Institutes of Health (NIH) randomized clinical trial is under way to compare NorthShore's technique with traditional hysterectomy. \"This NIH study demonstrates that other top-notch medical centers see this as a valuable option,\" said Dr. Goldberg, who noted the surgery might not be an option for every patient. \"This procedure changed my life,\" remarked Herring, who also enjoys the convenience of managing her care on the go through the secure online portal NorthShore Connect . Recently enhanced features allow patients to schedule more specialty care appointments, set reminders and communicate with their doctors on the Web or via the mobile app. \"Prolapse is so common,\" Herring added. \"Women should know they have a range of options to treat it\u2014especially at NorthShore.\" Trailblazing treatment NorthShore Pioneers Advanced Procedure for Pelvic Organ Prolapse By Martha FlobergHealthcare for what's next.

A team of investigators led by NorthShore Endocrinologist Liana Billings, MD, MMSc, has launched new studies and clinical trials to more deeply examine the DNA architecture that underlies diabetes. The hope is that by understanding an individual's diabetes based on his or her unique genetic makeup, clinicians can better personalize care for a disorder that is often treated with a one-size-fits-all approach. diScovery t HroUGH coll Abor AtioN \"One of our more exciting studies is PHARMGen, a pharmacogenomics study involving more than 1,000 patients at four medical centers across the country,\" explained Dr. Billings. \"By analyzing an individual's DNA, we'll better understand how genetic variations influence a patient's response to the drug Metformin\u2014a commonly used oral medication to treat Type 2 diabetes.\" In collaboration with researchers at The University of Chicago Medicine, Dr. Billings also is spearheading FIND MODY (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young), a research project that focuses on patients younger than age 40 with diabetes caused by genetic mutations. \"More than 80 percent of individuals with MODY are misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated for Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes,\" said Dr. Billings, who also holds an academic appoint - ment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. \"As a result, they could be prescribed unnecessary insulin injections instead of an oral medication to control blood glucose.\" \"One of the key barriers to diagnosing MODY is identifying appropriate patients for genetic testing,\" added research partner Rochelle Naylor, MD, a diabetes specialist at the University of Chicago. \"Our collaboration with NorthShore has broad implications for translating knowledge of diabetes genetics into improved outcomes and can serve as a model for other diseases as well.\" NorthShore's Dr. Liana Billings (left) and Dr. Rochelle Naylor from the University of chicago are collaborating on genetic research to improve care for diabetic patients.Deep Dive into Dna Researchers Seek Genetic Path to More Effective Diabetes Treatments By Martha Floberg Join the Conversation Learn about what's next in managing diabetes.

Thanks to the expertise of clinicians at NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center\u2014in collab - oration with Mayo Clinic\u2014Jaffe is feeling fine, and is back to his happy and healthy routine with his wife Cheri and their two young daughters. teAm A PPro AcH to S PeciAlized cA re What Jaffe originally thought was a bad case of diverticulitis\u2014an infection of the colon\u2014turned out to be something far more serious: colon cancer that had spread to his lymph nodes. Fortunately, Jaffe was under the care of a seasoned medical team. NorthShore Surgeon James Spitz, MD, successfully removed the cancerous tissue, followed immediately by a consultation with Kellogg Cancer Center Oncologist Matthew Adess, MD, for postsurgical treatment. Both physicians hold academic appointments at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. Because the cancer had spread, Dr. Adess recommended that Jaffe undergo six months of chemotherapy. But he opted to leave radiation out of the treatment plan, as he did not believe there was a proven benefit. Still, in an effort to review all options, Dr. Adess suggested a second-opinion consultation through NorthShore's ongoing collaboration with the Mayo Clinic Care Network. Jaffe welcomed the opportunity to have experts from two leading health systems weigh in.\"I was confident with Dr. Adess's recommen- dation, but it was certainly an additional boost of confidence to have the Mayo consult,\" said Jaffe. \"I strongly believe in second opinions,\" noted Dr. Adess, whose recommended course of treat - ment was reinforced by Mayo Clinic Oncologist Steven Alberts, MD. \"I think all of us treating complex cancers find it helpful at times to review and discuss care plans with other clinical colleagues,\" said Dr. Alberts. \"We do electronic consults with a number of insti - tutions, and the people at NorthShore are clearly very knowledgeable experts in cancer care.\" cUS tomized t reAtme Nt Pl AN Chemotherapy was not easy, but Jaffe persevered. \"Dr. Adess was always reassuring and even offered to reduce the strength of the chemo if necessary. He made us feel like it was doable,\" recalled Cheri Jaffe. The couple also praised the NorthShore Highland Park Hospital Kellogg Cancer Center team for their care and compassion. \"The nurses and everybody were terrific,\" said Jaffe. \"They really took good care of me.\" Jaffe did what it took to ensure the best chance of beating the cancer, added Dr. Adess. \"He's a vibrant guy and doing great with a life expectancy of many years.\" Second-opinion expertise As the only Chicago-based health system within the Mayo Clinic Care Network, NorthShore is able to offer patients the benefit of experts from two leading health systems working together for the best patient outcomes. \"The interaction between NorthShore and Mayo allows several physicians to think through a situation,\" explained Mayo Clinic Oncolo - gist Steven Alberts, MD, who collabo - rated with NorthShore Oncologist Matt Adess, MD, on Mickie Jaffe's colon cancer care plan. \"It's a positive for the patient to draw on the knowledge of this additional expertise,\" he added.

If so, fluctuating hormones can wreak havoc in your body as you journey through perimenopause\u2014the six- to 10-year period before actual menopause hits. h ot flashes, sleepless nights and low libido are a few of the symptoms that may leave you wondering if you will ever feel normal again. NorthShore Integrative Medicine Specialist Mina ryu, MD, and affiliated OB/ gYN Linda h olt, MD, who both hold academic titles at the Pritzker School of Medicine, offer expert insight into new drugs and natural remedies that can help you feel better. Q. What's the best way to control symptoms? A. Dr. Holt: The most effective treatment is hormone replacement therapy using estrogen, but that carries a risk for cancers. Newer drugs called selective estrogen- receptor modulators\u2014such as tamoxifen and raloxifene\u2014have the benefits of estrogen on certain tissues and can help prevent breast cancer. Flibanserin will likely be the first drug approved by the FDA for treating low libido in women, but side effects and other factors may limit its use to treat perimenopausal symptoms. Q. What about effective natural therapies? A. Dr. Ryu: Nutritional strategies include adding soy and flax to your diet. Moderate exercise, reducing stress and maintaining a healthy body weight also can ease symptoms. Botanicals like black cohosh and red clover can help cool hot flashes. You might also consider acupuncture, with or without traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Since stress can make symptoms worse, I always encourage patients to try meditation, yoga and breathing exercises. When these are not adequate, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy may work well. These are hormones that are chemically identical to those your body produces and are available as a prescription. It's best to individualize treatment to provide relief while preventing age-related illnesses and minimizing cancer risk.copiNg wit H cHaNge NorthShore Gynecologist Margaret Salamon, MD, offers suggestions for relieving some of the discomforts that menopause may bring.
