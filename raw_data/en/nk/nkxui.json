I have put together a few tips for helping you get off the tiredness merry go round. Enjoy! *Tiredness can be a symptom of lots of medical conditions so if you are feeling very fatigued and it has been ongoing then please go and see your doctor! Keep on top of stress Stress and anxiety are definitely linked to feelings of fatigue and tiredness. This can be multifactorial - from messing up sleep patterns, reducing focus so you feel as though you need to work longer, impacting on thyroid and adrenal health. Its not as easy as saying \"just destress\"but there are ways to minimise the response that you have to stress - organization, journalling, mindfulness techniques, adaptogens and optimal nutrition. See my tips for stress reduction [here](https://mistydayplantpotions.co.nz/blog/keeping-calm-when-under-stress) Get some exercise but not too much If there was an exercise pill, it would be a panacea. It seems kind of counterintuitive to expend energy when your energy is low but it has all sorts of benefits for making you feel less fatigued. Even just a short walk can have you feeling better by enhancing blood flow to the body, supporting the utilisation of blood sugar, getting rid of accumulated stress hormones and even the act of getting outside can help you feel more energized on a soul level. You can have too much of a good thing though - overtraining can throw the body into an ongoing stress response and a nutritional deficit leading to severe fatigue. So make sure you are not doing more than your body can handle. Stabilise your blood sugar I can't think of any tired person who feels enthused about going home and cooking a wholesome meal! For this reason, feeling tired is one of the key reasons that people make poor dietary choices. Problem is that takeout and convenience food is usually packed full of refined carbohydrates. These foods are quickly broken down into simple sugars in the body. This is a signal for the body to produce insulin which in essence allows those sugars to be taken up by the cells. Problem is that the body can often overestimate the amount of insulin that the body needs then you end up with low blood sugar and you know what that means - feeling even more tired and craving sugar! And the cycle continues. The best way to combat this cycle is to try and plan ahead with easy meal plans , precook a whole bunch of meals on a Sunday for the week or even just for the nights you might feel like takeout, use crockpots to make stews that are ready when you get home, use prepacked meal plans like My Food Bag, delegate to the kids if they are teens( it can work I promise!). As far as what to eat goes - ditch the refined carbs, eat lots of vegetables, wholegrains, legumes and maximise your protein! It is also important to make sure that you eat regularly as hunger is cumulative so you might ruin all your well made plans by chowing down on three Sara Lee Cheesecakes before dinner if you missed lunch! Hydrate Our bodies are made up of nearly 65% water which we lose daily in urine and sweat so its important to keep up the water intake especially when it is hot. Dehydration can impact on brain function, mood and energy levels so if you are feeling fatigued make sure, you are actually drinking some water - not just coffee! If you are finding it difficult to drink water in the winter months, why not try drinking herbal tea or try adding some of our [Nectars](https://mistydayplantpotions.co.nz/shop/elixirs) to your tea! Keep caffeine to a minimum I know we all love coffee but it has its issues. Basically it is a diuretic so it dehydrates straight away, then its also drives the stress response which in turn can lead to blood sugar issues ( caramel slice with that coffee anyone?) and in sensitive people, it can lead to sleeplessness which in turn leads to more fatigue. I guess its a case of what goes up, must come down! If you are trying to kick coffee to the curb, [Shroom Potion](https://mistydayplantpotions.co.nz/shop/p/shroom-potion) or [Magick Cocoa ](https://mistydayplantpotions.co.nz/shop/p/mistys-magick-cocoa) are my recommendations! Nutritional Support The energy cycle is reliant on a steady stream of nutrients to help fuel it. Aside from the macronutrients, there are certain micronutrients which are intrinsically involved in energy production. The most pertinent of those are the B complex which are available from legumes, wholegrains, brewers yeast,some nuts and seeds and green leafy vegetables. Magnesium is also intrinsically involved in not only the energy cycle but also hormone production so if you are struggling with energy then supplementation with the B vitamins and magnesium can be helpful ( I'm not a huge supplement fan but if you are struggling, its good to start somewhere) Of course the IRON spectre is always there especially if you are menstruating and perhaps have a low intake of iron rich foods. Always important to get tested! Eleuthero One of the very first herbs to be named an \"adaptogen\" , eleuthero was originally used to help provide stamina and endurance to cosmonauts during their gruelling training. It helps the body be resilient in the face of stress, supports optimal energy levels and is a cardio and immune tonic. It is more nourishing and not as super stimulating as Korean Ginseng rhodiola, thus why I prefer it. Available in [Power Potion](https://mistydayplantpotions.co.nz/shop/p/power-potion) Ashwagandha Is there anything this herb isn't good for? How can it be for sleep and for energy!? It is truly amphoteric! It calms the nervous system to get a better sleep -thus more energy plus it actually enhances stamina, endurance and focus while under pressure. This, my friends, is why its in nearly all my [blends! ](https://mistydayplantpotions.co.nz/shop) Schisandra From traditional Chinese medicine schisandra is one of the most highly prized traditional herbs. It has an innate ability to help us deal with stress by regulating a cascade of hormones and supporting the adrenals when they are under pressure. Schisandra supports calm focus while also awakening, energizing and lightening the body and spirit. Cordyceps Traditionally used for centuries in China, cordyceps is a potent yang tonic that has been used to support mental power, athletic and sexual endurance and power and a sense of wellbeing. It has a special affinity for the lungs aiding oxygen carrying capacity and thus energy production. It also has an affinity for older people or more sedentary people who are trying to find the energy to start exercising. Perfect for people wanting to get a little bit more out of their workouts and their day.

Similar to he shou wu, It supports and replenishes deep energy stores in those who are depleted .
