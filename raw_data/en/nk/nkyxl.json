By reducing inflammation and restriction in both your muscles and your nervous system, you are allowing optimal function and communication throughout the body. That's why regular massage therapy and routine chiropractic care make the up perfect combo for wellness Massage Therapy Services Swedish Massage Therapy Swedish massage is virtually synonymous with massage therapy. Using lotion or oil, massage therapists typically begin with broad general strokes and then transition to specific strokes to address problem areas. There are five basic strokes in Swedish massage therapy: effleurage (long smooth strokes), petrissage (kneading, rolling, and lifting), friction (wringing or small circular movements), tapotement (percussion), and vibration (rocking and shaking movements). Swedish massage provides full-body muscle relaxation, and it can be especially helpful if you're recovering from an injury. Aromatherapy Massage An aromatherapy massage is a Swedish massage with essential oils added to the massage oil. The soothing effects of aromatherapy massage can benefit a variety of conditions, including headaches, insomnia, certain digestive disorders, back pain, and even premenstrual symptoms.

The therapist places heated, smooth stones on specific points on the body and also holds the warm stones while giving the massage. The stones are volcanic rock that retains heat well. The warmth of the stones are relaxing and can loosen tight muscles so that the therapist can reach areas of muscle tension quickly. Deep Tissue Massage Deep tissue massage is a focused, therapeutic massage that targets muscle knots and specific problem areas in the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue. Using deliberate, slow strokes or friction across the grain of the muscle, our therapist addresses chronic tight or painful muscles, repetitive strain, postural problems, or injuries. While it's true that the pressure of deep tissue is generally more intense than that of a Swedish massage, it shouldn't have to be painful to be effective. If you're experiencing pain, let your massage therapist know right away. This type of massage is particularly beneficial for people with chronic pain or lingering injuries that cause limited mobility. It's effective in treating repetitive stress injuries such as tennis elbow or carpal tunnel syndrome and can be helpful in reducing the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Pregnancy Massage Also known as prenatal massage, pregnancy massage is customized to an expectant mother's needs but is most often used to promote relaxation. Since many pregnant women suffer from lower back pain and swollen ankles especially in the later months, prenatal massage is a relatively safe, drug-free way to provide relief. Massage therapists who have received specialized training and are certified in prenatal massage know how to position and support the woman's body during the massage, modify techniques, and avoid certain areas and techniques during pregnancy. Most will have a special table that allows the woman to rest comfortably and safely during the massage. Sports Massage Designed to prevent and treat injuries, improve flexibility, and enhance athletic performance, sports massage can be used by athletes of all abilities to prepare for or recover from athletic or sports events. Even if you aren't an athlete, sports massage may help muscle pain or restricted range of motion. The idea behind sports massage is to manipulate the body's soft tissues, and focus on certain muscle groups depending on which sport the athlete plays. This type of massage can help with increased blood flow, increased range of motion, and increased flexibility. In sports massage, the strokes are generally faster than a typical Swedish massage. The therapist may also include compression, pressure point therapy, friction, and joint mobilization. Our Services Reach out and request an appointment "}
