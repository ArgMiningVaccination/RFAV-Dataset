Would you recommend an acupuncture treatment for it? 22 Answers [Theresa Evans](/Expert/81226290-Theresa-Evans)Acupuncturist NAPLES, FL We assess the patient, not treat the disease. [Dr. David Scott Weinreich](/Expert/61405-David-Scott-Weinreich)Internist Sanford, FL I would recommend evaluating it to see why it is hyperactive and then decide on treatment [WenShuo Wu](/Expert/81226382-WenShuo-Wu)Acupuncturist Diamond Bar, CA Acupuncture can improve your symptoms and signs (insomnia, bad temper, heat intolerance, sweating, palpitation...) of hyperthyroidism. [Dr. Armando Enrique Marull](/Expert/8121175-Armando-Enrique-Marull)Internist Wellington, Florida No Tabibzadeh](/Expert/82091516-Majidreza-Tabibzadeh)Acupuncturist TUSTIN, California Sure. It can help. [Kathleen Blazek](/Expert/81227025-Kathleen-Blazek)Acupuncturist Colorado Springs, CO For a hyperactive thyroid I would recommend acupuncture and Chinese medicinal herbs in combination. Hyperactive thyroid can cause a host of systemic issues. If untreated it typically does not get better but with treatment a patient can get a lot of relief and in some cases remain asymptomatic. Something has set your body off into this autoimmune response. Finding that cause is the trick. Treatment with acupuncture and Chinese medicine is effective in treating this disorder. Find a licensed acupuncturist who specializes in this type of treatment, remain compliant to the treatment protocol that they recommend and you can treat this naturally.

[Diana Abramachayeva](/Expert/902165-Diana-Abramchayeva)Acupuncturist Queens, NY Hi, Yes, it's worth trying acupuncture for a hyperactive thyroid. Yes, it's worth trying acupuncture for a hyperactive thyroid. [Dr. Herbert Kwong yee Lau](/Expert/903578-Herbert-K-Y-Lau)Acupuncturist East Amherst, NY Both Western and Eastern medicine offer various methods to restore thyroid hormone levels. Western treatments rely mainly on drugs and surgery while Eastern treatments aim to restore immune function as well as balance the production and release of thyroid hormones through a variety of approaches ranging from acupuncture and herbal remedies to lifestyle changes and special exercises. In the treatment to thyroid problems, acupuncture can be used to restore hormonal balance, regulate energy levels, smooth emotions and help manage sleep, emotions and menstrual problems. There are several powerful acupuncture points on the ear and the body that can be used to regulate the production of thyroid hormones. Treatments take all of your symptoms into account and are aimed at balancing the energy within the body to optimize health. When it comes to lifestyle changes, a diet rich in protein, calcium and magnesium helps support thyroid function while certain foods known as goitrogens may interfere with thyroid hormone production and should be limited. These include cruciferous vegetables (such as cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts), peanuts, and soy. Stress reducing exercises can also be beneficial.

[Jordan New](/Expert/81225849-Jordan-New)Pain Management Specialist | Pain Medicine Denver, CO Yes, acupuncture can help treat a hyperactive thyroid. A hyperactive thyroid means that the body's systems are out of balance. Acupuncture works to harmonize and rebalance the body to function properly. Acupuncture can be a beneficial adjunctive healing therapy, along with other forms of medicine and lifestyle shifts to help heal the thyroid. [Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO Treating with Chinese medicine is completely different from biomedicine with Rx. Chinese medicine utilizes needles to unblock meridians and gives Chinese herbal medicine to regular hormones. Chinese medicine treated thyroid malfunctions before the modern Rx. You need to find a practitioner who is good at the thyroid disease. [Dr. Milay Luis lam](/Expert/81843259-Milay-Luis-lam)Endocrinology-Diabetes | Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism HAGERSTOWN, MD No [Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Acupuncture can very effectively balance hormones, if treatments are regular and consistent. [JOONKOO LEE](/Expert/81226344-JOONKOO-LEE)Acupuncturist LOS ANGELES, California Acupuncture and herbal medicine are more effective when used together. [Phranque Wright](/Expert/81225847-Phranque-Wright)Acupuncturist Chicago, IL I would, yes. I would expect you would stay in contact with your MD to maintain an appropriate level of medications they are prescribing so you can have that monitored and adjusted as you get treatments. The acupuncture could help you reduce the needs, dosage, etc so it is important to keep open the communication of what types of treatments you are getting and how things change as you move forward. Find a licensed acupuncturist in your area (not just a DC or MD who \"does acupuncture but a fully licensed L.Ac.) and good luck to you.

[Abe Shahabelmolki](/Expert/81226414-Abe-Shahabelmolki)Acupuncturist Sarasota, FL No. You will need to consult with your doctor and decide what works for you and the dosage. Unfortunatly you will need to be on this medication for the rest of your life if you have been diagnosed. Please don't stop your medication until you consult with your doctor. Thanks. [Dr. Richard A. Guthrie](/Expert/3468675-Richard-A-Guthrie)Endocrinology-Diabetes Mount Hope, 20 No I would not. Acupuncture may be effective for some things such as pain but it will have no effect on a thyroid problem. Hyperthyroid is a dangerous disease as it can cause severe wt. loss, heart failure & death. Don't mess around with pseudo-cures. There are 3 ways to take care of it-medication, surgery & radioactive iodine. I recommend the latter. It is so much easier than the other 2. Just drink some liquid or take a pill of radioactive iodine & it's over. BUT DO IT-it could save your life. [Ms. Ellen D. Leonard](/Expert/1434534-Ellen-D-Leonard)Acupuncturist Grants Pass, OR Sure. Acupuncture works by balancing the body's energies so everything can work as it should. So acupuncture could possibly help level out your thyroid so that it works more effectively. Sometimes people are able to lower their medications, so work closely with your doctor after getting treatments. [Jeannette Kerns](/Expert/81227064-Jeannette-Kerns)Acupuncturist Saint Cloud, florida Acupuncture would certainly help. I myself have Hashimoto's thyroiditis and sometimes I go into a hyper phase and experience palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmia and it's very uncomfortable. I see an electro-physiologist (basically an electrician for the heart) at my cardiologist's office and he even recommends acupuncture. However, it's also important to use lab work as a guide, which in my clinic, always includes the thyroid antibody tests and reverse T3 in addition to the standard labs. Chinese medicine (herbs) are often added to the protocol for best results. I like to work in tandem with an endocrinologist for the benefit of my patients. [Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist Yes, I would recommend acupuncture for that. I have only treated that once myself so you have pulled me a bit outside my experience zone though... Acupuncture does address hormonal imbalances though. If you decide to try acupuncture, make sure you start with a fully trained acupuncturist (not an MD or Chiropractor that did minimal hours of training to get a license).

[Huy Tran](/Expert/81227314-Huy-Tran)Acupuncturist San Jose, CA Hi there, If your doctor has diagnosed you with hyperactive thyroid, then you must be taking some prescription medicine and/or getting treatments. Has your doctor advised you to go see an acupuncturist? You may want to bring it up to see what your doctor says. Acupuncture do have herbal medicine that can help.

[Andrea Cillo](/Expert/81226399-Andrea-Cillo)Acupuncturist Bay Shore, New York Acupuncture can definitely help, but it would take several treatments and may require treatments on a regular basis for life. [Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO This is a good question, unfortunately it does not have a straightforward answer. There are a lot of variables in play: how long have you been experiencing this issue? Do you have a conventional diagnosis (in other words: do you know what's causing the issue from a hormonal perspective)? Are you currently using pharmaceuticals to manage the condition? I'd suggest acupuncture with a few caveats: you want someone who has worked with thyroid issues before. It's probably going to take somewhere in the neighborhood of 7-9 treatments before you're going to know whether and how well acupuncture is working. You may need to be open to either herbal therapy, food therapy or both to really get things moving in a healthy direction. You may also need to use conventional pharmaceuticals as a stop gap until the Chinese medicine starts to bring things under control. In a case like this, perhaps more than any other time, it's critical that you see an NCCAOM board certified acupuncturist who can accurately diagnose the issue in terms of Chinese medicine. I'd start with the \"Find a Practitioner\" page at NCCAOM.org. Call a few folks local to you, ask whether they've been successful with this issue before and, if they haven't, if there's someone they'd recommend.
