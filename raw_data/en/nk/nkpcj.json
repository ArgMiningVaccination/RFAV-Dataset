And I20 think I am very proud of this Commission and the21 work that has been done the last five to six22 months. Really just getting started to get into(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.12 1 the very tough questions. 2 And we have one of the proponents of3 the bill, the CARA Legislation, that will be4 speaking with us shortly. Congressman Bilirakis,5 thank you so much for being here.6 And at this time, I would like to turn7 it over to Joe and Miguel. And introduce your8 team.9 MR. BATTLE: Well, good morning. I'd 10 like to welcome all the Members of the COVER11 Commission to the James A. Haley Medical Center12 here and our clinics in surrounding areas.13 I'd also like to welcome Congressman14 Bilirakis. It's always good to see you, sir, and15 have you here at the Medical Center.16 Also, I'd like to welcome you to VISN17 8. And we're very proud of the work that we do18 in VISN 8. We're proud of what we do here at19 Haley.20 And the whole motion is to improve the21 well-being of our patients and care givers. And22 we're very, very excited about that.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.13 1 I'm just going to take a moment, if I 2 may, and to share some of the great work we've3 been doing over the, that we've been doing. And4 you'll see this over the next few days.5 Of course, we don't operate in a6 vacuum. I'd like to introduce our Executive7 Team, if I might take a second.8 Melissa Sundin is our current Deputy9 Director. And Colleen Jakey is our Chief of 10 Staff. Andrew Sutton is our current Associate11 Director. Laureen Doloresco is our Associate12 Director of Patient Care Services. And Suzanne13 Tate is our Assistant Director.14 So, thank you for letting me introduce15 them.16 The VA, in my view, provides world17 class health care and support services to the men18 and women who have sacrificed for our nation. 19 But to do this, we rely on evidence-based20 treatments for patients.21 And that includes the care we provide22 in mental health. In some ways here at Haley(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.14 1 we're a little different than other VAs. We just 2 have four counties that's our catchment area in3 Central Florida.4 And we do have two other sister5 hospitals. One in St. Petersburg and one in6 Orlando.7 But those three facilities take care8 of approximately five percent of all the veterans9 in the country that the VA takes care of. So, 10 very densely populated with veterans here in11 Central Florida.12 But, we find that, that our geographic13 distribution is not quite as wide but gives us a14 lot of opportunity here.15 Hillsboro County alone has about16 100,000 veterans in it. And that's the largest17 number of veterans than any one county in18 Florida.19 In FY18 here at the hospital, we20 treated around 97,000 unique veterans. We did21 1.4 million outpatient visits here at the22 hospital and had over 11,000 hospital admissions. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.15 1 So, quite a busy place. 2 We are in the process of expanding and3 improving many of our sites of care. In fact, we4 are upgrading all of them.5 In our clinics, we're getting ready to6 open a new clinic in South Hillsboro County that7 construction is finishing this month.8 And on your way in today you may have9 seen a sign that said, Mission Modernize. And 10 I'm going to ask you to pardon our dust a little11 bit, we are in the process of building a new bed12 tower out in the front parking area. Or what13 used to be a parking area.14 And that will give us 96 additional15 rooms. And when we're finished, all our patients16 will be able to have private bedrooms, which is17 something we've not had here and is well overdue. 18 So, we're very excited about that.19 But, it's not just with us. We also20 partner with the Military. With MacDill Air21 Force Base, just down the road from us here.22 It is home to Special Operations(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.16 1 Command, and also Central Command. And we have a 2 very close relationship with them and our DoD3 partners. And we also see many active duty4 military here, on top of the veterans, that we5 take care of.6 We are one of the five polytrauma7 centers and get referrals from around the world. 8 Between the 100 bed Michael Bilirakis Spinal Cord9 Injury Center, the 56 polytrauma and rehab beds 10 and ten polytrauma transitional rehabilitation11 program beds, that makes us the largest federal12 rehabilitation center in the country.13 And at any given time, we have between14 15 and 30 active duty military inpatients here at15 our hospital.16 We also have a rapidly growing women's17 population here. In FY18 we saw more than 9,00018 unique women veterans. And enrollment is19 increasing on the average of five percent for the20 last seven years.21 We see about 37 percent of the22 eligible women veterans in our catchment area,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.17 1 which is higher than the national VA average of 2 around 25 percent. Which kind of means once they3 get here they like it here and they continue to4 use our services.5 In September, we just celebrated the6 25th anniversary of our Comprehensive Women's7 Health Center. It started with eight employees,8 it's now up to 40. And it's in its third home9 because it keeps getting bigger and bigger. 10 It's at our primary care annex, which11 incidentally, our primary care annex was the12 first outpatient clinic built around the patient13 aligned care model, or PAC model as you may know14 it.15 It features a patient center in front16 of the house, back of the house design. On17 stage, off stage if you will.18 And care teams that treat the whole19 person. We offer same day services. And mental20 health is integrated into each interdisciplinary21 primary care team.22 We have a no wrong door approach, so(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.18 1 veterans can enter care at any level and then 2 move to those levels as their needs and3 preferences dictate.4 One thing about our primary care5 center, it's only considered a model to follow. 6 We've had over 40 hospitals and private groups7 come see what we do at our primary care center. 8 That also includes foreign countries.9 The last big group we had was last 10 year, was a group from Singapore, came to see11 what we do.12 We want to provide veterans with the13 best possible opportunity to live full and14 productive lives. We prioritize evidence-based15 practices because we know these treatments work.16 It's been based on years of rigorous17 scientific study and we believe it's our18 obligation to ensure veterans have access to the19 best treatment options.20 At Haley, and in the VA in general,21 we've been embracing complementary and22 integrative health care, products and practices(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.19 1 as they're not currently part of the mainstream 2 or conventional medicine and practice. But we do3 embrace those here.4 CIH emphasizes patient empowerment,5 self-activation, preventative self-care and6 wellness. Often in conjunction with traditional7 medicine. They go hand-in-hand.8 We have many that you'll hear about9 over the next three days in some of our key 10 programs. Some of those key programs it's11 chronic pain rehabilitation, creative arts and12 music therapy blended by a partnership with13 creative forces, a DoD National Endowment of the14 Arts Program. We're the only VA hospital15 participating in this program.16 Our post-employment rehabilitation17 evaluation program, or PREP, which helps active18 duty service members evaluate and address health19 issues, is also an area we use this a lot. PREP20 is a one of a kind, holistic program that many21 agencies have come to Tampa to study in hopes of22 emulating its success.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.20 1 In fact, over the last three years 2 here at the medical center, we have hosted3 approximately 34 countries that have come in to4 look at some of the programming that we're doing. 5 So we're very, very proud of that.6 And of course, we're a pilot for the7 whole health initiative in VISN 8. Dr. LaPuz8 asked us if we could do that, and I quickly said9 yes because we feel like we've been working down 10 those roads for many years.11 So, we were very excited to do that. 12 Because we want to, while we're a big system, we13 take care of a lot of people, we still want to14 take care of every veteran as an individual and15 give them what they need.16 And whole health provides perspective17 of balance in the mind, the body and the spirit. 18 You need all three. And it's changing the way19 we're delivering health care across the VA.20 At Haley, we also serve as a training21 site for other VA facilities in whole health. 22 And Dr. Paykel's Thrive Program has indeed(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.21 1 thrived here and it's now become part of the 2 whole health program nationally. And that was3 developed by her here.4 And whole health builds upon one of5 our many strengths, community collaboration. 6 Here in Tampa we're lucky to have a large and7 active duty and veteran community. This is the8 best community for veterans I've ever seen in my9 36 years at the VA. 10 We have our monthly operation helping11 hand dinners, we have a MOU partnership with the12 YMCA, we have our community veteran engagement13 board, which is Mission United, here locally. We14 have hundreds of volunteers and donors that15 support our patients daily, through voluntary16 services and group therapy, among other whole17 health programs.18 So, a wide gamut of how our community19 works with us to make sure the veterans get what20 they need.21 We rightfully engage our local state22 and federal partners and are committed to(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.22 1 building those relationships and affiliate 2 relationships. And we'll be speaking with a few3 of them over the next few days.4 But, just like we use integrated5 health care teams to treat our patients, an6 integrated community can also support our veteran7 population and help achieve what matters most to8 them and reach their health care goals.9 We're very excited about all our 10 programs, but probably enough of me talking, and11 we can dive into the rest of the agenda. I want12 to thank you for your time and attention and as13 we've discussed, comprehensive mental services14 and the use of CIH.15 And at this time, I'd like to turn it16 over to my boss, Dr. LaPuz, to say a couple17 things.18 DR. LAPUZ: Good morning, Mr.19 Chairman and Members of the Commission and20 Congressman Bilirakis. We welcome you all here21 in Florida.22 VISN 8 is actually, it covers South(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.23 1 Georgia, Florida and the Caribbean. We have 2 about, almost 640,000 enrollees in our health3 care programs across the coverage site. And we4 have seven health care systems from North5 Florida, South Georgia, down to the Caribbean in6 San Juan, Puerto Rico, also covering the U.S.7 Virgin Islands and anywhere in between.8 So I'd like, thank you for giving us9 this opportunity to share with you what VISN 8 is 10 doing, in particular, to enhance mental health11 delivery to our veterans.12 We are now on our third year of what13 we have called veterans integrated care team14 model. So, during our first year we actually15 focused on primary care for the PAC enhancement.16 And there are two components of17 enhancing the PAC model. First is that we have18 emphasized on the team base approach and the19 multi-disciplinary team approach.20 Which means to say that we have21 utilized all of the members of the team in order22 to provide primary care to our veterans. And the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.24 1 second component of that is the RN care 2 coordination.3 In the RN care coordination, it is4 actually, what we have done is to reach out to5 veterans. Among those veterans that are high6 risk or high utilized with the health care.7 And what we have done is that we have8 provided them health care in a proactive manner. 9 So, before a problem arise, while we were there 10 to support the veteran by providing the RN care11 coordination.12 On our second year we have integrated13 primary care and mental health. And there are14 two components of that.15 The first is academic detailing. In16 the academic detailing, we have trained our17 primary care doctors to utilize the most commonly18 prescribed mental health drugs. To include19 antidepressants and anxiolytics.20 And by that we have demonstrated that21 when the primary care docs are more proficient in22 the utilization of the medications, there is a(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.25 1 high, we have demonstrated there is an 2 exponential increase in the first-time3 prescription that were handed by the primary care4 docs.5 So, in other words, we have prevented6 the delay in care by providing the first drug. 7 And that is being provided, the prescription is8 being provided in primary care.9 The second thing is, in the team we 10 have integrated behaviorists. So, whether that11 is social worker or a psychologist, we have12 integrated behaviorists so that we have a first13 line of therapy that can be offered, even at the14 primary care level.15 The third component of our veterans16 integrated care team is the incorporation of the17 whole health. And we are now doing that. We are18 now embarking on the incorporation of whole19 health.20 We are in the process of hiring 11721 health coaches across the VISN. And the purpose22 of the health coaches is so we will have a(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.26 1 trained individual that will be readily available 2 to the care team that can teach and educate the3 veterans and provide them with the skills, with4 emphasis on wellness.5 So, we're no longer in the business of6 just treating physical or mental health, we're in7 the business of actually providing wellness to8 prevent physical and mental health condition.9 So, in that team, we expect the health 10 coaches to provide our veterans the skills to be11 able to help themselves stay healthy, both12 physically and mentally. And we are doing that13 as a VISN project in all of the seven health care14 systems across our area of coverage.15 So, it is my privilege to actually16 share with you the VISN projects that we have. 17 And I'm hoping that during your visit that you18 will be able to, that we may be able to19 demonstrate the effects, as well as how that is20 being delivered to veterans.21 So, it is my privilege to again22 welcome you and to thank you for visiting our(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.27 1 VISN. So let me turn this over to our 2 Congressman. Thank you.3 CONGRESSMAN BILIRAKIS: Thank you. 4 Thank you, Dr. LaPuz, I appreciate it very much. 5 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you Joe6 Battle, who does an outstanding job. And all the7 folks behind me, they're heroes as far as I'm8 concerned. They take care of our heroes.9 It's truly a privilege and an honor to 10 join you here this morning. We have a wonderful11 community here in the Tampa Bay area that12 supports our veterans.13 This Commission was born out of the14 belief that one size does not fit all. 15 Especially when it comes to an issue as sensitive16 as meeting the mental health needs of our nations17 heroes.18 I'd like to thank you for your19 willingness, again, to serve on the Commission. 20 This is really a dream of mine. This was my top21 priority. The COVER Act and the PROMISE Act. My22 top priority, addressing the mental health issue,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.28 1 particularly PTSD and TBI. 2 I'm confident that the work you're3 embarking upon will save lives. That's the goal. 4 And transform the way the VA system, as a whole,5 approaches behavioral care.6 I'd like to tell you a few stories7 about, that inspire me. One in particular,8 Jason, who caught me in-between a Homeland9 Security Meeting, I was walking the corridors of 10 Cannon, I think probably most of you have been to11 the House buildings, and he caught me and he12 says, Congressman, I'm not from your District but13 I know how much you care about our veterans. I14 know they're your top priority in the United15 States Congress.16 He told me his story where several17 tours in Afghanistan. And came back and was18 having a real difficult time. Very difficult19 time.20 Problems in the marriage, connecting21 with his children, losing job after job after22 job, going to the VA and getting counseling and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.29 1 also some medication, but it just wasn't enough. 2 And he was thinking suicide.3 And then a non-profit, 501(c)(3), gave4 him a service dog. And the service dog, as you5 know, because most of you, thank you for service6 are veterans, in this case turned his life7 around. It gave him a sense of purpose.8 You know, his wife had taken care of9 the kids and continued to take care of the kids. 10 He didn't feel like he had a purpose in life to11 live. And the service dog turned his life12 around. And with the counseling obviously at the13 VA. He continued the counseling. You know, it's14 part of the puzzle.15 In any case, he started working for16 the American Humane Association bringing back17 service dogs, hero dogs. Hero dogs from Iraq and18 Afghanistan and reuniting them with their19 handlers.20 So, Jason and others, you know, the21 best ideas come from our veterans. And I hired22 Rob, prior to that, Mike Cimino, who works for(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.30 1 the VA now. 2 Rob used to work with the VA and now3 he works for me. He's a combat veteran,4 originated in Santa Rosa.5 So, this is where we get our ideas and6 we know the veterans in the advisory council. 7 And, again, Jason's story is not unique. I've8 met with countless veterans, as I said, including9 many in our community who have similar stories of 10 how an alternative or complementary treatment11 brought their lives back from the brink of ruins.12 For some it was a service dog, as I13 said. Many have found accelerated resolution14 therapy, and I believe we have that here in15 Haley. I know we have it at the University of16 South Florida.17 I understand that works for some. 18 Art, there be really art therapy. And Rob is19 doing art therapy.20 Again, it's been transformational. 21 I've, again, I've also heard similar stories22 about hyperbaric oxygen treatment.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.31 1 We have a physician who gives it, 2 performs that treatment on veterans in my3 Congressional district, pro bono. Yoga,4 acupuncture. I mean, one thing that made a5 difference in treatment of PTS or TBI.6 We want every veteran to have access7 to whatever treatment works for them, which is8 why we are assembled here today.9 Of course, we want to protect the 10 veteran by making sure that the treatment is11 evidence-based and effective. I have a heart for12 the cure are the experts. That's why you are13 here, again, independently to determine that.14 I also want to note that I've seen15 heartbreak, many heartbreaking stories about16 young veterans who return home from war17 struggling with PTS and who are placed on18 opioids. They develop the reliance on the19 medication and then have yet another issue that20 hadn't been addressed. Maybe even not been21 addressed in some cases.22 I'm not saying that medication isn't(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.32 1 part of the solution for our heroes, but it 2 shouldn't be the only option considered. That's3 why complementary and alternative therapies are4 so critical.5 We even have one veteran, Jason6 Simcakoski from Wisconsin, I know his family7 well, communicated with his family while we were8 working on the legislation. Jason died in a VA9 hospital from opioid overdose. This can never 10 happen again.11 His story inspired the PROMISE Act. 12 Which requires VA doctors to receive training,13 additional training, and utilize best practicing,14 prescribing practices, when treating with15 opioids. These two issues go hand-in-hand, in my16 opinion.17 Substance abuse and mental health18 issues are often co-occurring. And the19 treatments the Commission approves for the VA to20 use will have the impact of treating these issues21 in a holistic manner, which is very, very22 critical. And of course, Dr. LaPuz addressed(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.33 1 that. 2 I believe it is the key component of3 reducing the suicide rate within the veteran4 community and helping service members5 successfully reintegrate into civilian life. Two6 of our primary objectives.7 Again, I'd like to thank all of you8 for participating. This is a dream of mine and9 it looks like we've got some great, great 10 Commission Members, highly qualified.11 And, again, you were selected by the12 President and also the Majority Leader in the13 Senate, Minority Leader in the Senate, Speaker of14 the House and Minority Leader in the House. And15 I know that you require the 50 percent of the16 Commission. I think we're well over that, are17 veterans. I think it's very important that we18 engage.19 So, thank you very much for20 participating. Thank you for bringing the COVER21 Commission to my home area. Tampa had nothing to22 do with that but I'm very pleased.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.34 1 (Laughter.) 2 CONGRESSMAN BILIRAKIS: So, again, God3 bless you and I'm here to help. But, again, you4 are the experts and I'm always here to follow the5 legislation and get it through. So, thank you6 and God bless you.7 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Congressman8 Bilirakis, thank you so much for doing what9 you're doing and what you have done as far as set 10 this Commission on its path. And we have gotten11 to know each other quite well in the last few12 months in getting into the weeds, so to speak.13 Because a lot of people don't14 understand exactly what the Commission is set up15 for. You just basically defined the principles16 that we're looking at.17 And COVER, plain and simple, stands18 for Creating Options for Veterans Expedited19 Recovery. And it's really focusing in on the20 mental health care of the entire VA system.21 And are we living up to the promise to22 the veterans who do have issues with mental(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.35 1 health, and we're finding out that this is an 2 increasing number as we go forward. It is very3 complex.4 And so, you do have a great group of5 Commissioners that understand the sense of6 urgency that you and the rest of Congress have7 placed on this Commission to come up with the8 appropriate suggestion and recommendations for9 the VA to improve in areas. And also look into 10 new areas that veterans can access and expedite11 their recovery of care for one another.12 Also, to Director Joe Battle, thank13 you so much again. And, Miguel, great to see Dr.14 LaPuz is back in the saddle on the campus, so to15 speak, in VISN 8.16 And we look forward to now getting17 into more of the weeds in talking to your18 doctors, your staff, your clinicians, as to how19 veterans are cared for here in the greater Tampa20 area.21 I would like to take a couple of22 minutes to open it up to the other Commissioners,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.36 1 if there are any questions over the next couple 2 of minutes. And, we're on a very tight time3 frame to either Joe, Miguel or the Congressman.4 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Just a comment. 5 And, Congressman, thank you for the clarity that6 you've given to the mission of this Commission.7 Too often in health care we treat8 people with a bundle of symptoms rather than9 holistically. And I think what you outlined is 10 the imperative that we treat our warriors with11 what I will call existential or moral wounds12 holistically. Not just themselves but in the13 context of their family.14 So, it's very clear, I think, not only15 to the Commission Members but hopefully with the16 audience, what our mission is. And I'm really17 grateful for that. And we will do our best to18 ensure that the law that you put into place is19 met, not just the spirit, but holistically as we20 try to address these issues.21 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: One22 question. You mentioned that you have been(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.37 1 successful in integrating the prescribing of 2 anti-depressants and anxiolytics in primary care,3 which I see it's a huge hurdle for a lot of other4 VAs --5 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Hey, Mike, do me6 a favor, just put that mic closer to you. Thank7 you.8 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: It's a huge9 hurdle for a lot of other VAs. I know it is in 10 ours, it isn't a lot that I've seen, I'm11 wondering how you did that. Maybe if you just12 say briefly like what barriers you've faced13 because I've seen a lot of barriers with that.14 DR. LAPUZ: Well, one of the more15 significant barriers is the comfort in16 prescribing mental health drugs, for example, in17 primary care. So what we did was, we have an18 academic detailer, so they're pharmacists,19 they're PharmDs. And they provide education.20 And we have a, sort of like a cheat21 sheet that was provided to the prescribers so22 that it made them a lot more comfortable in using(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.38 1 the drugs. 2 And the second thing that we did was,3 one of the barriers is that they will feel, the4 primary care docs, will feel that they are being5 dumped on because there is another one. So that6 is important, it is important that we emphasize7 on a team base provision of care.8 That means that we utilize a lot of9 the nursing protocols in order to unload the 10 burden of the primary care docs. So, we did that11 in the beginning, in the first year.12 So, we did a lot of unloading by13 utilizing nursing protocols. And by emphasizing14 that it is not the, it's not the primary care doc15 that is only the one providing care.16 So, instead of the doctor being17 wrapped around my services and he's the one that18 is providing care, it's all the members of the19 team are wrapped around the veteran and they're20 all providing care.21 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: Thank you22 very much, I appreciate it.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.39 1 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Sorry, one 2 question. The clinician that are present, is3 overloaded with administrative tasks, how can we4 reduce all of this and we still can help them so5 they can spend more quality time helping the6 veteran?7 DR. LAPUZ: I know that there are8 pilots, and in fact, there is a pilot that is9 mandated by legislation. And that pilot is the 10 use of scribe in the health care setting to11 unload, for example, the administrative tasks12 that you are referring to.13 Now, in the way we did it in VISN 8 is14 to unload the task of provision of care by15 itself. So, in other words, again, like I'm16 sorry to repeat the description, but what has17 happened is that we, in the past, we have18 provided care through the primary care doctor.19 So everything will have to be ordered20 by the primary care doctor. And so, what we did21 is we unloaded that. So, from the beginning, we22 recognized the fact that there are things that(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.40 1 nurses can do well, just as well as docs. 2 So, we have written nursing protocols3 to allow the nursing staff to do that. And the4 social worker, there is no, in the event of our5 primary care integration, there is no requirement6 for the primary care doc to actively provide a7 counsel for mental health because there is a8 behavior that's integrated in the team.9 So, there are a lot of things that we 10 have unburdened the primary care doc from the11 beginning. Now, I am not opposed, and I welcome12 the pilot regarding scribes because I think that13 there will be a significant role to further14 unburden primary care providers in that area.15 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Thank you.16 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Congressman17 Bilirakis, sir, thank you so much for this18 legislation and I'm a lawyer who loves19 congressional intent. And we don't often get to20 sit down with a Congressman and ask him what they21 meant when they wrote it.22 And I guess one of the things that we(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.41 1 struggled with is the part about conducting a 2 patient centered survey within each VISN. And3 there's a lot of different bureaucratic hurdles4 within conducting patient surveys in the VISN and5 I was just wondering if you would be willing to6 have one of your staff members guide us and tell7 us, like, we'll tell you what the challenges are8 and then you let us know --9 CONGRESSMAN BILIRAKIS: Absolutely. 10 I look forward to working with you on this. And11 yes, definitely --12 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Thank you.13 CONGRESSMAN BILIRAKIS: -- we'll14 assign a staff member to you. I have one15 veterans' person up in Washington and several16 down here. So, maybe Rob probably might be the17 best person.18 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Awesome.19 CONGRESSMAN BILIRAKIS: understand and we'll help you. And21 we'll guide you as far as that is concerned. But22 I think that is essential.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.42 1 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Thank you, sir. 2 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: That being said,3 and we're now 17 minutes over our allotted time4 to be on schedule, we would like to move forward. 5 But, again, thank you so much Congressman, Miguel6 and Joe.7 And the rest of your staff and the8 chiefs and doctors that were introduced, thank9 you for your service to the veterans in Tampa. 10 Thank you.11 (Applause.)12 MS. WHITEHEAD: All right, so, thank13 you everyone. We're going to go ahead and get14 started with our next presentation, an overview15 of the civilian mental health services.16 We have Dr. Catalano and Gironda, who17 I saw somewhere. Okay.18 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Doctors, thank you19 so much and please, take it away.20 DR. CATALANO: Well, I'd like to say21 welcome to Tampa. Commissioners, thank you very22 much for the opportunity to speak with you and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.43 1 hopefully we can answer all your questions today. 2 We appreciate it.3 Let's start by giving you the overview4 of the service. We are happy to say that our5 mental health services are provided at all James6 A. Haley Veteran's Hospital primary points of7 care.8 Whenever a patient comes in, we're9 there. We have full mental staffing, of course 10 at the main hospital, also at our primary care11 annex, our outpatient mental health building, our12 psychological rehabilitation recovery center, our13 domiciliary, which is offsite, and our four, our14 three community satellite outpatient clinics,15 which are of course in Zephyrhills, Lakeland and16 Brooksville.17 We also have a large, our outpatient18 clinic in New Port Richey, all are fully staffed. 19 And it's with subscribers and therapists and PTSD20 specialists.21 Now, we cannot do this alone, okay. 22 So, it's not just mental health in these(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.44 1 facilities, in our service. We also work 2 collaboratively with social work service,3 chaplain service, nursing service, pharmacy and4 mental health. Along with being oral, being5 embedded in other places throughout the facility.6 We have tried to build a mental health7 system of care based on the four primary8 candidates of course being integrated9 interdisciplinary, evidence-based and veteran 10 centric. I'll spend a couple of seconds11 discussing each of those if I can.12 First, integrative. Our mental health13 services staff are embedded throughout the entire14 James A. Haley veteran system of care. If a15 veteran comes in on an impatient service, we have16 a number of consults and consultants who are17 available for medicine service, spinal cord18 injury, polytrauma, surgery, wherever they come19 in.20 And, mental service is also internally21 integrated within the mental health service. 22 Which means that, as a veterans needs change or(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.45 1 as a veterans situation changes, we are able to 2 move them throughout the system of care3 seamlessly.4 We are able to get people moved into5 the programs they need and based on how they're6 doing and how they're responding to therapy,7 making additions and subtractions based on what,8 on their current situation.9 There's usually no wrong door. We 10 want to make sure that when someone comes in,11 whether it's in New Port Richey or whether it's12 the domiciliary, we can work with the veteran on13 a treatment plan for exactly what they need to14 recover and to get the most out of their lives.15 And our continuum of care, it's also16 called the Step-Care Model. But essentially what17 we mean there is that we are, and since we offer18 mental health services throughout the system, the19 level of service is matched to the veterans needs20 and preferences.21 And as those needs and preference22 change, they can easily move up and down and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.46 1 continue over time. 2 So, interdisciplinary speaking, all of3 our service programs are interdisciplinary. We4 have psychiatrists, psychologists, advance5 practice nurses, RNs, LPNs, pharmacists, social6 workers, licensed mental health counselors,7 mental health family therapists, addiction8 counselors, chaplains and peer support9 specialists. 10 Now, there are other services such11 spinal cord injury and polytrauma, where we have12 staff that are embedded with, teams with even a13 broader representation. Whether it's14 rehabilitation specialists or whether it's15 internal medicine doctors. As we are embedded in16 there, we are able to, I think, add to the17 options available for each of our veterans.18 This model does provide a tremendous19 range. I think when all you have is a hammer,20 everything looks like a nail. And so, by doing21 this, by having numerous providers involved in22 every patient's care, we're able to really have a(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.47 1 large toolbox of options to help our veterans. 2 And, the whole team works together3 collaboratively with the veteran towards the4 shared treatment and recovery goals. We want to5 make sure that we all work together and we all6 know what each of us is doing to make sure that7 our veterans are taken care of.8 Evidence-based, we have definitely9 prioritized the delivery of evidence-based 10 practices. And we've been doing that for at11 least the last 12 years.12 We know these treatments work, there13 is numerous, there's years of scientific study. 14 And we have, based on these research, we know15 these work and get people better.16 Why? Why the time, because the17 veterans deserve our best. It's our obligation18 that veterans have next to the best available19 treatment, state of the art treatments and20 whatever they need to get better.21 Now, not every evidence-based practice22 is going to work for every veteran, we know that. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.48 1 That's why we have numerous evidence-based 2 practices, along with CIH therapies as well.3 So, I can guess that essentially every4 veteran is going to have a different treatment5 plan. Same diagnoses, but since these treatment6 plans are all veteran centric and they're all7 individualized, pretty much no two treatment8 plans should look alike.9 Veteran centric, we're about the 10 recovery model. People can get better. We11 really want to do everything we can to maximize12 the veterans functioning and have them do the13 best they can.14 So, we, our treatment plans are driven15 by the veterans' strengths, needs and16 preferences. And our change throughout the17 duration of care.18 The treatment is not a static19 document, it has to change over time. And by20 allowing, by continually working with the veteran21 to see what they need and what they want, we want22 to make sure that we are able to change with the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.49 1 times. 2 And the veterans have ownership of3 their care and they have choice. They can4 choose, they may not want to be involved in5 therapy but they may change down the road.6 So there is no closing doors either. 7 We want to make sure that they know that they can8 always come back and be involved in something if9 they change, if their preferences change. 10 Outpatient programs. As you can see,11 we have quite a few. In fact, 95 percent of our12 patient encounters happen on the outpatient13 basis.14 We have general mental health, you15 know, just mental health people, but also, we16 have our three out, three computer based17 outpatient clinics and our outpatient clinic in18 New Port Richey.19 But we also have specialty care. We20 have women's mental health, we have a PTSD21 clinical team, we have a substance use disorder22 service.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.50 1 There are some veterans who don't want 2 to come see mental health. I don't want to come. 3 So we even meet them where they are. And that's4 where our primary care mental health integration5 comes in.6 Everybody needs primary care. And so,7 instead, we're able to see them as a colleague of8 their primary care doctor.9 We have psychiatrists that are based 10 on the primary care mental health team as well11 who help the primary care doctors with their12 medication choices and follow-up there.13 Also, we have we offer transcranial14 magnetic stimulation. We are the busiest TMS15 program in the VA system.16 We have different types of therapy, we17 have peer support recovery services and we have18 programs where we see the veterans in their home. 19 Through our mental health intensive case20 management program and also home-based primary21 care.22 We are also staffed in a number of(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.51 1 other programs in the polytrauma, chronic pain, 2 spinal cord and outpatient medical clinics.3 Inpatient. We are fortunate that we4 only have an inpatient psychiatric unit called5 the acute recovery center, 40 beds. And that's6 where our most acute patients go.7 We also have, once again, we also have8 consultation liaison services to all the medical9 teams and all the other teams. That is the med 10 surge, we have a substance use disorder. That11 way we can get patients seen immediately and12 start evidence-based medications for substance13 use.14 We have a geriatric psychiatrist and15 psychologist specialist in the community living16 center. They're there full-time. We have a full17 team embedded in the spinal cord injury and18 polytrauma. And we have a team involved in the19 emergency department as well.20 Overall, we are embedded throughout21 the hospital. Also in polytrauma and chronic22 rehabilitation and pain, and spinal injury in the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.52 1 community living center. Pretty much wherever 2 the patients, we're there.3 And then residentially speaking we4 have a domiciliary offsite that has 33 beds. 5 Also, we have 20 beds for, especially with our6 intensive outpatient program and substance use. 7 So, for our veterans who either live far away or8 are homeless, we can get them in and make sure9 they come in and complete the outpatient program. 10 Also, we have complementary beds in11 the homeless, in the homeless program and in the12 grant per diem program.13 Amongst mental health programs, the14 CIH that is most utilized are animal-assisted15 therapy, of course in equine therapy as well is16 lumped into there, acupuncture art therapy.17 By feedback, what is equine therapy? 18 Guided imagery, meditation mindfulness, spiritual19 care yoga and having outdoor recreation, which20 happens a lot at our domiciliary.21 So, as you see, we've been using CIH22 for quite a long time and we're excited for the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.53 1 expansion as we move forward. 2 A couple mental health measures. Our3 facilities have over 28,000 veterans and mental4 health, which is around 27 percent of our5 patients.6 About 11 percent of our outpatient7 visits are for mental health, which is8 significant. And we have over 335,000 mental9 health visits, impatient and outpatient. 10 We have over 12,000 mental health days11 of care, which is essentially patients who have12 stayed on our inpatient services for overnight. 13 So we've had a significant increase there.14 And what we're very proud of is our15 access. The average new patient wait time from16 create date to patient being seen is 9.8 days. 17 Which, we're happy with but, compared to the18 community, it's much, much better.19 And of course, we also have same day20 access for veterans who request that. And that's21 at every site of care.22 As Mr. Battle spoke about earlier, we(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.54 1 have a very compact catchment area. And at no 2 point in time, is any veteran more than 253 minutes away from a VA facility that can provide4 evidence-based care.5 But still, some veterans want to be,6 need to be taken care of at home, and so we have7 increased our video telehealth encounters since8 2016.9 And once again, we have over 1,300 TMS 10 encounters last year, which is of course, as you11 know, a significant number which is probably the12 most in the VA system.13 I'd like to tie it up before I open. 14 I'm sure you have questions.15 The VA system allows us to provide16 care to our veterans in this systematic matter. 17 I'm very appreciative of that.18 Our care is in a disciplinary, veteran19 centric, evidence-based and integrated. But for20 me, the important thing is, well, one of the21 important things is the integration.22 It's not just mental health that's(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.55 1 integrated it's everything. Mental health speaks 2 with surgery, who talks with internal medicine,3 who works with whole health, who coordinates with4 dental, who interacts with neurology. The fact5 is, we are one family taking care of our6 veterans.7 I'm really proud of our clinicians. 8 Honestly, these are really top-flight people who9 could work anywhere but they've chosen to work 10 here. And the reason is because of their11 commitment to our veterans.12 They have a dedication to the mission,13 which is important. And what is the mission,14 it's to provide compassionate, evidence-based and15 effective care in a quick manner, in a rapid16 manner. And they do a great job.17 Overall, it's an honor to serve our18 veterans and work with these people. But, I have19 to thank the VA for allowing us to work in this20 system of care because it's, I think, it's one in21 a million.22 And also appreciate the fact that our(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.56 1 hospital leadership has made mental health, 2 veteran mental health their top priority. And3 happy to answer any questions that you have.4 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Thank you, Doctor. 5 A quick question. Two questions actually.6 How are your staffing levels? It7 sounds like you're doing a great deal of things8 here, but it takes professionals, it takes peer9 support specialists, it takes a lot of people to 10 do this, how are your staffing levels?11 DR. CATALANO: They're very good. 12 Actually, we only have a four, I think right now13 we have a 4.9 percent vacancy rate. And we have14 another individual coming on board it's just we15 have, we are fortunate that our hiring is16 expedited because of the importance of having17 mental health, having boots on the ground. So18 it's very good.19 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Okay, thank you. 20 And the second question, you mentioned video21 telehealth at home. Can you tell us a little bit22 more about that at home?(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.57 1 DR. CATALANO: Certainly. We have a 2 number of providers, a webinar SCI, a spinal cord3 injury area, and also one of our4 geropsychiatrist, who are pretty much doing their5 practice by using the video connect, which is on6 the cell phone.7 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Right.8 DR. CATALANO: And also, then they're9 able to, well, it sort of serves two purposes. 10 One is that if veterans can't get in we're able11 to see them in their own house, but also, when a12 veteran is no-show, we're able to call them up13 and try to, and interact with them, to make sure14 that there is not something afoot and something15 going on. So, that way it's not just a phone16 call it's a face-to-face.17 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Thank you. Are18 you doing this with mental health as well?19 DR. CATALANO: Oh yes. We're doing it20 with, we're doing geriatric psychiatry right now21 along with the psychologists and the spinal cord22 injury.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.58 1 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Thank you, sir. 2 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Two questions3 for you. When you talk about, on the last page,4 the 28,000 veterans served in mental health,5 you're not including the patients that are seen6 in primary care that are serviced by your health7 workers that may be embedded in primary care, are8 you?9 My guess is that the percentage of 10 your patients that have mental health issues in11 primary care are much higher than 28 percent,12 probably 60, 70 percent of patients that go to13 primary care practices have some sort of mental14 health issue or is that everybody?15 DR. CATALANO: That's everybody. This16 is all a 500 series stop code, which would17 include primary care mental health. Yes.18 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Thank you. And19 the second is, you mentioned in the CIH that it's20 all evidence-based. So, you have the data behind21 a lot of the therapies and all that you're22 providing here --(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.59 1 DR. CATALANO: Well -- 2 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: But that's one3 of the challenges that we have as a group is to4 make sure that the evidence is behind integrative5 and complementary services that we, you know, you6 can help us out if you've got the research base7 behind some of this, like equine therapy.8 DR. CATALANO: Yes.9 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: We know 10 anecdotally it worked but do we have anything11 that can demonstrate it because it would really12 help us.13 DR. CATALANO: Well, I think as you14 know, the nature of CIH is that many of these15 modalities are experimental. We do have16 preliminary data, anecdotal some of it. Perhaps17 not well controlled studies that demonstrate that18 many of these techniques have promise.19 Do we have the level of evidence to20 suggest that these are, what we would say are21 evidence-based therapies, by and large I would22 say no. They have promise. Many of them have(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.60 1 promise. 2 There's been, in the history of3 medicine there's all kinds of treatments that4 over time, show promise but then don't pay out to5 be useful. And then many go on to be the6 standard of care.7 And so, I would say that the CIH that8 we have front lined in mental health services are9 the ones that have higher levels of support. 10 Things like mindfulness and biofeedback, those11 kinds of things are treatments that we certainly12 have a lot more confidence in.13 Others, we don't know. We have14 anecdotal data that suggest that they are15 helpful, and that's why we offer them. But the16 jury is out on many of these. And we're going to17 wait to see the data to move those into the18 categories of evidence-based care.19 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: So, a point20 of clarification. You mentioned about the data,21 that 500 series stop codes were included in that,22 the PCMHI data. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.61 1 DR. GIRONDA: Correct. 2 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: Correct? 3 But I'm wondering, are you including the people4 who are just getting an antidepressant prescribed5 by their primary care? Because that really6 wouldn't be coded in that per se.7 DR. GIRONDA: That's an excellent8 point. And many of those would not. Some of9 them are. We do antidepressant monitoring. 10 Getting back to one of the11 Commissioner's questions regarding barriers to12 primary care prescription of antidepressant13 medication and other psychotropic medications,14 one of the things that we have done is to15 institute antidepressant monitoring.16 We have a psychiatrist vetted in17 primary care as part of our primary care mental18 health integration team. That individual's job19 is to assist, consult and assist the primary care20 providers with the prescription of antidepressant21 medications.22 And he is part of a team that(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.62 1 essentially identifies patients who are getting 2 new scripts for antidepressants, and then3 monitors them on a routine basis, assessing4 progress, treatment response, and so forth,5 providing that information back to the6 psychiatrist, who then works with the primary7 care physician to modify the treatment regimen,8 whether it's to adjust it or to continue the9 course. 10 So those individuals would have been11 included, because they would have been captured12 in our 500 series stop codes through our BHL or13 antidepressant monitoring.14 But you're right. There's a vast15 majority of other individuals who would not be16 captured through a PCMHI contact. Many people do17 get initial contact in the sense that they will -18 - there's a warm handoff in primary care from the19 primary care team to the primary care mental20 health integration specialist. Suggestions are21 made.22 But if they are kept in primary care,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.63 1 there's a large percentage of those that are not 2 going to see any light.3 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: So that's4 probably the number difference of what we were5 talking about, that it's more like 60 or 706 percent, you know, total, because there's a large7 bulk of people probably just getting some8 Citalopram or some Prozac or whatever it is that9 probably are not captured. 10 One other question I have was, you11 talked about the vacancy rate, which is about12 four point something percent. But what is the13 M.D. psychiatry kind of vacancy rate, because14 that's a very -- that's a narrow group, but it is15 a very important group that a lot of the VA16 struggles with.17 DR. CATALANO: We really don't have a18 problem with that. I would say it's probably two19 to three percent. We have a very strong20 relationship with the residency program across21 the street at USF. And the only positions we22 currently have open from a psychiatry standpoint(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.64 1 are for our new clinic that's opening in April. 2 (Off-microphone comments.)3 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Yeah, that is4 amazing.5 COMMISSIONER to what we're seeing in California,7 yeah.8 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Doctor, out of9 your 28,000 veterans, again, that are being 10 served for mental health, I would assume that you11 have a breakdown that would help the12 Commissioners or one of the subcommittee groups13 that shows what the diagnoses are for each one of14 the mental health so we would have a sense of,15 idea as to what is number one through ten, per16 se. That's not a question. It's just a comment17 at this point.18 The point I'm trying to make is that,19 do you also have any outcomes of each one of20 those categories of mental health that you're21 currently treating the 28,000 veterans with. So22 do you know, and can the Commission know, are(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.65 1 these veterans actually improving to get into a 2 normal lifestyle again? Are they being surveyed?3 DR. GIRONDA: I think there's a number4 of levels of survey, of outcomes, a number of5 ways in which we assess how we are doing. It's6 embedded in the system level.7 At the national level, we have patient8 surveys. We have the SHEP survey, which is a9 survey of inpatient psychiatric, inpatient care. 10 And through that we can get mental health11 satisfaction data. It's a pretty comprehensive12 survey of inpatient data.13 We have an annual veterans14 satisfaction survey that we --- that system-wide15 is administered. It has a number of mental16 health-specific measures. One of them is the17 mental health experience of care. We rate very18 highly on that.19 With respect to your specific20 question, in terms of diagnostic groups, we think21 about it more programmatically I would say. And22 certain diagnostic groups tend to be treated in(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.66 1 certain programs. We think about it functionally 2 and programmatically.3 So at the service level, we have a4 number of programs that will have their own5 outcome measures. I can give you a number of6 examples of that.7 At the domiciliary, we collect8 outcomes data on a routine basis. We see that9 one measure that comes to mind is 10 rehospitalization rates. Before domiciliary11 care, veterans tend to be hospitalized at a rate12 of about 60 percent. After care, that rate goes13 down to around 39 percent. Not where we want it,14 but it's still low.15 Also, as a result of doing this, we16 know that many of those rehospitalizations are17 based on substance abuse. So, as a result of18 that information, we've changed practices. We've19 increased the connection between our domiciliary20 and our substance use treatment program.21 And in fact, we have plans to have a22 residential substance use program in the future. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.67 1 We don't have it now. We want to have that. If 2 you ask us one of our barriers, which I assume3 you will, that's one of the barriers we'd like to4 see addressed.5 Other programs, all of your CARF-6 accredited programs are required to be accredited7 to collect outcomes, comprehensive outcomes,8 functional outcomes, veteran satisfaction, again,9 holistic approach to assessing the veterans, not 10 just symptom reduction.11 Symptom reduction is a piece of it,12 but it's only a small piece of that. We want to13 know quality of life. That's important to us. 14 All those CARF programs measure quality of life.15 I can give you other examples if you'd16 like, but it's at the programmatic level, and I17 think really, really, really importantly too, at18 the individual patient provider level. With19 evidence-based practice, assessing outcomes is20 built into what you do.21 Evidence-based practice is, the22 foundation of that is a continual assessment of(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.68 1 what's working for the patient, what's working 2 for the veteran, and modifying the treatment3 protocol to make sure that what you're doing is4 working.5 And if it's not, because we're6 veteran-centric and because we have so many7 treatment options available to us -- we have a8 number of different evidence-based treatment9 options. We have a number of CIH options 10 available to us. If it's not working, we'll11 switch. We will give you something else. We12 will work with you to pick something else.13 And even getting down to how do we14 know that our providers are doing that, we have a15 quality of care review process. And part of the16 quality of care review process is a monthly17 process where peers review each other's care.18 And questions on the quality of care19 review form address directly that. Are you20 assessing progress towards treatment goals? 21 Those goals need to be objective and measurable. 22 Are you assessing progress towards those goals? (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.69 1 And if indicated, because they're not making 2 progress, are you changing treatment?3 Those are two key questions on our4 quality of care. So providers are responsible to5 the patient and they're responsible to their6 peers.7 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Sir, once you8 capture that quality care, is that data available9 to us? 10 DR. GIRONDA: That's internal data. 11 I would be happy to give you a summary of that12 data if you would like. But it's internal data. 13 It's used for our internal quality of care14 process.15 What happens is you have a -- we have16 a quality of care committee that every month17 reviews any fallouts. We call them fallouts if18 we feel that the care is not what we would like19 to see. The committee reviews those data,20 reviews the chart, determines what the21 shortcomings might have been, and then provides22 that feedback directly to the provider through(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.70 1 the supervisor. 2 COMMISSIONER KHAN: I appreciate very3 much because that will help us to get you more of4 what you need. The second question, Doctor, so5 you have a very highly motivated staff. What is6 the secret of retention? Are they competitive,7 their salaries, with the private sector?8 DR. CATALANO: I honestly feel that9 it's a special provider that comes to the VA. 10 You're never going to make as much money as in11 the private practice. But the job satisfaction12 is a lot higher.13 Instead of chasing dollars,14 essentially what happens is we are, it's a higher15 calling. And so I think people are, really buy16 into the mission. And I think for us the17 important thing is good recruiting. And we've18 been able to get the best people who see things19 the way we do. And I think that's been our20 fortune.21 And, but we've tried to make sure that22 people have the opportunities to get training and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.71 1 to increase their -- what they can offer, and try 2 to be, treat them as well as we can.3 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Okay. Maybe it's4 Tampa's climate that's keeping them here.5 DR. CATALANO: I'll take that, too.6 (Laughter.)7 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: So, Dr. Catalano,8 part of what we're called for is to really figure9 out how innovation happens within VA's mental 10 health or how it should. And I've got to take11 the bait that you dangled in front of us twice12 about TMS.13 DR. CATALANO: Okay.14 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: And, I mean, it15 seems like something that you're rightfully proud16 of. And it may be fair to say that you're17 pushing beyond the bounds of the evidence, you18 know, like you're seeing more results. But how19 did you guys become the center of excellence in20 TMS? It does not seem like it was told to you21 from Washington that this was going to happen. 22 Is that fair?(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.72 1 DR. CATALANO: That's fair. Well, we 2 always had, we've always had electroconvulsive3 therapy. And when this came out, there was a4 really, a national expert in TMS who was over at5 the university who left, and we had the6 opportunity to grab him.7 And when he came here, he -- really we8 had started the program, but he was able to9 really put it into the next gear. And he's sort 10 of like the Pied Piper. He's got a number of11 other faculty, staff here who are helping him out12 now, which is why we've got, we have two machines13 running at all times now. And so we're -- it's14 nice to have it to offer because, you know, some15 people, that's the only thing they respond to.16 So, yeah, we thought it was an17 opportunity to sort of get a leg up on the18 private sector. And this, Dr. Kozel, who you'll19 meet at some point during this, during the next20 couple days, is, you know, he believes in it. 21 And we believe in it. And he's actually doing22 the research on TMS and PTSD now. So --(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.73 1 DR. GIRONDA: Can I add a piece to 2 that? It's being done -- we're putting our money3 where our mouth is. His work is being done in4 the context of RCTs. And he's going to be5 telling you about some very, pretty6 groundbreaking research in the area with7 methodologically rigorous trials.8 So we're asking the question, does it9 really work. And he's gotten a lot of good data. 10 And so we're following that. We're following11 that thread.12 But he's going to be speaking to you13 in a closed session. And then you can ask him14 the hard details about what his results are thus15 far.16 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Sir, I have one17 more question. Those who are already enrolled in18 the VA, you're treating them.19 DR. GIRONDA: Of course.20 COMMISSIONER KHAN: What is the system21 where -- is there an effort that those who are22 not enrolled, are reaching out to them?(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.74 1 DR. GIRONDA: Well, we think that 2 every veteran should be enrolled. And so we have3 a very robust outreach program. Dr. Shiber will4 speak with you later on today. But we are -- we5 go to outreach events throughout the area,6 sometimes, you know, veteran organizations. 7 Sometimes we're at the state fair. Some days we8 go -- wherever the veteran might be, we are9 there. 10 And, but then suicide prevention also11 does a number of outreaches. And so we try to12 spread ourselves throughout the catchment area13 and make sure that if someone's out there that we14 can sort of bring in onboard, we want to bring15 them on in.16 COMMISSIONER KHAN: So, since you're17 the pilot program, can you initiate an initiative18 that can be used at a national level to create a19 database from the Defense Department, when the20 military veteran leaves, they track their21 veterans, where he is, whether he enrolled in the22 military --- came to VA or not. That's how(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.75 1 you'll reach every veteran. So if you create 2 that initiative, I'll back you up.3 DR. GIRONDA: You know, we're not4 doing that. But it's something that needs to be5 done. And I've heard talk about that. It's the6 central office level. And there may be others7 who can speak to this better than I can.8 But I know that that's something that9 has been talked about and thought about. I don't 10 know. I think the logistics are really11 difficult. But that would be something that I12 think the COVER Commission should be looking at.13 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Yeah, just a quick14 follow-on question, how effective do you see your15 community outreach? How many people are you16 drawing in to this facility from your community17 outreach?18 DR. GIRONDA: So we've been doing this19 for a while. The mental health summits have been20 our primary mechanism for engaging partners in21 the community. And we partner with them to22 engage veterans in the community.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.76 1 So we started doing the summits per 2 the VA mandate back in 2013. We decided very3 quickly that we wanted to expand what we did with4 the summits. We saw that as an opportunity to5 engage in the community. We knew that was the6 direction of the VA. We knew that having strong7 community partners was the only way that we were8 going to be able to do our mission well.9 And so we have very aggressively 10 developed a curriculum for the summits that11 included issues around care coordination with12 community partners. Many of these are treatment13 providers and other agencies. Care coordination,14 providing crisis services, and then also15 increasing veteran and military cultural16 confidence among the community partners.17 And so then we've used those agencies18 and those partnerships. We've tried to leverage19 those agencies and partnerships to increase our20 reach into the community and to have that be a21 two-way door. And you're going to hear from a22 number of those individuals.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.77 1 We've also -- if you just want 2 straight numbers, the suicide prevention team3 goes into the community five times a month. Over4 the past three years, or five years, excuse me, I5 think they've done 357 outreach events. These6 are all over the place. These are in churches,7 coffee shops, vet centers, anywhere we can find8 veterans.9 We know that, and this is an estimate, 10 but we know that an estimated number of veterans11 attending those events, over the 357 events, is12 roughly 130,000. So, and again, that's an13 estimate.14 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Right.15 DR. GIRONDA: But if you look at each16 individual and you add the estimated number of17 attendants, that's what we get. So we know we're18 reaching a lot of individual veterans.19 We have a number of other initiatives. 20 We have the commissioner's challenge. Have you21 heard about the commissioner's challenge? It's a22 SAMHSA project designed to bring the community(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.78 1 together to identify veterans, service members, 2 veterans, and their families who are at highest3 risk for suicide.4 This project began in June. We are5 very much a part of this with some of our other6 committee partners, the partners, very partners7 that we have cultivated over the last five years. 8 And you're going to be hearing from them as well9 during your community session. 10 But the idea there is that we are11 helping the community build, identify gaps in12 services, and to build capacity to provide13 services to those at risk. And so that's, we're14 doing that with the community, with the Tampa Bay15 area, with the Hillsborough County Commission.16 COMMISSIONER ROSE: end19 on your question.20 COMMISSIONER MAGUEN: Okay, great. 21 Thank you. You guys did a wonderful job of22 outlining the CIH modalities that you use here. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.79 1 I know this is a huge strength of your facility. 2 And I was wondering, in terms of the3 patients who are currently receiving mental4 health care, do you know what percentage of those5 patients are currently getting one of those CIH6 modalities?7 DR. GIRONDA: The short answer is no.8 COMMISSIONER MAGUEN: Okay.9 DR. GIRONDA: Yeah, you know, I just 10 don't. I know that they are offered routinely. 11 But we don't track that in particular. The issue12 is that, again, because we're veteran-centric13 every patient has a different treatment plan. 14 They're offered an array of treatment options.15 (Off-microphone comments.)16 DR. GIRONDA: So it's hard to know17 because they're offered so many different types18 of treatments. They might get a number of19 different evidence-based treatments. They might20 get a pharmacological21 pharmacological, evidence-based22 treatments, different evidence-based(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.80 1 psychotherapies, peer support services, chaplain 2 services, other supportive services, plus CIH. 3 So it's hard to know what any individual is going4 to get.5 COMMISSIONER MAGUEN: So I think, you6 know, one of the things that is going to be7 important for us, too, is over time to be able to8 better attract that so we just know how many9 people are getting it as well. So it sounds like 10 you're offering it to everybody. But in terms of11 the numbers, that's not exactly clear.12 DR. GIRONDA: We have numbers based on13 programs in terms of numbers of patients that we,14 that they're, you know, they're trying to offer15 it to. So we do know that.16 In certain programs it's a lot easier17 to know. So, for example, with our MHICM18 program, we know that all of them get the19 opportunity to participate in equine therapy. We20 know in our PRC the vast majority of them are21 participating in art therapy and music therapy.22 At our domiciliary, we know that all(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.81 1 of them are offered the opportunity to 2 participate in things like yoga and therapeutic3 outdoor recreation. So it varies by program. 4 But your point is well taken.5 COMMISSIONER MAGUEN: Thank you. 6 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Dr. Catalano and7 Dr. Gironda, thank you so much for your8 professionalism and your leadership and being9 part of this great integrated system, and really 10 appreciate the time that you spent with us and11 being so transparent as well as far as what's12 taking place within the Tampa VA and the great13 care that you're providing our veterans. Thank14 you so much.15 DR. CATALANO: Thank you.16 DR. you.17 (Applause.)18 WHITEHEAD: All right. Thank you19 so much. And we'll move right into our next20 session. So we'll have Doctors Paykel and Scott21 come up to the table now. And they're going to22 provide an overview of whole health,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.82 1 complementary and integrative health, and 2 recreation therapy modalities in the facilities. 3 So, thank you, Doctors.4 DR. PAYKEL: Thank you.5 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Go SCOTT: Okay.7 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: There's going to8 be some moving and --9 DR. SCOTT: Some moving. 10 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: We're well11 quorumed.12 DR. SCOTT: Good morning. My name is13 Dr. Steven Scott. I'm the Chief of Physical14 Medicine Rehabilitation, as well as the15 Polytrauma Director here at Haley. I've been on16 staff here since 1990. And I've been also, one17 time also the chief of the spinal cord injury18 service, too.19 I might add I also did, I was also co-20 clinical director of an HSR. That's a health21 systems research center, as well as a22 rehabilitation center, as well as a QUERI center(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.83 1 in the past. And I've also helped develop the 2 first residency program in physical medicine3 rehabilitation in the state of Florida earlier.4 I'm going to -- and what we're -- so5 I want to welcome the Commission Chair, the whole6 Commission, and welcome to Tampa. We have a7 great story here. We have a great place. And I8 think it's all because we have a compassion and9 caring for our veterans and active duty. 10 And what I'm going to, we're going to11 do today -- you can go to the first slide here. 12 We're going to talk a little bit about timeline13 and give you a little bit of an idea of a14 timeline and how we basically with this timeline15 have grown into the whole health movement.16 And I might add, the timeline, I'm17 starting just back to 2000 because we can spend18 all morning if we went back earlier than that. 19 And the timeline starts with -- I'm using20 different CIH type of activities.21 And that's the equine therapy program22 that we started back in 2000. Since that time --(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.84 1 and we used an outside community source. And we 2 continue to use an outside community source to3 help us in this equine therapy program.4 And these programs are all embedded in5 recreational therapy. And many of the times6 within our rehabilitation programs they are7 interdisciplinary. They are certified by CARF,8 which is an accreditation standard for9 rehabilitation. And they also have outcomes 10 based on their programs, not based on the11 specific treatments.12 The equine therapy program since the13 year 2000 has treated over -- almost a thousand14 veterans have participated in this program,15 including families and other individuals, too. 16 We've also had an adaptive sailing program. We17 actually have our own sailboat here in Tampa.18 (Off-microphone comments.)19 DR. SCOTT: Yes, we actually have our20 lake and our own sailboat. We've had all types21 of disabilities that have used this adaptive22 sailing program to get them out on the water, to(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.85 1 give them freedom as they use that. And it's a 2 very unique program.3 We also partner with MacDill. And4 together, we actually bought a platoon boat. And5 we actually have them go out fishing out there in6 the bay at the same time. And we also do deep7 sea fishing. But that's also a program we've8 used since the early 2000s.9 In terms of yoga, what we've done is 10 we use a best practices. And we saw a best11 practice up at Walter Reed. We saw the12 instructors that would use it. So we basically13 copied that program, brought it down here. And14 we have an adapted yoga program. That's for15 people that have disabilities and that can16 utilize this or even have PTSD and adapt the yoga17 aspect to their unique needs.18 In terms of golf, this is a big19 golfing area. Well, we actually have an adapted20 golf program. We actually took this from the21 PGA. And we actually, with this program, which22 meets every Friday morning, we are able to take(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.86 1 even veterans that are blind or all type of 2 disabilities and give them the opportunity to3 play golf.4 But it's not recreational. It's also5 discipline, it's cognitive thinking, it's6 socialization, all those aspects. And so any7 disability at all we try to get them back on the8 golf range. And that started in 2007.9 In terms of our adapted sports 10 program, we actually started a disabled or11 adapted sports program just for the disability,12 you know. And the idea was taking all these13 different sports -- and you name it, we do it14 here, you know, water skiing, you know, whatever15 you want to do. If you can't -- we actually do16 that type of sports. And we teach them. We17 educate them. We get them participating. And we18 put them in national events that are hosted19 around the country.20 I might add that this is sort of an21 extension of our rehabilitation program, and our22 rehabilitation program and our overall goals.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.87 1 And I just want to mention this, a 2 mission, is our mission is to provide3 comprehensive treatment to maximize functional4 independence, to enhance the quality of life, and5 to assist the participant to regain his or her6 role in society as an active and useful person or7 member. And that's our goal. And that's, in8 many ways, this adapted aspect, sports allows9 them to do that. 10 In 2017 and 2018, we got more involved11 in music and art. We've always being doing it in12 rec therapy. We got more formalized with the13 National Endowment for the Arts. And you'll hear14 more about this.15 This is an exciting area, you know, to16 mention to you on how we can use seriously17 disabled people, people that could only maybe18 move one arm or can't move anything at all and19 how you can apply music and art to enhance their20 quality of life, to enhance their rehabilitation,21 to allow them to become more independent, to22 allow their family members to interact with them(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.88 1 in that. And we have some exciting stories to 2 tell on this, as well as benefits of this, of3 that program, too.4 We also do adapted tai chi. We5 actually went and trained, we had 12 people6 train. They trained in wheelchairs. Whatever7 disability it is we use tai chi to meet whatever8 needs they are. And that's the needs on PTSD,9 the physical needs, the mental needs, as they go 10 together.11 The virtual reality, which is our last12 one there, is sort of an innovative thing. And13 it's sort of new. And what we've done on that is14 we've partnered with our community, and community15 partner was Operation Helping Hand. They16 actually donated and allowed us a virtual reality17 room.18 And with that room, we're able then to19 virtual reality different environments, including20 those of, say, you're in the Air Force. And we21 have a lot of Marines here. So we have guys in22 the Marines. We could actually have them fly(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.89 1 over Tampa, you know, and visualize that. And 2 they could visualize whatever environment they3 want to have.4 And in that environment, we could then5 apply different aspects of their pain management6 or their mental aspects and improve that. And7 we're in the process now of assessing and8 evaluating that, too.9 We also use virtual reality in our 10 head injury population and in other aspects. And11 that's a growing area at the same time. Next12 slide.13 I just want to mention that we have a14 whole variety, I think there was listed in the15 last presentation, of CIH activities. I don't16 have all the research and all the numbers. The17 code numbers don't jive, but we'll give you as18 much information as we can in this, I wanted to19 mention.20 But you could see that we have21 everything almost A to Z here. You could see22 art, music, sports, yoga, golf, deep sea fishing,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.90 1 equine therapy, animal assistance, aquatic 2 therapy, which you'll see, massage, manual3 therapy, tai chi, mindfulness, therapeutic4 gardening, spirituality, biofeedback,5 acupuncture, guided imaging. And we probably6 have more than that at the same time.7 And I guess when you read that, that's8 the reason why our retention rate is so high9 here, because everyone -- we have everything here 10 that you could ever want per se. Next slide.11 I just want to give you some numbers. 12 And we're going to give you more as discussions13 go the next couple days. But in terms of massage14 and manual therapy, this is used -- these are all15 in code numbers, CPT codes.16 And massage therapy is more of a soft17 tissue type of treatment. It's usually embedded18 in other types of therapies that we use, too. 19 But you can see that we used it already on 26020 unique patients in '07, in 2007, 289 in 2018.21 We also mix that up with manual22 therapy where they actually move the joints. You(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.91 1 have joint movement and joint activity to enhance 2 range of motion, to enhance muscle, motor3 learning, to basically allow them to function at4 a higher rate. And there we used it over 2,0005 individuals in '17, and 1,800 in '18, a large6 number of people.7 When you take those two combined, the8 numbers are fairly high when we look at the9 actual numbers compared to our overall 10 population.11 If you look at chiropractic care, you12 know, over 2,000 unique patients were treated13 last year alone and almost close to 10,00014 encounters. Two chiropractors did this. We do15 send some out in the community. But actually we16 had two that saw over 2,000 unique patients,17 10,000 encounters. And I might add even last,18 the year before that it was 1,600 unique patients19 and 8,000 encounters, a fairly large number.20 And so, when you look at the magnitude21 of that and how many people we've put our hands22 on just with the therapies, it's a large(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.92 1 percentage here that's additive to their 2 rehabilitation process. Next slide.3 And I'm going to now make the4 transition over to Dr. Paykel. And she'll5 introduce herself. And she'll be talking about6 whole health.7 DR. PAYKEL: Thank you very much. And8 Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for coming to9 visit us, and all of the Commission members. 10 This is very exciting for all of us.11 So I love working here. I'm a veteran12 myself. I was in the Navy for five years. And13 this is a fabulous institution to work in. I14 received wonderful care in the Department of15 Defense while I was active duty, as did my family16 members. And I received wonderful care here as17 well.18 So I just wanted to embellish just a19 little bit the recreational timeline as far as20 CIH modalities are concerned.21 First of all, let me back up for a22 second. I'm a gynecologist by training, and I'm(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.93 1 also boarded in integrative medicine. And 2 currently, I'm serving as the Chief of Whole3 Health. And I work very closely with many of the4 members of the staff here, especially with Dr.5 Scott. He has been doing CIH and as has mental6 health for many years in the facility.7 I came on board in 2014, started, was8 very fortunate to be supported to start a9 holistic shared medical appointment that is now a 10 whole health modality that we offer to our11 veterans. And we will talk about more of that,12 about that more later. But in 2015, that was13 started. And we became a flagship site for the14 Whole Health Endeavor July 1, 2017. So there has15 been so much going on.16 And if we could move to the next17 slide, please, I will explain this in a moment. 18 But I just want to give you some of the data that19 we do have as far as CIH encounters are20 concerned. 21 So we saw approximately 28,000 unique22 patients last year. And that was recorded(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.94 1 through CPT codes that are appropriate for whole 2 health and CIH modalities. 22,600 of those came3 from PM&R interventions, over 5,000 just from our4 sleep clinic as far as mental health is5 concerned, 2,417 from our primary care providers,6 and then within whole health, over 2,000. So we7 are very busy.8 This graphic that you see before you9 is our system as far as whole health is concerned 10 within James Haley. The pathway is how our11 veterans enter into the system. They then go12 through an introduction or orientation. And then13 they are referred to either one of -- either14 Taking Charge of My Life and Health or Whole15 Health Coaching, or they go right into whatever16 modality that they choose at that time.17 On either side of this diagram, you18 see two boxes. Both of those are for clinical19 care. Some of it is inpatient. Some of it is20 outpatient. Some of it is shared medical21 appointment. Some of it is one-on-one22 intervention.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.95 1 And then down below, the eight circles 2 of self-care that we'll see on the next slide,3 the eight circles of self-care are down there. 4 And these are courses that we have available for5 our patients, whether they are didactic in6 nature, immersive in nature, or a combination7 thereof as far as modalities are concerned.8 Those that are represented in green9 are up and running at this point. Those that are 10 in purple are in the planning stages but have11 already significant --- you could build and are12 planning to be underway within the next three13 months. So we have a lot of things going on.14 I can say that one of the reasons why15 we are able to recruit wonderful professionals16 and retain them is because we have exceptionally17 supportive leadership. That is the key to that18 situation, I do believe. Okay. Next slide,19 please.20 So this is just another pictorial that21 can show you the eight different areas of self-22 care in the whole health circle. We call it the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.96 1 whole health circle of life, but just some of the 2 modalities that accompany those different aspects3 of self-care that are available to the veteran. 4 This is within whole health or behavioral5 healthcare or PM&R. Next slide, please.6 And this is Hercules, one of our pets. 7 And I wish he would come for a visit. Is he8 planning to come for a visit today? He will be9 here. You will see him eventually. 10 But what he's doing is he's just11 demonstrating for you one of our treatment12 modalities. And he's affected thousands of13 patients since his inception just over a year ago14 I would say, right? Yes, so just over a year15 ago.16 So again, 28,000 CIH visits, we've had17 3,364 last fiscal year that had at least 10 CIH18 visits, which is really important because we want19 them to come back and continue to participate in20 these endeavors. Once they have their first feel21 of it, though, we have very good rapport with the22 veterans and they continue to come back for more.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.97 1 Just from the whole health service, 2 only in two-month period of time, because we3 didn't have the consult up and running prior to4 that, we're a brand new service, we're just5 getting underway. But in the last two months of6 last fiscal, we had 473. And then we had over7 13,000 patients that had anywhere between 1 and 98 CIH visits.9 So this is something that is -- we are 10 an evolving service. We've only been in11 existence since mid-last year. And I was the12 only employee of this service until November 15th13 of last year. And there were four of us in total14 until middle April.15 And so we are now 38 in number and16 continuing to grow because we have a lot of17 services that we need to deliver and want to18 deliver. But we are being supported in that as19 well. Next slide, please.20 And what we are all about is creating21 community. And this is just a demonstration of22 that community evolving before you.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.98 1 Whether it's through Battlefield 2 Acupuncture, even our director joins in the fun,3 or we have community outreach programs, animal4 therapy. We have healthy teaching kitchen,5 fixing nutritious meals in front of the veterans6 so that they can learn how to do that as well.7 Question and answer services up in the8 right-hand corner, this is THRIVE Immersion. We9 are now hosting 50 providers throughout the 10 country from different VA sites to come in and11 learn THRIVE. And so we are expanding that12 throughout the country. And then up on the left-13 hand side, you can see art therapy going on.14 So there's just a lot of stuff going15 on. But I'll tell you that the most important16 thing about what we do is connect people to17 people. Thank you.18 COMMISSIONER KHAN: You should get19 that President Bush dog because that Labrador20 reminds me of that.21 DR. PAYKEL: Yeah.22 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Doctors, thank you(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.99 1 so much. And it was great to see you again. 2 DR. PAYKEL: Yes, thank you.3 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: I remember Orlando4 about a year ago --5 DR. PAYKEL: Yes, that's --6 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: -- and the great7 job that you've done then and --8 DR. PAYKEL: Thank you.9 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: -- love your 10 enthusiasm by all the doctors and the entire11 staff here. I think we need to bring that12 nationwide.13 But I do have a question that goes14 back to what I believe Commissioner Potoczniak15 asked of Dr. Gironda, if I'm remembering it16 correctly, Mike, and stop me if I'm wrong.17 But it was about any research that has18 been going on, or is there any research and data19 points coming out of CIH type of modality20 treatments right now, and how you're going about21 looking at that type of research. Is it mostly22 anecdotal right now, which I surmise it might be,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.100 1 hearing from Dr. Gironda. 2 But is there a plan in place and is3 somebody leading it? Because I think you have the4 number one program nationwide under the VA, if5 not in the entire country. With all the6 modalities that you're listing here, plus with7 the experts behind it, plus with the veterans8 that are receiving it, I worry that, what are the9 outcomes. 10 So, until you can tell the11 Commissioners and the general public and Congress12 that, boy, these really help or at least rank13 those, and to start us off, anecdotally, I think14 it would help the subcommittee number 3 and a15 little bit on number 5 to really get something16 out of Tampa here before we leave in the next17 three days. So it was a question slash comment18 to see if I was on track with that.19 DR. PAYKEL: Yes, I appreciate that20 because numbers count, and we understand that. 21 We have a very robust relationship with our22 research department. We have a number of studies(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.101 1 underway just -- and that's on a national scale 2 and on a local scale.3 Also, as far as whole health is4 concerned, the veterans, as far as efficacy and5 favorability as far as the practices are6 concerned, that's, at a national level, that is7 being cared for. So we do not intrude upon that8 process locally.9 I can tell you though, however, at 10 THRIVE we have over 200 veterans that have11 graduated from that program. And what we have12 seen in the preliminary data -- we've been13 keeping metrics since the very beginning. We've14 seen a 30 percent reduction in depression over15 the 14-week period of time, a 60 percent16 reduction in anxiety, a 30 percent improvement in17 life satisfaction, and we have a 20 percent18 improvement in neuroplasticity.19 One of the basic tenets of THRIVE is20 acceptance and commitment therapy, also positive21 psychology. So we move towards happiness, not22 just neutrality.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.102 1 And we are seeing a 20 percent 2 improvement in neuroplasticity, which is the3 ability to think about problems in a different4 way, including the disease processes that are5 going on, including the difficult scenarios that6 you've been presented with during the lifetime.7 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Is there also some8 sort of data points as to the decrease of9 pharmaceutical medication that they're on? 10 DR. PAYKEL: We do not have that for11 THRIVE. We are monitoring that with the12 programs. Dr. Gironda had mentioned that. But I13 don't know that we have any firm numbers. Okay. 14 I know at a national level, they are looking at15 that. And there's some preliminary numbers on16 the horizon.17 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Any other18 Commissioners?19 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: One question20 for you, so you're with whole health. Is that21 right?22 DR. PAYKEL: That's correct.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.103 1 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: And then 2 you're with recreation therapy?3 DR. SCOTT: No, I'm in physical4 medicine rehabilitation service.5 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: Okay. So I6 was wondering how, because I know rec therapy is7 a separate -- is it separate of whole health? Is8 that --9 DR. PAYKEL: We are all one. 10 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: You're all11 one. Well, that's --12 DR. PAYKEL: Everybody is one.13 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: Oh, okay. So that's --15 DR. PAYKEL: Yes.16 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: That's17 actually different. That's what I was asking,18 because I know in a lot of VAs there's rec19 therapy and then there's whole health. And so20 you guys have merged together to be one program.21 DR. PAYKEL: This is a very unique22 situation here. We are the first in the country(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.104 1 to be a service in and of itself as far as whole 2 health is concerned. That was done intentionally3 so that we could have a broad-reaching effect4 across the entire facility. We wanted to be able5 to engage not just in one specific area, but6 throughout the entirety.7 And I'll tell you that Ms. Tate, who8 was my original partner in crime, she was very9 crucial in that initial stage when we started 10 this endeavor, because it was she and I that met11 with each of the chiefs of each of the services. 12 And everybody was on board immediately. And I13 meet on a regular basis with the chief of staff,14 too.15 So this really, when I say this is16 one, this is an enterprise-wide endeavor.17 COMMISSIONER you.20 POTOCZNIAK: That's21 breaking down a lot of barriers --22 DR. PAYKEL: Yes, absolutely. Thank(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.105 1 you. 2 DR. SCOTT: I was just going to make3 a comment on the Chair, Commissioner's4 suggestion. And I would highly recommend that5 this Commission really strongly consider an HSR&D6 center or a rehabilitation center or a QUERI7 center for CIH. I think that will be very8 beneficial. I think it will set the VA on9 course. And it may be a recommendation you may 10 want to consider as a group.11 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Matt? 12 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Doctors, I had a13 broad question about physical exercise and its14 relationship to mental health wellness. And can15 you describe how you see that relationship and if16 there's a connection and maybe how that fits in17 with your programs?18 DR. PAYKEL: There is no disease19 process ever that has not improved with physical20 exercise. It fits in very well.21 (Off-microphone comments.)22 DR. SCOTT: Yes. And we use exercise(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.106 1 and movement. And our philosophy is if you can 2 move it, we could rehab it. So --3 (Laughter.)4 DR. SCOTT: And so we use that all the5 time. And we believe it's actually our6 functional goals is to move.7 And I might add that, you know, we've8 had the experience here and the fortunate9 experience and privilege, you know, myself as a 10 provider, to treat the most seriously injured11 from the war, people that can't move anything.12 And we've been able to give them the13 opportunity, the hope, and the healing process14 here to actually start their lives over again. 15 And I think that's one of the unique missions16 here.17 And in order to do that, many of them18 are like an N of 1, you know. And I know we talk19 about research. We talk about evidence-based. 20 We talk about all this stuff. But we have so21 many what I call Ns of 1. In other words,22 there's nobody like this we've ever seen before.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.107 1 And that's why we have to be creative. 2 The providers have to be not only skilled with3 evidence-based, but also be innovative and4 creative in their management and care, as well as5 the team that they all work together with.6 And that's how we got into CIH very7 early on, because that was the only way that we8 could approach some of these complex injuries9 that we see that we've never seen before. 10 And with that, we've found definitely11 a positive environment. And it creates the12 environment of healing, which is so critical and13 so important for our nation and for the14 individuals that we treat. I just want to share15 that with you and, for your thoughts.16 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Wonderfully17 helpful.18 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Doctors, you have19 a very long list of modalities, the longest that20 we've seen to date. Are there any others that21 you're thinking about, that you've heard about,22 that you've read about that are intriguing to you(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.108 1 and/or other veterans that are struggling with 2 mental health?3 DR. PAYKEL: Yes.4 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Yes?5 DR. PAYKEL: There so CHAIR Would you name --7 DR. PAYKEL: Yes.8 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Give us three that9 you think may help veterans with mental health 10 issues.11 DR. PAYKEL: Sensory deprivation12 tanks.13 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Okay.14 and urban15 gardening. Throw out one.16 DR. SCOTT: Well, my lifelong dream I17 guess was started about ten years ago. And18 actually, the Congressman was working with me on19 this. And that's sometimes we think that20 healthcare starts in the health center here. And21 actually, in many ways, they start in the home22 and they start outside.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.109 1 And so I found that mental health, if 2 we can get outside into a more natural healing3 environment, and so I had a proposal a long time4 ago on Heroes Ranch, you know. And it's called a5 whole health heroes ranch where they could6 actually -- and with some type of partnership7 with VA and private that we could put together.8 And we could actually have that9 healing type of environment and use evidence- 10 based, as well as use these new, innovative11 things, as well as use these therapeutic outdoor12 recreational activities and actually allow them13 the opportunity to heal, but not only just14 immediately, but for lifelong, you know,15 intermittently and lifelong aspect.16 And the second thing is we're trying17 to -- I'm also a believer in the home and how we18 -- you hear a lot about telemedicine. But let's19 try to make telemedicine into a connected,20 healthy home I call it. And that's a concept21 we're working on here.22 We started SMART home technology back(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.110 1 in 2011. And we've been working with that. But 2 how can we make a home and monitor the home with3 healthcare factors and healing factors and make4 that the center of healthcare, and --- because I5 am a believer that the healthy home gives you a6 healthy community gives us a healthy country.7 And so if we could focus on a8 connected, healthy home by using our telemedicine9 systems, by using the VA apps, and by using SMART 10 home technology that's out there, we can create11 an environment that our veterans can connect to12 our -- to the VA, connect to their work sites,13 connect to each other, and live a healthy life.14 And then we can monitor those things. 15 We can monitor their sleep. We can monitor their16 activity. We can monitor their medications. We17 can monitor their behavior, because that's what18 we actually started to actually do. We could19 actually manage behavioral changes that really20 will have an effect in the home and in the21 community.22 COMMISSIONER KHAN: So sir, you're a(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.111 1 proponent of giving every veteran that we are 2 treating in that category a smart phone so they3 can -- with the application of the VA --- 4 DR. SCOTT: We're heading to that5 direction right now. We're heading in a6 direction that we want to connect to them, you7 know, in a mobile device, not just a stationary8 web base, so that we can monitor them.9 And actually also just I might add 10 that we're also in the process right now of11 developing an app for the caregiver, because the12 caregiver is so critical and important,13 especially on our seriously disabled or even our14 mental health ones.15 And if we could reduce their burden,16 reduce their stress, you know, with a mobile17 device that could help organize their day and18 organize their system, that's another step19 forward that we can improve quality of health.20 COMMISSIONER KHAN: So, to share with21 you, today if Marine Corps puts me in22 Afghanistan, there's a technology. They monitor(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.112 1 my movement. If I'm hit, the automatic medevac 2 comes and picks me up.3 My request to you is take this pilot4 initiative, ask for that technology. It can be5 civilianized. It doesn't have to be the site of6 -- I mean, we got all kind of secrets, you know,7 in our defense.8 But you can use a push button9 technology, which is available today. When you 10 fall on the golf course and you say I can't get11 up, they send you somebody to pick you up. That12 same technology can be used in what you're trying13 to monitor. And I'll ask the Congressman to14 support you. Tell him my number, the Marine15 asked for it. Thank you, sir.16 (Laughter.)17 DR. SCOTT: I'll remember that.18 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: just a CHAIR We'll end and BEEMAN: Thank you for(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.113 1 your enthusiasm and what you're doing. Here's a 2 concern that I have. When I was at -- I3 commanded the NICoE, the National Intrepid Center4 of Excellence, in Bethesda. And I never met a5 warrior that came to us that said give me more6 medicine, you know.7 And in fact, they went from being8 depressed when they got there to being depressed9 because of their medicine. And so most of the 10 liberation came from, thank god, you know, I'm11 leaving now, because the complementary medicine12 that you were doing and the integrative medicine13 was getting me off a lot of the medication.14 In a country that's so devoted to its15 allopathic sort of roots, we need to somehow16 demonstrate that we can relieve the pharmacology17 and take some of it out of the system and replace18 it with these programmatic sort of lifestyle19 changes.20 And my fear is that if we can't get21 the data that supports it, that the patients are22 better off because they've gone through this(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.114 1 program, which just sounds amazing, inertia will 2 take over and we'll go back to just -- because3 there's so many, only so many resources. And4 this is pretty resource-intensive.5 DR. PAYKEL: That's right.6 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Pharmacy is less7 resource-intensive. It's just more expensive I8 think in the long term. We have to somehow get9 that balance, I think. And so I just want to 10 really encourage you.11 But also I think your idea of having12 a research institute capability that really looks13 at this and says, you know, the tradeoff is this. 14 We just spent $20 billion on pharmacy. This is15 going to cost us $10 billion, but we're going to16 get, relieve another $10 billion worth of17 pharmacy. Unless we can show that, I think we18 might slip into or back to where we're at.19 DR. PAYKEL: I agree that we need20 money, dollars in that effort as far as the21 research is concerned.22 I can tell you that I've been immersed(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.115 1 in THRIVE for three and a half years. And with 2 that, we did a small cohort of patients, did a3 retrospective review on their charts and looked4 at the traditional healthcare resource5 utilization, and it reduced 50 percent.6 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: That's huge.7 DR. PAYKEL: So that -- it is huge,8 exactly right. So we need to quantify this, and9 we need to continue to quantify it. But we need 10 the support in order to do that. Thank you.11 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: No, thank you both,12 Dr. Scott and Dr. Paykel. And it's great to see13 what has taken place, what is continuing to go on14 here in Tampa, what needs to go probably15 nationwide within the VA.16 And I'm pretty sure that the17 Commissioners in charge of 3 and 5 are going to18 be contacting you. And I think that Doctor --19 our director, Battle, would be comfortable with20 that as long as both of you are, because what21 you're doing is extremely important and a big22 part of what the COVER Commission is supposed to(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.116 1 deliver on. 2 So, again, thank you for your3 enthusiasm, your dedication, and your commitment4 to veterans.5 DR. Thank you.6 DR. LEINENKUGEL: We will now take9 a ten-minute stand up, stretch out break maybe 10 led by Alison again for deep breathing exercises,11 a little bio. So, Alison, do you have any DFO --12 - 13 MS. WHITEHEAD: Just be back here in14 ten minutes, at about ten after, we'll resume.15 (Whereupon, the above-entitled matter16 went off the record at 11:00 a.m. and resumed at17 11:12 a.m.)18 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: All right. I'll19 formally bring the COVER Commission back into20 active open session. 21 So at this time, Alison, if you'd22 please introduce these three fine doctors.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.117 1 MS. WHITEHEAD: Great. Sure. So we 2 will resume our open session with pain management3 services. So we have Drs. Murphy, Drake and4 Angeli here to present. So thank you.5 DR. MURPHY: Okay. So I am Dr.6 Murphy. This is Dr. Drake; this is Dr. Angeli. 7 And we are really appreciative today to be here8 to be able to talk about the pain management9 services at James A. Haley Hospital, specifically 10 because we really feel like there's great import11 in terms of the intersection of pain with mental12 health issues as well as so many other medical13 comorbidities. And so we're very, very grateful14 to have the opportunity.15 And I'll also just say, kind of the16 best part of this, some of the other things that17 have come up. I know I speak for all of us to18 say it's really a privilege for us to be able to19 work in the VA and to be able to spend our20 professional time giving back to the veterans of21 this country. And so we just wanted to say thank22 you as well for all of your kind of collective(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.118 1 service. We really appreciate it. 2 So next slide? So I'm just going to3 start with sort of an overview and first talk4 about why are we talking about pain at all in5 this context? It's a little bit of a divergence6 from what we've started with here today. That's7 been a little bit more strictly mental health as8 well as CIH and supportive mental health. And9 this is just some of the more overall -- the data 10 that we have around chronic pain and its11 relationship to the other chronic conditions that12 we see that are so prevalent across the VA health13 care system.14 What we know is that chronic pain is15 more common in veterans than in non-veterans and16 it is not only more common, but also more severe17 in intensity and it is seen in the context of18 numerous comorbidities, particularly psychiatric19 comorbidities. So some data that we have from20 2008 to 2015 shows us that while some of those21 medical comorbidities have remained fairly22 stable, we've actually seen an increase in the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.119 1 psychiatric comorbidities that accompany chronic 2 pain. So it really is timely and important to3 think about how we address all of these issues4 together.5 Some of the other things that of6 course have already come up today but just to tie7 it into pain a little specifically is we saw in a8 behavioral health autopsy report that the VA does9 in looking at suicides back in 2015 that the most 10 frequently identified risk factor among veterans11 who died via suicide was pain. So just it's12 difficult to overstate the importance of asking13 about pain, evaluating it and treating it in the14 context of a whole person. 15 And this morning there's already been16 a number of things that have come up about17 integration and I think that we have this kind of18 intellectual separation of mind and body that19 doesn't exist. So we're always working with a20 whole person sitting in front of us and every21 piece is inextricably tied together. And so22 that's sort of where we're always coming from(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.120 1 with our pain management services in the VA and 2 certainly here at this facility specifically.3 Next slide? So again in the VA4 overall there was officially a Stepped Care model5 for pain management that was established back in6 2009 in a VA Directive, and that's this sort of7 visual aid on the right-hand side of this slide8 where we start off with self-management and kind9 of core foundational educational services around 10 effective pain management and then what optimal11 pain management looks like across the continuum.12 Here at James A. Haley we're sort of13 drilling it down to our local services. We14 started with primary care. We talked a lot about15 our primary care mental health integration, being16 available at the most basic primary care level17 where in fact most people are treated who have18 pain in primary care. And those mental health19 specialists are able to really do a lot of the20 health, psychology, lifestyle management kinds of21 things that they do for a lot of chronic pain22 conditions.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.121 1 We also have some other outstanding 2 resources in primary care. We have an embedded 3 ambulatory pain clinic. So we have expertise in4 primary care so that those physicians can consult5 with somebody to get input on treatment planning,6 specifically medication management decisions,7 things along that line. We also have a pain8 workshop which is a multi-disciplinary, multi-9 week workshop that really addresses all of the 10 different biopsychosocial aspects of pain, the11 biomedical, all of the psychosocial issues that12 surround it as well as environment and how13 different approaches could be helpful.14 As we kind of move up the ladder we15 move into our specialty pain care services, and16 that -- one of the critical pieces of that is our17 outpatient pain medicine clinic. We have a18 variety of services. These are individuals who19 are really physicians who are boarded in pain20 medicine. This is their expertise. They're able21 to provide higher level really expertise on22 medical management, interventions and procedures. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.122 1 We also have the chiropractors that 2 were mentioned previously. They're embedded in3 our pain clinic which is really great. We made4 that transition when we moved into the building5 that we're in now, and I think that's really6 improved the kind of seamless care between7 chiropractics and our pain services that sort of8 used to be collocated, which is great. 9 And then another part of that, the 10 collocation of that in the medical clinic is we11 also have a group of pain psychologists who are12 also embedded in that clinic. And so those pain13 psychologists are able to do the work where --14 not only of addressing the psychosocial needs15 that are related with pain, but also to support16 the physicians when there is an emergent issue,17 an issue around suicidal ideation, other things18 that come up to be able to just go directly to19 someone's door and get that support for the20 veteran at the moment it occurs versus there21 being any delay in that process, which is really22 wonderful.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.123 1 Other things we do at the secondary 2 specialty level from a mental health perspective,3 we have a large pain psychology service here. 4 We're incredibly fortunate to have the largest5 one in the VA system, and so we're able to offer6 all of the evidence-based psychological therapies7 for chronic pain. Those are cognitive behavioral8 therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and9 mindfulness-based stress reduction. Biofeedback 10 also has a firm evidence base specifically to11 support headache management, which we offer for12 that here as well by one of the psychologists in13 our section.14 In addition we have an Integrated Pain15 Management Team who reviews our high-risk16 veterans. This includes someone from our17 Substance Use Disorder Team as well as medical18 and behavioral, so everyone's in a room together19 reviewing these individuals who are at highest20 risk for adverse events including suicide so that21 we can really take a closer look at those and22 make appropriate recommendations.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.124 1 Dr. Scott of course already talked 2 about the wonderful PM&R therapies that are also3 important when it comes to pain. We have the4 physical side, and so we need physical therapy,5 occupational therapy, all of the things that fall6 under the purview of PM&R.7 And then we're going to talk a little8 bit more about our inpatient and outpatient9 interdisciplinary rehabilitation options. A 10 couple that we have here: our Chronic Pain11 Program as well as our Chronic Headache12 Management Program. That's also the only one in13 the VA where it offers an interdisciplinary14 approach to headache management. It can be a15 particularly challenging pain issue to address16 and so we're very pleased to have that program17 growing and developing as well.18 Next slide? So in addition to that19 because we're talking about evidence-based20 psychotherapies for mental health, cognitive21 behavioral therapy for chronic pain is one of the22 VA's evidence-based psychotherapies that's been(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.125 1 rolled out as part of the EBP initiative in VA. 2 And that started back in 2012. I've been a part3 of that program since its initiation and the lead4 author for the manual for that treatment as well5 as the national VA trainer for that. 6 We have been able to be very effective7 across this system since we've been doing that,8 have trained over 500 clinicians in how to use9 these interventions to help people with chronic 10 pain live their best life, respond to the pain in11 a more effective way so that there's less12 detrimental impacts with pain on their lives.13 We have a wonderful cohort of people14 at this VA specifically who also serve as our15 regional trainers. Dr. Angeli is one of them. 16 We have multiple consultants here that support17 the program nationally, but again also help us18 locally here. And CBT for chronic pain, which is19 the -- a first-line treatment for chronic pain20 according to the Clinical Practice Guidelines21 from VA, DoD, from the CDC, basically all of the22 official recommendations for clinical practice(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.126 1 for pain treatment is to use CBT for chronic pain 2 as a first-line treatment and to offer it to3 everybody who has pain. 4 And thankfully we're actually able to5 do that here because we have the capacity to do6 it. We offer it individually and in groups as7 well as in Spanish, which is wonderful. We have8 one of our staff members who's translated the9 manual and does a CBT group in Spanish as well. 10 Next slide? So one thing we also11 really wanted to highlight here is the12 Interdisciplinary Pain Program we have here in13 Tampa. We're really the flagship for the14 development and maintenance of these types of15 programs across the VA. Back in 2008 there were16 two of these programs in the VA. And so I'm17 specifically referring to CARF, or Commission on18 Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, CARF-19 accredited pain rehab programs in the VA. Today20 there are 20. We have really led the way in21 helping other VAs to develop these types of22 programs. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.127 1 So we hosted over 30 teams from across 2 the VA in trying to demonstrate, train, work with3 them to tailor what are their resources, how4 could they have an Interdisciplinary Pain Program5 at their own VA. We have both an inpatient and6 outpatient CARF-accredited program. Our7 inpatient program is the only one in the VA8 system, so we -- and it was established in 1988,9 so this is our 30-year anniversary this year. So 10 we've actually been doing this for a very long11 time. 12 And we accepted missions from across13 the country. The majority of those are long-14 distance admissions. So they are from outside of15 our catchment area, although we're very happy to16 be able to offer services to our local veterans17 as well. 18 Systematically, since this program19 started everybody who comes into the program is20 tapered off of opioid medications during their21 three-week admission. We have a lot of outcomes22 that we would be more than happy to share with(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.128 1 you. We collect patient outcomes on everybody 2 who comes into the program. 3 I did a large-scale study and looked4 at these outcomes a couple of years ago comparing5 the pain rehabilitation outcomes for 7006 consecutive admissions, comparing those who had7 tapered from opioids during the program, for8 those who came in not on opioids and went through9 -- they go through the same pain rehab program. 10 And what we saw was that not only did everybody11 improve across domains, but those who were12 tapered from opioids actually improved even more. 13 And so we see across all pain-related functional14 outcomes, including pain intensity, that there15 are positive outcomes across domains.16 Okay. Next slide? And this is just17 a really I think nice example of -- so we are so18 glad to be of the whole health flagship and have19 this come on board here. It fits incredibly well20 with the Chronic Pain Rehabilitation Program21 because we've always taken a -- very much a whole22 person approach to pain care because that's the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.129 1 way that you achieve optimal outcomes. If you 2 are only addressing the biomedical aspects, it's3 an incredibly important piece, but it's one tire,4 and so you're not going to get things off the5 ground if you don't address the rest of what's6 happening with the individual.7 And so this is that whole health8 wheel, but this is literally just for our Pain9 Program and everything that we're doing within 10 the context of that program. So as you can see,11 it not only covers our evidence-based12 psychotherapy options, but also many of our PM&R13 options, as well as everybody who participates in14 these programs does yoga and tai chi and15 mindfulness and classes with the chaplain and16 sort of covers again start to finish everything17 that goes on for a human being who's living with18 a chronic condition like pain that impacts so19 many different things. 20 So we are happy to answer any21 questions about any of these services. Dr.22 Angeli is the director of our Inpatient Program. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.130 1 Dr. Drake is the chair of our Pain Facility 2 Council and one of our pain boarded physicians. 3 And we're happy to answer any questions that you4 might have about our pain services.5 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Dr. Murphy, thank6 you very much. Very extensive and we're going to7 have questions.8 So, Tom, why don't you lead it off?9 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Well, first of 10 all, I think the director should be very proud of11 this, all of the teams that have presented today,12 and you should be issued seat belts because13 everybody's so excited they're jumping in. 14 (Laughter.)15 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: -- which is16 really a tribute to the leadership.17 And, Dr. Drake, I assume -- are you an18 anesthesiologist? Is that what you said?19 DR. DRAKE: That is my primary20 specialty.21 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: I guess a22 question that I have is why do veterans have more(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.131 1 pain? What, is it that they have physical 2 injuries or is it their moral injuries create3 psychological issues that exacerbate pain? You4 said it with such authority. I was just curious5 because if we look at this what's creating that6 in our population that we're trying to serve?7 DR. MURPHY: I think there's a few8 important factors: One is just their military9 service. So obviously it's a very physical 10 service that you undertake when you go into that. 11 And so we certainly have veterans who have12 sustained injuries, multiple jumps over time. 13 Their bodies have essentially been under more14 duress and wear and tear than your average15 person. 16 I also think, at least in the VA17 system, we do see maybe versus the population in18 general, more individuals who also in their --19 outside of their military service work in jobs20 where there's construction or police officers or21 firemen, people that are in jobs in the private22 sector that also -- they're not necessarily(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.132 1 sitting behind a desk for a lot of their day. So 2 again, they're kind of -- have more wear and tear3 to their bodies. 4 And I think your other point is also5 really important that we also may see a6 population that has more vulnerabilities when it7 comes to the psychological pieces and the8 physical pieces coming together. We know that9 trauma is something that is related. There's a 10 correlation between a trauma history and the11 development of chronic pain. So again, we sort12 of have a group of things that puts our13 population at a greater risk for the development14 of pain problems. 15 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: You did a16 wonderful job in describing how you're addressing17 pain. Are there things that the Commission18 should know or that you would like us to know so19 that if we're looking at our final report we can20 say in the area of pain we need to address A, B,21 C?22 DR. MURPHY: That's a big question. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.133 1 And as it sounds like, is evident, I'm very 2 passionate about this work. I think we -- a lot3 of what's happening, which is really wonderful,4 right now in the private sector as well as in the5 VA, who really is leading the charge, is that we6 do need this cultural transformation where we are7 talking about a biopsychosocial approach to pain. 8 So I think that, at least for me, a9 couple of the most important things are, one, 10 intervening from a biopsychosocial perspective as11 early as possible. So not waiting until somebody12 has had pain for 10 years before we mention this13 concept that all of these pieces are related and14 important to the pain process and to chronicity. 15 I would say one thing for the future would be if16 we can focus on, which goes so well with17 everything that we're talking about here -- but18 wellness and prevention. How can we stem the19 chronification? 20 There's a lot of people that we see in21 our programs who will say; I know everyone who22 works in the programs has heard this so many(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.134 1 times, why didn't somebody tell me this 15 years 2 ago? Why didn't somebody talk to me about this a3 long time ago? And it's -- all you can do is4 sort of say I'm sorry, but there's a lot of5 initiatives that I think need to happen around6 the kind of education that we provide, both in7 our medical schools, but also there's a shortage8 of training in the mental health field around9 what kinds of interventions can lead you as 10 mental health clinicians to help people who have11 pain. 12 One, we have to ask about it, but when13 you're trained, you're less fearful about what to14 do. You know how you can help someone. So I15 think that the education is really the beginning16 of that cultural transformation and getting in17 there as early as possible is something that we18 really need to do to help with pain care.19 I also would say that certainly20 something that's a pressing obvious need now is21 better understanding and treating the22 intersection of pain and opioid use disorder. So(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.135 1 understanding that population better and what 2 their needs are so that we can treat them most3 effectively would be another area that I would4 focus on.5 COMMISSIONER ROSE: If I may, just to6 follow up on the opioid part, and the program you7 have here sounds like it's been very successful,8 what is your rate of relapses as the folks go9 through this program? 10 DR. MURPHY: So it's a good question. 11 Our data, kind of long-term data shows us that12 about -- at follow-up say one month, three13 months, six months out, we had about 15 percent14 return to opioid use.15 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Fifteen percent?16 DR. MURPHY: But 85 percent don't, at17 least from the data that we're getting.18 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Right, right,19 right.20 DR. MURPHY: So --22 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Yes.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.136 1 DR. MURPHY: -- numbers there. 2 COMMISSIONER ROSE: Thank you.3 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: So could I4 have a question about -- to what extent do you5 guys work with addiction medicine using like6 buprenorphine or naltrexone or something like7 that, because -- yes, either during the taper or8 after the taper how many people stay on it? Do9 you use methadone at all? So anyway, that's -- 10 DR. MURPHY: So in our chronic pain11 rehabilitation programs that were in inpatient12 programs we are focused -- really mainly we're13 treating individuals who do not have opioid use14 disorder and are safely tapered off of opioids15 completely, and therefore are not transitioned to16 a medically assisted treatment like Suboxone or17 something along that line. 18 We do have a lot of individuals on an19 outpatient basis that we see who do meet the20 criteria for opioid use disorder and therefore we21 work very closely with our Substance Use Disorder22 Team to be able to have those psychiatrists who(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.137 1 specialize in the treatment of OUD assist with 2 transitioning them to a medically assisted3 treatment that's appropriate for more chronic4 management. The key is -- which is a complicated5 one, is figuring out again sort of the6 intersection of those individuals and also making7 sure that they get appropriate pain care. 8 Everybody on MAT doesn't have chronic9 pain of course, but a proportion of them do. And 10 we would like to -- we feel like if we could11 adequately address their pain needs, we could12 certainly help their recovery trajectory overall. 13 And so that's one area we certainly are seeking14 to improve all the time, that that is one of the15 goals of that Pain Management Team that's16 interdisciplinary, that has all of those people,17 representatives. How can we become more18 integrated so that we're better able to sort of19 move people on that continuum, identify people as20 early as possible and figure out how to optimize21 their treatment.22 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: So to follow(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.138 1 up to that, because there's -- you mentioned 2 people with opioid use disorder would work with3 your Substance Use Team, but how about the people4 that -- you know, we have a lot of veterans; and5 I've seen this a lot, that have been taking6 opioids for 30-plus years who clearly wouldn't --7 characterize as an opioid use8 disorder because they've been following it by 9 prescription -- 10 DR. MURPHY: Yes.11 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: -- but they12 are dependent. 13 DR. MURPHY: Yes.14 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: How do you15 handle that because their taper is going to look16 different?17 DR. MURPHY: Absolutely. Yes, I mean,18 I think nationally -- and certainly we're very19 much in line with how the VA approaches this20 overall here and do a wonderful job of, one,21 making it very veteran-centric. 22 And so, having that conversation about(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.139 1 what are you taking and what does your life look 2 like? I think one of the questions that we often3 don't focus on enough is that it has to be about4 functioning, so -- we make all of these decisions5 independently, so if there's somebody who has6 been on opioids for a long time and their7 functioning is great and they're maintained on8 say a low dose of opioids, I think that a9 prescriber in our clinic would talk to them about 10 their quality of life, their interest in making11 any maybe minor reductions in that, and possibly12 if there is a collaborative treatment plan13 established to maybe start to make some changes14 on that. Maybe make a minor reduction very15 slowly and see if their life changes at all. 16 Does that impact their functioning? If not,17 maybe just return to exactly what it was before.18 I think the bigger question is that we19 certainly work with people who even themselves20 feel there's a bit of an over-reliance on the21 medication. Maybe they have been on it for22 decades and they would actually prefer to maybe(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.140 1 not be on it or be on less. And so is there a 2 way that we can work with them to talk about what3 are some of the other treatments, pharmacological4 as well as non-pharmacological, that can be5 offered and maybe start to make some of those6 changes and see how the person does and really7 just evaluate it at every visit and see what the8 best plan of care for them is.9 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Dr. Murphy, who 10 started the Cognitive Behavior Therapy Program?11 DR. MURPHY: So that is part of that12 evidence-based psychotherapy initiative out of13 the Mental Health Office in VA Central Office. 14 So back in -- so it's their program. Back in15 2012 they got a small group of us together as16 subject matter experts and we did a fairly17 exhaustive review of the literature of18 psychological interventions that can be provided19 for chronic pain to decide what was the most 20 evidence-supported approach. That was cognitive21 behavioral therapy.22 There are others that are supported by(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.141 1 evidence. It has the biggest stack because it's 2 been around the longest. And so we basically3 took that evidence and chose those core4 components and created a protocol that really5 synthesized those most critical pieces. The6 manual was born out of that protocol and that's7 what we've been using since that time.8 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: So No. 1, the VA9 started it? 10 DR. MURPHY: Yes, it's one of the VA's11 large group of evidence-based psychotherapies.12 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: It didn't come13 from private sector?14 DR. MURPHY: Not from the -- oh, no,15 not -- it's a VA manual.16 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Answered that17 question. 18 DR. MURPHY: Yes. Yes.19 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: No. 2, what is the20 effectiveness of it?21 DR. MURPHY: So we have a couple of22 studies specifically -- I will -- full(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.142 1 disclosure: one of them that I'm working on 2 submitting right at this moment, that's the3 largest cohort that we have that looks at4 effectiveness of CBT for chronic pain,5 specifically the VA's version. So when you look6 at the general literature for CBT for chronic7 pain, there is good evidence for effectiveness8 with reductions in pain intensity, pain-related9 disability, reductions in pain catastrophizing 10 etcetera.11 The VA's protocol, we have a smaller12 study that we did a few years ago. It showed13 improved outcomes across domains again in things14 like -- pain-related functioning is one of the15 things that we always look at. Intensity, as16 well as pain-related catastrophizing, which is17 really kind of negative thinking related with18 pain, which is very associated with disability.19 The data that we have right now is a20 much larger sub-set of veterans who have used CBT21 for chronic pain as part of our training program. 22 So it's close to 600 veterans. And we also see(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.143 1 very positive effects from that. Again, similar 2 outcomes with reductions in pain intensity,3 functional improvement. It's across domains and4 they're anywhere from small to moderate effects5 on each of those domains.6 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Thank you for7 that. I guess since it started in the VA, and if8 my math is correct over six years ago now, how do9 you feel about the transference across the 10 system? Where is it at right now?11 DR. MURPHY: I'm really pleased with12 how it's all kind of transitioned and generalized13 across the system.14 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Let me back up and15 say there's 168 VA Medical Centers. How many are16 practicing now? 17 DR. MURPHY: I can get you the exact18 data because I have a very large spreadsheet with19 that information, but it is almost every -- I20 believe that CBT for chronic pain is available at21 every main medical hospital in the VA system. I22 can't say for sure like here we have it available(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.144 1 at our CBOCs and our outpatient centers. I can't 2 say that there's a trained person at every single3 outpatient center, but at every VA Medical Center4 there are multiple people that have been trained5 in CBT for chronic pain that are able to use6 that.7 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: I would hope so,8 because Admiral Beeman as a Commissioner brought9 it up right away to you that veterans have a 10 significant higher --11 DR. MURPHY: Yes.12 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: -- number13 inflicted with chronic pain. So if we started14 this in 2012 and this is one of the a-ha moments15 that I associate at least; and I don't have16 enough evidence, that pain definitely has an17 impact on a person's mental health and well-18 being.19 So that being said, I would hope that20 this would be a best practice spread across all21 the VAs and we'd need to clarify that.22 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Jake, for the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.145 1 record though, the VA didn't invent CBT. They 2 invented their own program, but it was invented I3 think by Aaron Beck, right, years and years ago. 4 He's like a 90 -- 5 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Thanks for6 clarifying that. 7 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: I just wanted to8 make sure. 9 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: No, I thought it 10 was started from the VA the way it was described11 to me.12 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Yes. No, no. 13 It was started by Aaron Beck. He created the14 field probably 40 years ago or something like15 that.16 DR. MURPHY: So cognitive behavioral17 therapy is something that initially was really18 applied to traditional mental health conditions19 such as depression and anxiety. There's a large20 amount of longstanding data to support that. 21 Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been22 applied for the treatment of chronic pain very(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.146 1 much again on a longstanding basis outside of the 2 VA. 3 When the VA puts together these4 evidence-based psychotherapy programs they tailor5 them for VA training and distribution, but6 they're using evidence that comes from academic7 settings and the private sector. So it's well-8 supported globally in the literature. And then9 we also take a look at our own personal version 10 as well as its application to veterans and what11 it looks like for them.12 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Thank you for13 clarifying that.14 DR. MURPHY: Sorry if that was15 confusing.16 KHAN: Dr. Murphy, do you17 use acupuncture? I didn't see that on the list.18 DR. MURPHY: In terms of like in our19 pain programs or something?20 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Sure.21 DR. MURPHY: So we have a lot of22 individuals who we put consults through our pain(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.147 1 clinics to receive acupuncture. Those services 2 are somewhat limited inside kind of the walls of3 our VA, so we do a lot of community-based4 acupuncture accessing. It isn't something that5 we actually use within our pain program itself,6 but we certainly utilize it a great deal in terms7 of referrals to outside --8 COMMISSIONER KHAN: The CHOICE9 Program? 10 DR. MURPHY: Yes. in the11 community.12 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Dr. Murphy, I had13 I guess one real specific question and then one14 more kind of out there for the whole group.15 The first one, is CBT for chronic pain16 billable by mental health clinicians in the17 community generally? So for the veterans not18 working with the VA, as they go to their mental19 health provider, could they be -- could they bill20 for this?21 DR. MURPHY: It's one of the more22 complicated and problematic issues that we have(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.148 1 as psychologists who are focused on a chronic 2 pain population. In the private sector things3 are much more restrictive around psychological4 services as well as the kind of interdisciplinary5 programs that we're able to offer here, which are6 really the gold standard of treatment. Those7 kinds of programs are very limited in the8 community.9 There's a couple of difficulties with 10 accessing a pain psychologist in the community. 11 One is that whereas the VA has this training12 program and network where we're able to identify13 who has received this training, in the private14 sector it's much more difficult. There is not a15 boarding say in pain psychology. There's not an16 easy way to Google yourself to a psychologist who17 has training in chronic pain services. So that18 piece makes it complicated and there are19 definitely restrictive billing practices. 20 Because I am mainly focusing on the21 VA, I don't know as much about reimbursement, but22 I'm very active in professional societies and I(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.149 1 know that's one of the limitations of one of the 2 things that is brought up on a regular basis that3 we need to have more coverage for these kinds of4 services, which are recommended as first-line5 treatments, and then we can't get them covered by6 the payers. And that's a huge obstacle to being7 able to utilize something that's a first-line8 treatment if insurance won't pay for it.9 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: So is that a nice 10 way for you to ask the Commission for help?11 (Laughter.)12 DR. MURPHY: If I was able to play any13 small part in moving the ball forward towards14 getting psychological services for chronic pain15 better covered and accessible to individuals16 across the country, it would be an amazing17 accomplishment, honestly, because that is one of18 the biggest shortcomings that we have is that19 when we talk about the services that had the best20 evidence CBT for chronic pain and21 interdisciplinary pain programs have the22 strongest evidence and it is incredibly difficult(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.150 1 in the private sector to access them or to even 2 get these programs built. 3 I mean, we were able to be this4 beautiful model system here in the VA because we5 have -- because we're fortunate enough to be able6 to do the work. In the private sectors there's a7 handful of them; that's it, in the whole -- in8 the country. It's a small network and so we know9 each other well and there's not much opportunity 10 for these kinds of pain programs that are so11 incredibly effective or the ancillary12 psychological services as well.13 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: I see.14 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: And that was what15 I was -- I just had a second question. Can you16 talk about the relationship between physical pain17 and psychological pain, and what the roots are18 there or --19 DR. MURPHY: Again, I just -- to me20 there's -- when it comes to the experience of21 chronic pain, even as the International22 Association for the Study of Pain, which is kind(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.151 1 of the big pain academic body -- their definition 2 of pain is that it's a sensory and emotional3 experience. So as far as I think how we4 conceptualize pain is it's not a physical5 experience. It's the way that it's processed is6 our brain. And it's an emotional process as well7 as a physical process.8 I think the individual differences9 among everybody in the population, how it impacts 10 their lives, how they respond to pain, the11 support system that they have or don't have, this12 is where a lot of our services come into play13 because it's -- a lot of it is about how do you14 respond to the pain? What do you do with it? 15 That has so much of an impact on what we see in16 terms of the outcomes. How does pain actually17 impact your life.18 I don't know if that's a great answer19 to your question, but --20 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Thank you.21 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: And just a22 point of clarification for Jake and for Matt. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.152 1 When you're talking about billing for these 2 services, we also have to keep in mind that most3 facilities in the VA are paying Medicare rates to4 high-performing professionals in the community5 and they pay late. So you can't really think6 about expanding into the private sector at all7 until you fix that problem because a pain8 psychologist in Tampa, Florida is not going to9 accept Medicare rates. So even if you get the 10 agreements, they're not going to accept Medicare11 rates and the fact that they're going to have to12 wait six months to get paid.13 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Yes, we're going14 to find out shortly, Commissioner Potoczniak, if15 the MISSION Act is going to resolve that issue.16 COMMISSIONER HARVEY: May I ask a17 quick question? The cover article in the DAV18 magazine this month, which I just happened to19 read yesterday, talks about medical marijuana in20 the treatment of pain. And as marijuana is being21 accepted in medical terms but also recreationally22 in several states, obviously things are moving(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.153 1 rapidly in that area. Do you do anything with 2 regard to medical marijuana?3 DR. MURPHY: I mean, in terms of do4 anything, I think that the way that we approach5 medical marijuana is to -- kind of the way that6 we would do our normal clinical whole-person7 assessment. So we evaluate for -- is the person8 using tobacco? Are they using alcohol? Are they9 using medical marijuana? Are they using other 10 substances? Kind of how are they using them? 11 What are they using them for? What's the impact12 on their life? What's their functioning? And we13 just take that as another component of their14 clinical picture. 15 Obviously the VA isn't involved16 directly at this point in time, as you know, with17 anything related to medical marijuana, but it's18 certainly increasingly a part of our clinical19 care and it's something that we're aware of20 that's a part of what people present with. And21 so I think for most of us we're -- it's another22 piece of data that we use in terms of the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.154 1 person's -- potentially their management of their 2 disease.3 The one thing I would say just in4 terms of again our overall approach, we really5 try to encourage as much as possible really6 active management of chronic pain. So doing7 things like a lot of our movement-based8 activities, things that you can impact how you9 respond to pain in a certain way. So we seek to 10 sort of increase those things that are maybe more11 actively a part of managing pain and potentially12 decrease some of the things that are more passive13 as far as the treatment.14 But we would just I think approach15 medical marijuana in the same way as we would a16 lot of other things as far as the clinical17 picture in determining are there any18 contraindications with certain medical19 prescribing, again in the same way as we might20 for alcohol or something else. Does this change21 what your medication treatment plan looks like? 22 And it may. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.155 1 COMMISSIONER HARVEY: Well, and one of 2 the implications of the article is that there3 should be research into what does -- that there4 should be research that would provide evidence or5 to give -- you know, because medical marijuana is6 becoming legalized in many places, and7 recreational marijuana as well in many more8 places. So it is coming. We ought to know what9 the implications are when this arrives in the 10 next what, three to five years, whatever? 11 Probably in a relatively short time.12 DR. MURPHY: Right. Yes, I mean,13 obviously the illicit nature of marijuana has14 made it more challenging to do the kind of15 empirical data looks that as you're saying are16 really in order now, and hopefully it would be17 fast-tracked so we can see a little bit more in18 terms of impacts and outcomes and things like19 that because the data is certainly very limited20 currently.21 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Well, I guess a22 question aligned to that is it's not a tool in(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.156 1 your tool kit today because of the federal 2 proscription, but it's starting to be in the tool3 kit of providers in certain communities where4 it's been legalized. And I think what I'm5 hearing you say is we need more studies because6 clearly if it's an important tool, which I have7 no alignment either way because I don't know --8 but if it's an important tool and you don't have9 that tool, we need to do research to see if it's 10 a tool that should be added.11 DR. DRAKE: I guess I would say just12 real quick my opinion on it is that it would be13 treated like any other drug out there is that the14 research is needed. You don't just want to start15 using something if someone anecdotally says16 something is important. Maybe there's really bad17 side effects for one condition, but then it could18 be used for another that it would get -- have19 benefits. You have to know so much more before20 you could confidently say, yes, let's use it. 21 But if there are benefits, it would be a big22 benefit to have that out there, the evidence(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.157 1 there to make practitioners comfortable in 2 saying, okay, I know what I'm giving, I know what3 I'm treating and I know what outcomes possibly4 there would be. 5 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Any other6 questions? Any comments from the Commission at7 this point?8 (No audible response.)9 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Again, very 10 professional, very dedicated, enthusiastic and11 just doing tremendous work. Thank you, doctor,12 so much for everything that you continue to do13 for veterans. 14 (Applause.)15 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: At this time I16 would like to formally close the COVER Commission17 open session on December 4th, 2018.

WHITEHEAD: So, I think everyone16 can see a great panelist here. We are going to17 introduce Dr. Colleen Jakey to come up here.18 DR. JAKEY: Thank you. Good morning,19 everyone. Again, I'd like to thank the20 Commission for this opportunity for us to be able21 to present to you this morning.22 We're going to be introducing some of(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.9 1 our key community partners that we are very 2 fortunate to have. As you've heard, the very3 Veteran-centric community, and in that, we have4 wonderful partners that are really integral in5 the care that we provide.6 So, I am going to be introducing them7 and then asking them to share some with you and8 then, obviously, there will be plenty of time,9 and really the majority is really for questions 10 that you might have for them.11 If you wouldn't mind, I did want to12 take one liberty at the beginning. And, I did13 want to acknowledge, after discussions yesterday,14 our leadership within our programs and why I feel15 very fortunate to work here as Chief of Staff,16 and why I feel very strongly about the success of17 our programs.18 So, first, you met Dr. Paykel19 yesterday from Whole Health. You know, this is a20 brand new service. I've never anyone where you21 start a new service. And, so she's started from22 the ground up.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.10 1 We had complimentary integrative 2 health measures, different techniques, but we did3 not have a service for whole health. So, she4 developed the structure, the clinics, the5 providers, new initiatives. 6 I mean, she's taken some of the7 national ideas and developed our own local --8 we're going to have inpatient whole health nurses9 and coaches. 10 And so, I did want to acknowledge that11 that is a huge task to take on.12 There was discussions yesterday as13 whole health, its own service, is it a separate14 service? Does it wrap in rec therapy?15 The way we envision it is, we have16 mental health. We have primary care. We have17 surgery. And, whole health will be a service18 that will overarch over all of those. So, it19 really is the true integrated medicine approach.20 But, most importantly, I think having21 it as its own service and having a dedicated22 service sheet is what really will lead to the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.11 1 success and the sustainment. 2 Because, we were talking yesterday3 about the sustainment and the ability to keep4 these measures, these initiatives, these programs5 going on.6 And so, having one person who is7 responsible for making sure of the success of8 that, but also the cultural transformation of our9 institutions. So, I feel very strongly that 10 having its own service with its own leader is11 really what will help to integrate whole health,12 NCIH and everything we do.13 I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Dr.14 Scott. Clearly, he's an innovator in15 interdisciplinary care and our physical medics16 and in rehab. And, is known nationally for that.17 He developed some of our earliest18 implementation of CIH, but also, he's really a19 thought leader that makes all of us re-examine20 how we provide healthcare.21 And, finally, mental health, there was22 a discussion yesterday about mental health and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.12 1 how we are able to not have difficulty in hiring 2 and maintaining psychiatrists. That really is3 all about our mental health leadership.4 The ability for Dr. Catalano and Dr.5 Gironda to recruit and recruit wonderful people. 6 And then, once they recruit them, then those7 wonderful people are happy and then we recruit8 more.9 And so, I think that leadership and 10 recruitment really is the key.11 The second part of that is they are12 both imbedded in education. And so, we have a13 very large psychology training program with 814 interns, 13 post-docs and then I think 1215 graduate students.16 We are an integral part of the17 psychiatry residency at USF and we are actually18 the primary teaching site where that's in Tampa,19 most -- Tampa General is usually the primary20 teaching site. So, for psychiatry, we are.21 And so, that educational mission, one,22 allows us to meet these people and recruit them(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.13 1 and train them. 2 It also elevates the level of care3 we're able to provide.4 But, in addition, it allows us to5 develop the sub-specialties that we need to6 address these specific populations.7 And so, you know, we work on having8 post-docs in these areas, so trauma and9 neuropsych, obviously, we have our pain program, 10 substance abuse, we have Suboxone providers.11 And so, I think it's the ability to12 train these sub-specialties and work with them13 that allows us to provide that level of care.14 But, I really do have to say it's the15 style of leadership from Dr. Catalano that is16 what has allowed all of this.17 You have met with numerous of our18 leaders under mental health in your small groups. 19 And, as you see, he recruits them, empowers them20 and then they are engaged and they develop their21 own programs and grow them.22 And so, allowing the leaders under(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.14 1 him, you know, to flourish and develop and think 2 out of the box really is what has led to the3 success of many of these programs.4 So, I just wanted to acknowledge that. 5 Thank you.6 All right, so now, our community7 partners, thank you all for coming. Again, we8 really value our community partners and feel that9 they are integral. We -- I will talk a little 10 about our mental health summit.11 But, again, we see it as very much a12 two-way street. We are only able to do what we13 can do with the help of our community partners. 14 It really does take a village, we talk about that15 all the time.16 And, really, two sides. We rely on17 them to help us identify and find Veterans that18 are not seeking care in the VA, but we also rely19 on them to be able to provide comprehensive care20 to all of our patients. Because, you know, we21 can't do every part of it and so, we rely on22 them.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.15 1 We have some representatives today 2 from our different groups that we work with. 3 One, we have numerous outreach events you've4 heard, our mental health summit we have in every5 county, every year. We develop relationships, we6 work, on education and talk about military7 culture in those.8 And also, brainstorm on ways to co-9 ordinate care. So, when Veterans are in and out 10 of the VA system, how do we share all that11 information back and forth and make sure we are12 all up to date?13 Suicide prevention has numerous14 outreaches per month on awareness and our15 resources that we have available.16 PTSD clinical team works with local17 universities, faith-based and does training also18 of local law enforcement.19 As far as our -- some of our broader20 partners, Veterans Treatment Court, I don't know21 if you've heard about that and our role with22 them, but we work with them to provide training,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.16 1 but also to be a contact so that when -- and, 2 obviously, we host the Veterans Treatment Court3 in our facilities.4 But so that when there is someone who5 needs to be transitioned into mental health care6 from the Treatment Court, we facilitate that.7 Mission United, as we'll introduce, is8 really a community of Veterans engagement group9 that's doing wonderful work in our community and 10 we'll talk a little bit about the crisis center.11 So, now, I'd like to introduce each of12 our panel members just briefly. After I13 introduce all of them, I've asked them to sort of14 give us just a brief description of their15 relationship and role with Veterans in our16 community and then, obviously, I know that you'll17 have questions for them.18 So, all right, I'm going to start at19 this end with Manny. So, Manny Guevara-Ruiz is a20 former Army member. He served in the Army from21 1993 until 2006.22 He actually served in combat under the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.17 1 command of the 25th Infantry Division, Tropic 2 Lightning.3 He served our community and our4 Veterans since 2014 in several capacities,5 including as a case manager, a navigation6 specialist for support services for Veterans and7 families program.8 He also served our community's9 homeless Veteran population as the program 10 manager for Circle of Veterans and Families11 Development of Homeless Shelter initiative and12 became a part of the inaugural team of the13 Veteran Peers of the Crisis Tampa Center, the14 Crisis Center of Tampa Bay and that's really what15 he's here to speak to today.

I think, if5 you don't mind, I'll actually start with Manny6 from the Crisis Center and we'll sort of work our7 way down.8 MR. GUEVARA-RUIZ: Good morning, all.9 At the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, we 10 are dedicated to connectivity. We understand11 that, at times, reaching out straight to the VA12 may seem a bit far off.13 So, we connect our callers to14 community service providers as well as the VA. 15 The main idea is staying connected.16 And, we do this through a peer-ship17 program. Thank you.18 MS. PECORI: Good morning and thank19 you for having us here.20 I'm with Central Florida Behavioral21 Health Network. We are the managing entity here22 in the Suncoast Region. And, what that means is,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.24 1 we don't provide direct services, we get dollars 2 from the Department of Children and Families here3 in Florida and then we subcontract those dollars4 out to 14 counties here in this region,5 Hillsborough County is one of them and several of6 the other counties that the VA serves as well.7 We've partnered with the VA for many,8 many years, reaching out to attend their summits. 9 And this year, having the pleasure to host the 10 summit.11 I work in the Consumer and Family12 Affairs Department and one of the main things13 that I do working with Veterans and the VA is14 working with Dr. Shiber and the peer support15 specialists that she hires. I am one of the16 state trainers for peer support specialists here17 in the state along with WRAP, Wellness Recovery18 Action Planning, which is an evidence-based19 practice as well through the Copeland Center.20 And so, we provide that training to21 peers including the Veterans here in Hillsborough22 County.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.25 1 Also, I work with NAMIs across our 2 region and NAMI Hillsborough is one of -- I'm3 here representing as well.4 Dr. Shiber and her staff have been5 very involved in NAMI Hillsborough. They just6 recently had a 5K team that competed in our NAMI7 walks.8 They allow the signature programs that9 NAMI has to be hosted here so that Veterans and 10 their families can take part in that.11 As a person and a consumer of mental12 health services and the parent of raising a13 daughter with mental health services, it's also14 important to me to partner with the VA because my15 son is an Army psychologist currently stationed16 at Fort Carson.17 So, it's a pleasure to work with the18 team here and any way that Central Florida can19 support them and any way that I can personally20 support them.21 So, thank you for hearing from us22 today.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.26 1 MR. ORTIZ: Good morning, COVER 2 Commission members.3 I work in Hillsborough County as a4 Veteran Services Manager. And, I'd like to share5 with you that Hillsborough County has the largest6 Veteran population in Florida with over 97,0007 Veterans.8 We have over 33,000 Veterans that we9 make contact with either through visits to the 10 office or outreach that we conduct.11 I would say that our relation with the12 VA Medical Center, and particularly, mental13 health services is solid.14 We're very fortunate that we just15 established an MOU, Memorandum of Understanding,16 which allows us to have a VA full-time healthcare17 enrollment specialist at one of our main offices18 which allows Veterans that, upon visiting us for19 -- applying for VA benefits can also enroll in VA20 healthcare, so they two for the price of one. 21 So, that makes a lot of sense and it pays great22 dividends.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.27 1 The other thing that we've established 2 is we're fortunate from the Veterans Center, we3 also have once a week, a full-time mental health4 counselor right there on site as well. So, that's5 super. Not only does she see appointments, but6 allows for walk-ins as the need may arise.7 It's important and working with8 Veterans that we reach out, not only to Veterans9 per se, but National Guard members, Reserve, 10 active duty, Veteran service organizations, the11 whole spectrum because it takes a team effort to12 accomplish everything that we need to do.13 Thank you.14 DEPUTY KRAGER: Hello, Stephanie15 Krager from the Sheriff's Office. I'm kind of16 more boots on the ground. I handle six deputies17 that run the Homeless Initiative. And, our focus18 is the ones that need the most care in the19 community, the ones that have been on the street20 for 10, 20 years.21 And, unfortunately, some of those are22 Veterans.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.28 1 So, we're working with a variety of 2 services, HUD VASH to the homeless services here3 at the VA along with the psychiatry department4 trying to get those guys help.5 I don't know, you know, when you walk6 in this place, it terrified me. I'm like, oh my7 gosh, where am I going to find this place?8 That's how these guys feel. I mean,9 when they walk in, they're just terrified of 10 trying to find where to actually enroll. So, we11 actually kind of handle them into the facility so12 they can get the services that they need and that13 they worked for, that they deserve.14 We also use the VA psychiatry15 department. They actually teach a PTSD portion16 of our 40-hour crisis intervention class. So,17 basically, it's teaching deputies how to interact18 with someone that's suffering from mental illness19 or substance abuse.20 So, it's more that de-escalation, how21 to encounter folks, such as that.22 And, we also work on several committee(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.29 1 meetings together and it's helping Hillsborough 2 to safe and sound Hillsborough, it's all focused3 on mental health and how to better our community4 and working together. Thank you.5 DR. BOHN, JR.: Good morning,6 Commissioners.7 I'll note a couple of points for you. 8 My focus is on outreach with the -- in regards to9 the Veteran community. 10 A couple things of note have been with11 our Tampa Bay street medicine team which Dr.12 Currier is also been involved with and working on13 some of the outreach efforts.14 There's a focus with the homeless15 Veterans that are encountered and trying to help16 get them in touch with the right resources here17 in the community.18 Also, for myself, as a professor,19 there's been some mentoring with, you know, with20 some of our Veteran students that need some help21 in terms of leadership philosophy.22 And then, also, another key initiative(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.30 1 has been an effort over the last year working 2 with faith leaders across the three county region3 and Dr. Nicole Shiber here has been involved in4 helping with looking at Veterans issues across5 two of the counties that we've been involved6 with.7 DR. CURRIER: Good morning, it's a8 pleasure to be here. The USF James Haley VA9 relationship is very strong and we take a great 10 deal of pride in being one of the most Veteran-11 friendly public universities in the country.12 Not only do we provide most of the13 trainees who eventually get hired here as14 psychiatrists, but we have a lot of joint15 educational efforts.16 USF is also a Veterans Choice site, so17 we provide direct clinical care. We take a lot18 of pride in providing care to the families of19 Veterans who come here for poly-trauma and other20 things.21 And, finally, since MacDill is in our22 catchment, we do active duty as well through(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.31 1 TRICARE coverage. 2 I'm firmly committed to growing this3 relationship. My son is in field artillery at4 Fort Lewis Washington and I know what's involved5 here. So, you know, we want to make things6 better.7 MR. FETTERMAN: Good morning,8 everyone. My name's Mark Fetterman. I think to9 really tell you some of what we do, I'd like to 10 tell you a little of why. And, it starts with my11 story.12 In 2010, I was deployed in Afghanistan13 and there's this one day that really sticks out14 in my head and it pretty much sticks out in15 everybody's head is the day we were going home.16 So, I was standing on the flight line17 in Bagram and it's this hot, hot day. And my18 ruck sack's weighing me down and it was a great19 day, though, because our whole team had made it,20 everybody was going home.21 So, we load this C-17, this orderly22 fashion two by two and we drop our ruck sacks(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.32 1 down and we fly into Kuwait and that's really 2 where we're going to transition and start heading3 home and on our separate ways.4 And, that's where that happy feeling5 kind of turned into something a little different.6 They came up to me and they said, hey,7 sailor, you've got to take that uniform off. I8 was going to be flying out of Kuwait9 International Airport. 10 So, I took the uniform off and I11 bought some civilian clothes over at the12 exchange. And, when I flew into the airport in13 San Diego which was home at the time, that14 orderly fashion from the C-17 turned into15 absolute chaos for me.16 It was only about 72 hours before I17 was in the mountains of Afghanistan. The next18 thing I know, I found myself at the baggage19 carousel and the alarm had gone off and that was20 the same alarm as incoming.21 So, I pushed myself against the wall22 and I backed up and I waited for this chaos to(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.33 1 stop. 2 And, finally, I grabbed that ruck sack3 that was weighing me down on the flight line and4 I went out and I got in a cab and I sat in a5 hotel room by myself for about three weeks.6 And, I think to myself, as an officer,7 as somebody who's somewhat educated and can start8 to navigate some of these systems, why is it so9 hard even for me? 10 So, this is why we think we -- Mission11 United is so important. We've actually asked12 this community, you know, what's missing? What13 is the gap? What do we have? What are the14 needs?15 And, from there, we establish five16 areas we want to start to focus on. One, it's a17 transition, it's a process, not an event.18 Two is employment. We need to start19 gainfully and meaningfully employing these20 individuals into their next role and not viewing21 them as the victims, but actually as a resilient22 workforce, somebody who can contribute to our(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.34 1 economy and contribute to their communities. 2 It's the benefits, accessing benefits3 is really difficult, but these benefits are4 earned. The family and caregivers, our military5 strength starts at home. If we can't support the6 home, we can't go and fight where we need to go.7 And then, finally, and really this one8 touches me really a lot is, changing the9 narrative. We see often a Hollywood or this 10 pervasive theme is all heroes are all broken,11 neither of which is true.12 We just need to be able to tell our13 own story. When we do that, we can start to14 become part of our community all over again.15 So, thanks so much for taking this16 time to look at this new initiative and how we17 can partner throughout the community and with the18 VA. So, thanks for your time.19 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Let me start by20 saying, thank you all so much, but in particular,21 I want to start with Dr. Jakey for your22 leadership and also for your fantastic, fabulous(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.35 1 five minute recap of what we saw, witnessed and 2 did yesterday with the team here in Tampa.3 You pretty much encapsulated4 everything that we saw and did with your fine5 team here.6 More importantly, thanks to the panel,7 in particular, Dr. Bohn, Dr. Currier, Mark,8 Manny, Deputy Krager, Beth, Edwin and the Mission9 United story is something that, for 18 months I 10 totally agree after being in Washington, D.C.,11 that story needs to be told and we fully support12 everything that Mission United is doing.13 So, what an excellent panel for the14 Commission to interact with this morning.15 And, with that, I will open it up to16 the rest of the Commissioners.17 (No response.)18 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: I will start,19 then. I want to add how important this is. With20 any time you have government involved in21 something in dealing with care, and again, I'm22 editorializing, this is Jake Leinenkugel as a(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.36 1 Commission, only my gut feeling. 2 If you don't connect with the3 community, whether it's VA, DoD or state, it4 doesn't matter what government entity it is, the5 strength of how you're going to operate is how6 you connect with the community.7 And, here, our community leaders at8 our panel today. And, probably the best group of9 folks, a diverse section of Hillsborough County 10 is what I got from your 15 minute introductions,11 who deeply care about the mission of the VA in12 Tampa.13 And, I'm a true believer that comes14 from the leadership at the top and it goes all15 the way down to the bottom.16 And, I think that every Commissioner17 would probably say the same thing that I'm going18 to say, that this is an exemplary example of how19 government should connect and operate with its20 local communities.21 And, again, I can't thank you all22 enough for the hours, the time, the commitment(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.37 1 that you are giving back to Veterans on a daily 2 basis, whether it's mental health which this3 Commission is really charged to cover to make4 sure that they're getting the best care possible,5 when and where needed.6 And, in particular, you all do care7 and so, there is something going on here that we8 need to encapsulate and bring nationwide and9 that's basically my editorial comments and my gut 10 feelings.11 So, other Commissioners would like to12 ask some questions. We'll start with Tom.13 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: First of all,14 Dr. Jakey, thank you for aggregating this group15 of professionals. It's really important and I16 think that Mark said something sort of important17 is, all of us that have served come out of the18 community.19 And, then, of course, then we come20 back to the community and we set up special21 programs and we set up a VA. But, at the end of22 the day, we're still part of this community.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.38 1 And, that you really very well 2 articulated the need to reintegrate. You know,3 we dis-integrate and we become parts of other4 communities when we're away. And then, we come5 back and we have to figure out how to6 reintegrate.7 So, I guess the question I have for8 all of you is that, this Commission is charged9 with looking at the services that the VA provides 10 for mental health.11 But, you know, this is really the12 first time I think we've started to talk about13 what are the community services that are14 available and how do you integrate those so that15 we can make sure we reintegrate our warriors into16 the communities that they not only get the best17 healthcare that we can provide in the VA, but18 they also live with their families out in the19 community?20 And so, what can we do to sort of make21 Congress aware of the work that you're doing and22 the seamlessness that seems to be here in this(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.39 1 community so that we can really get them to think 2 about that as they write new legislation to3 really encourage the kind of activities that4 you're all engaged with that helps the VA, helps5 the community meet its mission to really serve6 these men and women who have left at our behest,7 you know, to really to protect our nation and8 then they come back, how do we -- how can we9 communicate that? 10 So, what would you like us to take11 back with us so that we can really help you be12 successful in your mission?13 MR. GUEVARA-RUIZ: VINC-8 had just14 recently, the first of October, charged the15 Crisis Center of Tampa Bay with providing care16 coordination to the Veterans that reach to us via17 the 211 system and it's going through the state.18 So, this right here, the fact that we19 have to have support from VINC-8 shows how, as20 the Chairman was saying, the connection that the21 federal government has with the local agencies22 works.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.40 1 We are, as service providers for the 2 community, we are eager to help the VA. Not3 every agency has the financials to do so, but4 having that support makes an immense change in5 what we do and allows us to do such much more to6 the point of we are bringing what the VA has,7 locally, we are bringing it to the state through8 the community service providers.9 So, it's another avenue to reach out 10 to the Veterans, not only the VA but the11 community service providers.12 And, it is very important that we, as13 community service providers, understand that we14 need to work together and this is the way to do15 it. Thank you.16 DEPUTY KRAGER: Can I say something? 17 I think it's communication, honestly. I've been18 working with the Sheriff's Office and mental19 health for at least 15 years now.20 And, it was very difficult to21 penetrate the VA system in the very beginning. 22 It was a lot of knocking on doors, the VA summit,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.41 1 I was the biggest screamer at that meeting, just 2 basically saying, listen, we need to talk to3 somebody, we need to tell them what's wrong in4 this community.5 Because, we were having some serious6 people come back damaged and it was, you know,7 dealing with those folks on the street, it's --8 they need help, they really do.9 We have a quarterly outreach the VA is 10 very involved in. And, basically, we have over11 10 VA Veterans service providers, we have not12 only the VA there, we have the Vet Center, we13 have someone that can actually do benefits right14 then and there.15 Because, as you know, getting folks16 out of the woods into a community area is very17 difficult.18 So, when we provide all those services19 all in one spot, it's great for those folks20 because they're able to go to, I'll say, Tuesday,21 we're having one at the American Legion. We have22 between 200 and 250 homeless folks that arrive at(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.42 1 that location. 2 It's all the services are all in one3 spot. And I think that makes a big difference4 instead of coming to this big facility where it's5 hard to get around.6 You know, you go right there, you7 determine right then and there whether they can8 get benefits or not, what their DD-214 says,9 everything is right there on premise. 10 So, I would say just communication and11 going out into the community and being part of12 those community resources, those fairs, so to13 speak.14 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Deputy, are those15 stand downs?16 them17 stand COMMISSIONER But, they're just19 like a stand down?20 DEPUTY KRAGER: Yes, yes, actually,21 September was supposed to be the VA stand down. 22 They actually came and were part of ours.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.43 1 COMMISSIONER KHAN: My next question, 2 what about the physical security of the VA3 facility? Is that provided by the VA or is it4 provided by the community?5 DEPUTY KRAGER: What do you the6 security? The campus?7 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Yes.8 DEPUTY KRAGER: Oh, it's the VA Police. 9 I mean, we actually respond to different 10 circumstances that happen here. We actually bring11 our VA patients to assist the mental health. So,12 we bring patients here to the ER all the time.13 We actually have a contract -- the14 county has a contract for transfer that actually15 transports patients here.16 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Do you have enough17 security available to do all the stuff required18 for you to do as security from the VA?19 DEPUTY KRAGER: Well, I'm actually not20 -- I'm the government, I'm the county government. 21 So, we actually surround the VA. We actually22 don't do anything on the property unless we're(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.44 1 called to or if we have a Veteran that's in need 2 of services we'll come and, like I said, go3 through and handle them and try to find4 eligibility and all the services that they need5 on campus.6 COMMISSIONER KHAN: From the VSO, how7 do you reach out to those Veterans who are not8 enrolled in the VA system? Is there a database9 available to you? 10 DEPUTY KRAGER: Well, I've developed11 friendships over the years that will have the12 Veteran actually get on the phone with someone13 that has access to those services.14 And, we'll have them talk face to face15 to see if those services can be provided to that16 Veteran before we even step foot here.17 COMMISSIONER KHAN: No, I'm -- my18 question is, there are Veterans who are not in19 the VA system.20 DEPUTY KRAGER: Absolutely.21 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Who have no buddy22 system. How does the community -- is there a way(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.45 1 for community to reach out to these Veterans? Is 2 there a database available to you to reach out to3 them?4 MR. GUEVARA-RUIZ: We do hear that a5 lot. Because the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay6 manages the 211, and I don't know if anybody's7 aware what the 211 system is.8 Our very first question to every9 caller is, are you a military Veteran? And, 10 right there, the person discloses, yes. And,11 immediately, a chain reaction starts happening.12 Okay, from here, that's when you go13 through that care coordination piece we offer to14 every Veteran caller a care coordination piece at15 our level with the goals of connection with the16 idea of, if you are a Veteran who for access or17 why never reached out to the VA, we know -- 18 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Well, that's19 understood. My question is -- 20 MR. GUEVARA-RUIZ: -- and we connect21 them.22 COMMISSIONER KHAN: -- my question is,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.46 1 not when he comes into the VA, my question is, do 2 you have a toolkit, something available to you to3 know where all these Veterans are? That is not4 available to you?5 MR. GUEVARA-RUIZ: No.6 COMMISSIONER KHAN: So, my next to7 leadership is, that there should be an effort to8 go to the higher -- national level and work with9 the DoD to create a national data where every 10 reference, once he's enrolled, his life history11 is followed, whether he's a combat Veteran or12 he's not a combat Veteran.13 So, when Jamil joined the Marine14 Corps, I'm in the system. When I leave15 Afghanistan and I come back and I do not go to16 the VSO, I do not ask for any help, my question17 is, we promised that Veteran. So --18 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: I think, Jamil,19 we're getting into a larger concern here at this20 point as far --21 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Thank you, sir.22 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: -- as our outcome. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.47 1 And, I think that Mark Fetterman probably could 2 provide something through Mission United and you3 live in this space as well.4 So, Mark, do you have something?5 MR. FETTERMAN: Yes and I appreciate6 the, you know, making the connection between the7 DoD and the VA, it may be essential at some point8 and we can actually do that in the interim is,9 what we're trying to establish is a civilian 10 transition assistance program.11 So, through the DoD right now, when a12 military member is going to be separating13 approximately about a year out, they're required14 to go through the transition assistance program15 offered on base.16 But, quite often, when they do leave17 the base, they didn't get all their questions18 answered or there was just too much information19 at that one time.20 So, what we're trying to do is21 supplement that with a community-based effort22 called a Civilian TAP Program. And, the idea(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.48 1 behind that is when you leave the military, 2 you've got too much information, you had a plan3 and regardless, the plan's going to change.4 We'd like you to have a place to turn5 to to get some of those questions answered when6 you were not quite answered or asking the right7 questions at that time so they can come back to8 that.9 Because, as it is, there's only about 10 17 percent of our Veteran population that11 actually retire. They're the only ones typically12 other than a 100 percent disabled who are allowed13 to go back to the base.14 Well, how do we supplement the other15 83 percent? This is where we think the Civilian16 TAP Program can go.17 And, I think through the leadership of18 this VA here, I think we're really starting to19 see that it's not about who gets the credit, but20 the outcome.21 And, I think when the VA's actually22 able to be a part of that as well, I think we're(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.49 1 able to go a whole lot further. 2 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Are you reaching3 out to the Vietnam Veterans?4 MR. FETTERMAN: Yes, we are. And,5 actually, there's several ways to communicate. 6 It's, you know, telephone, television or tell a7 Veteran. Any ideas, this is a grassroots effort,8 actually.9 So, what we actually, we're really 10 trying to do is try to use other Veterans and11 their success stories to allow other Veterans to12 know that they have a place to turn.13 MS. PECORI: Yes, and that -- oh, I'm14 sorry -- and that goes to what I wanted to say. 15 Because what I've heard that's very familiar and16 we talk about in the community is the engagement17 of the Veteran.18 Being engaged to come into services19 can be challenging if your first encounter is20 with law enforcement or, like they said, coming21 into the front door.22 But, utilizing Veteran peer(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.50 1 specialists to engage the Veteran, someone who's 2 been there, is crucial. And, we have seen that3 in the civilian world.4 And, the wonderful staff here at the5 VA have started a peer specialist program. But,6 I'm going to say, you know, from the bottom of my7 heart, there's not enough.8 I train a lot of those peers but I can9 only do four trainings a year with 30-something 10 people. Manny's one of my trainees.11 And, I know that the VA has a training12 program, but, for some reason, it's not being13 utilized.14 So, any way we could -- we partner15 with them to do this, but there's also a Veteran-16 specific training for peer specialists that you17 could take back and suggest that is implemented18 throughout the VA system.19 You know, and talking with my own son,20 when his soldiers come out, you know, when they21 have had issues and stuff, his key point is how22 do we engage them once they leave. Mark, very(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.51 1 true what you're saying. 2 But, those peer support specialists3 have been on the ground, they know what they're4 going through and someone will talk to them first5 a lot of times before they're going to talk to a6 professional.7 Not saying that we don't need the8 professionals, they are very well needed. But,9 that lived experience is crucial. 10 COMMISSIONER KHAN: Thank you.11 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: I want to give12 Dr. Currier an opportunity to -- then every -- I13 would like everybody to respond to my first14 question. I want to make sure that we take back15 to Washington what --16 But, I have a question for you and17 then maybe you can -- I know you wanted to say18 something else, and it is, I'm with Penn19 Medicine. One of the things that we thought was20 really important for academic healthcare in21 particular, is to ask questions on your medical22 record about, have you ever been in the service? (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.52 1 If so, where have you served? 2 So that you can start building the3 database within the academic health system. 4 Because there's specific and important needs that5 are unique to warriors and they may not be part6 of the VA. I know they're still working or7 something like that.8 Do you do that within your electronic 9 health record? 10 DR. CURRIER: We absolutely do.11 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Okay.12 DR. CURRIER: We have a whole battery13 of question built into ethic around that. Not14 only that, but all kinds of trauma, various, you15 know, lived experiences. So, yes.16 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: And then, I have17 a further question. One of the things we found18 very useful is creating a liaison between the19 academic center.20 We have a full-time nurse practitioner21 who helps Veterans move between the academic22 health system and the VA.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.53 1 Do you have a program like that? 2 Because I'd like to get those things out there3 because I think there's opportunity for this4 partnership.5 DR. CURRIER: Yes, we have actually6 Dr. Charles Brock who's from the neurology7 department is charged with all interface on our8 end between the VA, not only Haley, but Bay Pines9 as well. And so, he takes very solid interest in 10 that. Yes, we know who to call to problem solve.11 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Great.12 DR. CURRIER: I wanted to reply a13 little bit to your first question. You asked14 what you could take to VACO that might be useful.15 I love working at USF, it's the most16 Veteran friendly Veteran focused institution I've17 been around a little bit.18 And, part of it is because, not only19 do we highlight hiring Veterans, and that's been20 explicit focus, but we're really proud of the21 number of discharged soldiers, sailors, Marines,22 Coast Guardsmen who come to these duties.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.54 1 And, I think that the VA could push 2 its academic partners a little bit harder to take3 that stance. Because it creates a culture of4 respect for Veterans, an awareness of Veterans5 issues because of their you're coworkers, they're6 your students.7 And, I've been at other places where8 there's just that's just like that's a language9 that's not spoken. 10 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Thank you.11 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: So, I had12 one question for whoever wants to answer or a few13 of you, if you could.14 I'm kind of most interested in maybe15 one or two kind of barriers that you experienced16 in working with the VA or that your Veterans have17 experienced.18 You know, there's -- I know sometimes19 people are hard to reach in the VA, sometimes20 it's difficult to penetrate the VA like you were21 talking about.22 But, maybe if you could say from your(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.55 1 perspective or your Veterans perspective a 2 barrier for the VA?3 MR. GUEVARA-RUIZ: It has been my4 experience personal as well as working with my5 brothers and sisters that the one barrier we have6 here that's been coming up and up and up and up7 again, it's a good one. This VA serves so many8 Veterans, they can't find a place to park.9 (Laughter.) 10 MR. GUEVARA-RUIZ: Also, that has been11 it.12 MR. FETTERMAN: So, one barrier that13 I actually experienced, I moved here from San14 Diego is VA's don't necessarily speak to each15 other. I had to rebuild my profile and actually16 had to re-establish with this VA. I think that's17 one part that could possibly.18 DEPUTY KRAGER: I think just19 confirming that they're a Vet and what their20 discharge is. That's what's most important for21 me. I don't want to have to spend three hours22 trying to figure out whether this Vet actually(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.56 1 can get services here or not. 2 If I can have one place to call and3 just say, hey, could you tell if this guy's a4 Vet? If he's honorably discharged? And, if he5 can get services at the VA?6 Sometimes, that's difficult. I've7 made connections over the years so it makes it a8 little bit easier, but for that day to day9 person, it's very difficult. 10 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: I feel your11 pain, ma'am.12 DEPUTY KRAGER: Yes.13 COMMISSIONER KUNITZ: Mr. Fetterman,14 to start out with and then Manny and the rest of15 the crew to weigh in, I guess I'd really like to16 focus on work that you have. And, I would love17 to have you talk a little bit about the18 importance of work to mental health recovery.19 And then, maybe the specific question,20 do Veterans have concerns about their benefits as21 they begin to work? I've seen, you know, it --22 is that a balance? And sometimes, the concern(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.57 1 about benefits may weigh in with somebody's work 2 goals?3 MR. FETTERMAN: So, the biggest thing4 that we see that comes from work and being either5 meaningful or something with a possibility of6 advancement is the sense of belonging and purpose7 all over again.8 When we leave the uniform, we leave9 this identity and that comes with a purpose and 10 that comes with a mission.11 But, we need to find that somewhere12 else and sometimes that comes through employment,13 you know, gainful, meaningful employment.14 As far as benefits, quite often, we15 have to identify the difference between16 compensation and then, you know, the healthcare,17 which is, you know, where we are today.18 Quite often, I haven't seen it as the19 largest issue, but compensation comes up a lot. 20 But, I do think when somebody's employed, they21 often -- they'll use their employer's healthcare22 benefits just because it's a little easier and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.58 1 it's part of that culture. 2 MR. ORTIZ: Thanks, Mark, for your3 remarks.4 As far as employment, you know, you're5 absolutely right. The Veterans number one concern6 when they get out is not necessarily enrolling in7 VA healthcare or seeking VA benefits in general,8 it's getting a job. That's the bottom line,9 getting a job, taking care of his family, being 10 able to support them and their needs.11 So, how does that influence Veterans12 not enrolled in VA healthcare? They're too busy13 working, they don't have time for compensation14 claim, they just don't have time.15 However, as time passes, they've16 settled in and about after that one year mark or17 so, they finally realize, hey, I've got VA18 benefits, geez. And they start talking to other19 Veterans.20 And, as they learn that there is21 compensation benefits for everything they have22 endured while in service, then they come to visit(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.59 1 us to do a claim for benefits and so forth. 2 And, I know we're dealing with the3 mental health side, but on the claims side, the4 processing of claims has improved substantially5 since the implementation of the -- what they call6 national work queue which is basically where the7 claims are not paper anymore, they're electronic. 8 So, they can be sent out to any of the seven9 regional offices for process based on the 10 workload determined by the VBA on a daily basis.11 So, that helps expedite the claims, so12 that's been really good.13 But, that's the hard part is how to14 reach those Veterans that are not enrolled in VA15 healthcare and insuring that they're informed of16 what -- word of mouth is, I can tell you, the17 most effective tool that exists, because that's18 how I get so many referrals.19 They want to see you, they want to do20 the claim. They bring their discharge Form 214,21 we're in business. You know, we can get things22 done and we like to get those done, obviously,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.60 1 that same visit, that first time. 2 So, that's critical. Why? Because it3 gives them another source of income apart from4 the job. You know, and VA benefits are tax free5 so that's huge.6 So, that's the key thing is, you know,7 ensuring that we communicate, as it was8 mentioned, through outreach that we do a lot, but9 mostly, it's like personal contact, handing out 10 your card, giving a couple extra cards. And,11 believe me, they are distributed rather well.12 So, we stay busy, but it's sort of13 like the busy that you feel real happy to do and14 help Veterans.15 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Dr. Jonas, final16 question due to time constraints.17 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Sorry, this is18 hopefully a short one. I had general one that19 builds on yours, and but, on challenges, how to20 overcome challenges around integration and happy21 to talk to anyone on the panel that we have and22 sub-panels that we have coming up around that.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.61 1 But, actually, Deputy Krager, I have 2 one specific question for you because I know you3 can answer this question.4 How many homeless are there in5 Hillsborough, on average?6 DEPUTY KRAGER: Well, the paperwork7 says about 2,600, I'm estimating more of like8 4,000. I don't think they're counted as9 appropriately as they should during the annual 10 point in time count.11 DR. JONAS: So, the paperwork says12 2,600, you think there's more like 4,000?13 DEPUTY KRAGER: At least.14 DR. JONAS: And, of those, what number15 really need a lot of hand holding like you talked16 about? I mean, that area really high risk, just17 refractory 10, 20 years, out in the woods or --18 DEPUTY KRAGER: I would --19 DR. JONAS: -- need some other kind of20 support, getting a job, for instance, those kind21 of things?22 DEPUTY KRAGER: I would say there's(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.62 1 about 20 to 25 Veterans right now that are 2 chronic homeless. They have been on the street3 for a significant amount of time.4 Some of them do have services. I5 think the barrier is when we finally get someone6 to get in our car and want the help, we need to7 do it right then and there.8 So, the least path of resistance is9 what we usually end up with. So, I reach out to 10 Tampa Crossroads, Veterans Helping Veterans. 11 There is so many community-based organizations12 for Veterans that can help me right then and13 there.14 So, if I need to get somebody in a15 hotel, that's how I call, you know, just to get16 them off the street and get them into the system.17 DR. JONAS: So, let's assume there's18 maybe 200 out of that 4,000 that really need a19 lot of help and services. Is there a registry of20 who they are, records, names? People assigned to21 them who say, I know where, you know, Joe is or I22 can find out where Joe is? Or, this is where he(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.63 1 was last, et cetera, et cetera. 2 Is there a database of names, actual3 people with assigned folks available to help?4 DEPUTY KRAGER: They're not really5 assigned. We do have a database that actually6 has homeless folks that we have encountered day7 in and day out which I said, they're in the8 camps. They're -- they don't really seek9 services, so they're not in the community. 10 DR. JONAS: Right, I understand.11 DEPUTY KRAGER: Yes. So, we do have12 a database. We also have access to unity, which13 is out homeless database.14 So, because they are Veterans, more15 than likely, some of them don't go through that16 side of the service because Veterans Services are17 much better than homeless services as far as like18 HUD VASH availability is what I'm talking about.19 When I encounter a Veteran on the20 street, I can get them off the street in a day,21 if that's what they want.22 If it's a regular homeless person, I(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.64 1 say, it takes me a month or two just to get them 2 in the process of getting somewhere.3 So, I can say the VA and Veterans4 Services are awesome in that aspect when they5 want it, when they're ready to do it.6 DR. JONAS: Yes, so if you had your one7 place to call, what would need to be in that to8 make sure that that one place to call was going9 to allow you to help manage and provide what was 10 needed, you know, for the spectrum that you --11 DEPUTY KRAGER: For Veterans-specific?12 DR. JONAS: Well, I mean, we're13 talking about Veterans, so, yes, one place to14 call for Veterans.15 Obviously, it'd be nice if it was one16 place to call for more than that, but for17 Veterans. What would be in that? You have a18 place, you dial it, you say, what needs to be19 part of that so that you can make sure that20 anybody that you encounter or walk in or reach21 out to who comes in, you're able to get them what22 they need?(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.65 1 DEPUTY KRAGER: Someone that would 2 answer the question. You know, I know HIPAA and3 everything else that's involved in that.4 We just need -- a lot of these folks5 just don't know how to communicate. You know, I6 had a military Veteran, 78 years old, has no --7 medical benefits, but nothing else.8 He did not realize, actually, the VA9 called me and asked me, hey, what can we do with 10 this guy?11 I took him down to Social Security one12 Friday afternoon, got him $14,000 in back pay and13 $1,400 a month. How easy is that?14 And that's what frustrates me, it's15 like, wait a second, I said, this guy could have16 gotten, you know, money instead of living on the17 front porch of that city dump, you know, all this18 time and been in a nice, warm house.19 And, you know, I guess it's just20 getting the information firsthand and if somebody21 needs to assist them in any way, getting them in22 their car, having the ability of someone that is(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.66 1 communicating with the homeless service provider 2 or VA service provider just to get them down. 3 Why did they need to call me to get them down to4 Social Security?5 MR. FETTERMAN: Do you mind if I add6 on to that? I think the best thing we can do as7 far as the community is understand the role we8 play individually. Because, quite often, we're9 seeing ourselves as trying to offer all services 10 to all Veterans and then we fail.11 So, what we need to do is start to12 realize what role we play in this large holistic13 health that we're actually providing.14 Where she can reach out to 211, the15 Crisis Center, experts and actually talking16 someone down, bringing them in, getting them the17 services they need.18 When we establish what we can do and19 focus on our strengths, we can allow others to20 focus on our weakness and that's what we call21 collaboration and then a collective impact.22 DR. CURRIER: I'd just also add that,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.67 1 Hillsborough County partners, including the big 2 health systems, the VAs, the law enforcement and3 others, are working right now on a conjoint4 medical and social services release form so that5 HIPAA, which has been a real problem is going to6 be kind of bypassed through this route so that7 that's under development right now.8 DR. JONAS: So, it sounds like the9 integration and coordination components is a 10 fairly sophisticated way of what's needed to11 actually gets down to a personal level.12 And, I say that because you guys do it13 probably better than almost anybody that we've14 actually seen.15 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Yes, I think it16 goes back, Wayne to --17 DR. JONAS: It takes that persistence18 --19 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: -- the starting20 comments of how important the integration of the21 community is within this type of agency and the22 fine work that these folks are doing.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.68 1 I think to your point and question, 2 Wayne, I think that Manny, Edwin and Mark along3 with Deputy Krager can sidebar maybe five minutes4 at the closure of the open session and we need to5 discuss this further because I think there is6 something there that we need to take a little7 broader base.8 That being said, I want to thank Dr.9 Jakey. I want to thank all of you for your 10 service to Veterans, service to your community11 and service to your nation. It means a lot to12 this Commission for you to take the time to come13 in.14 But, more importantly, to serve those15 Veterans in need. So, again, Dr. Jakey, Dr.16 Bohn, Dr. Currier, Mark with Mission United,17 certainly Manny, Deputy Krager, Edwin, thank you18 for your services and depth for what you do.19 Thank you all.20 (Applause.)21 (Whereupon, the above-entitled matter22 went off the record at 9:30 a.m.)(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R.

POMERANTZ: So, I'm going to give5 some background, set the context for some of the6 things Cliff's going to talk about as well.7 I'm the National Mental Health8 Director for Integrated Services. The core of my9 position has been the integration of mental 10 health into primary care.11 And I've been in that position for12 about years. Previously I had worked in the VA13 in Vermont where we developed one of the core14 models of integrated care. Which is probably how15 I wound up in this job.16 So, let's see, I've pushed every17 button on this thing. But, just a broad18 overview, not specific to the VA, these are the19 general problems we face in this country as well.20 We know that the mental health21 conditions are very common in the population. 22 Even more so in veterans then the rest of the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.9 1 population. 2 We know that if left untreated or3 under-treated, which is the norm in our4 healthcare system, that the consequences are, if5 not immediately disastrous to the individual,6 they have profound effects on family and society,7 as well as on the cost of healthcare and8 healthcare outcomes in general.9 So, what's our solution in the VA? 10 And this is where we're -- where what we're11 trying to do. It's not 100 percent perfect.12 But this is our goal. This is where13 we're aiming for. Is to really develop a care14 system that provides the right amount of care,15 what kind of care people need.16 I think many are aware that typically17 mental health care begins with a referral to some18 other place. Sometimes far away, occasionally19 close by.20 And that it often begins with an21 extensive data gathering visit where individuals22 are essentially treated as though they had a very(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.10 1 complicated problem that needed a great deal of 2 attention.3 As opposed to the way most healthcare4 works, where most problems are simple and fairly5 straightforward.6 So, what we aim to do is really7 conserve the resources for those who really need8 them. And provide the right level of care for9 people who don't need the traditional care. 10 This is the description of the11 framework for our continuum of care. We had a12 lot of great minds from the field, got together13 and met and talked for about a year to develop14 the actual plan, continuum of care.15 And really, it's based around both,16 you know, it's reducing veteran suicide, which is17 our number one clinical priority. As well as18 support for a life worth living.19 I think that's an important thing to20 keep in mind. This is a schematic of how we view21 the -- where we're aiming.22 And what's really at the bottom is(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.11 1 self-directed care. Which takes many forms. You 2 know, it may be a veteran awakes in the middle of3 the night on the internet.4 It may be somebody, a veteran looking5 for other methods of treatment. You know,6 outside of the traditional medical treatment that7 we're known for providing.8 It may be various community-based9 groups. A wide variety of things that we all do 10 to take care of ourselves. It could be as simple11 as a walk in the park.12 The next level up is the -- it's doing13 it by itself.14 (Off-microphone comment.)15 DR. POMERANTZ: Oh, should I wave at16 you? Okay. Great.17 So this has nothing to do with what18 I've been doing.19 (Laughter.)20 DR. POMERANTZ: It's like the button never worked twice.22 (Laughter.)(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.12 1 DR. POMERANTZ: Very helpful. So 2 anyway, this is our -- this is where we're3 headed.4 And as you can see, you know, the size5 of the pyramid here is really aimed at really the6 -- you can think about that as the number of7 patents or the percent of the patients who really8 need to go that -- go to that level.9 You know, the most severe, acute 10 crisis go into inpatient care. So, next. Next11 slide.12 And this is in a meeting out in VISN13 21. This was a schematic that a veteran came up. 14 This is what it looks like from my perspective.15 You know, and I as the veteran, is the16 one who should be holding the key to this whole17 thing. I'm the one who opens it and gets18 started.19 So, next slide, please. So for our20 continuum of care, again, this is more detail on21 the same idea. That it is based on the level of22 need.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.13 1 Not everybody starts as though they 2 had a serious complex mental health problem. We3 aim for effective treatment.4 As well as being able to identify when5 somebody needs a higher level of treatment. And6 that requires ongoing assessments of the7 patient's care.8 And of course least restrictive care9 is the general principal. Very different then 10 from one -- when I started in healthcare a long11 time ago.12 And this is that we really want care13 to be as community-based and veteran-centered as14 possible. Next slide, please.15 This requires measurement-based care. 16 One of -- my initial background was as a family17 physician many years ago before coming into18 psychiatry.19 And it never occurred to me to not20 check a patient's blood pressure or their pulse. 21 Or listen to their heart and gather data to know22 how we were doing.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.14 1 But this is still an uphill climb 2 throughout this country. And, again, not3 specific to the VA.4 To really measure what we're doing. 5 Look for outcomes. Is this patient getting6 better with the treatment we're giving?7 Gathering a lot of up front self-8 report information from a patient, is critical to9 knowing what level of services they need. And 10 then -- and being able also to provide that as11 feedback to a patient.12 Patients feel good when they know13 their blood pressure is 120/70. Likewise, they14 often will kind of miss the point that they're15 actually feeling better until they actually see16 that their PHQ-9 score, the self-report tool for17 depression, has dropped from 20 to 14.18 So, being able to use this data19 collaboratively with patients make it possible. 20 As I'm sure you're also aware, the VA shift to21 more patient-centered care approach begins with22 what matters to the veteran.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.15 1 You know, what's important. Many 2 veterans that I've seen over the years are, no3 doc, it's not. Yeah, I can live with my4 nightmares, you know. It's just, how do I get5 along better with my family, has been.6 Find out what, you know, what are your7 goals. And we often change this over the course8 of treatment as we get to know patients better.9 As patients begin to experience 10 perhaps different ways of interacting with11 others. It may alter the course of treatment12 along the way. So, next slide, please. Get this13 out of the way because I keep trying to grab it.14 So, other principals here. It's focus15 on recovery. And recovery too is -- it's been16 what, probably 15 years since the Substance Abuse17 and Mental Health Service Administration came up18 with the principals of mental health recovery.19 But, it's still -- we still have a20 long way to go to move away from seeing21 individuals with mental health conditions as22 people with impairments that need to have their(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.16 1 impairment fixed so that they can be okay. 2 I think any clinician in this room can3 tell stories of patients whose symptoms went4 away. But their lives were ruined. I'll leave5 it at that.6 And really to focus on what the7 veteran wants. What's the -- because if we're8 focused on something else, we're not likely to9 have a good outcome. And we're likely to run 10 into even more problems.11 Suicide prevention is a lot more than12 just addressing highly suicidal patients. And if13 I can make no other point in this discussion14 today, the key is that really that a lot of our15 work should be focused around preventing people16 from becoming suicidal in the first place.17 I will try not to say support for a18 life worth living too often. But, I will say it19 one more time at least.20 That really our -- we need to provide21 that intensive level of care for highly suicidal22 patients. That we cannot afford to lose sight of(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.17 1 those patients who are early on in the course of 2 their adult life.3 It's really important. So, next4 slide, please.5 Then medical necessity. So, we, you6 know, what is we -- what are the reasonable and7 necessary interventions that we should be8 providing for this individual patient?9 Team based care too, is another kind 10 of evolution over time in VA and elsewhere. And11 we're still working hard on this in VA to12 encourage it, to support it.13 Mental health care should not be a14 collection of individuals each doing their own15 thing in a little office somewhere. 16 Corresponding only by email, if even then.17 But really needs to be a group. You18 probably know some about the patient aligned care19 team at this point.20 I think that's the, you know, patient21 centered medical home in the VA. Which is very22 much designed around those principals. Next(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.18 1 slide, please. 2 Practicing at the top of one's3 license. And that's, you know, that's hard to4 do. And not everybody wants to do that all day5 long.6 Sometimes we do need a break from what7 only we can do. But for the most part, that's8 what we're aiming for.9 So, I as a psychiatrist, doing the 10 things that only a psychiatrist can do, is11 important. Which also is a big piece of team-12 based care. Individual clinicians who are used13 to being very independent and autonomous, to14 really be able to rely on and trust information15 provided by other people, and intervention from16 other people.17 And then lots of different ways. 18 What's going to work best? How, you know, is19 this somebody who's going to come to the facility20 every day?21 Is this somebody who we need to reach22 out to with more innovative solutions such as(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.19 1 videos at home for instance. Next slide, please. 2 And then, you know, de-implementation3 and reducing redundancy. You know, what we aim4 to do is have services, you know, that are being5 provided to patients, but not having the same6 thing going on in some other setting.7 But really, really focus on evidence-8 based practices that will be a benefit to this9 particular patient. Which also means stopping 10 doing things that aren't helpful.11 It doesn't mean stopping care. And it12 means finding alternative methods of care.13 So, when I came into the VA, I was14 handed a caseload, you know, a bunch of patients. 15 Many of whom had been coming to the VA for 3016 years. And they didn't know why they were still17 coming.18 Well, because I'm coming because I get19 to talk to somebody once a month. That's fine. 20 Well, maybe there are other ways.21 And so, you know, ending some of those22 practices are important. And then partnerships(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.20 1 with the vet centers and other non-VA community 2 partnerships.3 I think we all know that healthcare is4 not just the delivery of medical services to5 people. But it's many organizations and6 community-based opportunities that people have. 7 Next slide, please.8 So, I think this is -- and I said I9 wasn't going to say it again, but I will. 10 Providing support for a life worth living is well11 beyond.12 It's not the same. It can include13 what's on the other side of that scale. Managing14 diseases, chronic disease management, identifying15 specific diseases, providing treatment.16 But it's also about shoring up the17 individual's existing strengths, their18 connections with family, community, and society19 at large. And many things that people don't20 always associate with healthcare outcomes.21 But if we do one side of this and not22 the other, we're not serving our veterans the way(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.21 1 we need to be. Next slide. 2 Ah, this is another schematic. You3 know, similar to the pyramid you saw earlier4 that's a little bit more descriptive. I'm not5 going to read it to you. It's really the same6 kind of thing. It really just starts at home and7 community.8 And the upper level is really specific9 care provided according to evidence-based 10 standards. Next slide, please.11 So, I'm going to talk -- again I said 12 DCMHI, primary care/mental health integration is13 my target area. So, along with a little bit of14 that. Next slide, please.15 This is a statement, the AHRQ, Agency16 for Healthcare Research and Quality, did a review17 of integrated care. As well as one on patient18 centered medical home.19 And the bottom line is that the20 initial review of integrated care, which was done21 ten years ago, it's really, let's -- you know,22 this is an evolving field. We don't know the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.22 1 right answer yet. But, there are a lot of good 2 things happening. Let's stay tuned.3 Which is a challenge for us in VA,4 developing policy. To make them broad enough5 that they can adapt to local environments while6 at the same time be specific enough to hit the7 core ingredients. The other is another statement8 that was commissioned by AHRQ eight years ago. 9 Looking at the patient centered medical home. 10 That we really need to provide mental11 healthcare within the patient centered medical12 home as much as possible. Next slide, please.13 Here's one definition, this one I14 particularly like. It's written by CPT. It's15 also part of the information that the AHRQ has16 developed. And it's really just -- it just17 refers to the mental health providers being a18 core part of the overall healthcare team. All as19 one team working with the individual patient. 20 Next slide, please.21 So in VA the patient aligned care team22 is the -- is our patient centered medical home. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.23 1 We also have PCMHI, the primary care mental 2 health integration program, which was formally3 rolled out in VA about ten years ago.4 And these are the mental health5 providers, primarily mental health providers, who6 are working as part of the PACT, the primary care7 team. Next slide.8 So, this is our goal. Our primary9 focus in this has been there are a couple of key 10 features. You know, one of which is providing11 same day services within PACT.12 There's plenty of -- a good body of13 research that demonstrates the longer people have14 to wait for a mental health appointment, the less15 likely they are to get treated.16 Many people are quite ambivalent about17 getting mental health care for a lot of reasons. 18 But these, that's been our goal since day one.19 And we primarily focus on those20 common, uncomplicated problems that come up in21 the primary care population. We don't typically22 treat schizophrenia in this program.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.24 1 But we are there for the more common 2 things that happen. So that we can stress this3 early intervention.4 Again, to try to help the -- I have a5 22 year old veteran, the first ever episode of6 depression. You think about what happens to that7 patient if it goes untreated for their lifetime.8 Then they wind up in that highly9 suicidal bunch of people. So, we provide that 10 early intervention to try to address it with a11 minimum of resources. Next slide, please.12 This is a little bit repetitive. So,13 in the interest of losing redundancy, I'll leave14 it for reference later. Anybody looking at the15 slides.16 Except to say that the outcomes we do17 know, we have published papers from many18 investigators demonstrating that we have since19 developing this program nationally, we have20 improved the percentage of the primary care21 patients who are identified with, and treated for22 a mental health problem.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.25 1 And that those who have passed through 2 our treatment and primary care, if they do need a3 referral to higher level of care, they are much4 more likely to engage in that care. Next slide,5 please.6 So the core components. One is the7 co-located collaborative care. That was the8 model that we had developed in our center in9 Vermont over the years. 10 It's often known outside VA as the11 behavioral health consultant. These are the12 embedded mental health clinicians that are part13 of the PACT.14 We provide typically some consultative15 advice. You know, ideally when the PACT is16 functioning as it should be, there's morning17 huddle every day.18 They talk about the patients coming19 in. Our providers are there in the huddle to do20 some troubleshooting ahead of time, make some21 suggestions, or even offer to see the patient if22 necessary. Next slide, please.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.26 1 The other component is known outside 2 the VA is collaborative care model. That has a3 much more extensive body of evidence then the co-4 located collaborative care.5 When PCMHI was first rolled out in the6 VA, we already had, you know, 10, 15 years of7 randomized control trials of the collaborative8 care model showing effectiveness.9 There wasn't a whole lot of 10 information when the good data on the co-located11 collaborative care. So, we've been generating12 that data ourselves along with a lot of other13 non-VA researchers. And developing brief methods14 of treatment. Doing a lot to move that field15 forward.16 But the care management collaborative17 care is a cost-effective way of improving18 outcomes. Initially it was just for depression.19 A nurse calling a patient on the20 phone, following a protocol. How are you doing? 21 Looking for side effects of medication.22 Doing some basic problem solving. And(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.27 1 being a link between the primary care provider 2 and a consulting psychiatrist.3 In this way a, you know, single care4 manager can help manage the care for, you know,5 one hundred or more patients with mental6 disorders with the psychiatrist or psychologist,7 whoever is needed, only seeing a very small8 percentage of those who really, you know, are9 maybe not responding to treatment. Next slide. 10 Also, outside of mental services are11 the health behavior coordinators. This was a12 program rolled out through the national center13 for prevention a few years after our PCMHI.14 The task of the health behavior15 coordinators typically has been to help the16 primary care providers do a better job of17 addressing conditions that are very behaviorally18 sensitive.19 There are also health promotions,20 disease prevention program managers who are there21 to -- they may not even be clinicians. But22 they're there to help oversee and coordinate(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.28 1 prevention efforts taking place within the PACT. 2 Next slide.3 So these are our outcomes. I think4 this -- what's really key here, I think, is --5 and these are all, you know, outcomes based on6 research study.7 I'm not a researcher. I support8 researchers. Try to provide some ideas if I can. 9 But these are things other people have done that 10 have helped demonstrate and develop the evidence11 base for what we're doing here.12 Certainly key in here is that both13 patients and providers like this. They really14 like this approach.15 We see many patients who would never16 go even 100 feet down the hallway to see a mental17 health provider, who will see a mental health18 provider if it's there, right there with the19 primary care team. Next slide.20 So, these are our key metrics. 21 Percentage of primary care patients who have seen22 a mental health provider in PCMHI. And the same(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.29 1 day access. 2 Same day access, thanks in large part3 to some of the things Cliff is doing, you know,4 has been improving over the years. We're not5 where we need to be, but we're getting there. 6 Next slide.7 Do I still have some time? I'll keep8 going until somebody gives me the high sign.9 So, this is another slide that again, 10 kind of demonstrates how we, you know, the11 patient flows. Not everything that we do is on12 here.13 But these are sort of the key within14 mental health services. The services we provide15 within mental health. Typically, this is how it16 works. Too busy with this slide. So we'll just17 go onto the next one.18 Again, open access to care is our19 goal. Make the process as streamlined, as20 seamless for the veteran as possible.21 We don't want any veteran who is being22 referred to mental health to go home with a well,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.30 1 why don't you, you know, just wait, you'll get an 2 appointment in the mail. It's coming. Check is3 in the mail. Just wait.4 You know, we know that the traditional5 old model of mental healthcare, going back a few6 decades, was well, the patient really needs to7 call the mental health center to demonstrate that8 they really want treatment.9 You know, I don't think that's as 10 pervasive now as it used to be. It's certainly11 not in the VA. Next slide.12 Referral management is part of our13 flow. Setting up agreements whether formal or14 not, between primary care and mental health. And15 then kind of defining the flow within general16 mental health, PCMHI, and specialty mental17 health.18 As well as the -- how it's going to19 work. This is essential with team-based care. 20 Is that you have your processes in place.21 And then we always encourage, you22 know, our facilities, the smaller ones to(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.31 1 collaborate with the larger ones for highly 2 specialized care.3 That's one of the advantages I think4 we have in the VA system. I know times over the5 years when I have been able to bring in somebody6 from thousands of miles away who happens to be an7 expert in what's going on with my patient.8 And bring that person into this9 patient's care. Next slide. 10 This is again, interesting thinking11 about when is an episode of care over? Is it12 ever over?13 As I mentioned the patients I14 inherited when I came into the VA, had been15 coming so long they didn't know why they were16 coming. But they kept coming because they had17 appointments.18 And really, we need to be constantly19 aware of and thinking about how to, when has the20 need been met, and it's time to shift this21 patient back towards primary care and self-22 directed care. Next slide, please.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.32 1 This is just I'm going to close with 2 a discussion of the FLOW Project. Which was a3 demonstration project that was developed down in4 Texas, VISN 17 a few years ago.5 It was really aimed at identifying6 when have patients completed their mental health7 care? And how can we successfully transition8 them back to primary care? Next slide.9 So, they began the project with kind 10 of looking at well, how can we identify these11 people? We actually know. We have a lot of data12 in VA.13 So how do we use that data in a way14 that would help us identify from a high level,15 who's really ready for transition back to primary16 care. That was the first task. Developing the17 criteria. Next slide.18 So this is -- this says what the group19 decided was important. And it was really, you20 know, these are people who have been coming maybe21 monthly, maybe a couple of times a year with22 certain, you know, and stable medication regimens(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.33 1 if they were on medications. 2 With certain critical exclusions. 3 These were the criteria thought to be consistent4 with stability and the end of an episode of care. 5 Next slide, please.6 Again, a busy slide. This just kind7 of talks about how it happens. The key part of8 this though, is that it was left in the end,9 despite what the data might indicate, it was left 10 for the patients and providers to make the11 determination of whether this patient could be12 transitioned out of mental health services. Next13 slide.14 So, this is an old slide. It's a year15 old. But the project was being completed then. 16 We're now rolling this out to a number of other17 facilities, trying to develop national dashboards18 that will support it.19 But this was a big deal. Four out of20 190 patients, the transition was not successful. 21 And I think that suggests that these are pretty22 conservative criteria if the number's that low,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.34 1 and that they're an effective way to kind of get 2 started on this process. Next slide, please.3 So we did prepare, this group4 developed, based on the things that I've talked5 about, a recommendation. A report that was6 distributed to the field a year ago.7 Demonstrating, you know, here's how8 you set up a continuum of care. It comes with an9 offer of some of us to help you do it if you'd 10 like. Next slide, please.11 You know, as well as a gap analysis12 that went in it. You know, a series of13 questions. How do you now you have a continuum14 of care?15 How does it work? And what, you know,16 how do you organize in your system? Because I --17 it's not been the law of the land in mental18 health anywhere. That there's a coherent19 continuum of care. So that's what we're20 attempting to do. Next slide, please.21 This is just a sample. Just to see22 what the gap analysis tool looks like. How(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.35 1 individual services will look at this report and 2 think about it.3 Look at their current processes and4 think about what's working. What could be5 changed? And how are you going to know? And of6 course, who's going to make sure it happens? So7 next slide, please.8 These are the steps we're recommended9 to. We had a couple of national mental health 10 conferences last year. East side of the country11 and west side of the country.12 We had some presentations about the13 continuum of care as well as then a set of14 recommended next steps, what people could be15 doing.16 We have since reached out to a couple17 of facilities that have expressed interest in18 following up on this. This is not something we19 can necessarily mandate and say everybody must do20 this exactly the way we say. That never works.21 But we're gathering some interested22 facilities who are interested in leading the way. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.36 1 And moving on from there. Next slide. 2 Okay. My voice was about done.3 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Perfect. Dr.4 Pomerantz, thank you so much. I think that was5 something that we expected was a 50-page6 PowerPoint to start the day.7 DR. POMERANTZ: Oh.8 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: But it was9 absolutely essential for us to see that. Because 10 the continuum of care is very important in the11 mental health process and what this Commission is12 exploring.13 I'm going to start with a question14 that I have for you. And I want your honest15 answer on it.16 It's the sufficiency of resources that17 are available to the Department of the VA to18 ensure the delivery of quality healthcare for19 mental health issues among veterans seeking20 treatment in the Department.21 Do you think that we have the22 sufficient resources throughout this Agency to(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.37 1 properly administer what you just showed us over 2 the last 20 minutes for every veteran that has a3 mental health issue?4 Whether we know it or not, because I5 think that was slide one. That there's just so6 many out there that are not being treated.7 So, I would like your assessment.8 DR. POMERANTZ: We have islands of9 sufficiency. There aren't a lot. I was in a 10 large meeting a few months ago. And I asked for11 a show of hands.12 I was at a PCMHI meeting and a show of13 hands of who feels they have sufficient resources14 in their facility. And one hand went up.15 I told her to keep that to herself in16 the future.17 (Laughter.)18 DR. POMERANTZ: But it was just19 and mentoring.20 (Laughter.)21 DR. POMERANTZ: You know, I think22 there are areas of inefficiency as well. And I(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.38 1 think that the best way to improve our efficiency 2 and do more with whatever we have, is to3 implement a continuum of care.4 So that you're not throwing a lot of5 intense resources at people who really do not6 need them. And probably will only show up for7 one visit because you haven't given them what8 they wanted.9 So, yeah, I think there are areas 10 where we can be more efficient. But overall as a11 system, I don't think we have enough.12 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Thank you for13 that. 14 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: So, I have15 one question. You were talking about the16 continuum of care, and I'm -- you know the17 different levels of care, which I'm a big18 believer in. That's a great way of thinking of19 it.20 As a mental health director in a CBOC,21 I just noticed that the continuum of care22 frequently breaks down. Like you talked about(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.39 1 the islands of sufficiency, it -- it almost seems 2 like they're just little micro-islands of3 sufficiency sometimes when you get to the higher4 levels of the continuum.5 For example, you know, when you get to6 the residential levels of care, you know, and7 then you go to the inpatient levels of care, I8 find that a lot of times if veterans aren't9 living right in the center of an urban area, 10 which is exactly where veterans don't live, a lot11 of times, they don't really have access to the12 higher levels of the continuum.13 Or you get a healthcare system within14 a VISN that hoards the resources. And then15 starves the other ones in the VISN.16 So I've kind of seen that. I see it17 -- listening to Tampa during our interviews here,18 you know, I've seen that here. But I've also19 seen it in VISN 21 where I am.20 And so I'm just wondering if you have21 -- you know, when you're talking about there22 might be islands of sufficiency, you know, there(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.40 1 are people working on that because there are 2 contacts out there.3 You know, but I know funding is an4 issue and that kind of stuff. But it's a huge5 issue for us on the ground.6 DR. POMERANTZ: I like to think of the7 facilities as you described, Tampa, others, you8 know, as sort of the places that have the9 resources to develop the models. 10 And then the challenge is how to stay11 true to the principals of those models when you12 don't have that level of resources.13 I think one of the problems we have in14 our CBOCs recurrently. And I dealt with it when15 I was leading mental health and services in16 Vermont, is that you have a CBOC with 15 hundred17 patients or something like that.18 You may have a mental health provider. 19 You should have a mental health provider. You're20 supposed to have a mental health provider.21 And very often that provider is22 spending their time doing, you know, intensive,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.41 1 cognitive processing therapy for PTSD or some 2 other base psychotherapy.3 And so the other patients are left not4 getting care. And I think that, you know,5 they're at least not being identified.6 So I think the key is community7 partnerships where they can work effectively. 8 Where the community partners are willing to adopt9 the same standards as we have within VA. 10 Which was not universal in my11 experience. Where if they can provide that kind12 of care, fine.13 Otherwise, using other resources14 within VA, other parts of our own, you know, main15 facility through either depending on distances,16 through actually having people go to these CBOCs17 as needed for the more specialized care.18 Or, having those evidence-based19 therapies provided via tele-mental health. So20 that the provider onsite can deal with all of the21 other mental health problems that are not being22 dealt with.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.42 1 When you get into some of the more 2 highly specialized programs, you know, it's not3 likely that if somebody needs a course of4 electroconvulsive treatment, they're going to get5 it at a COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: Right.7 DR. POMERANTZ: Yeah. So that some8 things they are going to have to go to the9 medical center for. But that happens, you know, 10 outside the VA as well.11 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: I guess my12 point to that was more, so even in -- even when13 you want to contract out, like I totally14 understand as -- in a CBOC you definitely can't15 do the higher level stuff or residential care or16 anything like that.17 But, there are complete lack of18 contracts, right. Or, if you do want to refer,19 you know, because some healthcare systems don't20 even have residential levels of care.21 But if you actually want to refer for22 residential levels of care, there actually isn't(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.43 1 even always contracts for it. 2 And so that's the -- and so you're3 left kind of as a clinician going I want to4 elevate this person to a higher level of care,5 but I have absolutely no avenue to do that.6 And that's the concern, I think, that7 I have. If I'm in an urban area experiencing8 that, I can only imagine what's going on, you9 know, in Montana. 10 DR. POMERANTZ: Yeah. I agree. I11 think it's a real challenge. You know, is there12 a suitable program outside of VA that we can13 contract with that can provide this care?14 And if not, I mean, if I wouldn't send15 a family member there, I don't want to send a16 veteran there.17 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: Right.18 DR. POMERANTZ: And I think that's19 really critical, and something all, you know,20 facilities are having to deal with. I think it's21 an issue.22 Likewise, if I live in Montana, I(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.44 1 don't want to have to go even to Idaho to be in a 2 residential program, leaving my family and3 everything I know, you know, behind.4 And then suddenly coming back. Hi,5 I'm cured. What do I do now? I think that's a6 really critical point.7 COMMISSIONER POTOCZNIAK: Back to the8 panel comment.9 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Where does a CIH 10 fit into the continuum as an adjunct to the11 primary care or psychiatrist when they're in12 their practice?13 DR. POMERANTZ: I think it fits on14 both sides of that balance scale.15 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Okay.16 DR. POMERANTZ: Both the support for17 the life worth living, a lot of CIH interventions18 really rely on the individual to practice them.19 And at the same time, those20 interventions, I like to think of it as they set21 the stage for healing. You know, healing doesn't22 happen in a vacuum.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.45 1 Which is how we traditionally approach 2 it in healthcare. Healing provide -- you know,3 its drawing on the internal strengths of the4 organism to promote healing.5 I think that -- we don't have a lot of6 hard evidence. And I think where research needs7 to go is to stop trying to do comparisons of this8 CIH intervention versus this evidence-based9 health treatment, and think about the two 10 together compared to either of them.11 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Have them at12 least alone.13 DR. POMERANTZ: Yeah. I think that. 14 So, I think it's critical, you know, for self-15 care and for just kind of strength and picking up16 on existing strengths.17 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Thank you.18 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Go ahead.19 I would like to20 get the 50-page PowerPoint. I mean, possibly if21 we could get that, then we wouldn't have to22 really copy that report.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.46 1 DR. POMERANTZ: Oh, I can give you a 2 thousand pages if you want.3 (Laughter.)4 DR. POMERANTZ: I mean, I've got, you5 know --6 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Wayne would like7 a thousand page one.8 COMMISSIONER BEEMAN: Jake and I would9 like the executive summary. 10 DR. POMERANTZ: Yeah. I mean, that's11 all I have. I put that together for today.12 COMMISSIONER JONAS: I noticed, I13 think the step care approach, the pyramid care14 model that you have, it's brilliant. It needs to15 be applied across all of healthcare.16 It shouldn't just be mental health. 17 Because this is not a -- mental and physical18 health are not separate. And yet we separate19 them.20 We have mental health integration. 21 And yet we know that people with mental health22 can get better if they'd just improve their(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.47 1 nutrition and actually stop their physical 2 thought linking minds.3 In fact many of you see the PCMHI4 people have told us that it really is a PCBHI,5 behavioral health. And that the ratio of those6 folks are not there.7 I've wondered if the whole health8 program might facilitate that. I would love just9 to see the integration between PCMHI and the 10 whole health program.11 I'll probably need some design12 thinking, because I noticed on your slide of13 this, of the step care model, you said this is14 future. And this is -- so it sounds like it's15 aspirational in those areas.16 And I'm just wondering again, to get17 back to the resource question, what do you need18 to make this happen? And that's really the19 question we're getting at.20 This is sort of the ideal model. And21 we have these spots of brilliance in which, you22 know, particular aspects of that long list of(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.48 1 characteristics, each of which is a challenge in 2 itself, to actually implement efficiently and3 technically, gets a part -- becomes routine.4 And it gets easy. What's needed to5 actually make that happen? If that happens, I6 would assume that then we would be using less of7 the top level of the resources.8 If we invested more in the lower level9 resources on a preventative area. And so maybe 10 that's where the cost-effectiveness and the cost11 investment meet so the resources could be12 associated.13 So I wonder if you could kind of14 comment a little bit on that? About what is15 needed here in order to make this sort of16 aspirational model a reality everywhere.17 DR. POMERANTZ: The easy quick answer18 is we need leadership with vision and courage. 19 Those two qualities.20 We need leadership to have a vision. 21 You know, to really go past all they were trained22 to do and think about what healthcare they should(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.49 1 be. 2 And have a vision of how that can3 happen locally. How can we achieve that? But4 also have the courage and will to lead the people5 who are working with them.6 Because a lot of this flies in the7 face of a couple of centuries of mental health8 knowledge. I think you know, we like to say we9 left Freud behind, but we didn't. 10 You know, there is still a view among11 most mental health providers, and I can go out on12 a limb and say most, not just many, that unless13 you take a comprehensive intake, just learn14 everything you could possibly, that the patient15 is willing to tell you, you are not delivering16 good care.17 And that's why most patients coming18 into public mental health systems, if they show19 up, they don't come back. And they don't engage20 in care. Because they're not getting what they21 want.22 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Yeah, so should(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.50 1 there be more? You know, this is on the 2 reduction of the redundancy and the de-3 implementation component.4 Because that's where the courage is5 needed, right? Don't do that. Not do this, but6 don't do that. I mean, is that -- if we would7 focus on that, would that help this become a8 widely spread use?9 DR. POMERANTZ: Yes. I think it 10 would. I think it would. I mean, we see11 frequently, at least within the PCMHI program,12 you know, programs rising to the top and then13 slipping when there's a leadership change who14 doesn't get it.15 So yes, I think getting -- and that's16 part of the courage. Is to really look at what17 you're doing. How you do it, and reflect on it.18 COMMISSIONER JONAS: I assume you two19 talk a lot about how to measure the outcomes20 here. And the outcomes that I heard here are21 primarily process outcomes.22 DR. POMERANTZ: Right.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.51 1 COMMISSIONER JONAS: That doesn't get 2 at the other up to triple, I would say quadruple.3 DR. POMERANTZ: Right.4 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Are needed and5 hope we can talk a little bit about that.6 DR. POMERANTZ: Yeah. And --7 COMMISSIONER JONAS: That might be a8 way of doing that.9 DR. POMERANTZ: And I think something 10 as simple as measurement-based care everywhere is11 what we really need. I can't show you.12 I can only show you clinical outcomes13 in programs that have looked closely at them. 14 But that's not a lot of the programs. So that's15 what we need.16 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Go.17 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Doctor, I would18 second the request for the PowerPoint. And if19 there's any way to have footnotes for the stuff20 that you'd really want to highlight where you got21 the research from.22 Because we are going to have a report(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.52 1 at the back-end. And every bit of guidance that 2 comes with a footnote is doubly valuable for us.3 I have a question I guess since you4 brought up ECT, and this facility in particular5 is really well, I guess really does well with6 treatment resistant depression through TMS.7 It makes me wonder, what is the8 journey of somebody with treatment resistant9 depression in your system look like? How does it 10 go through that process?11 Because working with folks that go12 through there, at least on the ground, it's13 pretty difficult. What does that process look14 like in your system?15 DR. POMERANTZ: When you say my16 system, do you mean the VA? Because I mean,17 it's, you know, hundreds of different ways it18 could happen. But, in a logical continuum of19 care, --20 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Yes.21 DR. POMERANTZ: How it should it look,22 is it starts with early identification. As you(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.53 1 know, the VA screens for depression yearly in 2 every patient.3 And either a positive screen or a --4 something the patient says, you know, the5 screening doesn't pick up everybody. And there6 are false negatives as well.7 False negatives and false positives. 8 That that screening then leads to ideally the9 primary care team asking a few more questions. 10 Maybe the PCMHI folks getting involved.11 And developing a treatment plan with12 the patient. May or may not include medications. 13 Since we're talking about ECT, we'll assume that14 there's medications being tried.15 A follow up with care management. And16 the care manager in the collaborative care model,17 following up with both the consulting18 psychiatrist and the primary care provider.19 And then let's say that patient's PHQ20 score started at 18, and after a month the score21 is up to 22. Which is much worse.22 At that point the patient -- and said,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.54 1 I don't think we can really manage what you've 2 got here, in primary care. I'd like you to, you3 know, I'd like to move things up to another level4 of care.5 They go into general mental health. 6 They get a more specialized team. They may have7 other providers involved. They may have a few8 others.9 They will obviously have somebody 10 doing very close medication management. Tracking11 that score. The score goes up.12 I would like we were talking about13 complementary and integrated health a moment ago. 14 I would hope that there would also be some15 efforts made to go beyond the medications. So16 again, that's part of the team care.17 And look at other things that may be18 helpful. And then gradually over time, provided19 this patient is still safe, you know, ECT20 although it's very safe, it's the most effective21 treatment we have for depression.22 It has, you know, it's resource(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.55 1 intensive. It has a very bad reputation among 2 patients. They're scared of it.3 But at that point, I think that's when4 ECT is going to be indicated. It may be done in5 that facility. It may be done elsewhere.6 I think there are other things that7 can be done. I think the literature on8 transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression9 is still evolving. 10 I know of some sites where they say11 well, we want to do that before we go to ETC. 12 Because it's easier. It's cheaper. It's safer.13 You know, it looks -- you know,14 patients are more comfortable with it. But that15 would be a -- that would be a typical flow.16 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Okay. Thank you.17 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Wayne?18 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Are there19 sufficient social workers in the facilities? 20 With the teams? And what impact might be21 boosting social workers to have on suicide?22 DR. POMERANTZ: Okay, I'll say it(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.56 1 again, support for a life worth living. And I 2 think that's key to what social workers do.3 And I think, do we have enough? 4 Probably not. I think the key issue in there is5 that there's a PACT social worker who's a medical6 social worker.7 And the PCMHI mental health provider8 maybe a licensed independent clinical social9 worker, who is providing psychotherapy. 10 So those are the two components of11 social work. And I don't -- I never think you12 can get enough social work.13 I mean, there are just so many areas14 where patients often need help. Some pat -- I've15 seen patients, I won't use the word cured, but16 certainly, you know, improve just because17 somebody helped them get food stamps.18 Or another patient of mine with severe19 PTSD, who went through all of our stuff. And he20 got a dentist and got new teeth. His life21 changed.22 COMMISSIONER JONAS: I'm just reminded(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.57 1 of Emil Durkheim, the original massive study on 2 the Sociology of Suicide where he said, if you're3 embedded in local, family, and community4 components, suicide levels are low.5 But if you're not in that, suicide6 levels are high. And that's the obvious part.7 DR. POMERANTZ: Yeah. And I was8 reading something the other day about, you know,9 globally the suicide rate is dropping. 10 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Yeah.11 DR. POMERANTZ: You know, we're We're an14 outlier.15 DR. POMERANTZ: And you know, and16 that's because so many more under-developed17 places are getting, you know, kind of getting18 that end handled a little better.19 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: If I may Andy, let20 me as the Commission lead, ask the last question21 of you. And take you off the hook.22 But this was a fantastic presentation. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.58 1 And truly met the needs of some of our key 2 questions.3 DR. POMERANTZ: Good.4 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: There's something5 that bothers me, and has been around the VA. You6 said something your presentation.7 When you're building out a great model8 such as you have, and you know that certain9 things are really effectively working. And you 10 say mandating something does not usually work.11 It's contrarian to my thinking and my12 knowledge from the private side, when you have a13 big idea and you take it through your system,14 whether it's making and selling beer for15 instance. That was my background and I know16 every well.17 If it's a big idea and a new technique18 or something new, you do mandate it. And19 everybody goes immediately, because they know20 that it's going to be the best for the company.21 So when you say that in the context of22 a big idea for evolving mental health and the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.59 1 continuum of care, and you say wait now, we don't 2 want to mandate it because we know that does not3 work. Could you clarify that?4 DR. POMERANTZ: I have a colleague in5 the Department of Defense who goes after me when6 I say things like that. He's like well, you just7 tell them to do it. They go to do it. That's8 how we do it.9 What -- I think there are a lot of 10 factors that come into play. And one is, that11 it's going to be more effective if you have the12 heart and soul of the people who are doing it.13 And telling them do it this way, I14 mean what worked in my shop in White River15 Junction, Vermont may not work in Boston. I16 heard that from the people in Boston a lot.17 But, you know, the idea is to be able18 to mandate this is what we're trying to do, these19 are the principals. And then say, you've got to20 do this.21 Which gets to a lot of what Cliff is22 going to talk about, about measuring things. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.60 1 That people -- I have a conflicted relationship 2 with SAIL and some other things because I think3 it doesn't often get to the heart and soul.4 But, I think that in order for that,5 and there's been a lot written about successful6 businesses. And you know, belief, you know, the7 employees belief in the brand and the company and8 the product is critical.9 And I think a lot of our providers 10 hate, and I've seen recent email chains that I've11 had to intervene on, you know, about this, you12 know, VA forcing us to do all these things and13 use these templates, and losing the human part.14 I think that there's a lot of kind of15 education and motivational interviewing that has16 to be done with our own people to have that17 happen.18 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: And I don't19 disagree with that. But you just said it. I did20 not see anything on your slides that would21 deviate from the human part of making that type22 of transitional change.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.61 1 And I only say this because I think 2 that everything moves at a snail pace when it3 comes to veterans healthcare within a large4 system like this.5 And I'm speaking just for myself at6 this point, on an 18 month experience within the7 VA. And so I'm on the record as basically saying8 that sometimes when there's a big idea, we are9 very slow to implement that big idea that could 10 be helping veterans and their continuum of care.11 DR. POMERANTZ: Well, that's the12 diffusion of innovation. You know, there's a lot13 written on that topic and the difficulties of14 doing that.15 So, I prefer myself to work with the16 early adopters. And then have the others be17 pulled along rather than putting all the efforts18 to folks that aren't into it.19 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Doctor, thank you20 so much for today.21 DR. POMERANTZ: Thank you. Thanks for22 the opportunity.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.62 1 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Appreciate it. At 2 this time we're going to transition to Dr. Cliff3 Smith, and he's going to be talking about SAIL.4 DR. SMITH: Thank you.5 Good morning, everyone. I'm Clifford6 Smith. I am a psychologist by training, a7 neuropsychologist by specialty. Current title,8 I'm Director of Field Support and Analytics. 9 Prior to the office merge, I was the Deputy 10 Director of Mental Health Operations. So, my11 skill set falls on the operational side.12 Andy and I have the north covered. I13 live in Iron Mountain, Michigan. So, Chippewa14 Falls is still south for me.15 I cut my teeth as the Chief of Mental16 Health there for about six years. So, I17 understand rural mental health and the challenges18 when your veterans live six hours from the19 medical center.20 I've also worked as an Associate21 Director. I understand budgets, the money issues22 that Directors face, and I've been in operations(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.63 1 for a number of years. 2 Next slide.3 So, we're going to talk about SAIL. 4 I was thrilled to hear -- it warms one's heart5 -- when one does not have to bring up the Triple6 Aim and others already are familiar with that7 model that was first identified or outlined in8 2008 with a focus on improving the health of9 populations and enhancing the experience of 10 individuals, of those patients, and being mindful11 of the cost.12 That was expanded brilliantly, I13 think, in 2014 where the importance of the14 healthcare worker was added to the model. Hence,15 the Quadruple Aim. And so, we're going to talk16 about that and how I in my work try to move the17 field into improvement in these four areas.18 The challenge, we have there, the last19 bullet, nationally accepted quality metrics20 specific to mental healthcare are pretty sparse.21 Next slide.22 You're probably very familiar with, if(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.64 1 you Google \"healthcare quality,\" there's a lot of 2 systems out there measuring hospital quality,3 CMS, you know, where somebody shows up on The4 U.S. News & World Report, right; Leapfrog;5 Healthgrades. The challenge with those is6 they're typically they are not7 mental-health-based. And if they are addressing8 mental health, they're typically mental health9 related to the hospital. So, HEDIS or ORYX 10 measures, your inpatient hospitalization, length11 of stay, readmission rates, things like that. 12 So, there really is no good comparison of quality13 between VA and non-VA facilities.14 Next slide.15 So, that got the VA a number of years16 ago looking at developing its own kind of17 comparative model; hence, the development of18 SAIL, Strategic Analytics for Improvement in19 Learning. This is just kind of a historical20 slide that's been around for a long time. You're21 probably very familiar with the rating star22 system. All facilities receive a score, then are(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.65 1 ranked based upon that score. The problem with a 2 ranking system is what? You may be a very good3 system, but you may be ranked low. So, that's4 easy to perceive, oh, my gosh, you're ranking at5 100; you must be a poor facility. That doesn't6 necessarily reflect the truth, right, because we7 are comparing ourselves to ourselves.8 Next slide.9 The challenge with the original SAIL 10 metric was mental health was left off. And so, I11 think there's part of the mental health culture,12 right? We are a medical healthcare system who13 accidentally does a little mental health on the14 side. And so, a group of us, back in 2014, met15 with the SAIL group and developed a mental health16 component to be added into the SAIL. So, one17 could say mental health was an afterthought to18 SAIL. It would have been better if we were at19 the table as it was developed, I think,20 initially, but it was a great thing to add. So,21 in 2015, Mental Health SAIL came into existence. 22 There is an article that we published on that(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.66 1 process, what the mental health component looks 2 like in SAIL. That is cited there with Lanki,3 2017.4 Next slide.5 So, the approach we took with mental6 health was, if I give a facility a metric, a7 single metric, I'll guarantee you they're going8 to take it, right? People, providers, will bend9 around backwards in order to make this. 10 So, we were a little devious on the11 mental health side. There's not a single metric. 12 Mental Health SAIL is actually three components,13 and within those components there's multiple14 metrics. So, it was intentionally designed so15 you could not push all your resources into a16 single area and succeed. You had to push17 resources everywhere to succeed. And that's the18 system that we intentionally tried to create.19 We focused on three critical20 components of care. Think of them as three21 doors:22 Population access. So, for example,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.67 1 if I know at a facility there are veterans, there 2 are 10,000 veterans that have a substance use3 disorder diagnosis, that's my population. And4 then, I want to be able to look at how well that5 facility is reaching out to that population. So,6 if the facility is only seeing one patient out of7 that 10,000, that's probably not a good thing,8 right? It's not intended to be 100 percent of9 the population, but we want to get the sense of 10 how well a facility is set up reaching out to the11 mental health population.12 The second door is the continuity of13 care. So, once a facility is able to reach out14 to a veteran, how well can we provide treatment15 to that veteran. This isn't just seeing them one16 time. Maybe that's important. But we want the17 full episode of care provided to that veteran. 18 So, door No. 2 gets at the continuity of care,19 how well, once we engage them, we can engage them20 into some kind of treatment.21 And then, the third component, going22 back to the Quadruple Aim, assesses not only the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.68 1 veteran's satisfaction, but we added the 2 provider's satisfaction, intentionally thinking3 of the Quadruple Aim; that if our providers are4 not happy, if our providers are burnt out, we5 will be decreasing the quality of our care in the6 long run.7 So, with those three doors, those all8 funnel into the single Mental Health SAIL domain.9 Next slide. 10 So, what that looks like at a facility11 level, this is Tampa's data from quarter 3. 12 You've probably seen it. Originally, the same13 picture would have been there, but mental health,14 which you see up at about three o'clock there,15 would have been gone. It didn't exist until we16 added it in 2015.17 This is the broad level of mental18 health. All three of those categories,19 population health, continuity of care, and20 experience of care, all are combined into a21 single overall metric. And Tampa's doing a very22 good job there, you can see in green.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.69 1 Next slide. 2 The second component that facilities3 have access to is, then, it breaks it down. So,4 going from that broad mental health domain to now5 the three components, you can see up at 126 o'clock there experience of care, which although7 it's at the top, their performance is some of the8 best in the nation. And then, there on the left,9 continuity of care and population coverage. So, 10 a facility can see where they rank in relation to11 other facilities.12 Next slide.13 There's a dashboard. This starts just14 teasing it apart. Mental health there is down at15 the bottom. You can see one, two, and three,16 again, the three doors and their performance.17 Next slide.18 So, what is being funneled to those19 components? The population coverage component,20 continuity of care component, and experience of21 care component are a series of metrics. And so,22 here's an example of our population coverage. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.70 1 So, you can see we're looking at populations of 2 substance use disorder, PTSD, depression, and3 seriously mentally ill. Those would be kind of4 the four big buckets that would be feeding this5 population metric.6 A couple there, the HIAS 21 and 727 there, that gets into our seriously mentally ill8 population. ICMHR is our MHICM program or our9 intensive case management. So, here at Florida, 10 you can see, just quickly, there on the third row11 down, the percent of vets with ICMHR-targeted12 diagnosis receiving ICMHR. This is intensive13 case management. You can see Tampa is14 approaching 5 percent of their population, which15 is above the national average. So, they're doing16 a great job reaching out to our most seriously17 mentally ill veterans with a serious mental18 illness.19 Next slide.20 And so, population coverage is21 actually made up of 15 metrics. Continuity of22 care has 13 metrics. And experience of care has(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.71 1 six metrics. So, I hope you can see we're trying 2 to discourage facilities from putting all of3 their resources in a single basket.4 So, if I made the single focus of5 quality care in the VA PTSD care, every medical6 center across the U.S. would take all of their7 15,000, whatever number we are at, mental health8 professionals right now, and say, you're doing9 mental healthcare. We would all do great. But, 10 then, others would suffer, right? Our most11 seriously mentally ill, the resources would be12 taken away.13 So, the Mental Health SAIL was14 intentional about that. We took the Uniform15 Mental Health Service Handbook, which outlines16 the required mental health services at each17 facility, and tried to create a system where the18 goal wasn't to focus on one thing; the goal is to19 focus on all things.20 Next slide.21 That exists. So, what do facilities22 do with it? In my group, I in many cases, and my(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.72 1 staff in many cases, develop and distribute a 2 series of dashboards that are specifically3 designed to identify those challenge areas and4 identify the opportunities, and create a process5 for improvement.6 I have a series of monthly webinars. 7 Right now, twice a month I talk about mental8 health access. Since 2016, I was actually doing9 that weekly. So, I think I had had over 150 10 webinars specifically on access. I have a once-11 a-month business operation call where I take some12 component of business or SAIL and discuss/outline13 process improvement activities.14 Dr. Klocek and his gang of technical15 assistant specialists host a once-a-month SAIL16 process improvement webinar, where, again, we17 will focus on specific metrics and identify ways18 and best practices of improvement.19 I have quarterly calls with our VISN20 mental health leads in the facilities to discuss21 the challenges and opportunities.22 I have three Program Evaluation(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.73 1 Centers with a bunch of very bright analytic folk 2 that are available for onsite consultation.3 In the last bullet there, probably4 that which has had the greatest impact is I have5 seven dedicated staff -- Dr. Klocek is one --6 called Technical Assistance Specialists who are7 improvement specialists. And we do a series of8 ongoing onsite and virtual improvement training9 sessions. These may be two to three days. We 10 will go to each facility, either at their request11 or based upon a review of where they fall in12 SAIL. If they're in the bottom of the SAIL13 performance, we're probably going to come visit a14 site.15 We did publish recently in 2018 an16 article that outlined the site visit17 collaborative care process, the collaborative18 process. Back in 2012, we started doing site19 visits that were very intense and which resulted20 in a lot of action items. It was in response to21 Congress. Congress in 2012 required us to visit22 every VA and to review the compliance with the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.74 1 Uniform Mental Health Service Handbook. And that 2 resulted in, you know, here's your 30 action3 items for follow-up.4 Our process now, like with our5 Technical Assistance Specialists, is, unless it's6 a matter of safety, patient safety, I'm not going7 to tell somebody what to do. Here's what we8 would suggest. Here's our plan for process9 improvement. Here's ways you can get there. 10 But, ultimately, like Andy said, it's up to the11 facility and local decisions. But that's an12 ongoing process, and we do a lot of traveling13 with that. And those could be \"for cause\" or14 consultative in nature.15 Next slide.16 So, the challenge, we know untreated17 mental health conditions -- Andy talked about18 this -- lead to increased mortality, worse health19 outcomes, increased disability, right? There's20 some challenges with mental health.21 Next slide.22 To help the facilities, we create(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.75 1 deep-dive tools, and some places we intentionally 2 do not develop deep-dive tools. For example, the3 example the facility has 10,000 veterans with a4 substance use disorder diagnosis. I am not going5 to develop a tool to tell a facility, \"Here's6 your 10,000.\" I get that asked a lot. They'll7 give me a call, \"My Director wants to know...\" 8 And I will refuse, because you're not going to9 cold call 10,000 veterans saying, \"Hey, Pal, 10 don't you want to come into treatment?\" That's11 not how we should be developing mental health. 12 We want to create an environment where those13 10,000 feel welcome to come, right? So, some14 places deep dive doesn't make sense. Other15 places deep dive does.16 For example, the first bullet there,17 the antidepressant non-adherence, patient18 dashboard, blah, blah, blah, that's a metric19 MDD43h and 47h. That one requires, for a new20 diagnosis of depression, you want good medication21 coverage. So, that's 84 days' coverage and,22 then, 120 days' coverage.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.76 1 We have a deep-dive tool where you can 2 see here's a veteran who has a new diagnosis of3 depression. And yet, they only had a 15-day4 prescription of an antidepressant. Maybe we5 should follow up with that veteran, right? Maybe6 we want to ensure that, if it was serious enough7 to diagnose, don't we want to ensure that we've8 covered it? So, we have tools like that where it9 does make a lot of sense to understand who we 10 should be reaching out to.11 Next slide.12 Shifting gears some, I get this asked13 a lot. Does staffing matter? This is a14 correlational analysis. I know it's busy, but15 each quarter is one box. Because I say I've16 argued, yes, your staffing is important to how17 you do on SAIL. And no matter what quarter I18 look at, it's consistently somewhere around a19 correlation of .5 or 25 percent of the explained20 variance is attributed to how well a facility is21 staffed. And staffing here is not the number of22 staff you have, not the FTE. It's the ratio.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.77 1 Next slide. 2 I recently published an article here,3 \"Mental Health Treatment, Access, Quality, and4 Satisfaction: Optimizing Staffing in an Era of5 Fiscal Accountability\". Myself and group, Dr.6 Klocek, published this article looking at does7 staffing make a difference.8 There's two ways to approach staffing. 9 One is an efficiency-based model. If you look at 10 their productivity -- and there's a system in the11 VA called SPARQ, you may have heard of, that12 balances productivity and wait time. So, if you13 look at places that have low wait time and low14 productivity or high wait time and high15 productivity, you can draw out the quadrant and16 say, gee, maybe you have too many staff; maybe17 you need more staff. It's an efficiency-based18 model, based upon how efficient those providers19 are with their productivity.20 I've argued in the article, and other21 places, I'm not a fan of an efficiency-based22 model. For example, the example I use is(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.78 1 evaluating the unemployment rate. The 2 unemployment rate only tells us the rate of3 unemployment among people who are looking for4 employment. At some point, people become5 discouraged of looking for employment. And so,6 they stop. They're still unemployed; they're7 just not counted in the rate any longer, right?8 And so, my concern about efficiency-9 based staffing is it only tells us how well we 10 are doing seeing the veterans who are coming. 11 There's in many cases a large population that12 just stop coming, right? If staffing is poor,13 they get frustrated; they know don't come. You14 know, you're not going to be seen anyway. So,15 they still would benefit from being seen, but16 they've stopped coming. So, they're not going to17 show up in an efficiency-based staffing model.18 So, we have argued in the VA for a19 population-based staffing model of 7.72 providers20 per 1,000 veterans, outpatient veterans. And so,21 I know how well a site meets that is really well22 correlated with how well they're going to be(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.79 1 doing on SAIL. So, their quality, their access, 2 their satisfaction, provider and veteran3 satisfaction, are all going to be related to how4 well staffed they are.5 Next slide.6 This is just a real simple graphic to7 show pictorially how well we do. You can see our8 Northwest generally is our better-staffed9 facilities. The Southwest and the Southeast are 10 our challenged facilities.11 Next slide.12 There is a hiring initiative, right? 13 You may have heard Dr. Shulkin specifically14 initiated an initiative to add a thousand net new15 mental health providers. Currently, from the16 start of his announcement, we are at 866. The VA17 can hire. There are some challenges with hiring18 I'd be happy to talk about and have opinions on. 19 But this is our staffing ratio over time. Okay?20 And you notice it's not going up. In21 fact, if I really were to blow this up, we're22 actually going down. So, how can we be hiring in(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.80 1 the VA, but our staffing ratio is going down? 2 We're getting more patients. The more we attempt3 to hire, the more patients come. It happens4 everywhere. If I were to bless any facility with5 here's an extra hundred staff, veterans would6 come. And so, as a result of that -- next slide7 -- our staffing ratio goes down.8 So, you can see over time, this last9 fiscal year, we were up over 1.7 million veterans 10 served in mental health. You can see we continue11 to hire. These numbers are a little old. We are12 over 12,000 now in outpatient staffing. And yet,13 our ratio is flat. And that's simple math,14 right? Our hiring cannot, or at least is not,15 outpacing the veterans that are coming in.16 Next slide.17 So, this is a tool I created to help18 facilities understand where their challenges are. 19 And this is Tampa's SAIL data. So, this is the20 population coverage for Tampa. And they have a21 couple of metrics there that stand out, PACT1522 and Psy38. Those are the places where they are(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.81 1 performing less than the 50th percentile for the 2 nation in SAIL.3 So, if the mental health staff here at4 Tampa say, you know, gee, we want to be at the5 90th percentile in our SAIL, this will tell them6 how many patients that would mean, and those7 little yellow dots are what one provider could8 account for. So, you can see Tampa's PACT15 or9 their PCMHI, they're really doing well. You 10 know, 300 more patients seen in PCMHI this year,11 and they would be at the 50th percent for the12 nation. So, maybe they want to be at the 90th13 percentile; they want to lead. I can easily14 calculate that, and I know what that means for15 patient care. And if I know what that means for16 patient care, I can calculate that into what that17 would mean for staff, right?18 In many places, why I created this is19 facilities want to do better on SAIL, but the20 bottom line is they don't have enough staff to do21 better on SAIL. And so, it was a tool to help22 medical center directors understand this is what(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.82 1 it would take in staffing if I wanted to get 2 there.3 Next slide.4 So, some projects: the Mental Health5 Access Initiative, Modeling to Learn Step Care,6 Andy talked a little about step care. I'm not7 going to talk about that, but will briefly about8 Modeling to Learn. But I want to hit next Mental9 Health Access Initiative. 10 Next slide.11 I wrote, back in 2018, a memo where I12 asked the field in general mental health to13 specifically design in general mental health14 programs, or your BHIPs, this thing called open15 access scheduling. We have same-day services,16 same-day care, but that's different than an open17 access schedule where, as a psychologist I want a18 specific portion of my week to not be scheduled,19 so I can tell my patients, \"If you have something20 that comes up you need to see me, Thursday21 afternoons is my free time. I see patients. If22 I'm free, I'm happy to see you.\" You know, it's(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.83 1 a scheduling model. 2 So, I was writing a memo outlining3 that \"ask,\" and before I wrote it, I sat down and4 I wrote a preamble. And it was essentially this,5 and it was my aspiration for the VA: that we6 aspire to be the nation's leader in understanding7 what access is.8 And access for me has three9 components. There's crisis access, engagement 10 access, and sustained access. And I'll explain11 the three and the differences.12 I was involved early on with the13 Access Initiative on a detail from my position as14 Associate Director at Iron Mountain, and I didn't15 like the conversation. Because, usually, when16 people talk about access in the news, they're17 talking about access right now for this crisis. 18 That's all it applied to. It would be simple --19 I can instantly today create huge access in the20 VA if I just tell all of my providers, \"You no21 longer do individual psychotherapy.\" We are an22 emergency department. We do crisis care. We(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.84 1 have access. It's simple, right? 2 Or, instead of individual3 psychotherapy, if I say, \"We will only do group4 psychotherapy,\" look at that. Instead of one5 patient per hour, I can now see 10 per hour. 6 I've increased access, right?7 But that was at a detriment to8 quality, right? So, access to crisis is9 critical. If there's an immediate need, we have 10 to have an available system to see that veteran. 11 But, as Dr. Pomerantz talked about, we need12 engagement access. When a veteran asks for help,13 we have to be able to see them as rapidly as we14 can. If my ability to see this veteran who asked15 me to help today is to schedule them six weeks16 out, I've lost that veteran. They're not coming17 back. And then, I wonder why we have a no-show,18 right?19 I sit in my office. I wait with my20 patient list, and I'm surprised the patient21 didn't come see me. Of course they're not going22 to come see you; that was six weeks ago, right? (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.85 1 So, we have to engage them quickly; get them in 2 for that appointment. If it's the same day, like3 in PCMHI, open access, great. If we have to4 schedule it for their convenience next week,5 that's what they wanted, great. But if I have to6 schedule them out four, five, six weeks from now,7 I've lost that opportunity. So, we need8 engagement access.9 And finally, we need sustained access. 10 When we get them in, when they come in and ask11 for help, we have to be able to provide the full12 course of care that that veteran needs. And if13 that's weekly psychotherapy, we need to have14 space or access to schedule weekly psychotherapy. 15 There are many places where psychotherapy16 consists of one appointment a month. I'm a17 psychologist. I know I'm a snob sometimes. Once18 a month is not psychotherapy. It may be good19 support. It may be important for that veteran. 20 But let's call it what it is, and it's not21 psychotherapy, right?22 We need intensive care for psychiatry(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.86 1 follow-up, for psychological follow-up for 2 therapy. We need space to be able to do that. 3 So, the Access Initiative for me was about4 finding this balance, not just focusing on crisis5 care, care right now, but how well is our system6 doing in all three, right?7 Next slide.8 So, I created a bunch of stuff and9 I've presented hundreds of times on this to 10 facilities, walking them through how they can, at11 a facility level, understand how they're doing in12 all three. So, this is just a simple slide. 50213 is general mental health. This would be your14 BHIP. This is our completed appointments in a15 month. The orange, the biggest ones, those are16 scheduled. The little red slot is a walk-in17 appointment, a same-day appointment.18 In the VA, there are two ways you have19 a same-day appointment. One is it can be20 scheduled. Okay? And it can be scheduled either21 as a walk-in or unscheduled, or you can call,22 say, at eight o'clock; you'd like to be seen. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.87 1 Get an appointment scheduled at two o'clock, 2 later in the afternoon. That's a same-day3 appointment. It was scheduled, but it's the4 create date and the appointment date equals the5 same.6 The last component is -- so that7 purple, that's created through our CPRS system. 8 It's not a scheduled appointment. So, that is,9 there was a need. A veteran needed an 10 appointment. A provider was free. The provider11 saw the patient and they wrote a note in CPRS12 when they created an encounter. It's not an13 appointment, right? An appointment in the VA is14 made in VistA. An encounter is just between the15 patient and the provider. They both have16 workload, but one is just a formal system in the17 old computer, right, in VistA, and the other was18 not.19 And so, if you add up all of that, you20 can see we're a little less than 10 percent21 scheduled same-day appointments. But when you22 look at that same-day workload -- so, I know, as(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.88 1 a Chief, I saw patients, but I may be walking 2 down the hall, and one of my providers sees me. 3 \"Hey, I have a situation here I'm not sure what4 to do with. Can you see this patient?\" I'm5 happy to.6 I'd see the patient, put my note in,7 right? It wasn't scheduled, but it was a same-8 day appointment. And when you look at all of9 that in the VA, we are approaching a little less 10 than 25 percent in BHIP monthly workload that11 happens the same day.12 Now the question I often get is, so13 what's the right amount? I don't know. The14 right amount is whatever the amount the veteran15 needed, I guess, right? It's not 50 percent. I16 don't want to go to 100 percent same-day access. 17 There's no treatment there, right? But I need18 this kind of availability. And I created this so19 sites can understand what's happening every day.20 Next slide.21 This gets to the engagement access. 22 This is looking at our wait time from a create(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.89 1 date -- somebody asks for help -- to when they 2 were actually seen. This is just looking at3 change over time, and you can see, roughly, if we4 look at general mental health or BHIP, we're5 somewhere around 14 days, which isn't bad, right? 6 You know, two weeks for that first appointment7 can look pretty good. And this is nationally. 8 If I look at individual facilities, it can be9 less; it can be more. But, nationally, we're at 10 14 days.11 Next slide.12 But the trick with mental health,13 though, is we're a bunch of different providers. 14 So, at most facilities, it's fairly easy to see a15 psychologist or a social worker. There's more of16 them, right? There's fewer psychiatrists,17 depending on the site you're at. And so, this is18 that same process, but now I asked, what's the19 wait time for psychiatry, not just to see a20 provider? Because to see a psychologist is21 usually pretty short. To see a psychiatrist22 nationally, you can see there's a bad trend going(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.90 1 on, right? We are creeping up. If you're 2 familiar with statistical process control charts,3 the dotted line there, the upper and lower4 control limits, and now we're one standard5 deviation over, our wait times for psychiatry6 nationally are creeping up.7 Next slide.8 There's another process of the \"So9 what?\" So, there's a ton of data out there. 10 What do you do with it? Those are just some11 things that I've created for facilities to12 understand locally.13 Here's another one, and I'll end with14 this, and open for questions.15 There's a process out there called16 Modeling to Learn. It takes local data. So,17 here you can see this is psychiatry data. AUD is18 alcohol use disorder/depression. OUD, opiate use19 disorder and other. It takes local data and20 pulls from that.21 Next slide.22 And then, we sit down with staff and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.91 1 we ask them, okay, so what is it exactly you're 2 trying to do? If you're trying to improve your3 wait times, decrease wait times, if you're trying4 to improve access to OUD, there's a system out5 there, and this is just a little snapshot. But6 this helps sites understand, if you make this7 little change here -- so, for example, if we can8 change our no-show rate from 15 percent to 129 percent, the system here, the algorithms will 10 show sites in real time what that would actually11 mean for their access.12 So, this is similar to flow, right? 13 There's not enough mental health providers in the14 U.S. to see everybody forever, right? My job,15 as a psychologist, is to work myself out of a16 job. You know, if you could to see me for care,17 if you're still seeing me in 30 years, my new18 house may appreciate that, but I wasn't19 successful as a provider, right? I don't want20 you to see me for 30 years, right? We need flow,21 right? Get the care when you need it. Feel free22 to come and go. But don't stay forever. This(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.92 1 helps sites understand with their own data, if 2 they make these system changes, here's the real-3 world impact that it would have on your clinic.4 Next slide.5 And this is just some early data from6 that. The first, to the left, those are seven7 clinics that did the same thing as usual. And8 you can see nothing really changed. And this9 example was the site wanted to increase their 10 evidence-based psychotherapy. So, the team,11 using these principles, helped Clinic 1 and12 Clinic 2. The seven clinics changed nothing. 13 And you can see they didn't really change how14 much evidence-based psychotherapy they were15 providing. Clinic 1 and Clinic 2 did make these16 changes based upon input from the algorithms. 17 And you can see the significant increase in their18 goal, how much evidence-based psychotherapy they19 were actually providing.20 Next slide.21 I think that is it. So, with flow and22 that Modeling to Learn, just two models of using(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.93 1 facility-based data to help facilities understand 2 how they can make system changes to improve3 access, quality, and satisfaction.4 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Thank you, Dr.5 Smith. Enlightening. And I wish I would have6 had that 18 months ago as far as SAIL is7 concerned, but also over that 18-month period8 you've been doing a lot of fine-tuning and work. 9 Especially, I did not know that mental health was 10 not part of it back in 2012 or 2014. So, thank11 you for finally initiating that.12 This will be helpful, I think, to a13 degree for the Commission and Commissioners to14 dig a little deeper from a national basis. 15 Because, you know, our charge is the entire16 veteran mental health issue and the entire nation17 and community of veterans.18 So, when you're speaking of staffing,19 to me, I mean, it goes right back to the resource20 issue. And we already talked to Dr. Pomerantz21 about that as well. It's always the biggest22 catch and bugaboo, I think, going on nationally,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.94 1 and you said it yourself. 2 I mean, from a context of what the3 Commission has to do, it is to answer the4 question about resources, and it's pretty clear5 to most of us that, you know, that is going to be6 an ongoing challenge. So, when you look at your7 flow and you look at how you want to do the8 continuum of care, along with what Andy9 presented, which I think is absolutely critical, 10 I'm really worried -- and I think the rest of the11 Commissioners are -- about properly staffed and12 resources.13 But we would probably like to come14 back to you, and we've gone over time for a15 reason, because this is, both sections, very,16 very important. And I want to give the other17 Commissioners time to ping you as well before we18 go to break.19 MR. POTOCZNIAK: I guess I could say20 there's one question I have. You mentioned in21 your slides about how primary care is kind of the22 de facto kind of initial mental health care, and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.95 1 it does serve the largest amount of people. 2 It seems like there is, though, a3 block, and I've noticed it kind of throughout4 some of the VAs, where a lot of primary care5 providers are not willing to fill that role. 6 It's a big frustration for general mental health7 as well as specialty mental health.8 Is there anything in the VA that does9 -- we don't want to say \"mandate,\" right? -- but 10 is there anything that does mandate primary care11 providers to provide that care? Because there12 are definitely whole clinics where primary care13 will ban together and say, \"We're not doing14 this.\"15 DR. SMITH: And I'm sure Andy knows16 sites like that.17 Completely agree. There are many18 providers uncomfortable with mental health, will19 outright refuse even a mild, you know, an20 antidepressant for mild symptoms. No. And this21 gets to the flow, right? So, they've been very22 stable on this medication for 25 years in primary(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.96 1 care. There we get into the pockets. We work, 2 Andy's office works a lot with chiefs-of-staff. 3 I think, for me, that's really where I want4 -- mental health has to do a better job5 supporting, and we have to do a better job, as6 our overall facility processes, understanding7 this. We are sharing patients.8 In my community, in Iron Mountain,9 there's one psychiatrist outside of the VA, and 10 he is scheduling 18 months for that first11 appointment. I know the majority of primary care12 providers in my community are treating this. 13 They are the ones who are treating mild14 depression. We have a hard time with that, and15 some VAs struggle more than others.16 The challenge is, I cannot, from a17 central office perspective, come out with my18 Smithsonian fiat and mandate it. I have to19 provide an environment of education and support20 to try to get the field there, rather than the21 big hammer.22 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Matt?(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.97 1 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: I guess coming 2 from my part of Montana and our part of the3 country, I just have been so amazed here at the4 level of like psychologists doing clinical care5 and master's level social workers doing case6 management. I mean, it's almost a degree above7 kind of where you see in some other parts of the8 country. Montana, you would probably be just as9 likely to receive clinical therapy from a 10 psychologist as you would from the talking elk. 11 You know what I mean? They're not statistically12 different. They're just not. Nobody is doing13 it.14 And I guess I wonder, how do you15 measure staffing when -- like these guys have USF16 across the street, and they should be using17 psychotherapists. I mean, whereas, if Montana18 chased psychologists, that's dumb. You know19 what I mean? I mean, just do your numbers20 reflect those different realities in terms of21 staffing and what's realistic?22 DR. SMITH: So, like with the 7.72, we(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.98 1 don't have a specialty breakdown. From Iron 2 Mountain, historically, hiring -- I know when I3 started, I had five psychologists, and that was4 it. Most of my providers were social workers5 because that's what is available there.6 And we have to be thinking what7 resources are there. Sure, there's some things8 that's a Board-certified neuropsychologist that9 only I can do. But, in the grand scheme of 10 things, that's just a very limited amount, right?11 So, I don't tell any facility, \"You12 need more psychologists.\" I would advise13 facilities, \"You need more therapists.\" Now, if14 that's marriage and family therapy, if that's15 licensed professional counselor, if that's social16 worker, hire what is regionally appropriate for17 you.18 There's a few positions that are19 mandated, but it's not specialty mandated, unless20 it be like a neuropsychologist kind of thing. 21 But I don't tease it apart to get at that.22 Like the challenge with Montana, and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.99 1 other sites that send work out into the 2 community, community care, it's a challenge,3 right? I know, as a chief, I would send my4 veterans out, and I didn't always get notes back. 5 And when I did get notes back, they were often6 pretty bad notes for VA quality.7 But we don't measure that. So now, we8 get into the whole MISSION Act and that,9 hopefully, will be changing as we develop our 10 community partnerships. But I can look at, like11 with Montana, I recently spoke with the chief of12 staff. Lot of sites will think, \"Well, we're13 doing a lot of community care.\" I can look up14 how many you're doing in community care and I can15 do the math and say, you know, yes, I know you're16 doing a lot, but, still, there's this bigger17 population out there. So, what are we doing? 18 It's not all community care.19 But, there, we have to get into the20 partnerships like just there's no psychiatrist in21 Iron Mountain. You can search all you want, and22 other than Dr. Van Holla, they aren't going to(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.100 1 exist. So, how do we supplement that in the VA, 2 tell community care, where appropriate,3 partnering with HOMA, partnering with Madison? 4 Some 10 years ago, I had psychiatrists stationed5 in Madison and Milwaukee, and even at home. We6 have to think outside of the box, especially like7 in our more rural places, even social workers can8 be pretty thin.9 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Thank you. 10 COMMISSIONER MAGUEN: I have a follow-11 up question, because I think you're bringing up a12 really important point about in the cases where13 we do have to have veterans go outside of the VA. 14 And what are some of the things that we're15 thinking about? Here you're presenting a16 beautiful model of how we look at quality inside17 the VA. How are we going to make sure we're18 holding outside providers to some of the same19 standards?20 DR. SMITH: That's a very timely21 question, especially with the MISSION Act. 22 There's been lots of conversations, even along(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.101 1 the lines of -- what I appreciated with the 2 MISSION Act is there's specific lines in there of3 quality. What is quality care?4 And as Dr. Pomerantz said, if I5 wouldn't send my family to this provider in the6 community -- and I know in my community there are7 providers I would not send my family to -- how8 can I send veterans there? What I appreciate9 with community care and the MISSION Act is I 10 think we're going to be able to define that. The11 challenge we have, for example, in mental health,12 we do great evidence-based psychotherapy. 13 There's nobody in the private sector that does14 evidence-based psychotherapy like we do it. So,15 from a leadership position, if I say I expect the16 same thing in the community as I would expect17 from my providers internal, I've just eliminated18 care because it doesn't exist.19 In a similar fashion, if I hold the20 community to the same level of training that I21 have -- I have an APA-accredited internship; I22 accredited post-doctoral fellowship; DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.102 1 have my Board -- if we set up our standards the 2 same internally for our community care, we've3 just eliminated opportunities for care, right?4 So, that's going to be the interesting5 battle, right? We have a set a very high bar. 6 This is why I love VA mental healthcare. There7 is a high bar. The Uniform Mental Health Service8 Handbook, published 10 years ago, was way ahead9 of its time. Nothing like that is in the 10 community to have that broad residential. I11 mean, we have the system covered. I think that's12 going to be the interesting thing, how that works13 out.14 Do we lower our standards to be able15 to provide somebody? Is a body better than16 nothing, right? There's people smarter than me17 working on that. I think that's going to be our18 challenge.19 COMMISSIONER MAGUEN: Right. It is a20 measurement dilemma, though, because the21 definitions necessarily are going to be22 different, right?(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.103 1 DR. SMITH: Yes. 2 COMMISSIONER MAGUEN: And then, how do3 you balance measuring what's going on inside the4 VA with other places what's going on?5 DR. SMITH: Right. I could give6 examples. Like we have required follow-up post-7 discharge from an inpatient service, right? The8 public standard is you can -- if I'm on an9 inpatient unit and the social worker comes and 10 sees me while I'm on that unit, that would count11 for seven-day post-discharge. Okay? And I think12 that's a pretty silly model, but that's the13 definition. Okay?14 And so, there was a lot of concern as15 we were moving to that private definition of16 seven-day follow, of post-discharge follow-up, if17 that was going to be a good thing. From my18 statisticians, they're like, you know, even with19 the private sector being able to do that, we20 still beat the pants off the private sector for21 our follow-up. So, if they want to see somebody22 when they're still an inpatient and call it post-(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.104 1 discharge follow-up, let them; we're still going 2 to beat them.3 And that's going to be the challenge4 as we measure quality. Nobody else dose5 measurement-based care like we do. I mean, we6 have the numbers, but we also have the7 infrastructure to do it. That will be an8 interesting battle.9 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Wayne? 10 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Yes, several11 questions. I'll try to keep that focused.12 You asked, we need to think out of the13 box. Could we think out of the box by thinking14 of the whole person? I have patients who come15 in; they clearly have depression. They've been16 on treatment. They're getting quality care. And17 then, they join a group. They get their reasons18 for living back, their purpose back, and their19 depression markedly improves.20 There's evidence-based approaches not21 delivered by psychologists or mental health, such22 as exercise for depression, such as diet and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.105 1 training in diet, for example, acupuncture. A 2 study just published on depression and PTSD3 showing acupuncture improves depression as much4 as standard psychotherapy.5 I'm wondering if we have a whole6 health system we can start thinking whole person,7 mind and body together. I know that would be8 maybe even more of a challenge to measure because9 you're now looking at -- 10 DR. SMITH: Correct.11 COMMISSIONER JONAS: -- staffing12 around mental health. And now, we're talking13 about a mix of staffing that's much broader than14 that. It seems to me there would be a way to15 come up with assessing that if we were looking at16 -- maybe there's some demo models or something17 like that, looking to the future. So, that's one18 question.19 And then, I have a second question20 about SAIL 2.0.21 DR. SMITH: Measuring or adding CIH22 into the measurement system can be a challenge. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.106 1 I was an NIH-supported researcher. Before I came 2 to the VA, as a medical university, I had3 probably somewhere around $5 million in my4 grants. Science, I mean I am a scientist. So,5 evidence-based is important.6 And so, I know, for me, I can struggle7 with, okay, so where do I want to go? Some8 interventions may not have the volume of science9 that I would like behind it. At some point, I 10 have to say, yes, well, so what? There's value11 to the veteran when they find value in it. It's12 important to them, and that makes a difference.13 I need to set aside my little14 specialty superiority and nobody can do it like a15 Board-certified neuropsychologist, and16 \"harrumph,\" you know, and say, that's okay. It17 was ultimately a good thing for the veteran and18 their quality of life improved.19 So, where is that balance, and how do20 we bring that into the fold, and yet, maintain21 scientific integrity. Evidence base, rigorous22 placebo double-blinded studies, those are great. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.107 1 For me, I know, as a chief, that's the struggle. 2 At Iron Mountain, we have acupuncture. 3 We have acupuncturists. I sent my chief of4 anesthesiology to Harvard to get certified in5 acupuncture. It has value. But that's going to6 be the challenge of how we weave that into our7 quality metrics.8 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Yes, and I'm not9 suggesting abandoning evidence. I'm a firm 10 believer in evidence. We're doing a whole11 evidence assessment of a section in great detail12 using standard hierarchy models and all that type13 of stuff.14 But there is a clash between person-15 centered care and evidence-based medicine often,16 and the provider is often trying to figure out to17 balance that, right --18 DR. SMITH: Yes, yes.19 COMMISSIONER JONAS: -- all the needs20 and the wants.21 I'm really asking if it's possible for22 the VA to even think outside the box by saying,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.108 1 maybe we ought to get rid of the \"M\" in the PCMH 2 or the \"B,\" whatever you call behavior, and just3 call it PCHI, or maybe add well-being to it --4 DR. SMITH: Uh-hum.5 COMMISSIONER JONAS: -- with metrics,6 with assessment tools, and call it patient7 primary care health and well-being integration,8 and come up with a SAIL 2.0 model that actually9 allows us to track that, feed it back into these 10 learning models that you have, in order to get11 the drivers and change going in those areas.12 And then, maybe even add some other13 metrics that don't appear to be in SAIL very14 well, but maybe you just didn't present them, and15 that's some of the other aspects of the Triple16 Aim, which is cost issues and clinical outcomes.17 DR. SMITH: Right, right. So, those18 components are not in Mental Health SAIL. They19 are in SAIL.20 COMMISSIONER JONAS: They are in SAIL?21 DR. SMITH: So, there is an efficiency22 metric there that gets at the costs and staff,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.109 1 overall staffing, things like that. That is 2 built in and reported on the ultimate SAIL model. 3 I think it's in one of my slides underneath4 \"Mental Health\". There was a metric down there5 on efficiency.6 And one place I think we will see our7 ability as we integrate other aspects of care in8 our current Mental Health SAIL is veteran9 satisfaction improves. And you'll see that in 10 the experience of care. It is that there will be11 an increase in their satisfaction overall with12 care.13 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Is there any14 discussion or taste in VA of doing a SAIL 2.015 that really fully integrates mental health into16 it instead of an add-on?17 DR. SMITH: Well, depending on18 probably who you ask, they would say, well,19 mental health is integrated. We are what, 20 --20 we're not 20 percent. Thirteen percent? Twelve. 21 We are 12 percent, right? Twelve percent of the22 overall SAIL performance is mental health. (202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.110 1 That's up from zero percent. So, I'm pretty 2 happy with that.3 Mental Health SAIL is not static. So,4 every year we change the metrics. In the fourth5 quarter, the metrics can be shifted. For those6 metrics that are stable, and we know 99 and 1007 percent of the sites are doing well, we will drop8 it and shift new ones in. We do that for a9 couple of reasons. One, it doesn't do any good 10 to measure something where you're completely11 successful at it. So, we'll get rid of it. But,12 then, we add new ones to keep people thinking13 it's not about doing well on these metrics. It's14 about doing well overall. How is our mental15 health program?16 So, we actually do have a mechanism. 17 We just, fourth quarter, created our new Mental18 Health SAIL. So, next fourth quarter, there will19 be new Mental Health SAIL. And so, there will be20 opportunities, as we think about --21 COMMISSIONER JONAS: And that's going22 to include costs, resources, and clinical(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.111 1 outcomes as part of that? 2 DR. SMITH: So, the costs we keep out3 of mental health, although I would probably have4 a battle with the RAPID folks if I wanted to put5 costs which they have outside in big SAIL, if I6 was going to then put costs internal. But we7 certainly monitor that. I have other monitors8 for mental health costs in the cost per clinic,9 the cost per episode of care. 10 And then, as we continue to develop11 measurement-based care, that will, I would hope,12 eventually be one aspect we will be able to weave13 in. Right now, nationally, we're doing it. It's14 still an area of growth. There's some IT15 challenges with measurement-based care. Some16 facilities have iPads and they can do the17 testing, and others can't have iPads. But, as we18 refine our measurement-based care processes, that19 would certainly be important to include because20 that's a critical components of measuring21 quality.22 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Thank you, Wayne.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.112 1 Dr. Smith and Dr. Pomerantz, first of 2 all, thank you so much for what you're doing. 3 And it's great to have such valued folks involved4 in veteran affairs and the many issues, and your5 professionalism, and taking the time to come from6 two states that are in the low teens for7 temperatures right now, so the snow, ice, which8 are all good things, by the way.9 (Laughter.) 10 DR. SMITH: Which are all good things,11 that's right.12 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: To come to the fun13 and the sun of Tampa. So, hopefully, you're14 going to be able to enjoy a little bit before you15 travel back.16 But, again, thank you for the great17 mission that you both have done for our veterans. 18 Thank you.19 DR. SMITH: Thank you.20 DR. going 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.113 1 take a 10-minute break at this time, and be back, 2 and we'll have Colonel Cary Harbaugh onboard at3 that time.4 (Whereupon, the above-entitled matter5 went off the record at 10:31 a.m. and resumed at6 10:48 a.m.)7 DR. POLLACK: So thank you, everybody,8 for returning. I just want to take a moment and9 introduce Colonel Cary Harbaugh who is going to 10 be talking to us now.11 Colonel Harbaugh is the USA Director12 of the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior13 Care Program from the Care Coalition and he is14 the Director of the DoD Warrior Games for 2019.15 Colonel Harbaugh does not have a16 presentation to present to you all today but is17 rather here to answer any questions that the18 Commissioners may have.19 So at this point I will turn it over20 to you, Commissioner Leinenkugel, and we'll start21 working with Colonel Harbaugh.22 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Thank you very(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.114 1 much. And thank you, Colonel, for coming in and 2 being part of the COVER Commission and also thank3 you for your service to this nation and we are4 delighted to have you on board today.5 I know that you are prepared to talk6 and we have not really had the opportunity to7 integrate and do a lot of work with the DoD8 that's part of our Commission mandate as well is9 looking into the alliance and partnerships and 10 relationships between the VA dealing with11 veterans' mental health and also DoD on the12 transition of those service members that are now13 becoming veterans on a full-time status.14 So I know that you don't have any15 particular presentation but I would like to have16 you just speak from the heart if you would, sir,17 as to your background, what you are currently18 doing, and then we'll talk about the19 transitioning of service members.20 COL. HARBAUGH: Yes, sir. No, honored21 to be with you, honored to be with you all today,22 and to represent the United States Special(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.115 1 Operations Command and the Warrior Care Program 2 that I have been, you know, privileged to be able3 to lead for the past almost five years now.4 And a Warrior Care Program is near and5 dear to my heart because it took care of me and6 that's kind of how Admiral McCraven put me in the7 job back some years ago which was he knew I had,8 he knew my story because he had been around my9 story and lived it. 10 My story is not the story to be really11 be talked about, it's really all the stories of12 the many that we serve out of that Warrior Care13 Program.14 The Warrior Care Program for the15 United States Special Operations Command services16 currently about nearly 15,000 wounded and/or17 injured Special Ops service members and their18 families are included in that 14,900 and change,19 which was my last figure a couple of days ago,20 are some family members.21 Our mandate from our Commander is that22 we will also support family members of active(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.116 1 duty service members in health crisis. So 2 primarily when we are talking about those kind of3 cases it's severe illnesses, usually cancers,4 that kind of thing, where we are providing5 resources to approximately the 80,000 sized SOF6 force that is out there.7 The program has both an active duty8 component and a veteran component. Our Warrior9 Care Programs also continue to assist into the 10 veteran years.11 We are able to do that within our12 charter and without violating, you know, sort of13 the colors of money that are out there as14 programs are put together by the fact that the15 Veterans Administration graciously provides us16 embedded personnel into my staff, so I have VA17 personnel there to handle the veteran-oriented18 issues.19 But in order to maintain a continuity20 of care and relationship and a tether to the21 Special Operations Force for the Special Ops22 veteran, they still have access to their what we(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.117 1 call a recovery care coordinator and formally the 2 advocate that then overwatches them and is that3 lifeline to call in when they have a need and for4 us to align them with the resources.5 The resources just change as the6 status changes, and as well there is always as7 you mentioned, sir, that's the transition phase,8 we have those components. I will give you a9 little bit more about that. 10 I am going a little bit back to me. 11 I have been in the Special Ops community for a12 very long time. I have been service, I am in my13 41st year of service actually. I did ten years14 as an enlisted service member all in the Airborne15 and Special Ops world, then moved into officer16 service in 1988, did 30 years as a commissioned17 officer in Special Operations primarily.18 I am an intelligence officer and I19 just moved into the Special Operations20 Intelligence world and served in a variety of21 levels all the way through commanding an22 intelligence center for Special Operations as my(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.118 1 O-6 Command. 2 And, again, in one of those fun,3 little adventures ended up acquiring some weird4 thing in the African desert as we chased some bad5 guys and ended up enrolled in a Warrior Care6 Program and the Warrior Care Program assisted me7 through what was kind of a life-threatening8 challenge for a couple of years, and that, of9 course, was where the alignment came to the 10 program.11 The struggles that we have, the12 continued challenges we have, first of all one13 thing I would want all the members of the14 Commission to understand is that the Warrior Care15 Programs, there are five that are recognized by16 Congress and the Department of Defense.17 They are the four traditional services18 as you know them and U.S. SOCOM. Congress19 brought us to life in 2013 by NDAA and made us a20 peer-level program and we benefit from that21 tremendously because as those of you that have22 served in the military, which I know is most of(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.119 1 this Commission, you know that within the 2 conventional force there is one type of mindset3 and one type of management of personnel,4 including their talent and how they are utilized,5 and the SOF force is unique.6 You know, it's one of those things we7 say it's hard to be humble when \"special\" is in8 your names sometimes, but it's Special9 Operations. 10 And in order to also have -- and when11 we were created in 2005 informally, and it took12 us eight years until we had that formal13 recognition. It was done so because General14 Brown, the Commander at the US SOCOM at the time,15 was noticing that we were bleeding, literally and16 figuratively, talent from the battlefields.17 And what was happening is the hard to18 train, hard to recruit, hard to select, hard to19 get through assessment and training in the first20 place because it's high attrition rates through21 our training, we were losing these highly22 talented people to medical ailments,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.120 1 disabilities, injuries, through a Medical 2 Evaluation Board process that the military has in3 place, and, of course, that ultimately flows into4 the IDES process and ultimately into VA care when5 it comes to disabilities, we were losing these6 people at rates that we could not sustain.7 And so he wanted to put into place8 something that allowed us to ensure that9 rehabilitation -- recovery and rehabilitation, 10 were protracted enough to get the greatest11 opportunity that if we could retain the service12 member, even post-injury, that we could do so13 and, therefore, not then have a hole in our14 formations, and so that's kind of where we were15 born from and that attitude.16 We have over the years, and I am very17 proud of the five years that I have been running18 this program, that we are maintaining a 7319 percent retention rate for our wounded.20 That is tremendous. And if you21 compare that to the DoD aggregate average it's 1022 percent and that 10 percent is because we are 73(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.121 1 percent. Okay, so most of the services are 2 retaining at about two to three percent.3 So the fact is that we are -- and4 really the secret sauce to our effort is that we5 slow roll the system, classic SOF -- we ignore6 orders.7 What we do is we allow the maximum8 recovery time and we have put the call to go to9 an MEB in the hands of our SOF leadership, and in 10 particular our SOF doctors, so that we can11 protract that rehab phase as long as possible.12 Sometimes it doesn't work out and we13 end up having to transition the service member. 14 One of those cases is a local wounded Green Beret15 who we maintained on active duty six years as a16 quadriplegic.17 Much to the service that he belonged18 to, the Army, is, you know, kind of snarling at19 us a little bit from time to time, but we wanted20 to give Chief Camargo every possibility.21 Romy Camargo is the man I am speaking22 of. He actually runs a small benevolent org here(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.122 1 that assists spinal cord injury service members 2 and veterans with rehabilitation.3 It's just down the street here. He is4 tethered to this hospital because he has such5 great love for this hospital.6 And so about six years we retained him7 on active duty. We tried everything, stem cell8 research, anything we could get that could9 potentially get him back to work, to walking, 10 that's what Romy wanted and that's the way we11 fight.12 Now that's a rare case. For most of13 our guys we kind of max out at about the year,14 year and a half mark for maximum rehab time and15 then make an assessment as to whether or not16 there is going to be a return to duty potentially17 in their lives.18 But this is resolvent as well that19 we've got, you know, guys wearing prosthetics go20 out there kicking in doors in our most21 specialized units at the highest level and that's22 pretty cool.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.123 1 And I am talking about guys that have 2 lost limbs and have gone six combat tours since3 limb loss, so we are pretty proud of the fact4 that we have been able to run a program that5 retains at that level.6 The other thing is that the 27 percent7 that are not able to be retained don't8 necessarily reflect just not able to be retained9 if we wanted to. 10 What we do is, you know, sometimes you11 get, and especially in our formations, tend to be12 older, more experienced, and you get a guy that13 gets injured and he might be injured at a point14 in his career where he is already retirement-15 eligible, he's already maybe had a couple of16 smaller hits through his career and through17 deployments and it's kind of like, hey, I'm not18 going back for, you know, another helping to see19 if I survive the next one, and so they just make20 a natural attrition decision and we support them21 through that process as well.22 So just to give you a sense of kind of(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.124 1 how and what our focus is and this has been 2 driven by, you know, our commanders that have3 followed General Brown, from Admiral Olsen, to4 Admiral McCraven, to General Joe Votel, to5 General Tony Thomas, who I currently work for,6 all of them have made a strong commitment to7 warrior care and to our program and that we have8 been very, very graciously supported by the9 Department and then by the Congress itself as we 10 continue to move forward on our efforts.11 And we have grown now to be the12 largest warrior care program with the number13 still serving on active duty. So a lot of people14 think little, old Special Ops -- well little, old15 Special Ops has borne a lot of burden of this war16 and if I were to just talk to you about the past17 ten days and severely wounded, just yesterday18 another severely wounded Green Beret who probably19 will be in a wheelchair the rest of his life, we20 had three instantly killed in an IED last Monday.21 We had a fourth die at Landstuhl from22 brain swelling due to that same IED. We had(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.125 1 another Ranger killed last Sunday in an 2 accidental, in a raid, green on blue. It was not3 an intentional green on blue, but we had a Ranger4 killed and another Ranger buddy of his severely5 injured.6 It's just a gift that keeps on giving7 right now as coming off the battlefields and in8 particular where Special Operations serves, so9 plentiful in that business. 10 Now the Warrior Care Program has the11 recover and rehabilitation aspects then it moves12 into other elements. One of those is adaptive13 sports, which we use as a tremendous14 rehabilitative tool. It is necessary to preserve15 it. It is used in the Veteran's Administration16 System as well as a continuing rehabilitation and17 I think also it has tremendous social aspects to18 it, too, that help preserve the veterans.19 And I know that it preserves our20 veterans because even in our warrior game system21 and even in our adaptive sports system our22 veterans continue to participate.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.126 1 So we have to, you know, control the 2 funding for that. Most of it is funded by3 benevolent organizations that support the4 veterans to be continued to be part of our5 programs for those type of events.6 But it's highly successful and I have7 seen many people blossom out of these things from8 the deepest and darkest holes where adaptive9 sports has been, has had a measurable impact and 10 positive impact on the lives and it's something11 that we really have to fight as a nation to12 continue to preserve and proliferate out into our13 communities.14 And a few different avenues that that15 can work, from sport leagues that are oriented on16 adaptation and disability to just accessibility17 to them.18 Like I was out yesterday with a19 foundation that does golf and we're trying to ---20 golf, one of those sports you can play lifelong21 and you can play almost with any disability, with22 the exception of just really severe brain damage.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.127 1 But you can play this game well into 2 your late years and all you have to do is have3 the right adaptations. U.S. Adaptive Golf has4 been very, very involved in this as has been the5 PGA of America, as are a number of entities.6 This one in particular that I was7 meeting with yesterday, the Crossroads Foundation8 run by LPGA legend and hall of famer Jan9 Stephenson, and what they are doing they've got a 10 whole facility designed, it's in this Tampa Bay11 area, designed to help disabled veterans and12 wounded warriors recover and rehab through the13 game of golf, and what they are doing in their14 facility I was absolutely totally impressed with.15 So a lot of the active sports world,16 which also goes on my other, my third job for17 this year, because I also have another role that18 I serve the Commander as a special assistant for,19 my third role is the Director of the Warrior20 Games.21 And the DoD Warrior Games it was SOCOM22 decided to take its turn. The four services had(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.128 1 already done theirs since DoD took it over with 2 the 2015 games and the Marine Corps were the3 first to host it, and we are bringing 300 wounded4 warriors, and that includes a veteran, every one5 of these games has a veteran component to it and6 all of teams, and along with six partner nation7 teams, which, again, are a combination of active8 duty and veterans that will be there for 3009 athletes total along with over 1000 family 10 members coming to the Tampa Bay area.11 It's going to a Vegas-style12 extravaganza I assure you, with Amalie Arena for13 our opening and closing ceremonies, A-list14 entertainment acts there, and sports going on for15 about eight days across the Tampa Bay area.16 It's going to be absolutely17 tremendous. It usually gets a lot of media18 attention and we use it to showcase the needs of19 our wounded warriors and to show how they are20 recovering and also to highlight to the public21 that, you know, Joe's leg is not going to grow22 back, okay, and he's not getting out of that(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.129 1 wheelchair, he is going to need help the rest of 2 his life.3 So it is more than just this week of4 patting him on the back and thanking him for his5 service, it's what you can do, look to see what6 you can do to support him or to support the7 organizations that support him and his family8 through what will be a life of disability.9 And that is one of the great things 10 about the Warrior Games is it gives us that11 opportunity. So adaptive sports is another key12 component of what we do.13 Benevolent support. We can't do14 everything that we do in warrior care programs,15 and that's not just mine, it's my brothers in the16 four other programs, without the support of17 benevolent organizations that are just weaved18 across the fabric of this land.19 We have got from ones that are20 specifically oriented on my Special Ops tribes,21 you know, the Navy SEAL Foundation, the Green22 Beret Foundation, Ranger Lead the Way, the Marsaw(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.130 1 Foundation, I can go on and on, SOF Warrior 2 Foundation, one of our biggest.3 These organizations, you know, fill4 the gaps and seams that the Department and the VA5 can't cover for lots of things, to include care,6 and that means getting them out to new innovation7 that may not be in the Tricare folder, may not be8 in the VA constellation of care yet that we can9 get somebody out to try, provided that his 10 primary care provider says that this isn't going11 to be harmful.12 If we've got something that we want to13 experiment with or a therapeutic retreat or what14 have you, a lot of those things can't be covered15 by Department of Defense funding or VA funding16 but are covered by these benevolent orgs and they17 do tens of millions of dollars to support all of18 us every year. 19 And it ranges from home builds to, you20 know, tricked out adaptive vehicles to all21 different sorts of things, to fishing trips and22 golf clubs and you name it, but it is(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.131 1 unbelievable what's out there. 2 And what we do with our program is3 make sure that it's delivered fairly, that it is4 to people who need it the most and not just are5 vocal about it, which is something I think across6 our wounded warrior and disabled veteran7 population we have to be fair about and8 recognize.9 A squeaky wheel doesn't necessarily 10 need the grease in our business. Sometimes it's11 -- in fact I find with my special operators that12 the ones that need it the most seem to be the13 quietest and most humble and it's sometimes14 compelling them to take advantage of an15 opportunity, but the benevolent orgs are key to16 that.17 So I have a whole team, a benevolent18 team, as part of our apparatus at the Warrior19 Care Program that makes a determination, does the20 judgements, finds out and records and tracks as21 well as gets the legal and ethical reviews that22 are required because when it involves active duty(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.132 1 members there is more scrutiny to make sure that 2 it's done appropriately and, you know, especially3 who it's coming from.4 And then, finally, it's career5 transition, and we all career transition. They6 are going to make me take this off, 41 years or7 not.8 I did what is called a retiree recall9 year at General Thomas's request in my personal 10 desire to be able to run the Warrior Games11 because I was instrumental in bringing it here.12 When the Commander said let's do it I13 am the one that staffed and because I have been14 through already six Warrior Games plus four15 Invictus Games I wanted to be able to lend my16 experiences and expertise to running this warrior17 game for us in this area.18 So the career transition piece though19 of this involves unique authority bestowed upon20 us by the Secretary of Defense that we conduct21 fellowships as our service members transition.22 The fellowship allows them in the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.133 1 final months of service, up to six months, to get 2 out and sample the high level corporate world,3 the small business, government agency, to helping4 them build, you know, build a small business5 themselves, you know, assisting them of the needs6 of a new entrepreneur, re-training, re-education.7 We've got tremendous accessibility,8 some just high-end institutions, Stanford,9 Columbia, just to name a couple, that will 10 support our guys and we've got a great brand.11 Again, the Special Operations brand12 carries a lot of weight in society and so with13 that we have been able to use that effectively14 and have over 500 partners and we have executed15 380-so fellowships where a service member gets16 out and is able to be sampled while still drawing17 their Department of Defense salary.18 They are able to be sampled by a19 business. We have tremendous success with this,20 a 100 percent job offer rate and a 92 percent job21 take rate.22 And the reason being is that we do(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.134 1 good counseling ahead of time, so we kind of kind 2 of match the guy up to what they are looking to3 do in life next.4 And, again, it's no harm no foul for5 the business that they are oriented on because6 they may not work out and the business can say,7 hey, not the right kind of guy. That's okay. We8 have had that done, it's been very, very few9 cases. 10 But it's done, you know, graciously11 and with a lot of respect. It's not done ugly. 12 But, again, because you can see by the rates,13 that's not been the case.14 Typically it's, hey, how can we get15 this guy, and not only how can we get this guy,16 how can I get more of these guys? And that has17 been why we have snowballed to where our rolodex18 of opportunities is actually bigger than our19 clientele that are transitioning at any given20 time. So we have grown over the time that we21 have been existing.22 We started off in 2005 with about 600,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.135 1 I think was where we were and now as I told you 2 14,900, so, you know, it's the gift that keeps on3 giving and we just continue to grow with well4 over 6,000 plus still on active duty plus about5 1,000 active duty, a little over that, almost6 1,500 active duty family members, and then about7 the 7,000 and change veterans that we continue to8 support.9 So that's kind of a quick overview of 10 what we do, subject to any questions you may have11 on the program per se or any other questions that12 you want to hit me on with regard to how we use13 this fine facility as well as the VA, because I14 am located everywhere SOF is.15 It's not just here in Tampa. This16 just happens to be one of our flagship locations17 and it's serendipitously located close to my18 headquarters and to my office.19 So we've got a great relationship here20 with the Haley VA and Director Battle and his21 entire staff have been absolutely fantastic22 partners for us both for our active duty service(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.136 1 members' care as well as for our veteran care. 2 We utilize this hospital and we bring3 in guys from distance to this hospital for many4 good reasons, but we also use the VA's, the four,5 that have poly-trauma total, which, of course, is6 one of the four, the other three -- we use all of7 them because of proximity to our footprint.8 But our Warrior Care Program I have9 personnel from Landstuhl to Walter Reed to West 10 Coast to Hawaii, I am covering everywhere that11 Special Ops is and in every one of our sub-12 component footprints I have a presence that is13 under our purview as the Warrior Care program. 14 Sir?15 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Dr. Harbaugh, as16 I said to you earlier thank you so much for17 coming in, but more importantly thank you for18 your 41 years of service to this great nation and19 your continued enthusiasm, and I say that with a20 capital E because you certainly have it.21 COL. HARBAUGH: Thank you, sir.22 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: And on behalf of(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.137 1 the Commission we are delighted to have you 2 represent our warriors out there and also at the3 same time I need to know the dates for the 20194 Warrior Games that you are going to be saying5 your farewell at.6 It won't be your farewell, sir, but it7 will be something that you started and are going8 to be highlighted for, so what are those dates?9 COL. HARBAUGH: Well the dates of the 10 Games are the 21st to the 30th of June with the11 opening ceremony actually on the 22nd, but the12 21st we do some preliminary sports, like a lot of13 games like this new Paralympic style, and the14 30th closing ceremonies, both opening and closing15 at Amalie Arena.16 And then we will be all over this17 area. We wanted to bring Tampa Bay into it. We18 didn't want to do it on a base because we found19 that that doesn't give the same accessibility to20 public.21 The last game was held and hosted by22 the Air Force, a beautiful game run in Colorado(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.138 1 Springs, but just that barrier, that natural 2 barrier, even if you make the gate open to the3 public, people won't take the step, and so public4 attendance at those games was not what you would5 like to hope, you know, would like to see.6 And we are really trying to pull in7 the population so I have been doing a lot of8 media events and talking to people and saying,9 look, you know, I want to get a volunteer 10 support, and I said, look, the best volunteer for11 a wounded warrior is a butt in a seat cheering12 there for him.13 And I'm going to tell you right now14 you want to warm a wounded warrior's heart don't15 be guarding a cone out in the parking lot, be in16 here cheering for him, patting him on the back,17 you know, making a lot of noise, and proud of18 him.19 So we will be Amalie Arena for opening20 and closing. We will be at the Tampa Convention21 Center and taking over the floor space there that22 they are very graciously giving to us at a very(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.139 1 low cost for that eight-day phase playing 2 everything from wheelchair basketball, wheelchair3 rugby, shooting archery, power lifting, indoor4 rowing, mini sports, on the courts that we will5 set up inside that facility.6 We will be doing track and field7 across the street here at USF and USF has been8 very gracious to include providing the9 transportation support here, so giving their bus 10 service for us so that we can again -- we are11 trying, our model for game, General Thomas and I12 had a lot of talks about this and what we were13 wanting to do was set a model for sustainability14 of the games.15 The games have been escalating in16 cost. We are trying to prove a concept, that has17 become the SOCOM model as they are calling it at18 DoD.19 And my brother that -- Colonel Larry20 Miller that runs the Marine Corps program is21 embracing that and he is stepping up because he22 will be running it in 2020 in San Antonio and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.140 1 they are following the same kind of format, and 2 that is looking for a city that wants to host us3 Olympic style, so to speak, bring you in, low to4 no-cost venues, keep the costs low.5 Let's preserve the funding that we6 were having to dispense for a warrior game and7 preserve that for care because we got 3008 athletes and that's the tip of the iceberg. I9 call it a flake off the iceberg. 10 I mean there are 15,000 wounded11 enrolled in my program alone. If I start adding12 my brothers out there, they've got tons more. We13 start to bring these together it's like when we14 get 300 athletes they are exemplars of what is15 out there but they are not the whole kit, and16 what we were doing is we were seeing, you know, a17 lot of money spent.18 It was alarming to the Secretary of19 Defense. He wanted us to look at how we do that20 better. We already had a format. We knew what21 we wanted to do and we were already stepping22 forward on that even before the SECDEF had(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.141 1 expressed his concerns and that was, look for a 2 community that wants you there, that wants to3 embrace you, wants to keep the costs low by4 providing you venues at low cost and allowing you5 to be able to do this very smartly.6 So USF will be out at the Long Aquatic7 Center in Clearwater for our swimming event and8 the Mayor of Clearwater has graciously donated9 his facility. 10 We have a golf course that is donated. 11 We added golf to the Warrior Games for the first12 time this time and we've got one of the companies13 that does seven PGA Tour events every year is14 doing the PGA Tour kind of treatment for us.15 And I got PGA players and LPGA players16 coming out to play the practice round with our17 guys and then caddy for them the next day. Can18 you think of anything better?19 It's like I'm looking at how do you20 pull in more and more folks and by doing so --21 Jon Stewart, by the way, from the Daily Show fame22 is our emcee. He has been the emcee the past(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.142 1 three games. He has graciously signed on to do 2 our game as well.3 We've got A-list entertainment acts4 from Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame stature to ones5 that have immediate public appeal that are6 signing on. The whole idea is, what pulls the7 public in gets them watching these athletes and8 supporting these families.9 So I think that you'll see this whole 10 area touched by it. It will be a tremendous11 event and we are hoping to see much of the senior12 political leadership we know that are already13 signed on board.14 Governor Scott from the outset,15 General Thomas and I sat down with him in a16 meeting and he was like what do you need, Florida17 is on board.18 I mean it has been just absolutely19 tremendous and that's what we expected. And I20 can tell you that my brother Larry there has been21 calling, he was in San Antonio the other day and22 he and I are really best friends, so he's going,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.143 1 man, I'm already seeing it here, too, so what we 2 expected to see.3 So we are, again, trying to set a4 model for how we preserve these games, keep them5 under the budget. Right now Congress6 appropriates for us about $5 million a year to7 run a warrior game.8 We think we can keep it under budget. 9 The games that had the -- the past two games 10 ahead of us had gone much higher than that and11 that was sort of sad, and as well we were trying12 to avoid having to sell our souls to corporate13 sponsors.14 We don't want it to be that way. I 15 told the groups that had asked to do that, I said16 our wounded warriors are not NASCAR, they don't17 need to be wearing things all over their jerseys.18 They need to be honored and respected19 for the limbs they have lost, the blood they have20 spilled, and the reason that you have the21 prosperity you have.22 If you are willing to come on board(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.144 1 and support us we will thank you, but we are not 2 looking to have you use them in that regard, so3 that's the way we're holding the line on that as4 well.5 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Thank you, sir. 6 I would like a follow-up transition, if you7 would, and this is something that I think all8 Commissioners need to hear from you, sir, and I9 know it's going to be very transparent and blunt. 10 Special Operations do multiple deployments and11 multiple very difficult missions and I have met12 with a few while I was active within the VA and13 when I heard that they did six, seven, eight,14 nine, even up to 13 different deployments, or15 operations as they called them, I was16 dumbfounded, so very active.17 I am surmising, and I don't know this18 for a fact, I want you to enlighten us as a19 Commission, that through all of the actions that20 you and the other medical staff have your hands21 full in dealing with some traumatic, what we22 would call mental health issues either when they(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.145 1 are active or at the point of transitioning. 2 How is that handled from the military3 doctor side, sir, and then what happens during4 the transition?5 COL. HARBAUGH: Okay. First I'll come6 back a little bit on the behavioral health thing. 7 I benefit, we benefit, our Command benefits from8 very tough, very resilient people and while we9 have certainly a portion of our force that is 10 dealing with the behavioral health issues, be11 they, you know, fully-rooted post-traumatic12 stress or post-traumatic disorder, I loved how,13 by the way, Bush instituted, and I credit14 President Bush for making that distinction, it's15 a positive thing.16 We have plenty of guys with post-17 traumatic stress. We don't everybody with a18 disorder that is disabling. But I think that the19 invisible wounds aspect of what we have been20 experiencing in 17 years of war is the most21 misunderstood, in particular, in my force.22 The most pervasive injury in my force(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.146 1 is traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain 2 injury manifests itself most times in a3 behavioral health way.4 Traumatic brain injury is5 physiological damage to the brain and it is being6 -- and you can't counsel your way out of TBI. 7 Now you need to be able to treat the symptoms8 that are behavioral health and those9 manifestations. 10 You need to be able to do that so you11 need the behavioral health component to this but12 it has to be done comprehensively. One of the13 things that I love about this hospital and the14 PREP program and the whole poly-trauma kind of15 perspective is that it understands that it is16 more than just the behavioral health component17 here, it's got to be full body.18 And I think that any of you that are19 familiar, and probably many of you are more20 familiar than I am when it comes to TBI, the fact21 is that it is still a bit of a mystery science22 right now and the therapies out there are more in(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.147 1 the realm of test bed and pilot programs. 2 There is no proven efficacy of any3 one. We find some that have relief, but we also4 have some that the relief may be nothing more5 than placebic.6 So it's like -- it's hard to judge7 that. But I know that this is the injury because8 when we've gone to and, of course, even more9 alarmed when we see things like what the research 10 is showing us in astroglia scarring because11 Special Ops guys, especially when I am talking12 about our trident wearing long tab, you know,13 that's the Special Forces' tab, short tab, Ranger14 tab, you know, the folks that we have that are15 exposed to blasts routinely through, you know,16 assessment, selection, training, preparation for17 deployment, deployment, return cycle, and as you18 said, sir, repetitively doing that, because each19 time it's going back out, getting back to the20 ranges, getting ready to go back out the door,21 another deployment.22 And when you are on breaching ops(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.148 1 every night, and I have been in my particular 2 role as a SOF intel officer, you know, out there3 building target packets and running the, you4 know, the SSE afterwards, the site exploitation,5 to run the next target.6 The guys are there popping a door and7 every time one of those door pops goes, any time8 that flashbang goes, any time a detonation goes9 add to that what the enemy is throwing at you, 10 RPGs, high-powered weapons, IEDs, all of that11 blast exposure, whether it hits you with a single12 event that brings you to the mid-grade to higher13 level TBI or it's cumulative that gets you a mild14 level TBI, the fact is TBI is out there and it's15 not -- and it can't be treated as a behavioral16 health condition.17 So we have to look at -- we look at18 our guys holistically and comprehensively and19 that is where recovery care coordination and20 advocacy is key.21 And I would tell you quite frankly as22 a guy who had been running a program as long as I(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.149 1 have with so many cases, if I had one authority 2 that I could get out of the United States3 government, and that would be, you know, out of4 Congress coupled to how the Department of Defense5 and the VA work when it comes to this stuff, is6 give the recovery care programs the authority to7 operate in the veteran space.8 We are not transgressing on Veteran9 Affairs activity, but the lead coordinator role 10 that is in the Veteran Affairs realm, lead11 coordinators are overwhelmed by volume and if you12 allowed us to aid you in that volume and resource13 us, and the reason I say that is I have to play14 this game.15 I have to, one, I have the embedded VA16 guys. I need them, okay, because we got guys17 that are going through various levels of18 transition, to include their medical transition,19 so I need them.20 But I don't have outright authority as21 a Department of Defense activity to man my force22 to cover my 7,000 veterans. Instead I do it(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.150 1 under the auspices of what I call residual 2 capacity, which is of my own coining.3 It was the way that I could4 substantiate to my bean-counting masters that I5 wasn't abusing what the Department of Defense6 funded for me.7 And so I was using a model that8 because when I transition a veteran he doesn't9 need the full crisis care kind of coverage out of 10 a recovery care coordinator that I was using at11 about a three or five to one ratio, that I would12 make sure that my caseload, active caseload in13 any one of my recovery care coordinators wasn't14 so high that I had residual capacity for them to15 cover the veteran space.16 But this is a workaround and it's not17 fair and I think that we could aid if we were18 more partnered, I mean, hell, the Veterans19 Affairs budget and the, you know, DoD budget come20 out of the same national security budget and I21 don't understand why they can't get the lines of22 money across.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.151 1 So I am being frank with you, and 2 probably get shot by the SECDEF after this, but I3 am telling you how I really feel because that's4 what you are asking me to do, not to mention I am5 on retired recall, what are they going to do to6 me --7 (Laughter.)8 COL. HARBAUGH: -- retire me again? 9 But I am telling you that there is -- We had 10 working for some time what was called the IC3,11 the Interagency Care Coordination Committee.12 We were doing this up at DHA on a13 quarterly basis. It had a lot of Veterans14 Affairs players and all the different subsets of15 Veterans Affairs.16 We had a lot of DoD players and all17 the warrior care programs of the services and18 special ops and were all part of this thing. It19 was a great coffee klatch where we went around20 there and chased our tail around the tree and21 never came up with any solutions.22 And the problem with it is while it(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.152 1 had the goal of getting solutions nobody could 2 come down to beating down the barriers and then,3 of course, you have changes in Administration and4 changes of leadership to Congress and all this5 stuff that goes on.6 I used to be a legislative affairs7 guy, too, by the way, for JSOC, so I had a couple8 years on the Hill for experiencing that and the9 complexity of that. 10 But the bottom line is that I know11 we've got certainly an Administration willingness12 to support us. I know we have congressional13 willingness to support us and if we could the two14 sides, the VA and the DoD to talk and be15 reasonable about how you do this and resource16 your warrior care programs so they could17 continually serve the veteran space, maintaining18 that relationship.19 My peers on the other programs have20 less capacity than I do to service veterans. 21 Many of them are very restrictive on it. We do22 it because we feel it's a moral obligation and(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.153 1 because once you become SOF, you are SOF for 2 life.3 Once you become Special Operations,4 SOF means Special Operations Forces, we don't --5 It's hard to get a guy that's been a Green Beret6 or a Navy SEAL that identified himself throughout7 his career from what was really childhood through8 to retirement now in his middle age as a badass9 doorkicker as the way he looks at himself in the 10 mirror and then says, okay, it's now time to11 retire and not think of himself that way still12 and not wanting to have connection to that.13 And as well, if you want them to seek14 care the benefit of our programs, in my program15 in particular, is that the guys I've got doing16 recovery care coordination came from our force,17 and I call them my crusty sergeant's major, but18 that's because most of them are retired E-9s.19 But I also have some retired O-5s and20 O-6s as well. But I got seasoned, experienced21 folks that came out of our formations. Most of22 us have been, you know, wounded or injured(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.154 1 ourselves, who understand it, went through an 2 MEB, went through it and ultimately made a3 transition decision and are now retired, but they4 walk through into these formations, or when they5 are dealing with these guys over the phone, or6 face-to-face they speak with credibility that7 gets the guy to get to care.8 So when you are talking about how we9 get them into care and make that segue into care 10 and preserve it that's where that tether is, it's11 the buddy.12 In this case that buddy is your13 advocate who says you need to go see Doc14 Schmuckatelli because he is the best guy for what15 you got, okay?16 You need to get out for this and here17 is what I got for you and I have a plan for you. 18 Here is how I keep you. And by the way if you19 start feeling low you got my number, brother, you20 call my number.21 And when he calls, and I have had this22 recently. Hell, I had a kid -- I believe(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.155 1 somebody was from like north, like Minneapolis or 2 something, or whoever was just in here, we were3 talking Wisconsin weather, right.4 I just had a wounded warrior, TBI,5 PTSD, combined guy, who for whatever reason he6 got into dire financial straits, was living in7 Las Vegas, and for some reason decided to go with8 no money, homeless, and get on a bus and go visit9 people, or go visit what he thought might be 10 people that he could see in St. Paul, Minnesota.11 He just did this last week and I get12 a call because he's now got nothing and he13 arrived, by the way, the night before14 Thanksgiving.15 So trying to find people the night16 before Thanksgiving that are going to take you in17 and provide you services, the Veteran Resource18 Center was closed there that night.19 So I get a call. So we immediately20 send out the troops and because he's SOF, he's a21 brother because he's Special Ops, and we do it,22 and I think that by preserving that in the(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.156 1 program and by giving us the authority to do that 2 that would be the best thing possible to maintain3 that relationship and ensure that your guys are4 getting to care or getting the nudge to care,5 because sometimes it's a kick in the butt.6 I heard one of your witnesses here was7 speaking to the fact that you can't force them. 8 That's a fact, we can't force them, but we're9 pretty good at cajoling and strong-arming. 10 And you know what that is effective11 when that comes from -- when you are Green Beret12 and you are feeling kind of low but you don't13 want to go see the psych because you think psychs14 are a bunch, you know, a bunch of blarney. Well15 when you hear it from a brother who goes, look,16 I've worked with Doc Schmuckatelli he's a good17 dude, he's really going to help you, I want to18 get you there.19 When a brother tells you, you go. 20 You're not going to listen to some sweet social21 working kind of background working person. 22 You're not going to -- it doesn't have the same(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.157 1 impact with our guys. 2 And so I say that to you as one of3 those mechanisms and also because I want to make4 sure that you understood when I go back to my TBI5 thing that we are dealing with a much bigger6 problem and I am also worried that the Veterans7 Administration is prepared, needs to be prepared,8 it's already working in these realms, but it9 needs to be prepared with what I think will be a 10 tsunami in neurologic disorders that are coming.11 This TBI brain stuff, especially when12 we start to see what astroglia scarring does long13 term. And some of the research, like Dr. Pearl's14 research out of Fort Detrick, out of Walter Reed15 is showing that many of the pharmaceuticals16 dispense for behavioral health conditions are17 actually exacerbating TBI and so what we are18 doing is we are not necessarily helping even19 though we think we are and until we really20 understand TBI fully I don't think we can address21 the BH side, not at least with pharmaceuticals.22 You can still -- there are some other(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.158 1 therapies that are effective, but we have to be 2 aware of that. Also, we need to get ahead when3 it comes to TBI and behavioral health.4 We need to get ahead of the5 innovations. We need to move faster in the6 innovations, getting them evaluated, determining7 efficacy and safety and getting them out into the8 realm of care.9 We have got things like, we have been 10 testing the magnetic resonance therapy, which is11 essentially EEG-guided frequency modulated12 transcranial magnetic stimulation, but it's, you13 know, more fixed.14 It's run out of the Brain Treatment15 Center at Newport, California. Those are the16 ones that kind of came up with this innovation17 and we were hearing some positives about it.18 We had some guys try it with19 benevolent org funding. We had some positives20 out of it, not completely, but we had some21 positives -- enough that we thought there was22 enough smoke here that we need to see if there(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.159 1 was fire, and we just need to be able to, you 2 know, just to process with these, you know, blind3 studies and all the other stuff, you now, you're4 putting it through.5 And I tell people, look, I don't6 really care if it ends up being much more than7 acupuncture or massage therapy for your brain. 8 If it turns out that it is effective let's not9 have it in the realm where we have to pay a lot 10 of money for it.11 Let's get it into the VA centers and12 let's get it into the military clinics and13 military medicine and make it accessible so that14 a guy can get in there and, you know, he needs to15 get a tweaking, maybe it's like teeth whitening,16 I don't care, you know, zaps him, makes him feel17 better.18 If it makes him feel better for 9019 days and they got to go back in that's fine, but20 if we're having to pay 30k a month for it that21 isn't the best way to do it, so let's figure out22 smart ways.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.160 1 That's just one example but we've got 2 others that are out there. Carrick Brain Center3 is doing stuff, Brainsake up in the D.C. area,4 Wake Forest has got one that works in the5 auditory realm.6 There is a lot of stuff out there and7 all I am is, look, I am a consumer, I am a8 Special Ops intel officer, I am not a doctor nor9 do I play one on television, and I am looking for 10 what works and I take the input from my wounded11 warriors as to what is working for them, that's12 how I determine efficacy, what's working, comes13 out of the mouths of those men.14 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Commissioner15 Jonas?16 COMMISSIONER JONAS: Thank you. And17 I want to say thank you for your candor and I18 want to push it a little bit farther in the area19 of the caregiver in the family.20 Kicking doors down is not something21 you do at home, okay, and there is a huge cadre22 of family members and caregivers that are out(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.161 1 there and when someone gets a serious injury and 2 comes back and needs the recovery and the support3 you have is tremendous, but as you know many of4 them are full-time caregivers afterwards in those5 areas.6 COL. HARBAUGH: Yes, sir.7 COMMISSIONER JONAS: How do you8 address those issues and the resilience of that9 and not falling out of that family? I know you 10 got your brother family, but falling out of that11 family in your programs.12 COL. HARBAUGH: Yes, sir. Well I can13 tell you first of all it's comprehensive with us. 14 Frankly, I have more interaction -- or our15 program folks have more interaction with the16 caregiver tends to be the spouse than we have17 often with the service member themself.18 They are -- it's part of our process19 is that we embrace the whole person and whole20 family concept because we know that's where21 healing occurs and we also know that they are22 bearing a tremendous burden.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.162 1 And most of the resources that we 2 dispense when it comes to whether that is pulled3 from the benevolent space or from the Department4 or from the Veterans Administration space is ones5 that look at the problem through that lens.6 So, you know, our caregivers are near7 and dear to our heart, our care providers, as8 are, by the way, also, I have the other9 obligation in my program which is our Gold Stars, 10 so families of the fallen and we provide them11 because often there is care that is required.12 And care is shut off once you have13 received your SGLI and all the other benefits and14 now you are dependent on Gold Start activities15 out there and other organizations to support you.16 Thankfully we have an incredibly and17 benevolent and gracious nation. But if we didn't18 have that we would struggle. So we take19 advantage of that but most of our Gold Stars20 don't know where to withdraw those resources.21 But, yes, sir, from the standpoint of22 caregiver support -- and there are a lot of thing(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.163 1 that are -- a lot of our wellness-oriented 2 therapy activities are full family or couple3 oriented. We recognize that.4 We have one tremendous partner called5 Operation Healing Forces, it's actually based in6 this area but it services the entire SOF nation,7 and it does specifically couples retreats because8 we have high divorce rates in our formations.9 When you've got eight, ten, 13 10 deployments guess what, it's tough on a marriage11 and so we really do what we can. We also have --12 I think we are also very proud of the fact that13 we have what we call steel magnolias.14 We have absolutely, and I'm saying15 that because it sounds like it is solely16 oriented, we also have plenty of women in our SOF17 formations now, more coming up, so we have also18 male spouses out there.19 But our steel magnolias when it comes20 to our Green Beret formations, our SEAL21 formations that are yet to really have women in22 them where we are talking about our spouses, are(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.164 1 absolutely amazing. 2 So the support networks we have3 collectively through the effort that we run out4 of Special Operations Command called Preservation5 of the Force and Family.6 It's a partner to us. It's a7 resiliency building activity. I am kind of right8 of bangs, so after the bangs happen they are part9 of our resource staff but they are there 10 strengthening the family, strengthening the11 service member.12 We have a physical component to it13 with human performance, behavioral health14 performance, spiritual performance, so it's got15 all the mains.16 We build up their strength and their17 resiliency and, by the way, we've already18 recruited pretty tough people anyway, so they are19 there.20 You also have to think about the SOF21 guy. The SOF that guy that gets hurt says how do22 I get back to the team? To me one of the most(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.165 1 heartwarming things about my job is that when I 2 am visiting a guy laid up in a Walter Reed, and3 he may be freshly wounded, half the time he's on4 FaceTime talking to his team back in Afghanistan5 or Iraq, wherever he came from, going, hey, guys,6 I'll be back in three months.7 I'm looking at the guy thinking it's8 probably going to be a year, but that's his9 mindset and that mindset fuels recovery and rehab 10 because it's how do I get back to duty, what does11 it take to get back to duty.12 I've got a guy working for me right13 now, a hero of the Camp Integrity attack a couple14 of years ago, Master Sergeant George Vera. He15 was a Green Beret.16 You may have seen, if you saw any17 coverage of the Invictus Games after he got his18 gold medal we really showcased that, ESPN picked19 it up, so did Fox News, because Prince Harry and20 Meghan gave his medal and congratulating him and21 his daughter ran out on the floor, it was a very22 heartwarming thing, and he is stuck in a(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.166 1 wheelchair the rest of his life. 2 He came off after a long recovery, to3 include a lot of time in this hospital, and he4 rolled in, literally rolled into my office and5 said, sir, I've still got three years on my SF6 bonus, my last Special Forces bonus that I took,7 I'm serving them out, man, I want to work.8 And so we put him to work as an9 instructor and now he is on my staff helping me 10 with Warrior Games. But that's the kind of guy11 that we have.12 And so that fuels, and I will tell you13 that the caregiver support around him is, you14 know, his wife, his children, it is a15 comprehensive package of folks that we care for16 and that have to be cared for with anyone of our17 warriors.18 COMMISSIONER JONAS: And that gets19 extended to your veterans population, too?20 COL. HARBAUGH: Yes, sir. Yes, sir,21 it gets extended to our veterans population as22 much as we can. But, again, going back to my(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.167 1 authority things, it's where I am then having to 2 operate in the benevolent space because there is3 not as much out there --- well, that's not true.4 There is a lot of out there, but I5 can't -- it doesn't come to me as quickly, and so6 needs come up. For instance, a couple of days7 ago I had a SEAL spouse call me, husband badly8 injured, medically retired SEAL O-3, back some9 years -- a few years ago at least, and she was 10 having struggles.11 And it was like I heard about it12 through an email, I had seen it, that got13 forwarded to me, and I called out to her and14 said, hey, I am here for you, what do you need,15 and I immediately re-invigorated.16 And the problem was this, service17 member was going I'm good, I'm good. He was18 getting his periodic checks by his recovery care19 coordinator, who was a retired SEAL, like I was20 telling you about my model, retired SEAL Master21 Chief, was calling him.22 And so we have a tracking system that(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.168 1 we maintain and it's got every interaction with 2 every wounded warrior or veteran, and I'm3 looking, and so I immediately go if I see, hey, I4 got this guy's name pop up, bump, bump, bump,5 where we at with him?6 Okay, well he has been contacted here,7 he was contacted here, says he's good to go,8 what's going on. And this is exactly it. 9 Brother recovery care coordinator SEAL calls and 10 says, hey, man, you need anything? How's it11 going? Where are you at with your care right12 now? That kind of thing, because it was follow-13 on care, and he was giving him all good, brother,14 all good, except wife's calling going not good,15 help.16 Okay? So we immediately respond to17 wife, send in the troops, the resources, and, you18 know, we're already -- she called me back the19 other night just, you know, glowing about how20 we're getting James back out to where he needs to21 be, it will back the family setting a lot better,22 you know, all the things and all the resources(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.169 1 that are already pouring in. 2 So it was just a matter of -- now he's3 in veteran space and we are getting -- one of the4 resources he is taking advantage of is a VA5 location, but we're also getting him out to an6 innovative care.7 I'm actually trying to get him, I'm8 going to try to get him slated for a PREP here9 that you guys are going to see later, which we 10 are big believers in. So that's kind of the11 steps we take. Sir?12 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Colonel Harbaugh,13 I guess I just want to say thank you for what you14 do and one of my rugby buddies is being patched15 up in San Antonio by your crew after a tough16 mission.17 COL. HARBAUGH: Good to hear.18 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: So especially19 thank you for taking care of that one right now.20 COL. HARBAUGH: We got a great team in21 San Antonio by the way, awesome.22 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: But I guess I(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.170 1 brought this up with you a little bit earlier to 2 make sure that you had some time to think about3 it.4 Just before you got on board, I guess5 around five years ago, I got a call from a family6 and they had a Navy SEAL in this area that was --7 the military had tried to force him into care. 8 He certainly needed care.9 COL. HARBAUGH: Yes. 10 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: No question. He11 walked away from their attempt to take him into12 care. He was thrown into the brig. Some mid-13 level person decided he was incredibly dangerous14 so then they put him in solitary confinement.15 And I got involved when the family16 contacted me and we worked through Congress, we17 worked through the legal team to help him,18 because he was just about at retirement anyway,19 just ten years in Afghanistan had been too much.20 COL. HARBAUGH: Yes.21 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: He had pre-22 existing bi-polar disorder and I, you know, I(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.171 1 think that that -- Admiral McCraven was helpful, 2 you know, but that solitary confinement time3 severs a lot of those ties to the community and I4 just -- how has the process of involuntary5 commitments been changed in the past five years?6 COL. HARBAUGH: Well I think, one,7 well gratefully, the involuntary commitment kind8 of thing, you know, through Baker Act or what9 have you is not a high number and I have 10 experienced a handful of cases over my past five 11 years.12 There has been, it's been an education13 process for all of our formations with our14 leaders, in particular commanders and senior15 enlisted leaders to make sure that they16 understood.17 Where we are benefitting right now is18 the guys have grown up now. It's 17 years of19 war, so guys have grown up. You know, you've got20 O-5 commander-level folks that grew up all at war21 so their appreciation for what the stresses are22 on that force has, you know, changed.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.172 1 So we had, obviously, a different, you 2 know, if you go back ten years ago you had more3 guys that had maybe grown up or were already at4 mid-grade or more senior officer level, that were5 in command roles that didn't necessarily have the6 same appreciation.7 You get into -- well here's where the8 difficulty is, as any of you that served in9 uniform especially as an officer know, that once 10 a guy breaches the UCMJ it complicates what I can11 do, especially if I am in any kind of12 adjudicative role, so it complicates what I can13 do.14 And we had this with a case, a Green15 Beret, that had -- and the Green Beret actually16 ended up a patient here in this hospital, but the17 substances became the outlet for dealing with his18 issues and once the event happened that19 ultimately injured him, because he was injured in20 an accident created by the abuse of substances,21 and that put him into a spinal cord injury22 setting.(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.173 1 And then it became a legal thing 2 because toxicology was drawn on him when he was3 injured and he was found to have substances that4 are very illegal, not just borderline illegal,5 very illegal, and then that tied into the abuse6 of him and others and potential sales or resale7 which then, of course turns this into a huge UCMJ8 action.9 Now the guy needed to be in care, 10 obviously, and there had been attempts to get him11 into care but they turn it into performance and12 you turn it into another act when you add those13 components to it.14 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Yes.15 COL. HARBAUGH: So now for guys that16 just go off reservation, so to speak, don't mean17 to be impolite about it, but say we had -- I had18 a special tactics NCO, a great history of19 experience, you know, tremendous special20 operator, Air Fore Special Operator, Air21 Commando, that got to the point where his post-22 traumatic stress and other behavioral health(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.174 1 disorders had him, you know, all the hyper- 2 vigilance, all that kind of thing, and he would3 go into states where he felt he had E&E, that4 included using his skills to steal cars and get5 involved in, you know, being chased by police,6 endangering lives, obviously, in high speed7 chases, I mean those kind of things, and where we8 had to get him committed and get him under the9 care. Ultimately he was put into care at the 10 Eisenhower Center up in Michigan, where the11 advocacy continued to include senior-level12 advocacy to make sure it didn't turn into too13 punitive and more therapy oriented.14 But we also had to recognize with this15 particular individual there had to be some period16 of, albeit behavioral health incarceration, there17 had to be some period of restricting him from18 access to society until you could be comfortable19 that he is safe.20 And this is where the hard thing comes21 in the case you are citing. You've got people22 that are trained to hurt people, preferably bad(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.175 1 people that are, you know, opposing the interest 2 of the United States or our allies, but they are3 highly skilled at hurting people.4 And so you have to take steps to5 protect society if it's appropriate. It's how6 you do that in a compassionate way that we have7 all kind of learned, and I'm not saying it's8 perfect right now because there still is9 sometimes cases that pop up and I get them from 10 time to time where we have to go, okay, I mean we11 obviously we have the veteran court system, we12 have some other things out there that can inform13 fair judgement of care.14 I'm not sure though all the resources15 that are necessary to provide the kind of care16 they need, especially when you are dealing with17 TBI that has as a co-morbidity a post-traumatic18 stress or other behavioral health disorder19 related to it, I don't know that we have the20 apparatus necessarily in place.21 Thankfully it's not too many cases we22 have to deal with, but I think we should at least(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.176 1 address that there is that need from time to 2 time. Does that answer your question?3 COMMISSIONER KUNTZ: Thank you, sir,4 that was perfect.5 COL. HARBAUGH: All right.6 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: Colonel Harbaugh,7 due to the time constraints, I as the Chairman8 need to say thank you again, sir, so much.9 COL. HARBAUGH: Sure. 10 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: A couple of add-11 ons as well, the depth, breadth, the insights12 that you have brought to this Commission were13 exemplary and the candor, as Wayne noted,14 fabulous and we hope that that continues with all15 of the people that come before the COVER16 Commission because it will make our suggestions,17 recommendations, and outputs much more clear to18 the key components of who are going to be the19 participants of making these changes for better20 veteran's mental health care.21 And I will make a promise to you and22 our mutual marine friend Keith Lawless, who I(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.177 1 have not seen in 40 years, to be here in June as 2 long as my marine buddy will have a rack for me.3 COL. HARBAUGH: That I will set up for4 you, sir. I have great -- if I could in just5 kind of a closing comment to you, I only got to6 allude to it a few times.7 This VA hospital has been an absolute8 fabulous partner for our Special Operations9 community. The PREP program that I know they are 10 going to display to you today, which I am sure11 you've already gained some familiarity on, it is12 almost exclusively servicing the SOF community,13 both veteran and active duty right now.14 We rely on it. It needs to grow. It15 needs to be out in every VA hospital. Frankly, I16 wish it was in every community. It's hard to17 find the expertise to populate that I know that18 because it requires the providers and the19 equipment to do so.20 But it is a flagship of care when it21 comes to dealing with the traumatic brain injury,22 post-traumatic stress disorders, but all factors,(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.178 1 because it's poly-trauma, it's orientation. 2 Every SOF service member that I have3 sent to this has benefitted from it and raves4 about it. We have never had one come out going I5 got nothing out of it, it wasn't that good. It6 is phenomenal.7 And we were hopeful to see it start to8 spread across the Veterans Administration. I9 know funding and other things get in the way 10 sometimes, but we need to have these everywhere.11 I, of course, am going to continue. 12 I have told them I can fill his classes, he knows13 that I can fill his classes every time. I've got14 more guys -- I've got guys in the queue, but15 whatever could be done through the work of the16 Commission to impart or to provide resources to17 the Veterans Administration to allow this thing18 to proliferate would benefit so many.19 Now it doesn't need to be abused, and20 I say that because as I mentioned in my opening21 comments about the concern about the degree of22 diagnosis or misunderstood on the post-traumatic(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.179 1 stress. 2 There are a lot of folks are carrying3 that as a badge of courage and unfairly have it. 4 Now my guys in my population worry about that. 5 You know, if I'm going to get disability for my6 knee I got to show you how I got my knee injured,7 okay?8 We've got a game being played right9 now and we got to be aware of that and we got to 10 be respectful of those that truly have post-11 traumatic stress and post-traumatic stress12 disorder, but we also have to recognize that some13 people have anxiety disorders, depressive14 disorders, other things, and to classify them all15 in one category, which connotes to the American16 public and to the rest of us that it means combat17 service, okay, I have been in combat, it's kind18 of hard to have PTSD unless you got it, you know,19 sexual trauma, car accident, something, watched20 grandma fall down the stairs and die in a21 grotesque manner.22 I don't know, but you got to have(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.180 1 something that was traumatic in your life. We 2 don't force that substantiation. And for the3 guys in my community that have gone through4 deployment after deployment watching their5 buddies die in their arms or get hit or get6 killed, for them to have somebody call it post-7 traumatic disorder based on the fact that they8 just merely put a uniform on is unfair.9 And so I think we just have to be 10 reasonable about that. We made a proposal a11 couple of years that that they reviewed, and it12 was during the DOLE Commission process, that they13 do a look at deployment-related stress disorders,14 service-related stress disorders.15 Have a classification so that you can16 break it out and be fair about it. Hey, what17 they get ultimately in a disability rating or18 payment I don't care, we don't care, but it ought19 to be a little fairer and that way you can't --20 we have whole people take advantage of this thing21 and really when I look at it through the lens of22 so many of my folks that have got legitimate(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R. Gross and Co., Inc.181 1 post-traumatic stress I worry about that. 2 So I'm just telling you, again, from3 the standpoint of being very frank with you that4 I think that we as a nation got to grasp this5 because not all of us that served in uniform are6 dealing with those issues, but those that do7 could ultimately be robbed of benefits somehow or8 robbed of care if we dilute that diagnosis and9 not make that something that is really well 10 understood. So I share that with you as a --11 COMMISSIONER KHAN: God Bless SOF12 brothers everywhere.13 COL. (Applause.)15 DR. POLLACK: So thank you all for16 coming and this ends the open session.17 CHAIR LEINENKUGEL: The open session18 of Day 3, December 6, 2018, of the COVER19 Commission is now formally adjourned.20 (Whereupon, the above-entitled matter21 went off the record at 11:49 a.m.)22(202) 234-4433 Washington DC www.nealrgross.comNeal R.
