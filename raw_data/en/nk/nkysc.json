An excellent way to do that and reconnect with your mind and body is through meditation. You must have heard of the benefits of meditation and how this practice can help improve focus and promote calmness and self-awareness. If you already meditate regularly, you have probably experienced the practice's benefits on mental health. Now add some crystals into your meditation routine to make it even better. Crystals have specific vibrations that can infuse your energy fields and support your intentions. For meditation, you'll need some [gemstones that carry gentle and calming vibes to wash away your stress](https://www.villagerockshop.com/blog/crystal-meditation-helps-relieve-stress/) and worries. There are various ways to use crystals for meditation, and you can experiment and choose what works best for you. But I will try to describe some of the options we have regarding gemstones and meditation techniques. During mindfulness meditation, we try to stay focused on the experience of the present moment. Every time our attention drifts away, we bring it back to our object of focus. Usually, the object of our focus is the breath, but crystal palm stones can also make great focal points. Holding a palm stone in your hand during meditation will help you become aware of the present moment by using your tactile sense. You can notice the stone's temperature and texture, its weight in your hands, and how it makes you feel. Don't think too much about it; just feel the crystal and observe the sensations. And if you want to enjoy the crystal's metaphysical properties during mindfulness meditation, I recommend palm stones that relieve stress, such as Amethyst palm stones, or those that help with focus, such as Black Tourmaline and Tiger's Eye. During a body scan meditation, people begin by focusing on one end of their body, usually their feet, then slowly and steadily scan their whole body to relax and release tension. This meditation promotes relaxation and a sense of tranquility. It's an excellent technique for overstressed or anxious people when practiced right before bedtime. During your body scan meditation session, you can place crystals on your body to infuse your aura with peaceful energy or place them on different areas, such as the Third Eye or the Heart Chakra. If you want to try a body scan session to relieve some tension, crystals such as Rose Quartz, Selenite, and Celestite can make great meditation tools. Place a Selenite crystal on your body during meditation to purify your energy and benefit from its deeply healing vibes. If you need some self-love, use the Rose Quartz crystal known as the stone of universal love. It can also encourage you to learn self-compassion and to approach yourself with kindness. Celestite is great for body scan meditation as it has grounding energies and can bring you a sense of harmony and connectedness. This crystal work best with the Third Eye Chakra, which is associated with wisdom, understanding, and elevated consciousness. During loving-kindness meditation, you imagine, focus, and direct your affection, love, and good energies toward yourself or someone else. Those who regularly practice loving-kindness meditation can awaken and enhance their compassion, unconditional love, self-acceptance, kindness, and capacity for forgiveness. It's an excellent mediation technique for those struggling with anger, frustration, resentment, self-hatred, guilt, or low self-esteem. Gemstones and [crystals that resonate with the Heart Chakra](https://www.villagerockshop.com/blog/seven-most-powerful-crystals-for-the-heart-chakra/) are excellent companions in your loving-kindness practice. And to allow them to infuse your aura and help you open your heart, you can wear them close to your body as jewelry pieces. Practice loving-kindness meditation while wearing crystals such as: Practicing Chakra meditation will keep your energy centers balanced and energized. You can use seven crystals for each energy center for this meditation technique, or you can use crystals that resonate with more than one Chakra. You will have to lie down comfortably and place the crystals on your body in the areas of your Chakras. You can have someone help you place all the crystals on your body if you find doing it alone difficult. Relax and let the mind's chatter switch off. Let the crystals infuse your energy fields while your awareness drifts to each stone placed on the body. You can experiment and do this kind of meditation with the following crystals and gemstones: Remember that crystals tend to absorb and store energy from their environment, and it's not always the energy you need. That's why your pretty little gemstones need to be cleansed of that unwanted, sometimes harmful energy. You want to use your crystals for meditation when they are most effective, so I recommend some crystal cleansing methods.
