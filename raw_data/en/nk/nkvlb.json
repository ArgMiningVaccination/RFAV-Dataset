New World Ayurvedic Health Practitioners are experts in Holistic Health. They deeply understand the mind-body connection. They become trained and skilled in all three areas below: - A Clinician Our students learn relevant and effective clinical skills. They become adept at assessing imbalances through pulse, tongue, facial, skin and other diagnostic modalities. They become skilled at thinking clinically and making recommendations through our case-based approach where the principles of Ayurveda are taught by working through actual client cases right from the very first class. - An Educator Our students learn education skills. They know how to develop online courses and in-person presentation skills. They also develop ways of teaching Ayurveda in one-on-one consultations that best serve each client. - A Coach Our students learn coaching skills. Some become dual-trained in both Ayurveda and Health Coaching through adding the [Consciousness-based Health Coaching Training](https://www.cbhealthcoaching.net/) to the Ayurvedic Practitioner training. They also learn coaching skills through our practice building curriculum. In the process, they learn to coach clients through a six-month wellness journey. Through our unique curriculum, we teach all this so our students not only learn the material, but become adept at applying the knowledge and skills they have learned so they are well prepared to practice upon graduation. Training to become a New World Ayurveda Health Practitioner is not just an intellectual endeavor. We teach students how to apply what they learn and support them in their own development and healing journey to experience first-hand the power of Ayurveda, consciousness and heart-centered living. This is why the most common feedback we get from our graduates is: \"This course transformed my life\".
