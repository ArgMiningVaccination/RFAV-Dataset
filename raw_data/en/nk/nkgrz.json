Grants are given to those who qualify and go towards their choice of non-toxic healing protocol that insurance companies do not provide coverage. Originally I created the fund to help women conflicted with choice when it comes to treating their breast cancer. Since non toxic cancer treatment can be costly, and insurance companies do not recognize or compensate for these treatments, having financial help can be the difference of life or death. Through the love and support of my community, family and friends, money was raised for me to help make my journey through cancer a less financial burdensome, as none of the protocols I chose were covered through insurance. I understand that not all people receive this kind of support and I truly felt the need to give back. The non toxic treatments I chose saved my life in so many ways, beyond the physical, and my wish is for this to be experienced for more people dealing with cancer. I have since expanded it to include help for all cancer survivors. Together we can help change the current state of the medical system to not discriminate against non-pharmaceuticals to treat, support and heal ourselves, but it's going to take a movement.
