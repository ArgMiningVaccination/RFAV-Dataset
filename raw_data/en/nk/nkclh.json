Notice of Funding Opportunity Title: Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities - Building Markets and Investing in America's Climate -Smart Farmers, Ranchers & Forest Own ers to Strengthen U.S. Rural and Agricultural Communities Notice of Funding Opportunity Number : USDA -NRCS -COMM -22-NOFO0001139 Assistance Listing : This program is listed in the Assistance Listings on Sam.gov under 10.937 Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities. SAM is a web -based, government -wide application that collects, validates, stores, and disseminates business information about the federal government's trading partners in support of the contract awards, grants, and electronic pay ment processes. Notice of Funding Opportunity Summary Up to approximately $1 billion will be made available for the Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities projects through this funding opportunity , which will build markets and invest in America's climate -smart farmers, ranchers , and forest own ers to strengthen U.S. rural and agricultural communities . Through the Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities , USDA will support the production and marketing of climate -smart commodities through a set of pilot projects that provide voluntary incentives through partners to producers and land owners , including early adopters, to: a. implement climate -smart production practices, activities , and systems on working lands , b. measure/ quantify , monitor and verify the carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits associated with those practices , and c. develop market s and promote the resulting climate -smart commodities . Grant agreements under this funding opportunity will be with a single entity, i.e., \"partner\"; however, USDA encourages multiple partners to coordinate on projects. A range of public and private entities are eligible to apply, as described in Section C. Proposals must provide a plan to pilot implementation of climate -smart agricult ure and/or forestry practices on a large -scale, including meaningful involvement of small or historically underserved producers , consistent with spirit of the Justice40 initiative ; a quantification, monitoring, reporting , and verification plan; and a plan to develop markets and promote climate -smart commodities generated as a result of project activities. Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 3 of 35 Funding will be provided through two funding pools. Proposals in the first funding pool (requests for amounts from $5 million to $100 million per proposal ) will be large -scale pilot projects that emphasize the gree nhouse gas benefits of climate -smart commodity production and include direct, meaningful benefits to a representative cross -section of productio n agriculture, including small and/or historically underserved producers . Proposals in the second funding pool (request s for amounts from $250,000 to $4,999,999 per proposal ) are limited to particularly innovative pilot projects with a n emphasis on enrollment of small and/or underserved producers and/or monitoring, reporting, and verification activities developed at minority -serving institutions. All projects must be tied to the development of market s and promotion of climate -smart commodities. For the purposes of this funding opportunity, a \"climate -smart commodity\" is an agricultural commodity that is produced using agricultural (farming, ranching , or forestry) practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or seques ter carbon. Markets for climate - smart commodities may include companies or processors sourcing climate -smart commodities to meet internal targets or other supply chain goals, biofuel and renewable energy markets, companies seeking to sell branded consumer products, or other opportunities that could provide a premium or additional revenue for participating producers and land owners . Sufficient incentives to encourage producer participation, as well as , generat ion of verifiab le greenhouse gas reductions and carbon sequestration are critical to project success and will be considered in the evaluation criteria.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Legislative Authority The authority for this funding opportunity is the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (1 5 U.S.C. 714 et seq ). This funding opportunity leverages the authorities under Section 5 of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act at 15 U.S.C. 714 c with particular emphasis on the following subsection : \"(e) increase the domestic consumption of agricultural commodities (other than tobacco) by expanding or aiding in the expansion of domestic markets or by developing or aiding in the development of new and additional markets, marketing facilities, and uses for such commodities .\" Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Detai ls In response to the climate crisis , USDA is pursuing actions within the agriculture sector to support the production of climate -smart commodities . For the purposes of this funding opportunity, a \"climate -smart commodity\" is defined as an agricultural commodity that is produced using agricultural (farming, ranching , or forestry) practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon. Adop tion of these practices can produce other associated envir onmental benefits. Through Partnerships , USDA will support a set of pilot projects that provide voluntary incentives through partners to producers and land owners , including early adopters, to: implement climate -smart production practices , activities , and systems on working lands ; Measure /quantify , mon itor and verify the carb on and greenhouse gas benefits associated with those practices ; and develop market s and promote the resulting climate -smart commodities . Goals of t he Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities : Intended Overarching Outcomes As demonstrated in Executive Order (EO) 14008 , tackling the c limate crisis at home and abroad will require a whole -of-government approach , and agriculture and forestry play an important role in that strategy. USDA 's 90-day progress report on our Climate -Smart Agriculture and Forestry (CSAF) strategy emphasized that a successful CSAF strategy relies on a multi -pronged approach. Projects funded through the Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities will play an important role in that approach and will contribute to meeting the U.S. commitments to address climate change . The Partnerships aim to achieve the following outcomes through a variety of pilot projects: Increased markets (supply and demand) for climate -smart commodities ; Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 7 of 35 Increased adoption of Climate -Smart Agriculture and Forestry (CSAF) practices and systems that reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and /or increase carbon sequestration from the agricultural sector ; Demonstration of scalable and low -cost meas urement /quantification , monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) systems ; Increase d innovation and cons istency in measuring/ quantifying farm -level GHG benefits ; Testing and evaluation of efficient traceability through supply chains from production of commodity to delivery to the consumer ; Improved understanding and communication of economic and adaptation benefits , as well as ancillary environmental benefits ; Equitable administration that includes small and underserved producers as well as early adopters (i.e., producers who have already used some climate -smart approaches ); Understanding of marketability advantages for a variety of farm types ; Empowerment of farmers, ranchers , and forest land owners to drive CSAF markets and practice adoption ; and Development of additional public -private partnerships to foster and develop CSAF markets . Intended Market Expansion Outcomes The Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities seek to address the need for new and expanded markets for CSAF commodities, including helping : Standardize the definition of a CSAF commodity ; Improve the quality and ability to verify GHG emissions reduc tions and carbon sequestration benefits associated with commodities produced using CSAF practices to inform future measurement and quantification standards ; Reduc e the potential for double counting of benefits ; Reduce transaction costs ; Increase understanding and awareness of climate -smart commodities among small and underserved producers and expand their participation ; Increase the efficiency of supply chain traceability ; Reduce the risk of market entry ; and Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 8 of 35 Increase the competitive advantage of U.S. farmers, ranchers and forest land owners domestically and internationally. Project Boundaries The primary focus of the Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities pilot projects must be on -farm production of climate -smart commodities. Commodities must be produced using verifiable and quantifiable climate -smart practices (farming, ranching, or forestry). Climate -smart forest products are included , and applicants may propose and justify innovative forestry projects that generate climate -smart forestry commodities. Projects must focus on verifiable on-farm (or forest ) GHG emissions and carbon sequestration benefits . Federal fund ing under this funding opportunity must not be used for renting or purchasing land in the form of an easement or other device. Other reductions associated with processing, transportation, etc., throughout the agriculture and forestry supply chains are not the focus of this funding opportunity . Partners with agreements under this funding opportunity must ensure that payments are not provided to a producer or land owner for the same production practice or system implementation on the same land for which the producer or land owner has already received, or is contracted to receive, funding through another USDA program. Enhancements to existing practices may be funded as part of these pilot projects . Specific ownership of GHG benefits shall be proposed by applicants (e.g., how GHG benefit ownership will be transferred through different parts of the supply chain) . These chain -of-custody ownership clauses could be included, for example, in a) contracts between producers and project developers , and b) contracts between project developers and commodity purchasers. Practices Highly competitive p rojects will include agricultural and forestry practices or combinations of practices, and/or practice enhancements that provide GHG benefits and/or carbon sequestration. Practices may includ e but are not limited to the following : Cover crops Low-till or no -till Nutrient management Enhanced efficiency fertilizers Manure management Feed management to reduce enteric emissions Buffers, wetland, and grassland management, and tree planting on working lands Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 9 of 35 Agroforestry and afforestation on working lands Afforestation/reforestation and sustainable forest management Planting for high carbon sequestration rate Maintaining and improving forest soil quality Increase on -site carbon storage through Forest Stand Management Alternate wetting and drying on rice fields Climate -smart pasture practices, such as prescribed grazing or legume interceding Soil amendments, like biochar Notes : All practices must demonstrate GHG benefits . Practices and enhancements to existing practices are not limited to those under existing USDA practice standards ; however , compliance and reporting activities will likely be more complex for practices without existing standards. Projects may include digesters only in limited circumstances , with additional documentation; s ee notes in the Project Narrative section . B. FEDERAL AWARD INFORMATION 1. Available Funding a. Estimated Funding The Federal funding agency expects to award a total of approximately $1 billion through this opportunity . b. Start Dates and Performance Periods Projects may be between 1 and 5 years in duration , with up to two years of no - cost extensions considered on a case -by-case basis . Anticipated start dates are Summer 2022. Note: Projects must demonstrate project results on the ground within one year of the project start date. c. Number of Awards USDA welcomes pro posals from a range of funding sizes from $250,000 to $100 million ; therefore, the number of awards under this announcement is difficult to predict. With this in mind, t he agency expects to make approximately 30-50 award s, depending on proposals received. 2. Type of Award a. Type of Federal Award USDA plans to award grant agreements pursuant to this opportunity . USDA will provide general oversight of the grant and reporting requirements . However, in Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 10 of 35 general, any on the ground technical assistance will need to be provided by the recipient (except for Highly Erodible Land ( HEL) and Wetland Compliance (WC) determinations). Recipients may only enroll agricultural producers and land owners who are compliant with HEL and W C requirements as described under 7 CFR part 12 . Procurement Contracts The agency does not expect to award procurement contracts associated with this NFO . b. Eligibility of Renewal or Supplemental Project Applications Applications for renewal or supplementation of existing projects are not eligible to compete with applications for new Federal awards . An application for renewal means a n application submitted to continue an existing agreement that meets the objectives and requirements of this NFO . An application for supplementation of an existing project means a n application to add components to an existing agreement so that it would meet the objectives and requirements in this NFO. USDA does reserve the right to renew or supplement awards under this NFO in the future with additional federal funding without further competition. C. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION 1. Eligible Applicants Applicants and applications must meet eligibility criteria by the application deadline to be considered for award . Eligible applicant type is consistent with the statutory authority for this funding opportunity. Applicant entities identified in the SAM.gov exclusions database as ineligible, prohibited/restricted, or excluded from receiving Federal contracts and certain Federal assistance and benefits will not be considered for Federal funding, as applicable to the funding being requested under this Federal program (2 CFR 200.206 (d)). This opportunity is open only to domestic applicants /recipients , and subrecipients must also be domestic ; beneficiaries must meet additional requirements described further in this opportunity . For the purposes of this funding opportunity \"domestic\" means not a foreign organization nor a foreign public entity as defined at 2 CFR 200. The primary applicant must also demonstrate an existing relationship with and/or prior experience working with producers or land owners. Additionally, at minimum one project partner must have existing experience working with underserved producers or land owners . This information will be used when evaluating the application in the equity criteria. Eligibility for this opportunity is limited to the following e ntity types: County, city or township governments Special district governments State governments Small businesses For-profit organizations other than small businesses Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 11 of 35 Native American tribal governments (Federally recognized) Native American tribal organizations (other than Federally recognized tribal governments) Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status (other than institutions of higher education) Nonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status (other than institutions of higher education) Private institutions of higher education Public and State -controlled institutions of higher education. Note: This list does not include federal entities. The primary applicant/recipient must be an entity (not an individual) . Commodity organizations , technical service provider organizations (including university extension), farming cooperatives , organizations representing historically underrepresented communities, loc al producers, micro -producers , forestry organizations and others are encouraged to apply. Individuals may also be eligible as sub recipients but may not be the primary applicant/recipient. 2. Other Any award made pursuant to this NFO will be made to a single entity . Applicants that apply as \"partnerships\" or other similar groupings must clearly describe the relationship between the applicant and the \"partner\" parties . In all but exceptional cases, this must be reflected in the award as an awardee/ sub-awardee relationship. An applicant organization may submit more than one application for different projects or propos e different approaches to a particular project in separ ate applications . In the case of applications submitted as revisions or corrections to a previously submitted application under this NFO, the agency will consider the last application submitted prior to the established deadline . Awards made pursuant to this NFO are not subject to any payment limitation s. However, any agricultural producers or land owners receiving a payment through participation in a project awarded under this NFO are considered beneficiaries for purpose of this N FO and must meet the following requirements : Meet the eligibility requirements of 7 CFR Part 12 ; Must have control of the land involved for the term of the proposed award period ; and Must also satisfy the following eligibility criteria, as applicable : o If a person: any person who is not a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted into the United States for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 -1778) will be ineligible to receive any disbursement under t his NFO on a farm that is owned or operated by the person, unless the person is an individual who Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 12 of 35 is providing land, capital, and a substantial amount of personal labor in the production of crops on the farm; or o If a corporation or legal entity: A corpora tion or other legal entity will be ineligible to receive disbursement under this NFO if more than 10 percent of the ownership of the legal entity is held by persons who are not citizens of the United States or lawful aliens unless each foreign person who i s a stockholder or other type of member provides a substantial amount of active personal labor in the production of crops on a farm owned or operated by the legal entity. However, upon the written request of the legal entity, the grant recipient may make p ayments in an amount representative of the percentage interest of the legal entity that is owned by citizens of the United States and lawful aliens or foreign stockholders or other type of member who provide a significant contribution of active personal la bor in the production of crops on a farm owned or operated by the legal entity. USDA will provide additional direction on how these percentages may be determined and approved. 3. Cost Sharing or Matching There is not a specific match requirement for this NFO . However, applications will be evaluated , in part , on the relative contribution of non -Federal resources to the project . Cost sharing may be achieved with contributions of cash, services, materials, equipment, or third -party in -kind contributions . USDA values the importance of partners contributing to projects ; the magnitude and quality of matching funds will be a part of the evaluation criteria. However, t his will be considered through the lens of equity so that the ability to se cure a non -Federal match is not a barrier to participation. Refer to Section D of this NFO for information about any required submittals related to match or cost -share requirements . Refer to Section E for a description of how a voluntary match will be evaluated. While the pace of cost sharing/matching may vary throughout the award period, the agency will actively monitor cost sharing/matching levels as it receives payment requests to ensure the total cost sharing/matching requirement is met by the award period of performance end date. Additional details about cost sharing or matching funds/contributions are located at 2 CFR 200.306. D. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION 1. Information for New Users of Grants.gov a. Overview While a Grants.gov account is not required to download a n NFO and related documents, it is required to submit an application . If your organization has never submitted an application via Grants.gov, please be aware that there are several Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 13 of 35 steps you must take to register your organization before you can submit an application . Completing those steps can take a significant amount of time , so plan accordingly. For information about the Grants.gov pre -award phase of the to Apply through Grants.gov Carefully r eview the registration step s and gather information requested prior to beginning the registration process to avoid last-minute searches for required information. For assistance with the registration process, contact Grants.gov Applicant Support at 1 -800-518-4726 or support@grants.gov . Organizations must complete all steps to register (steps i. through v . below) . Complete organization instructions are included on Grants.gov here: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization- registration.html. Although c reating a Grants.gov account online can take only minutes, SAM registrations may take several weeks. Therefore, organizations should begin the process early to ensure they have sufficient time to complete registration and meet required application submission deadlines. Individuals are not subject to the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)/ DUNS or SAM requirement and may begin with step iii. , Create a Grants.gov Account, listed below. (Note: Individuals are not eligible for all opportunities.) c. Steps to Register i. Obtain a DUNS Number or UEI: All entities applying for funding must have a Data Universal Numbering System ( DUNS ) Number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) or a UEI issued by SAM.gov . Applicants must enter the DUNS Number /UEI in the data entry field labeled \" UEI\" on the SF -424 form. ii. Register with SAM: All organizations must register with System for Award Management (SAM ) to apply online through Grants.gov . SAM registration must be renewed annually. Part of the SAM registration process includes designating an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EBiz POC). The EBiz POC plays an integral part in the organization's Grants.gov registration and application process. The individual in that role must authorize all other roles in Grants.gov. For more detailed instructions for registering with SAM, refer to https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization- registration/step -2-register- with -sam.html Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 14 of 35 iii.

EBiz POC Authoriz ed Profile Roles: After you register with Grants.gov and create an Organization Applicant Profile, you must establish roles for individuals in the organization . The Authorized Organizational Representative ( AOR ) role is critical; it gives an individual permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of the organization. (Please be aware that the EBiz POC and the person with AOR Role cannot be the same individual; they must be different people.) Without this role, the organization cann ot submit any applications . The request for role assignment will be routed to the organization's EBiz POC for approval. Once approved, the AOR can submit an application online . For more detailed instructions about creating a EBiz POC authorized profile on Grants.gov, refer to https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/authorize - roles.html Track Role Status: To track your role request, refer to https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track -role- status.html d. Electronic Signature When applications are submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the organization applicant with the AOR role that submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. Please be aware that th e EBiz POC and the person with AOR Role cannot be the same individual; they must be different people. The EBiz POC must authorize people who are able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as a user with the AOR role . This step ( step c.v. above) is often missed, and it is crucial for valid and timely submissions. Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 15 of 35 e. Workspace .

Approach to verification of greenhouse gas benefits , and E. Agreement to participate in the Partnership s Network (see entry below in \"Considerations for Successful Projects\"). Note: Applicants must describe how they will track GHG benefits through the supply chain. This funding opportunity is focused on projects that generate climate -smart commodities, and not on projects that focus on generating carbon offsets. Projects may investigate systems that track GHG benefits associated with both climate -smart commodities and carbon offsets. Applicants may consider approaches where the climate -smart activities could generate carbon offsets ; however, applicants should ensure there is not double - counting of climate benefits entering commodity supply chains and the benefits being used to generat e carbon offsets . Applicants must define how GHG benefit ownership will be transferred through different parts of the supply chain; and double counting will be avoided. Applicants will also have to attest that producers and land owners will not be involved in multiple USDA programs that fund the same practice on the same land . Federal funds under this funding opportunity may not be used to pay for implementation of the same practice on the same land, but funding may be used to enhance a practice or to further incentivize the climate -smart commodity generated, especially with respect to early adopters. iv. A plan to develop and expand market s for climate -smart commodities generated as a result of project activities, including: A. Any partnerships designed to market resulting climate -smart commodities, B. A plan to track climate -smart commodities through the supply chain , if appropriate , Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 19 of 35 C. Estimated economic benefits for participating producers including market returns , and D. Post -project potential, including a nticipated ability to scale project activities, likelihood of long -term viability beyond project period, and ability to inform future USDA actions to enco urage climate -smart commodities. Proposals in the second funding pool (requesting from $250,000 to $4,999,999) are limited to particularly innovative pilot projects with a focus on: enrollment of small and/or underserved producers , and/or monitoring, reporting, and verification activities at minority serving institutions . Proposals in the second funding pool are also encouraged to include plans for all of the elements listed above for the first funding pool. However, USDA recognizes that projects of this size may face limitations in the capacity to execute on all elements and will take these limitations in to account during project evaluation. Note: Under the second funding pool, digesters may be funded as a part of a project to help fund proving out technologies and building infrastructure on farm . Large digesters with high capital costs should plan to leverage other innovative financing as part of their applications . Small -scale digesters that can build off manure management strategies (e.g. , covered lagoons that can be converted) and community digesters where one system serves multiple farms may be included . Funding for the digester (s) when combined with other sources may not exceed the cost of th e digester (s). Applications requesting funding for digesters as part of the project MUST complete Appendix D and Appendix E , which include additional requirements and a feasibility study to be conducted by an outside consultant . All projects that incorporate digesters must include provisions for pollution and pathogen mitigation. Considerations for Successful Projects All projects must be tied to the development of markets and promotion of climate - smart commodities. Markets for climate -smart commodities may include companies or processors sourcing climate -smart commodities to meet internal targets or other supply chain goals, biofuel and renewable energy markets, companies seeking to sell branded consume r products, or other opportunities that could provide a premium or additional revenue for participating producers and land owners . Sufficient incentives to encourage producer participation, as well as, generation of verifiable greenhouse gas reductions and carbon sequestration are critical to project success and will be considered in the evaluation criteria. Requirements for (1) quantification, and (2) monitoring and verification of GHG benefits through Part nership projects are outlined below: Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 20 of 35 (1) Quantification Requirements USDA encourages deployment of innovative, cost -effective methods for the quantification of greenhouse gas and carbon sequestration benefits in these pilots . Alongside such innovative app roaches, the Carb on Management Evaluation Tool (COMET) Planner tool should be used where applicable. COMET is an USDA online management system that provides land owners and conservation planners with an easy -to-use, web- based tool to e valuate potential carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas reductions from adopting production practices. The methodolog ies used in the suite of COMET tools are documented in USDA's entity -scale methods , \"Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Agriculture and Forestry: Methods for Entity - Scale Inventory \" (\"Entity Scale Methods\"), and are based on peer -reviewed science . At present , USDA uses COMET -Planner to quantify the greenhouse gas and carbon sequestration benefits for a number of climate -smart agriculture and forestry practices. To help ensure comparability of project results, f unded projects also should use COMET -Planner, where applicable, to determine common estimate s of the GHG impacts of activities. Projects are encouraged to use USDA's Entity Scale Methods when GHG benefit estimates are not available in COMET - Planner. Applicants are also encourage d to use innovative quantification methodologies in addition to those mentioned above. The outcomes of the alternative methods should be compared against the Entity -Scale Methods and/ or COMET -Planner , as appropriate. Alternate methodologies should be documented transparently, be based in peer -reviewed literature whenever possible, be replicable by third parties, and be available for other projects to implement . (2) Monitoring and Verification Requirements USDA is not prescribing monitoring and verification methodologies, and is seeking proposals that include innovative, rigorous and cost -effective approaches . Innovation in approaches to monitoring and verification will help to facilitate the deployment of climate smart agriculture and forestry at scale and provide information critical to adapting qua ntification models in the future . Proposed monitoring and verification approaches should ensure the integrity of the GHG benefits and resulting climate -smart commodities, while also ensuring that transaction costs are not a barrier to participation. Additional requirements for quantification, monitoring and verification may be provide d at the time of award. Partnership s Network A representative from each awarded project must be designated as a member of the \"USDA Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Learning Network\" (Partnership s Network). Participation involves up to two virtual meetings and two Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 21 of 35 in-person meetings a year during the project duration , subject to change . The Partnership s Network will be co-chaired by the Office of the Chief Economist and FPAC . The Partnership s Network will inform synthesis reports to be assembl ed by USDA on a range of topics related to the implementation of Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities projects, including: Lessons- learned as projects are implemented; Options for providing technical assistance; Procedures for measur ement/quantification , monitoring, reporting, and verifying GHG benefits; Options for tracing climate -smart commodities through the supply chain; Mechanisms for reducing costs of implementation; A forum for discussion and learning regarding approaches to CSAF program implementation (including but not limited to deployment; measurement/ quantification, monitoring, reporting, tracking, and verification of associated greenhouse gas benefits and marketing of climate -smart commodities). Synthesis of outcomes and successes; and Opportunities for USDA and others to inform future approaches to generating new and expanded markets for climate -smart commodities. If your proposal will include information collection from non -Federal sources , ensure the collection meets the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Surveys of individuals or entities are generally prohibited without prior approval from the Office o f Management and Budget. For additional guidance about allowable and unallowable activities, please visit the following website: https://pra.digital.gov/do -i-need -clearance/ . The following do cuments do not count toward the above -stated page limit. b. Application Form (Standard Form 424 Application for Federal Assistance) See Instructions for Completing SF -424 located at the end of this document. c. Standard Form (SF) 424A, Budget Information - Non -Construction Programs Fill in all spaces as appropriate . Section B, Item 6, Column 1 should reflect the agency funds , and Column 2 should reflect the applicant's matching funds . This form is the summary budget for the project and should include the full project totals on pages one and two . See Instructions for Completing SF -424A located at the end of this document. Refer to Section D of this opportunity for information regarding indirect costs. d. Budget Narrative Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 22 of 35 i. In a separate document titled \"Budget Narrative ,\" explain and justify all requested budget items/costs. (Refer to the budget narrative guidance located at the end of this document.) Detail how the totals on the SF -424A were determined and demonstrate a cl ear connection between costs and the proposed project activities. For personnel salary costs, include the base -line salary figures and the estimates of time (as percentages) to be directly charged to the project. Describe any item that under the applicable Federal cost principles requires the agency's approval and estimate its cost. The pages included as the budget narrative do not count toward the page limit. Cost sharing/matching must be committed at the time of application submission. The budget narrativ e mus t show the amounts and sources of match or cost share (including both cash and in- kind contributions). ii. Any non- Federal entity (except State and local governments that receive more than $35 million per year in Federal funding) that does not have a current negotiated (including provisional) rate may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10 percent of modified total direct costs (MTDC) which may be used indefinitely. No do cumentation is required to justify the 10 percent de minimis indirect cost rate. As described in 2 CFR 200.403 , costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs but m ay not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as a non -Federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non- Federal entity may apply to do at any time. iii. Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) means all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000. Other it ems may only be excluded when necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs, and with the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. iv. As required in 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F Audit Requirements, all U.S. states, local governments, Federally recognized Indian tribal governments, and non -profit organizations expending $750,000 or more in Federal award funds in a fiscal year must submit a Single Audit report for that year through the Federal Audit Clearinghouse's Internet Data Entry System. Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 23 of 35 e. Grants.gov Lobbying Fo rm, Certification and Disclosure of Lobbying Activities Under Title 31 of the United States Code, Section 1352, an applicant or recipient must not use any federally appropriated funds (both annually appropriated and continuing appropriations) or matching funds under a grant or cooperative agreement award to pay any person for lobbying in connection with the award. Lobbyi ng is defined as influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress connection with the award. Submission of an application also represents the applicant's certification of the statements in 2 CFR Part 4 18, Appendix A- Certification Regarding Lobbying. If you/your organization have/has made or agrees to make any payment using non -appropriated funds for lobbying, you must also complete and submit the SF LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities located at 2 CFR 418, Appen dix B . See 2 CFR 418.110 for more information on when additional submission of this form is required. f. Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) if applicable If charging indirect costs, u pload the NICRA under Other Attachments (listed as an Optional Form) in the G rants.gov Opportunity Application Package . See Section D for information regarding indirect costs. g. Disclosure of Potential Conflict of Interest Applicants must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the performance of its employees in the selection, award, and administration of Federal awards. No employee, officer, or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a Federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties referenced, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from an applicant considered for a Federal award. The standards of conduct must provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the applicant. If the applicant has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a state, local government, or Indian tribe, the applicant must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizatio nal conflicts of interest. Organizational conflict of interest means that because of the relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the applicant is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a Federal award action involving a related organization. h. Post Award Documentation Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 24 of 35 Post award documentation may be required in addition to what is described elsewhere in this funding opportunity. i. Unique entity identifier (UEI) /DUNS and System for Award Management (SAM) Each applicant (unless the applicant is an individual excepted from those requirements under 2 CFR 25.110(b) or (c), or has an exception approved by the Federal awarding agency under 2 CFR 25.110(d)) is required to: ( i) Be registered in SAM before submitting its application; (ii) provide a valid unique entity identifier in its application; and (iii) continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Feder al award or an application or plan under consideration by a Federal awarding agency. The agency may not make a Federal award to an applicant until the applicant has complied with all applicable unique entity identifier and SAM requirements and, if an appli cant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time the agency is ready to make an award, it may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a Federal award and use that determination as a basis for making a Federal award to another applicant. Entities must obtain a DUNS or UEI and register in SAM prior to registering with Grants.gov. A description of each is below. Entities are strongly encouraged to apply early for their SAM registration. System for Award Management (SAM) Registrati on: To register, go to: https://www.sam.gov . The Federal Service Desk is available for registration assistance and can be contacted via the Help tab at the website listed above. Awarding agency staff cannot support applicants regarding DUNS/UEI or SAM issues. The Government intends to replace the D -U-N-S\u00ae number with a \"new, non- proprietary identifier\" requested in, and assigned by S AM.gov. This new identifier is being called the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI ), or the Entity ID. See Planned UEI Updates in Grant Application Forms for UEI updates . j. Support Letters - The applicant organization must provide letters of support from all project partners identified in the project narrative. Additional letters of support from organizations or individuals not directly involved in the project, which demonstrate past succes s of the applicant's activities may also be provided. k. A resume for the lead project administrator is also required. The lead project administrator is the individual assuming primary oversight of the project. It may or may not be a princip al investigator. Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 25 of 35 4.

Intergovernmental Review This funding opportunity is not subject to Executive Order 12372, \"Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.\" 6. Funding Restrictions Funds may not be used to pay any of the following costs unless otherwise permitted by law and approved in writing by the agency in advance of incurring such costs : a. Costs above the amount of funds authorized for the project. b. Costs incurred prior to the effective date of the award, including time spent applying for this opportunity . c. Costs which lie outside the scope of the approved project and amendments Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 26 of 35 thereto . d. Entertainment costs, regardless of their apparent relationship to project objectives . e. Compensation for injuries to persons, or damage to property arising out of project activities . f. Consulting services performed by a Federal employee during official duty hours when such consulting services result in the payment of additional compensation to the employee . g. Capital expenditures for general purpose equipment, buildings, and land, and for improvements to land, buildings, or equipment which materially increase their value or us eful life. See 2 CFR 200.439 for additional information. h. Management fees and profit. Any funds awarded to for -profit entities must be used for reimbursement of award related direct and indirect costs only . i. Meals may be charged to an award only if they are necessary for the performance of the project . For instance, m eals (normally only lunch) that are a necessary part of the costs of meetings and conferences (i.e., required attendance and continuity of a meeting), the primary purpose of which is the diss emination of information, are allowable , as are costs of transportation, rental of facilities, speakers' fees, and other items incidental to such meetings or conferences. Note: m eals consumed while in official travel status do not fall in this category ; they are considered to be per diem expenses and should be reimbursed in accordance with the organization's established travel policies subject to statutory limitations or in accordance with Federal travel policies . j. Costs normally charged as indirect costs may not be charged as direct cost s without proper justification and agency approval. Proper justification includes documentation that the costs meet the criteria for allowability (see 2 CFR 200.403). Examples of such costs include r ent, utilities, depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, and general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, and accounting. k. Salaries that are not commensurate with level of work . All costs must be reasonable to be allowable ( 2 CFR 200. 403), and 2 CFR 200.404 defines a reasonable cost as one if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur the cost. Salaries determined not to be reasonable compared to the level of work will be unallowable . This list is not exhaustive . For additional information please refer to 2 CFR Part 200, subpart E, Cost Principals. Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 27 of 35 Funding will be provided on a reimbursable basis based on benchmarks for each project. Advances may be considered in limited circumstances particularly for small and underserved entities consistent with 2 CFR 200 . 7. Indirect costs limitations a. To be eligible to recover any indirect cost under a Federal award, reci pients must either 1) have a current negotiated indirect cost rate agreement (NICRA) with a Federal agency that has not expired; or 2) qualify for use of the de minimis rate authorized by 2 CFR 200.414(f). A State, local, or tribal governmental department or agency unit that receives more than $35 million in direct Federal funding is not eligible for the de minimis rate. b. Applicants that have a current NICRA must calculate indirect costs using the rate and base specified in their NICRA. A recipient may voluntarily reduce or waive recovery of indirect costs at its sole discretion and must not be encouraged or coerced in any way to do so by the agency. A copy of the applicant's current NICRA must be provid ed with the application. I ndirect costs may not be recovered under an expired NICRA . c. Recipients are prohibited from shifting unallowable indirect costs to another Federal award unless specifically authorized to do so by legislation. E. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION 1. Review and Selection Process Applications will be screened for completeness and compliance with the provisions of this notice . Incomplete, noncompliant, and/or applications not meeting the formatting criteria may be eliminated from competition . In that event, the agency will send n otification of elimination to the applicant . The agency intends to select and award without conducting any discussions or allowing applicants to correct deficiencies or omissions in their applications . Consequently, applicants must ensure their applications are complete and accurate . However, while the agency intends to select without contacting applicants, it reserves the right to request applicants to revise their applications to correct deficiencies or omissions it identifie s. If this occurs , the agency will conduct discussions with all applicants , identify deficiencies and omissions for all, and give applicants an opportunity to submit a revised application by a common cut -off date . The agency may also contact individual applicants to clarify certain components of their application s. Merit/technical reviews will be conducted by a technical review board nominated by the approving official. Risk reviews will be conducted by the FPAC Business Center, Grants and Agreements Division . The approving official will make the final award decisions . The approving official for this opportunity is the FPAC Under Secretary . A multi -phase approval process may be utilized if determined necessary by the approving official. Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 28 of 35 2. Merit/Technical Criteria In general, all proposals will be evaluated at minimum on the following primary evaluation criteria and sub -criteria as drafted below. For applications in the second funding pool (under $5 million ), equity and outreach criteria will be weighted more heavily. a. Benefits Associated with the Production of Climate -Smart Commodities i. Projected benefits from GHG mitigation and carbon sequestration from ongoing or new on- farm practices associated with the production of climate -smart commodities (bolded to emphasize that this criterion is weig hted most heavily in first funding pool ) ii. Anticipated GHG benefits associated with the production of climate - smart commodities per farm, per project, per commodity produced, per dollar expended iii. Anticipated longevity of GHG benefits associated with the project iv. (Non -GHG) E nvironmental co-benefits (e.g., water quality, soil quality, localized air pollution, wildlife habitat) of climate -smart commodity production v. Climate adaptation benefits of climate -smart commodity production b. CSAF Market Development for Climate -smart Commodities i. Scalability ii. Likelihood of long -term viability beyond project period iii. Ability to inform future USDA actions to encourage climate -smart commodities iv. Ability to help producers realize greater market returns by overcom ing barriers to adopting CSAF practices , including estimated market returns to participating producers. c. Equity/E nvironmental Justice (EJ)/Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) Reach (weigh ted most heavily in the second funding pool) i. Economic benefits for producers, including underserved producers ii. Proposed number of underserved producers to be enrolled iii. Partnerships with EJ/MSI/equity/small farmer representation organizations d. Project Management Proposal i. Budget proposal ii. Estimated GHG benefits from the production of climate -smart commodities per dollar invested Note: T he size, complexity and diversity of operations reached will be consider ed in weighing this factor . Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 29 of 35 iii. Innovative collaborations/partnerships among organizations iv. Prior experience/confidence in the team e. Technical proposal i. Measuring, monitoring , and reporting plan: A. Project's contribution to advancing supply chain tracing and incentive structures, B. Completeness and credibility of m easurement /quantification , monitoring , tracking and verification approach C. Innovati on in approaches to quantification, monitoring and verification of GHG benefits associated with specific CSAF practices. D. Project's direct benefit to producers, particularly small and historically underserved producers. ii. Approach to reducing transaction costs iii. Technical assistance plan iv. Producer reach/number of producers targeted to be enrolled v. Consideration of how proposal fits into broad portfolio of funding opportunity (underserved, commodity type, etc.) Diversity of applications, including geographic diversity and size and scale of projects , will be considered when making award decisions. The Biden -Harris Administration issued EO 14036 on \"Promoting Competition in the American Economy\" in July 2021 and is committed to selecting a variety of projects s uch that this emerging marketplace starts out with robust competition and options for producers. USDA is committed to equity and environmental justice in program delivery and explicitly seeks to ensure that all projects provide direct, meaningful benefits to a representative cross -section of production agriculture, including small and/or historically underserved producers, consistent with Justice40 and other related initiatives. Administrative and Risk Criteria Notice of selection after merit/technical evaluation does not guarantee that an applicant will receive an award . Following notification of selection for funding (see Section F), the FPAC Business Center, Grants and Agreements Division' s staff conducts a final administrative a nd risk review of those applications. The administrative review includes, but is not limited to, a check to ensure that NFO requirements were met (e.g., applicant meets eligibility criteria, application was submitted via Grants.gov by the established deadl ine), and proposed costs are allowable, allocable, and necessary. During this process, it may be necessary to request further documentation from the applicant (e.g., organizational information as part of the risk assessment, more detail regarding proposed costs). Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 30 of 35 In addition, to comply with the requirements at 2 CFR 200.20 6, the agency will follow, at a minimum, the risk review process described below (additional steps may be taken) . The awarding agency will check SAM to ensure the applicant is not suspende d or debarred, which would preclude receiving an award . In addition, prior to making a Federal award with a total Federal share greater than the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000), the agency must review and consider any information about the appl icant that is in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (the Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System, FAPIIS) (see 41 USC 2313 and 2 CFR 200.206 (a)). An applicant must meet the following standards to be considered for award: a. Financial Stability The applicant maintains an adequate financial resources or cash flow to meet its financial obligations on a routine basis in order to successfully complete any agreement it may be awar ded. b. Quality of Management Systems and Ability to meet Management Standards prescribed in 2 CFR Part 200 The applicant has a financial management system adequate to segregate and track federal funds. It has adequate systems in place for proper agreement administration ; compliance with the standards outlined in 2 CFR Part 200 Subpart D for procurement, property, and records management; and required financial and performance reporting. c. History of Performance If the applicant has previously obtained Federal financial assistance award, it has never failed to materially comply with the Federal award terms and conditions and further , that it has never had an award terminated on that basis. Submission o f an application constitutes certification that an applicant meets these standards (items a. through c . above) . The agency may request documentation to substantiate the certification. Based on risk assessment, the agency may impose spe cific award conditions in accordance with 2 CFR 200.208 . 4. Awards Over the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (if applicable) a. Prior to making a Federal award with a total Federal share greater than the simplified acquisiti on threshold ($250,000) , the agency must review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM, the Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information Syste m (FAPIIS ). FAPIIS is a federal database intended to serve as a government -wide source of information about the prior performance and compliance of federal Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 31 of 35 procurement contractors, grantees, and cooperative agreement holders (see 41 U.S.C. 2313 and 2 CFR 200.206 (a)). b. An applicant may review information in FAPIIS accessible through SAM and comment on any information about it that a Federal awarding agency previously entered . c. The agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the other information in FAPIIS , in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR 200.20 6, Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants. F. FEDERAL AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION 1. Federal Award Notices The agency will provide notice that an application has been selected before it actually makes the Federal award. As such, the selection notification is not an authorization to begin performance. Any pr e-award costs incurred by the awardee will not be reimbursed . The N otice of Grant and Agreement Award (ADS -093) signed by the authorized agency official is the only authorizing document and will be provided electro nically to the entity's authorized official for signature. 2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements All project funds will be used in accordance with 2 CFR Part 200 and the General Terms and Conditions , which are available at the following website: https://www.fpacbc.usda.gov/about/grants -and-agreements/award -terms -and- conditions/index.html . Projects performed pursuant to this opportunity may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). For a ny project that involves on-the-ground activities undertaken by partners and agricultural producers following the issuance of the award, but prior to any ground disturbing activities related to the Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities project, the awardee must work with the local Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS ) field office to complete an Environmental Evaluation (EE) related to each individual producer 's activities under the project. Based on the outcome of the EE, the project may proceed as planned, proceed under an alternative designed to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse impacts, or awardees may be requ ired to prepare or pay for preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS), should the EE find that an EA or EIS is required. In addition, should the outcome of the EE require it, a National Historic Preservation Ac t (NHPA), Section 106 review and consultation by an NRCS State or area office with consulting parties (such as the pertinent State Historic Preservation Officer and federally recognized Indian Tribes) may be required prior Partnerships for Climate -Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity Page 32 of 35 to the implementation of project activities that have the potential to impact cultural resources. NHPA Section 106, its implementing regulations (36 CFR Part 800), and other related authorities, require Federal agencies to determine if a project has the potential to cause an effect to his toric properties and, if so, if they are adverse and how the effects may be addressed. The NHPA review and compliance in accordance with S ection 106 of NHPA and implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 800 must be completed by NRCS and applicants may be required to pay for any cultural resource surveys needed for NRCS to assess project effects. More information on the applicant's role in the NHPA Section 106 process can be found on the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation website at consultation with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and/or the National Marine Fisheries Service under the Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is also required for projects that may affect listed or proposed species or destroy or modify critical habitat. The ESA consultation in accordance with Section 7 of the ESA and implementing regulations at 50 CFR Part 402 must be completed by NRCS prior to the implementation of project activities that have the potential to impact species or habitat protected under the ESA. More information on the Section 7 consultation process can be found at https://www.fws.gov/endangered/what- we-do/consultations -overview.html . Allocation of rights to patents, inventions, and copyrights shall be in accordance with 2 CFR Part 200. This regulation provides that small businesses normally may retain the principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed with USDA support. In accordance with 2 CFR Part 200, this provision will also apply to commercial organizations for the purposes of this funding opportunity . USDA receives a royalty -free license for federal use, reserves the right to require the patentee to license others in c ertain circumstances, and requires that anyone exclusively licensed to sell the invention in the United States must normally manufacture it domestically. With regard to copyright, the grant recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was acquired, under an award. USDA reserves a royalty -free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for federal purposes and to authorize others to do so. All tools produc ed must meet the accessibility of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) requirements as specified in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105- 220).

All costs (both Federal and any required non- Federal cost -sharing/match) that are part of an award must be: allowable ( 2 CFR ). A thor ough budget narrative will aid the administrative review and processing of a recommended award. Amounts included in a budget and budget narrative are estimates; in the event of an award, payments will be based on actual expenditures. The following is guida nce for your use in preparing a thorough budget narrative. The guidance follows the order of the budget items. COST -SHARING/MATCHING: If required, you must provide the information below for the Federal portion of costs and separately provide the informati on below with the same level of detail for the cost -sharing/matching portion, as applicable, as part of the budget narrative. PERSONNEL - Only include employees of applicant organization This category includes salaries and wages of personnel of the applic ant organization (i.e., employees) that will be working directly on the project. For each individual, identify their role and describe their contributions to the project. Also include their annual salary, percent of effort, and the period of time they will contribute to the project along with the associated funds requested for support. The following format is an appropriate way to provide the information. Mr. Jones - Project Director. Accountable for assuring that all project activities are carried out in a timely, cost -efficient and responsible manner. He will provide oversight of daily activities and lead and direct the project toward accomplishment of the objectives of the project. He is responsible for the submission of the required reports. Salary % effort Project Duration Funds Requested $50,000 25% 12 months $12,500 FRINGE BENEFITS - Only related to salaries identified under Personnel Fringe benefits include, but are not limited to, the costs of leave (e.g., vacation, family - related, sick or military), employee insurance, pensions, and unemployment benefit plans. Also, see 2 CFR 200.431 , Compensation -Fringe Benefits. Provide information about how fringe benefits are determined along with the amount requested. For instance: Amt. Requested Fringe benefi ts - 25% of salaries and wages ($12,500 @ 25%). $3,125 TRAVEL Refer to your organization's travel policy for guidance on how to arrange travel. If your organization lacks a policy, it is expected that you follow the U.S. federal government policy, see http:// www.gsa.gov/federaltravelregulation . For the budget narrative, identify the total funds requested for travel. Provide as much detail as possible including purpose, destination, dates of travel, and number of individuals for each trip. If the dates of trav el are not known, specify estimated length of trip. Identify what will be followed (e.g., organizational travel policies or government per diem rates). The following are a few examples of how to provide the information. 2 people - travel to Washington D.C. once per year for a two -day meeting [identify purpose of meeting]. Airfare $800 x 2 for airfare = $1,600 Airport parking = $64 Hotel for 3 nights x 2 @ $200 = $1,200 Meals for 2 days x 2 = $24; Rental car for 3 days @ $110/day = $330 Total for trip: $3,439 Local travel for project manager is calculated at .50 per mile throughout primary service area x 326 miles/month x 12 months = $1,956. EQUIPMENT Equipment is defined as an item of property that has an acquisition cost of $5,000 or mo re (unless the organization has established lower levels) and an expected service life of more than one year. List each item of equipment along with the applicable cost. Include justification of its need in accomplishing the goals of the project. Example: To complete objectives #1 and #2, Refrigerated Trailer is required. XYZ Refrigerated Trailer, Model #123, at $5,555 These costs should only include the costs to purchase new equipment. The cost of renting or leasing equipment is not to be included in this category but instead, include under the Contractual category. If equipment is costly, include a lease vs purchase comparison in the budget narrative in support of route chosen. SUPPLIES Supplies is defined in 2 CFR 200. 1 as all tangible personal property other than those described in 2 CFR 200. 1 Equipment. A computing device is a supply if the acquisition cost is less than the lesser of the capitalization level established by the non -Federal entity for financial statement purposes or $5,000, regardless of the length of its useful life. Suggest also viewing 2 CFR 200.453 , Materials and Supplies Costs, Including Costs of Computing Devices, regarding the allowability of costs. Indicate general categories of expendable supplies including an amount for each category. Caution: If a category is viewed as too general or the associated amount is too high, further itemization may be requested. Therefore, use good judgement in determining the level of detail to provide. Example: General office supplies $50/mo. x 12 mo. = $600 Postage $37/mo. x 8 mo. = $296 Laptop Computer 1 x $900 = $900 Printer 1 x $300 = $300 Projector 1 x $900 = $900 Copies 8000 copies x .10/copy = $800 CONTRACTUAL This category includes consultants, subcontracts, etc. Consultants -- List the total costs for all consultant services. Ident ify each consultant, the services he/she will perform, total number of days, rate of pay, travel costs, per diem, and total estimated costs. Contract -- A contract is defined in 2 CFR 200. 1 as a legal instrument by which a non -Federal entity purchases property or services needed to carry out the project or program under a Federal award. The term as used in this part does not inclu de a legal instrument, even if the non-Federal entity considers it a contract, when the substance of the transaction meets the definition of a Federal award or subaward (see \u00a7200. 1 Subaward). Explain the need for each agreement and how their use will support the purpose and goals of the project. For each contract, describe the associated activities, scope of work or services to be provided and how the costs were estimated. If budgeting for a procurement action, document if a solicitation process has oc curred or if the contract will be a sole source. Example: ABC Company: Training $250/individual x 3 staff 5 days = $ 750 Amy White to provide Technical Assistant Services 1FTE @ $25,000 + 20% Fringe Benefits of $5,000 = $30,000 Travel at 2,000 miles @ .50 per mile = $ 1,000 Training course $ 175 Supplies @ $42.50 x 12 months = $ 510 Telephone @ $40 x 12 months = $ 480 $32,165 John Doe, Consultant $40 per hour x 220 hours for 12 month period = $ 8,800 To Be Announced Outreach Coordinator Annual salary $30,000 x 10% level of effort/12 months = $ 3,000 CONSTRUCTION Construction efforts are to be included under this category with the same level of detail as described under the \"Other\" category below. OTHER Costs not fitting under one of the other categories are to be included under this category. The level of detail is to be commensurate with other categories. Subawards should be included in this category. Per 2 CFR 200. 1, a subaward is an award provided by a pass -through entity to a subrecipient for the subrecipient to carry out part of a Federal award received by the pass - through e ntity. It does not include payments to a contractor or payments to an individual that is a beneficiary of a Federal program. A subaward may be provided through any form of legal agreement, including an agreement that the pass -through entity considers a con tract. Example: Outreach Workshop Rental of facilities ($750/2 days) $1,500 Information technology services $ 400 Training packets (approx. 125/$40 each) $5,000 Total $6,900 Note: Percentage for contingencies is not an allowable cost. INDIRECT 2 CFR 200. 1 defines Indirect (F&A) costs as those costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective, and not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefitted, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. To facilitate equitable distribution of indirect expenses to the cost objec tives served, it may be necessary to establish a number of pools of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) cost pools must be distributed to benefitted cost objectives on bases that will produce an equitable result in consideration of relative benefits deriv ed. This cost category guidance includes several components: Calculation (This is to be included as part of the budget narrative) Indirect Cost Rates o Negotiated Rate o 10% De Minimis Rate Limitation (i.e., indirect cost cap) Unrecovered Indirect Costs for Cost -sharing/Match Voluntarily Reduce/Waive Calculation. If indirect costs are requested as part of the proposed budget, you must provide details used in determining the indirect costs requested. For instance, provide the calculation specifying the amounts used in applying the base (the base specified in the applicable rate agreement) by the applicable rate (see indirect cost rate info below as well as Limitation section). The calculation can be displayed in different formats but must capture the components (i.e., amounts used in applying the base and the applica ble rate). EXAMPLE 1: For purposes of this example, the recipient uses the 10% de minimis indirect cost rate (10% of Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC)). MTDC means all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, service s, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of each subaward. MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward in e xcess of $25,000. Budget Indirect Eligible Amounts Salaries and wages $50,000 $50,000 Materials and supplies 3,000 3,000 Equipment 5,500 -0- Subaward 30,000 25,000 $78,000 x 10% = $7,800 Indirect Costs EXAMPLE 2: For purposes of this example, the recipient has a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) of 20% with a base of salaries and fringe benefits. Budget Indirect Eligible Amounts Salaries and wages $50,000 $50,000 Fringe Benefits 10,000 10,000 Materials and supplies 3,000 -0- Equipment 5,500 -0- Subaward 30,000 -0- $60,000 x 20% = $12,000 Indirect Costs Indirect costs may only be recovered if the non- Federal entity has one of the foll owing indirect cost rates. 1. Negotiated Rate: If the organization has a current NICRA established with the cognizant Federal agency (the agency that provides the most funds to the organization), then provide a copy of the NICRA; expired rates are not accept able. If unable to obtain a current negotiated rate from the cognizant agency, you are permitted to opt to use the 10% de minimis cost rate (you may only be reimbursed for allowable direct cost). Violation of cost accounting principles is not permitted whe n re-budgeting or charging costs to awards. Rather, costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs. Along with a copy of the NICRA, include the rate and base as part of the budget narrative. Example: Rate 24.87% of MTDC - 24.87% app lied to the following items: $97,300 of Personnel, $23,352 of Fringe, $110,000 of other, and the first $25,000 of three (3) subawards = $76,015.65 indirect costs 2. 10% De Minimis Cost Rate: In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(f) , any non -Federal entities, unless excepted, may elect to forgo calculation of an indirect cost rate and request a 10% de minimis indirect cost rate. The 10% de minimis rate is applied to modified total direct costs (MTDC). For this purpose, MTDC means total direct costs related to the award, such as direct labor, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, publications, consultant services and trave l costs. MTDC excludes the following costs: equipment, capital expenditures, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward and subcontract in excess of $25,000. Violation of cost accounting principles is not permitted when charging costs to awards. Rather, costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs. If the 10% de minimis option is chosen, it must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time you choose to negotiate for a rate, which you may apply to do at any time. If the organization previously opted for the de minimis rate, a copy of the rate agreement must be provided. If the organization is currently electing the de minimis rate, use an indirect cost rate of no more than 10% of MTDC when preparing the budget. If selected for award, a de minimis rate agreement will be executed along with the award, as appropriate. Example: Rate 10% of MTDC - 10% applied to the following items: $45,000 of Personnel, $10,800 of Fringe, and $59,000 of Other = $11,480 i ndirect costs Limitation: Some programs may not allow the recovery of indirect costs. In such instances, the limitation flows down to subcontractors. Refer to the applicable notice of funding opportunity to determine if indirect costs are unallowable. USDA appropriation acts limit indirect costs to 10 percent for cooperative and contribution agreements with nonprofit entities; for purposes of this limitation \"nonprofit entities\" includes institutions of higher education. For agreements subject to this limitation first apply the 10 percent indirect cost rate to the agreement's total direct costs; this is shown on line 6.i of the SF424A. Then calculate indirect costs using the rate and the direct cost application base specified in the recipient's NICRA. U se whichever rate results in the lower amount. If the organization has a NICRA, both the NICRA calculation and the 10% TDC must be completed in order to determine the lesser (i.e., maximum allowed indirect costs) for the applicable project. Calculation in structions: First, multiply the NICRA rate by the base stated in the NICRA to arrive at Amount A. Next, multiply the statutory limit of 10% by TDC to arrive at Amount B. The lower of Amount A and B is the maximum amount of allowable indirect cost, therefo re include this amount on the budget. Unrecovered Indirect Costs for Cost -sharing/Match: 2 CFR 200.306(c) provides, \"Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing or matching may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. Unrecovered indirect cost means th e difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could have been charged to the Federal award under the non- Federal entity's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.\" Voluntarily Reduce/Waive: A recipient may voluntarily re duce or waive recovery of indirect costs at its sole discretion and must not be encouraged or coerced in any way to do so by the agency. If o rganizations waive indirect cost recovery and request only direct costs, the organization is required to include in the award budget only those types of costs consistently treated as direct costs by the organization.
