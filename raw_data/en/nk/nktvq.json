[1](#ref1) bAdolescents (11 through 15 years of age) may receive either regimen: 3 x 5 mcg (pediatric formulation) or 2 x 10 mcg (adult formulation). cIf the suggested dose (10 mcg) is not available, the appropriate dosage can be achieved with two 5 mcg doses. However, the dialysis formulation may be used only for adult predialysis/dialysis patients. dSee also recommendations for revaccination of predialysis and dialysis patients in [Dosage and Administration (2.4)] of the Prescribing Information. RECOMBIVAX HB should not be administered in the gluteal region, as injections given in the buttocks have resulted in lower seroconversion rates than expected. ACIP=Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Reference Reference Reference Indications for RECOMBIVAX HB RECOMBIVAX HB\u00ae [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] is indicated for prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus. RECOMBIVAX HB is approved for use in individuals of all ages. RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulation is approved for use in adult predialysis and dialysis patients 18 years of age and older. Selected Safety Information for RECOMBIVAX HB Do not administer RECOMBIVAX HB\u00ae [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] to individuals with a history of severe allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis B-containing vaccine or to any component of RECOMBIVAX HB, including yeast. The vial stopper and the syringe plunger stopper and tip cap contain dry natural latex rubber, which may cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive individuals. Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. Decisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including RECOMBIVAX HB, to infants born prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant's medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. For RECOMBIVAX HB, this assessment should include consideration of the mother's hepatitis B antigen status and high probability of maternal transmission of hepatitis B virus to infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive if vaccination is delayed. Hepatitis B vaccination should be delayed until 1 month of age or hospital discharge in infants weighing <2000 g if the mother is documented to be HBsAg negative at the time of the infant's birth. Infants weighing <2000 g born to HBsAg positive or HBsAg unknown mothers should receive vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) in accordance with ACIP recommendations if HBsAg status cannot be determined. Hepatitis B virus has a long incubation period. RECOMBIVAX HB may not prevent hepatitis B infection in individuals who have an unrecognized hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccination. Vaccination with RECOMBIVAX HB may not protect all individuals. In healthy infants and children (up to 10 years of age), injection site reactions and systemic adverse reactions were reported following 0.2% and 10.4% of the injections, respectively. The most frequently reported systemic adverse reactions (>1% injections), in decreasing order of frequency, were irritability, fever, diarrhea, fatigue/weakness, diminished appetite, and rhinitis. In a study that compared the 3-dose regimen (5 mcg) with the 2-dose regimen (10 mcg) of RECOMBIVAX HB in adolescents, the overall frequency of adverse reactions was generally similar. In a group of studies involving healthy adults, injection site reactions and systemic adverse reactions were reported following 17% and 15% of the injections, respectively. The following adverse reactions were reported (1% of injections) injection site reactions, fatigue/weakness, headache, fever, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, pharyngitis, and upper respiratory infection. Adverse Reactions Post-Marketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been reported with the use of the marketed vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to a vaccine exposure. Dosage and Administration The vaccination regimen for RECOMBIVAX HB for persons from birth through 19 years of age consists of a series of 3 doses (0.5 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. The vaccination regimen for RECOMBIVAX HB for adolescents 11 through 15 years of age consists of a series of 3 doses (0.5 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule, or a series of 2 doses (1.0 mL each) on a 0- and 4- to 6-month schedule. The vaccination regimen for RECOMBIVAX HB for persons 20 years of age and older consists of a series of 3 doses (1.0 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. The deltoid muscle is the preferred site for intramuscular injection for adults, adolescents, and children 1 year of age and older whose deltoid is large enough for intramuscular injection. The anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the preferred site for intramuscular injection for infants younger than 1 year of age. RECOMBIVAX HB should not be administered in the gluteal region, as injections given in the buttocks have resulted in lower seroconversion rates than expected. Consider subcutaneous administration only in persons who are at risk of hemorrhage following intramuscular injections. Predialysis and Dialysis Adult Patients: The vaccination regimen for RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulation for adults on predialysis and dialysis consists of a series of 3 doses (1.0 mL each) given on a 0-,1-, and 6-month schedule. Consider a booster dose or revaccination with RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulation (blue color code) in predialysis/dialysis patients if the anti-HBs level is less than 10 mIU/mL at 1 to 2 months after the third dose. The duration of the protective effect on RECOMBIVAX HB in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present and the need for booster doses is not yet defined. RECOMBIVAX HB should be administered as soon as possible after being removed from refrigeration. Use in Special Populations Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies designed to evaluate RECOMBIVAX HB in pregnant women. Available post-approval data do not suggest an increased risk of miscarriage or major birth defects in women who received RECOMBIVAX HB during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Data are not available to assess the effects of RECOMBIVAX HB on the breastfed infant or on milk productions/excretion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for RECOMBIVAX HB and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RECOMBIVAX HB or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of RECOMBIVAX HB Dialysis Formulation in children have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of RECOMBIVAX HB did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, in later studies it has been shown that a diminished antibody response can be expected in persons older than 60 years of age. In addition, the responses to these vaccines may be lower if the vaccine is administered as a buttock injection. Predialysis and Dialysis Patients Predialysis and dialysis adult patients respond less well to hepatitis B vaccines than do healthy individuals; however, vaccination of adult patients early in the course of their renal disease produces higher seroconversion rates than vaccination after dialysis has been initiated. Known or Presumed Exposure to HBsAg Refer to recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and to the package insert for hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for management of persons with known or presumed exposure to the hepatitis B virus (eg, neonates born of infected mothers or persons who experienced percutaneous or permucosal exposure to the virus). When recommended, administer RECOMBIVAX HB and HBIG intramuscularly at separate sites (eg, opposite anterolateral thighs for exposed neonates) as soon as possible after exposure. Before administering RECOMBIVAX HB, please read the accompanying [Prescribing Information](http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/r/recombivax_hb/recombivax_pi.pdf).
