Cell ...and unlocks the \"doorway\" to the cell so that glucose can enter and be used for energy Cell CellSometimes, in type 2 diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin......or it's harder for insulin to open the cells' doorways \u2014 this is called insulin resistance! Cell28How is weight and activity involved? I make insulin!I store sugar, and I also give sugar to the body29How is weight and activity involved? Pancreas \u2014 Insulin Factory Liver \u2014Glucose warehouseAdditional weight, and reduced physical activity, increase insulin resistance...which means MORE sugar in the bloodstream\"That's fine. I'll just make more insulin! Whew! Getting tired over here!\" \"No worries. I can store the excess sugar. Oh, shoot! Fat is taking up all my storage space\" \"Muscle to the rescue!
