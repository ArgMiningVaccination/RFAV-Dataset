In ancient times, the use of essential oils was called Perfumery and has always been closely related to healing and medicinal practices. This craft also became known as alchemy and was used by ancient priests and priestesses in their healing ceremonies. It was believed that the \"lifeblood\" of the plant was the oil and the \"spirit\" was the plant's alcohol. When it comes to essential oils, it is best to get these precious materials from the purest, most organic sources the planet has to offer, while also being mindful of the environment and fair trade practices.
