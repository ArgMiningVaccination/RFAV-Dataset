Milburn, PhD The Future of Healing Defined for nea rly a century by a biomedical model, health care in the United States is now in transition. Although biomedicine continues as the dominant model in 21st centuryWestern culture, the widespread use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) signals a major shift. Nearly half of Americans use CAM\u2014often in conjunction with conven- tional care (Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Barnes, Pow ell-Griner, McFann, & Nahin, 2004), and this trend is likely to continue (Kessler, et al., 2001). The appeal of these non-conventional therapies is understandable. They appear to offer what biomedicine does not: a holistic approach to healing; treatments for chronic pain and illness that are often accessible, low-tech, and inexpensive; and a focus on disease prevention and optimal health. Exploring the reasons for the growing use and popularity of many alternative therapiesmay provide clues to the limitations of the cur rent system as well as indicate future directions for health care. Although the United States leads the world in health technology and biomedical research, these undeniable accomplishments do not appear to translate into better health. Chronic, systemic,and degenerative diseases are now the predominant concerns facing our society, and biomedicine's record is poor with respect to health care access, humanistic care, and eff ective treatment of chronic disease (Starfield, 2000). Mounting pressure from the public and dissatisfaction of health- care professionals are signs of the growing strain on the biomedical paradigm. Increasingly, conventional health care professionals acknowledge that the public's interest in complementary and alternative medicine is more than a passing phenomenon (Kessler, et al., 2001), and that they have a responsibility to become better acquainted with CAM philosophies, therapies, and practitioners. There is also a growing appreciation of the need to understand theimplications\u2014in terms of safety and efficacy\u2014of the interaction between alternative and conven- tional forms of care (Curtis, 2004).THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20042 seeking a third path The convergence of conventional and complementary and alternative medicine presents a complex challenge to the health care community. Although the popularity and apparent effective- ness of many CAM therapies tend to highlight the deficiencies of conventional care, few would deny the great strengths of the biomedical system or argue that CAM should totally supplantconventional care. Nor is it possible, even if desirable, to simply adopt CAM into mainstream medicine. First of all, despite many commonly held values ( see Table 1 ), \"CAM\" is not one approach, but many\u2014 an exceptionally wide variety of healing philosophies, systems, and therapies (Curtis & Gaylord,2004). Further, mainstream health care providers\u2014deeply committed to a methodical, scientific approach\u2014express a legitimate desire for proof of safety and efficacy of these unfamiliar theo- ries and practices. Thus, a tension exists between two different healing worlds\u2014arising not only from di- verse therapeutic approaches, but from fundamentally different beliefs about science and healing.TABLE 1TABLE 1TABLE 1TABLE 1TABLE 1 PRINCIPLES EMPHASIZED IN IN MANYPRINCIPLES EMPHASIZED IN MANYPRINCIPLES EMPHASIZED IN MANYPRINCIPLES EMPHASIZED IN MANY COMPLEMENTCOMPLEMENTCOMPLEMENTCOMPLEMENTCOMPLEMENT ARY ARY ARY ARY ARY &&&&& AL AL AL AL ALTERNTERNTERNTERNTERN AAAAATIVE THERAPIESTIVE THERAPIESTIVE THERAPIESTIVE THERAPIESTIVE THERAPIES While a disparate array of alternative therapies and healing systems fall under the umbrella term \"CAM,\" what they typically have in common are fundamental principles of health and healing. These principles are not unique to CAM(conventional medicine ascribes to some), nor do all CAM therapies embrace them equally. But, taken together,they provide a framework for understanding CAM approaches to healing that contrast with the biomedical model ofcare. Many CAM therapeutic systems emphasize some or all of the following principles to a greater degree thanconventional medicine. Effective integration of CAM and conventional care can rest on acknowledgment, apprecia-tion, and application of these principles in TINGTINGTINGTINGTING THETHETHETHETHE BODBODBODBODBODYYYYY'''''SSSSS SELFSELFSELFSELFSELF-----HEALINGHEALINGHEALINGHEALINGHEALING ABILITIESABILITIESABILITIESABILITIESABILITIES .....

The view presented here is that the creative tension produced by these converging cul- tures of healing provides a unique opportunity for a shift within biomedicine to a new, integrativehealth-care system\u2014a third path\u2014that acknowledg es and utilizes the accumulated wisdom and skill of many healing traditions. united states health care: where are we? Ultimately, the task facing United States health care today is to devise a better way of providinghealing services and promoting health for our society. Biomedicine's shortcomings show us the work to be done; CAM's strengths may help show us how. To see clearly where we might go, wemust review where we are and, in particular, note the special challenges we now face. Three fundamental questions guide that review. The first\u2014 Where are we ?\u2014can be an- swered by examining the two worlds of American health care: the dominant conventional health care system, and the emerging array of CAM care options. How \"healthy\" is our existing health care system? What are its underlying problems and wh at are its strengths? What are the motives and forces driving the growing trend to use CAM therapies? Is there a connection between prob- lems with conventional care and increased interest in alternative healing options? The second question\u2014 How are we challenged ?\u2014relates to the specific problems confront- ing healers right now at this time of transition. Questions about the safety and efficacy of CAMtherapies raise still more questions about the safety and efficacy of all therapies. The demands from mainstream health care for scientifically based, high-quality standards for alternative thera- pies increase the pressure for more and better research , including creative new research method- ologies and scientific hypotheses and access to funding sources. Finally, we begin the process of exploring What comes next . The 21st century health care system can become one that integrates the powerful research capabilities of biomedicine and the holistic healing approaches of CAM. The first ste ps along that path are to understand more fully the philosophies and techniques of various healing modalities, the barriers to change, the educa- tion and training required, and the costs and benefits of change. where are we now? Describing ours as a health care \"system\" is misleading. More accurately, health care in the UnitedStates is provided by a wide variety of non-integrated healing approaches. And, although its eco- nomic, political, and regulatory power predominates and thus influences the accessibility and roleof many CAM therapies, biomedicine does not coordinate health care. The result is a non-system that is at best confusing and at worst dangerous. Two major trends characterizing health care today are pertinent to this discussion. The first is the declining \"health\" of the conv entional health care system. The second is the significant and continuing increase in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). To under- stand \"where we are\" we must acknowledge the problems of conventional care, the appeal of CAM, and the complexities that arise as conventional health care and CAM converge.THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20044 the health of united states health care: what is ailing in conventional care? It is commonly acknowledged that western medical and public health practices have contributed to many of the 20th century advances in g lobal health, including prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, improved workplace safety, sanita tion, and life-saving surgical procedures. In some sense, biomedicine is one of western medicine's greatest triumphs. Pharmaceutical advancesand technological innovations such as organ transplants, microscopic surgery, in vitro fertilization, high-tech trauma care, and diagnostic tools\u2014to name a few\u2014have saved and extended lives, eradicated diseases, and offered hope and healthto millions. Nonetheless, there are signs and symp- toms of unhealthiness in our health care system. These include disappointing comparisons with other developed countries in health-status indi-cators, uneven access to care, increasingly imper- sonal care, high costs and high rates of error, and a variety of other negative side effects of our bio-medical industry (MacKay, 2003; Starfield, 2000). Indeed, the characteristics of biomedi- cine that contribute to its successes are also the source of its inadequacies. Enchantment withhigh-tech, pharmacological control of disease has resulted in relatively low interest in promoting health. Although public health measures and life-saving drugs and technologies have enhanced life expectancy in the United States, longer lives have not always led to healthier lives. There has been aconcomitant rise in chronic diseases that contrib- ute to sub-optimal healthy life expectancy, includ- ing cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, meta-bolic syndrome, arthritis, and obesity (Arias & Smith, 2003). While the U.S. is renowned for life-sav- ing technologies, there is less emphasis on and skill in the treatment and prevention of chronicillness. The Institute of Medicine's report Cross- ing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21 st Century states that the U.S. health care indus- try has \"foundered\" in its ability to provide safe, high quality care consistently to all Americans, but particularly to those with chronic conditions(IOM, 2001). The report recommends that healthEXEXEXEXEXCESSIVE USE OF PHARMACESSIVE USE OF PHARMACESSIVE USE OF PHARMACESSIVE USE OF PHARMACESSIVE USE OF PHARMA CEUTICCEUTICCEUTICCEUTICCEUTIC ALSALSALSALSALS One enormous cost in the health care system is gener- ated by the pharmaceutical industry. In any given week,50 percent of U.S. adults consume at least one pre- scription drug, with 7 percent consuming 5 or more. Of the highest using group, women 65 and older, 80 per-cent consume at least one prescription drug per week,with 23 percent consuming 5 or more (Kaufman, Kelly,Rosenberg, Anderson, & Mitchell, 2002). It is estimatedthat another 9 million people aged 12 and older use prescription drugs for non-medical reasons (Kaufman, et al., 2002). Chronic use of multiple medications oftentaxes the resources of patients and families, adding tothe overall cost of health care. One of the leading causes of death in the United States is from adverse reactions to FDA approved drugs. A 1998 study in JAMA , analyzing 39 studies conducted over 30 years, concluded that an average of 106,000 peopledie in hospitals each year from prescription medications, with the number rising to 140,000 per year when deaths outside the hospital are included (Lazarou, Pomeranz,& Corey, 1998). Adverse reactions to prescription drugsare the fourth leading cause of hospital admission inthe United States, and 2.2 million Americans are esti-mated to have suffered severe side effects from FDA approved drugs, at an estimated cost of $78 billion in 1997 (Lazarou, et al., 1998). Another side-effect of the pharmaceutical industry world- wide is the inappropriate overuse of antibiotics, which is contributing to the growth of antibiotic resistance(Swartz, 1997).UNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20045 care efforts focus more on improving care f or common, chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and asthma, currently the leading causes of disability and death in the United States, that consume significant proportions of health care resources. health-status indicators When compared with other developed countries on a range of health-status indicators, the United States fares significantly below average. The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO),comparing life expectancy among developed countries, found the United States ranking 17th in life expectancy at birth, and 19th in terms of infant mor tality rates. Moreover, in terms of healthy life expectancy (HALE), which adjusts life expectancy for time spent in poor health, the United States falls to 26th place, behind virtually every other developed countr y. For example, the Japanese, in first place, have a healthy life expectancy at birth of 73.6 years, compared with just 67.6 years in the United States (WHO, 2002). health-care costs These mediocre health-status indicators continue despite skyrocketing health-care costs. The United States spends more than $1.4 trillion dollars per year on health care\u201414 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product\u2014with no other nation spending more than 10 percent. Although these high costs have often been blamed on inefficiency, fraud, and the expense of malpracticesuits, a major factor is the high cost of investment in technology and personnel. The United States leads the world in expensive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging, coronary bypass surgery, and organ transplants. access to health care It is in regard to access to health car e that the high cost of high-tech medical care is felt most acutely. In spite of its large health care budget, the United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee health care to ever y citizen. Over 40 million working-age adults (almost 15 percent) have no health insurance and theref ore have extremely limited access to health care services (US Census Bureau, 2002). Ironically, because of their costs, the very best benefits of the system\u2014advanced surgical procedures such as or gan transplants, high-tech trauma care, and sophisticated therapies for life-threatening conditions\u2014are inaccessible to many of those who need them most. impersonal, disconnected care The emphasis on standardization of care has produced a system more focused on statis- tical averages and probabilities than on individual patients. Emphasis on technological expertiseoften sacrifices attention to patients' emotional needs. Treatment is often targeted to diagnosis and symptoms rather than individual patients' well-being. Furthermore, specialization in specific dis- eases and systems may result in patients' having to visit multiple providers who may not commu- nicate with each other effectively about the patients and treatments employed. The result may be an inefficient, fragmented system of care that is impersonal and frustrating to the patient seeking help (Halstead, 2001).THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20046 medical errors & adverse events The complexity of technological medicine with its requirement for extensive, specialized training, the potency of pharmaceutical products, and the potential for multiple providers and multiple prescriptions per patient, increase the system's vulnerability to medical error. One esti-mate is that the annual deaths from medical erro rs and medication errors exceed those from motor vehicle accidents or breast cancer, and are more than triple the deaths from AIDS (Kohn, Corrigan & Donaldson, 1999). The adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been estimated at 103,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths a year, as well as over $2 billion in costs (Wolfe, Lichtenstein, & Singh, 1999). A Kello gg Foundation study examined 30,195 patients in the United States and reported a 3.7 percent medical error rate. A 1998 meta-analysis of 39 prospec-tive studies reported adverse drug reactions(ADRs) occurring in 6.7 percent of hospitalized pa- tients. The authors estimated that, in 1994, 10,600 fatal ADRs occurred (Lazarou, et al., 1998). A 1999 Institute of Medicine study estimated that 225,000 ia trogenic deaths occur each year in the U.S. Of these, 12,000 deaths are associated with unnecessary surgery. The study also reported that of 106,000 non-error, adverse effects of drugs, 50 percent were preventable (Kohn, et al., 1999). dissatisfaction with the health care system & the search for options Signs of growing dissatisfaction with conventional health care include decreased job sat- isfaction among physicians and nurses (Landon, et al., 2002; McBride, 2002); large numbers of patient complaints (Simini, 1999); distrust of physicians (Thom, Bloch, & Segal, 1999); and soar- ing malpractice lawsuits, with concomitant malpractice-insurance rate increases for providers ( Medical Malpractice , 2003). The steady increase in alternative health care use may also indicate dissatisfac- tion with the dominant system (Kessler, et al., 2001). Nearly half of American adults use uncon- ventional health care modalities for at least some of their health care needs, visiting alternativetherapy practitioners more frequently than primary care physicians, even though much of this care is not covered by insurance (Eisenberg, et al., 1998). the health of united states health care: why CCCCCAMAMAMAMAM? Perhaps partly in response to the problems that beset conventional medicine, the last two decades have seen a remarkable increase in the use of complementary and alternative therapies. Since most CAM treatments are not covered by conventional insurance programs and must be paid for out-of- pocket, it is reasonable to conclude that patients are seeking such treatments because of their perceived benefits. The fact that CAM continues to be popular (Barnes, et al., 2004) suggests further that patients' expectations are being met. CAM, in short, appears to be providing services and outcomes that conventional medicine does not. It is important, therefore, to understand whois using CAM, why, and what these therapies offer. use of complementary & alternative health care in the united states Understanding CAM begins with an appreciation that the term is an umbrella concept for an eclectic array of healing modalities \"not presently considered an integral part of conventional medicine\" (NCCAM, 2002). These therapies include highly specialized methods such as biofeed-back, millennia-old practices such as meditation, and comprehensive traditional healing systemsUNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20047 such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, encompassing a wide variety of skills and training, with widely varying certification and licensure requirements. The reasons why these disparate therapies ar e currently outside of mainstream health care in the United States are numerous and complex. Ho wever, a brief summary of the evolution of health care in the 20th century is helpful in understanding the current situation. The dominant medical paradigm of biomedicine emerged during the 20th century with the successes of antibiot-ics and other life-saving drugs and technologies. These coincided with major achievements in public health. Industrialization and 20th century world wa rs may have popularized the metaphors of \"attacking\" disease, the powerful \"magic b ullet\" drug, and the mechanical model of the body, with parts that could be removed, repaired or replaced (Curtis & Gaylord, 2004). Focus on mate- rialism shifted attention away from appreciation and understanding of the energetic and spiritual nature of the human being. Pharmaceutical successes in allopathic treatments predominated overthe sometimes slower and gentler methods of homeopathic and other natural healing approaches. Research dollars and medical interest focused on the search for new drug therapies and better diagnostic and treatment technologies, and there w as little funding or motivation for research in natural, low-cost therapies. It is no wonder that many of these therapies, some popular for centu- ries, until recently lacked adequate scientific evidence of their efficacy or safety. In 1991, the Office of Alternative T herapies, under the National Institutes of Health, was created to investigate the increasingly popular and controversial phenomenon of alternative thera-pies. In 1997, this office was transformed into a Center, with a greatly enhanced research budget. The NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM, 2002) catego- rizes the vast variety of alternative therapeutic modalities into five broad areas: alternative medical systems \u0081mind-body interventions \u0081biologically based therapies \u0081manipulation and body-based methods \u0081energy therapies. While the NIH has popularized the acronym \"CAM\" for \"complementary and alternative therapies,\" some providers of \"alternative therapies\" object to this term, because it lumps their discipline together with other diverse therapies and may inappropriately imply some common attributes. Other professions object to the term CAM because the word \"medicine\" focuses on themedical profession, marginalizing other health professions such as nursing, pharmacy, public health and dentistry. The term \"complementary and alternative health care \" is broader and more inclusive of not only all the clinical health professions but also the systems that administer them. widespread use of complementary & alternative modalities For the last half century, there has been a consistently growing trend in the use of CAM, including, for example, acupuncture, chiropr actic, energy healing, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and massage; this trend is likely to continue (Kessler, et al., 2001; Wootton & Sparber, 2001). In the1998 Eisenberg, et al. study, overall CAM use was 42 percent, with the most frequently used therapies being relaxation techniques (16 percent), herbal medicine (12 percent), massage (11 per- cent), and chiropractic (11 percent). Folk remedies , energy healing, homeopathy, hypnosis, bio-THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20048 feedback and acupuncture were used less commonly. A more recent national survey, funded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), found that, in 2002, 35 percent of Americans used some form of CAM (excluding megavitamin therapy and prayer); 21 percent used biologically basedtherapies (excluding megavitamin therapy); 17 pe rcent used one or more forms of mind-body therapies (excluding prayer); 11 percent used manipulative and body-based therapies; 3 percent used alternative medical systems; and 0.5 percent used energy therapies (Barnes, et al., 2004). From 1990 to 1997, annual visits to alternative practitioners grew from 470 million to 629 million (Eisenberg, et al., 1998). Those estimated 629 million visits to complementary care providers far exceeded the 386 million visits to all U.S. primary-care physicians that year. Out-of- pocket expenditures for CAM therapies were an estimated $27 billion, comparable to those of allU.S. physician services.TTTTTABLE MEDICAL MEDICAL MEDICAL MEDIC AL CONDITIONS BY US ADULAL CONDITIONS BY US ADULAL CONDITIONS BY US ADULAL CONDITIONS BY US ADULAL CONDITIONS BY US ADUL TTTTTS, 1S, 1S, 1S, 1S, 1 999999999977777 (adapted from Eisenberg, et al., 1998) PERCENT PERCENT WHO SAW WHO SAW WHO USED WHO SAW MD & USED MD & CAM PERCENT CAM FOR CAM PR OVIDER CAM THERAPY PROVIDER WHO CONDITION FOR CONDITION FOR CONDITION FOR CONDITION MOST COMMONLY REPORTED IN PAST IN PAST IN PAST IN PAST USED THERAPIES CONDITION CONDITION 12 MONTHS 12 MONTHS 12 MONTHS` 12 MONTHS FOR THE CONDITION Back PrBack 4.2 28.0 6.4 Herbal; relaxation FFFFFatigueatigueatigueatigueatigue 16.7 27 .9 6.3 51.6 13.1 Relaxation; massage ArArArArArthritisthritisthritisthritisthritis 16.6 26.7 10.0 38.5 15.9 Relaxation; chiropractic High Blood PressureHigh Blood PressureHigh Blood PressureHigh Blood PressureHigh Blood Pressure 10.9 11.7 0.9 11.9 1.1 Megavitamins; relaxation Sprains or StrainsSprains or StrainsSprains or StrainsSprains or StrainsSprains or Strains 10.8 23.6 10.3 29.4 15.9 Chiropractic; relaxation InsomniaInsomniaInsomniaInsomniaInsomnia 9.3 herbal Skin PrSkin PrSkin PrSkin PrSkin Pr 8.6 6.7 2.2 6.8 0.0 Imagery; energy healing DigestivDigestivDigestivDigestivDigestiv e Pre Pre Pre Pre Problemsoblemsoblemsoblemsoblems 8.2 27.3 10.7 Relaxation; herbal SeSeSeSeSevvvvvere Depressionere Depressionere Depressionere Depression 5.6 40.9 15.6 40.9 26.9 Relaxation; spiritual healing AnxieAnxieAnxieAnxieAnxie ty Aty Aty Aty Aty Attacksttacksttacksttacksttacks 5.5 42.7 11.6 42.7 21.0 Relaxation; spiritual healing Weighted Average 28.2 11.4 31.8 13.7 Across All ConditionsUNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20049 conditions for which CCCCCAMAMAMAMAM therapies are used Medical conditions for which alternative ther apies are commonly used, as found in the Eisenberg, et al. (1998) study, are shown in Table 2 ( on page 8 ). The highest use was for back problems, allergies, fatigue, and arthritis; other conditions included headaches, neck problems, high blood pressure, sprains or muscle strains , insomnia, pulmonary problems, dermatological disorders, digestive disorders, depression and anxiety. The CDC study found that CAM was used most frequently to treat back problems, colds, neck problems, joint pain or stiffness, and anxiety ordepression (Barnes, et al., 2004). Perhaps the most significant finding of these reports is that complementary and alterna- tive modalities are often used, not instead of, but in addition to conventional care. This fact raises concerns for conventional clinicians and new challenges in health care. subgroups using CCCCCAMAMAMAMAM It is revealing to examine not only the numbers of Americans using CAM therapies, but the population sub-groups who regularly use these treatments and practices. Eisenberg's surveyfound CAM use was higher among women (49 percent) than men (38 percent); less common among African Americans (33 percent) than other racial groups (45 percent); and highest among the 35-49 year age group (50 percent) compared with older (39 percent) or younger (42 percent)age groups. Greater use was reported among those with college educations (51 percent) than with no college education (36 percent); and with annual incomes above $50,000 (48 percent) than with lower incomes (42 percent) (Eisenberg, et al., 1998). These statistics are similar to those found in the recent CDC study, where CAM (excluding pr ayer and megavitamin therapies) was used by 40 percent of females and 30 percent of males; by 26 percent of blacks, 36 percent of whites, 43 percent of Asians, 55 percent of Hispanics or Latino subgroups; and in higher proportions amongthose who had attended college. Although, overall, more highly educated and socioeconomically advantaged segments of the population use CAM, those with limited access\u2014both financial and geographic\u2014to conven- tional health services also are among those regularly using CAM. For example, those living inisolated, rural areas, particularly those who ar e impoverished, are often high users of folk rem- edies Sherman, 2004). A few studies have looked at CAM use in the United Stateswith a focus on other under-sampled, lower socioeconomic groups such as urban minorities (Rhee, Garg, & Hershey, 2004). Members of cultural minorities or new immigrants from other cultures in which CAM therapies have traditionally been practiced also use CAM regularly. For example, Native Americans living on reservations and Hispanic populations recently immigrated to the United States are high users of their traditional health systems (Marbella, Harris, Diehr, & Ignace, 1998; Pearl, Leo, & Tsang, 1995). reasons for the growing use of CCCCCAMAMAMAMAM modalities A number of factors influence patients to seek CAM services. In this information age there is increased awareness of other systems of care and greater public access to health informa-tion. Philosophical preferences also play a role: many are attracted to natural/organic productsTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200410 and treatments and to the philosophies and beliefs associated with many alternative practices (Astin, 1998; Giordano, Boatwright, Stapleton, & Huff, 2002). One national survey (Astin, 1998) found that for those 96 percent who used both CAM and conventional care, significant pre- dictors of use of CAM therapies (other than poor health status andhigher education) were primarily based on holistic values and be- lief systems. For example, those who agreed with the statement that \"the health of my body, mind and spirit are related, and whom-ever cares for my health should take that into account\" were more likely to use CAM (46 percent) than those who did not endorse this item (33 percent). Other significant predictors were having had a transfor- mational experience, and being a \"cultural creative\" (commitment to cultural change and innovation, including environmentalism and personal growth). These philosophical perspectives are found inmost CAM therapies. Thus, for users of CAM and conventional care, it is likely that congruence with the patient's values and phi- losophies of life is a motivator of CAM use. In the Astin (1998) survey, those who relied primarily on alternative forms of care were a minority (4 percent), and although the results must be interpreted with caution due to the smallsample size (45 people were in this subset), the following independent variables were significant predictors of use of CAM: \u0081Distrust of conventional physicians and hospitals, \u0081Desire for control over health matters, \u0081Dissatisfaction with conventional practitioners, and \u0081Belief in the importance and value of one's inner life and experiences. Here, education and health status were not significant predictors, nor was a holistic phi- losophy of health or being a cultural creative. T he Astin study's findings confirm results of earlier studies (e.g., Furnham & Smith, 1988) that found that subgroups whose health beliefs and phi- losophies differ from those of mainstream medicine, whether or not they are cultural minorities, are major users of alternative therapies. Common responses regarding perceived benefits of CAM indicate that people use CAM therapies because they feel that it works for their particular health problem, or that the CAMtreatment promotes health rather than just focusing on illness (Astin, 1998). Additionally, those who use CAM may be motivated to maximize wellness or enhance the likelihood of a successful health-care outcome. For example, particular CAM therapies, such as herbs, hypnosis, visualiza-tion, homeopathic remedies, or energetic therapies are often used by those undergoing surgery. The national CDC survey of CAM use (Barnes , et al., 2004), asked CAM users about their reasons for using a particular CAM therapy, giving them options for selecting more than one answer: Positive responses included: \u0081Therapy combined with conventional medical treatment help Congruence with holistic values and philosophies Awareness and interest in new health care options Belief in effectiveness of CAM treatment Concerns about safety, effective- ness or costs of conventionalmedicines Belief in wellness and health- promoting practicesUNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200411 \u0081Thought it would be interesting to try (50 percent) \u0081Conventional medical treatments would not help (28 percent) \u0081Suggested by a conventional medical professional (26 percent) \u0081Conventional medical treatments were too expensive (13 percent) Frequent users of CAM include those who seek effective treatment for chronic or incur- able diseases. For example, patients in rehabilitation clinics and with diagnoses of cancer, HIV/ AIDS, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's Disease use CAM therapies in greater percentages thanthe general population (Sparber, Wootton, et 2003; Sparber, Bauer, et al., 2000; Coleman, Fowler, & Williams, 1995). In addition, those people suf fering from chronic diseases with symptoms that are poorly understood or treated by con ventional care\u2014such as chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia\u2014may seek benefit from alternative therapies (Arcury, Bernard, Jordan, & Cook, 1996; Astin, Pelletier, Marie, Jazieh, et al., 2004). patient-provider communication about CCCCCAMAMAMAMAM One striking research finding is that most people who use CAM also use conventional care, often simultaneously (Astin, 1998; Eisenberg, 1997; Eisenberg, et al., 1993). Another finding is that the vast majority of patients\u2014about 70 percent (Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Eisenberg, et al.,1993)\u2014do not tell their conventional practitioners about their use of alternative modalities. Rea- sons given by patients for not discussing alternative therapy use with their physicians include the belief that physicians would not understand or be knowledgea ble about the therapy; that they are not asked; fear of disrespect or disapproval; and their belief that the physician is uninterested (Kessler, et al., 2001). Research affirms tha t conventional providers often fail to ask their patients about their use of alternative modalities (Murtaza, Singh, Dimitrov, & Soni, 2001). This lack ofcommunication may result in increased medical errors, noncompliance, possible duplication of services and greater health care costs, in addition to obscuring our understanding of the exact causes of specific outcomes. united states health care: risks &&&&& challenges of a pluralistic system An individual's use of two or more systems of care\u2014one a dominant or conventional system, the other a folk or unconventional system\u2014is common in most societies, as is the ability to hold multiple and sometimes conflicting health beliefs (King, Sobal, & DeForge, 1988; Mathews, 1992;Hufford, 1992). This phenomenon is particularly evident as cultures merge, due to immigration or other factors. The frequent use of alternati ve therapies among those who visit conventional pro- viders is not surprising, since the holistic values and philosophies held by many are found intraditional healing systems, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, and Native American healing traditions. Nor is it surprising that the vast majority of those who use alternativeTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200412 therapies (96 percent) also visit conventional care providers (Eisenberg, et al., 1998), since differ- ent needs are often being met. For example, a patient who uses primarily homeopathic care may still seek conventional practitioners for diagnostic tests. the risks of uncoordinated care It seems clear that patients seek the benefits of both systems, rather than choosing one over the other. Unfortunately, management of this ad hoc approach to health care falls largely to patients rather than health care professionals. To do so, patients must navigate the conflictingclaims and recommendations of different health car e providers, compensate for the poor commu- nication among caregivers, and contend with limited information about local options and a con- fusing excess of general information via the Internet and other media. Although there is a \"team leader\"\u2014the patient\u2014in this effort, the various team members (one or more from conventional settings and from various alternative practices) may be unaware of each other. Neither conventional nor CAM practitioner s may be well informed about each other's therapeutic approach or about interactions of treatments. Lack of communication about CAM use among conventional and alternative practitioners inhibits good health care. Without informed and compassionate prompting from providers of all types, pa tients may not communicate the fact of their use of alternative therapies to their conventional providers, and may choose not to communicate use of conventional care to their CAM practitioners. Treatment may therefore be redundant or at cross-purposes, even dangerous. For example, drug-herb interactions may occur, producing symptoms for which the cause is not known or un- derstood, either by patient or providers. Such a situation poses numerous problems. At a minimum, it creates great inefficiencies\u2014duplication of therapies, lengthy searchesfor the \"right\" treatment, or multiple diagnostic procedures. And there are more serious concerns about excessive costs and interactions be- tween different treatments. In addition to communications problems, other safety issues emerge as CAM use becomes more widespread.

Extensive research\u2014par- ticularly the randomized control trial\u2014has become the principal tool for assessing product and procedure safety, with standardization theultimate objective. Conventional medicine expects the same validation of alterna- tive therapies. From a scientifically based perspective, there are legitimate concerns about the safety and efficac y of products and treatments whose use has not been widely tested or whose production is unregulated. How-ever, others would argue that since many of these therapies have stoodCLINICIANS ADVISED TCLINICIANS ADVISED TCLINICIANS ADVISED AMAMAMAMAM The final report of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2002) advises clinicians and patients to\"become more knowledgeable about the potential benefits and harms of CAM approaches\" andurges \"physicians and other health professionals [to] make significant efforts to open lines of communi-cation with their patients about their use of CAM. . . .\" The reason for this recommendation is simple.Although not integrated with con- ventional care, complementary and alternative therapies form a majorcomponent of contemporary health care and the uncoordinated, ill-in- formed blending of these practicesposes safety risks.UNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200413 the test of time, are in common use, and are not likely to be funded for research, they should remain available as therapeutic options unless and until harm is proven. confronting safety issues Statistics on medical errors and pharmaceuti- cal risks attest to the need for alarm about safety in conventional medicine ( Medical Errors , 2000). Wide- spread CAM use raises additional questions and con- cerns, including unknowns about the safety of spe- cific therapies and methods, as well as unknowns re-lated to the combining of particular alternative and conventional treatments. Minimal regulation in the pro- duction and use of herbals and supplements, and lackof standards for providers, adds to the perception of risk by conventionally trained providers. In addition, inaccessibility to or lack of available information oneffectiveness of alternative therapies can be frustrat- ing (Curtis, 2004). Until recently, major funding for research on alternative therapies has been limited. Moreover, therandomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, the gold standard of biomedical research, while suited for drug studies, is challenging to apply to some alterna-tive therapeutic systems and interventions. Accumu- lating high-quality data on safety and effectiveness of so many different systems and types of care, and com-paring them with safety and effectiveness data on con- ventional care, is a daunting task. To date, research has varied in quantity and quality, and solid outcomedata is available for only a fraction of therapies that are in common use in the U.S. Not surprisingly, many conventional practitioners, insurers, and health care or-ganizations\u2014unfamiliar with many CAM options\u2014 are concerned that there is not adequate or convincing data to provide confidence for clinical recommenda-tions or therapeutic implementation ( see box, page 13 ). It is important to keep in mind, however, that many conventional therapies in common use have less than adequate research to back up their clinical recommendations (\"What Proportion,\" n.d.). The fact that many of these therapies are par t of the established medical culture may make their uncritical use more acceptable to conventionally trained health care providers. Hence, there is an urgent need to raise awareness and increase resear ch on safety and SAM SAM SAM S AFETAFETAFETAFETAFET YYYYY Many questions face conventional practitioners as decisions are made regarding recommendationsfor use of complementary therapies, their integra-tion with conventional care or referral to an alter-native-care provider.

In addition, since all therapies carry at least the potential of some risk, it is important to include consideration of relative risk in any compari- son of CAM and conventional care. rethinking medical research The demand for research evidence of CAM safety and efficacy has given rise to serious concerns about the adequacy of conventional research methodology. Although the RCT is the optimal method for proving the efficacy of a specific drug or treatment, the objectivity of the classic experimental method and the reductionist approach to assessment have recently come under scrutiny and criticism (Heron, 2001). Criticisms of RCT methodology range from concerns about the selection of participants and adequacy of the control group, to problems in measuringTTTTTABLE 3ABLE 3ABLE 3ABLE 3ABLE 3 RE-EVRE-EVRE-EVRE-EVRE-EV ALALALALALUUUUUAAAAATING CLINICAL TING CLINICAL TING CLINICAL TING CLINICAL APPLICAAPPLICAAPPLICAAPPLICAAPPLICA TIONS OF FINDINGS FRTIONS OF FINDINGS FRTIONS OF raised about RCT-based research: RCT results obtained with great rigor in very controlled conditions (known as \"high internal validity\") may be of limited value in clinical practice where patients are more diverse and often have more complex clinicalproblems than the original research subjects. Specific effects (i.e., a single drug) may not be the most valuable therapeutic intervention for the patient. Selection of variables in the study may omit other factors that are not understood or cannot be measured under these conditions. These excluded factors might influence the outcomes, and are not necessarilycontrolled for in a clinical trial. Medical studies do not usually clarify how, in each patient, the mind affects the body (placebo effect) or how this may vary among individuals or different cultural groups. Accounting for the placebo effect using acontrol procedure or inert substance may be inadequate. Large-scale studies tend to obscure each individual's interactions with the drug/intervention, so these data do not reveal to the clinician how an individual patient will react to treatment. The question, \"What is reallybest for this patient sitting in front of me?,\" is never addressed by large randomized studies. Treatment based only on inferential statistics and RCT designs may harm some people, because of events that cannot be predicted, and many studies are not large enough to identify significant adverse events. Arecent example is the withdrawal in 2001 of Baycol (a statin drug for lowering cholesterol) because of seriousadverse effects reported only after the drug was widely mar keted and not noted or reported in development and assessment (FDA, 2001). The scientific study of therapies using RCTs systematically ignores any analysis or understanding of how people feel about their illnesses. Each patient has a unique view of his or her own problem, a perspectivethat plays a role in clinical outcomes. This is not accounted for in RCTs. In randomized, controlled studies of conventional interventions, there is an emphasis on \"equipoise\"\u2014the emotional distancing and ignorance of the subject and researcher regarding the treatment outcomes. Equi-poise is rarely achieved in those studies in which the experienced clinician strongly believes in effectiveness,and subjects have often entered the study because of their specific preferences. (Heron, 2001)UNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200415 important variables. At the heart of the criticisms is the question of whether evidence of experi- mental validity translates into practical clinical validity for individual patients. These concerns are particularly relevant with respect to research on CAM treatments ( see Table 3, page 14 ). united states health care: where are we going? This is a time of transition for health care\u2014and a moment of great opportunity. On the one hand, we are seeing the beginning of what is likely to be a revolution in biomedical research and its applications. Discoveries in genetics, for example , offer the promise of new solutions to difficult health problems. At the same time, translational research in CAM may yield a multitude of insights and discoveries that will affect patient care, such as new understanding of the body's self-healing capabilities and energetics. However, despite such promise, the current dominant model for delivering health and healing services is increasingly unsuccessful; meanwhile, complementary and alternative therapies appear to be gaining in popularity as a path to health. In response to this situation, a growing number of clinicians\u2014and their patients\u2014are exploring ways to meld conventional practices withtraditional approaches and innovative therapies, thus expanding therapeutic options and creating new models of care. foundations of an integrated system of care Because so many patients use both CAM and conventional care and because their uncoordinateduse is costly, inefficient, and possibly unsafe, it seems appropriate\u2014perhaps inevitable\u2014for indi- vidual health care providers to not only seek education about CAM but to learn strategies toappropriately integrate CAM and conv entional care in their practices (Mann, Gaylord, & Norton, 2004). A further consideration is the possible progression toward a health care system that brings together conventional and alternative systems in a coor dinated, collaborative way. Such an inte- grated model of care would draw on the strengths and balance the limitations of the individual systems. Development of such a system would require: respect for and understanding about other healing systems; integrative educational curricula; new ways of conducting and understanding research on effectiveness and safety issues; new methods for assessing and assuring safety of conventional, alternative, and integrated healing methods; and significant changes in the policies that sha pe the economic and political structures of the current health care system. need for understanding & respect for other systems of healing Integration requires awareness and understanding of the many concepts, paradigms, and approaches to healing. Practitioners of various healing models must learn to appreciate the powerof belief to heal or harm, and learn ways to harness belief for healing. They must learn to respectTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200416 each other's beliefs and the healing practices that flow from them. To use the cultural analogy, health care providers, both conventional and CAM, must be willing to become \"bilingual,\" or even \"multilingual,\" with regard to alternative car e systems. Ultimately, a shared understanding of the healing processes that are common to all human beings and a common \"vocabulary\" with whichto communicate will enhance cross-disciplinary collaboration and integration. need for education about complementary &&&&& alternative principles and practices Comprehensive educational curricula in CAM and integrative principles and practices are needed at all levels of health-professions education. Although the majority of U. S. medical schoolsoffer one or more elective courses in CAM, the total number of students receiving more than a superficial introduction to CAM is still quite small (Brokaw, Tunnicliff, Raess, & Saxon, 2002). The NIH National Center on Complementary and Alternative Medicine has funded research ini-tiatives in CAM health-professions education at 14 health institutions; these are still at the model- ing stage without substantial published results covering outcomes and behavioral change. One study found that 77 percent of baccalaureate nursing programs included content or experiential learning in complementary health and healing in the curriculum (Richardson, 2003). Information about education in complementary modalities at schools of dentistry, pharmacy, and public health is limited (Sierpina, 2000). Alternative therapy schools could enhance communication with conventional providers by more consistently including content pertaining to conventional care in their curricula. A reviewof the curricula of schools of homeopathy, massage, herbal medicine, and acupuncture reveals variable levels of instruction in basic human anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, contemporary pharmacology, pathology, or clinical presentations of common disorders. Major exceptions arenaturopathy and chiropractic, which have four-year programs with substantial content in these areas, comparable to that of conventional medical education (http://www.bastyr.edu/academic/ profiles, accessed 12/31/04; http://www.ncnm.edu/a4academics/doctorofnd.cfm-national, ac-cessed 12-31-04). Training institutions, and, ultimately, the professional associations of the respective heal- ing modalities, must take responsibility to expand the \"core competencies\" of healing profession- als to include specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to both CAM and conventional care. Interdisciplinary education involving various alternative and conventional health-care pro- viders would enhance cross-disciplinary communication and understanding. For example, case-based discussions would highlight the various disciplines' diagnostic strategies, information needs, and ways of viewing the human being. need for more &&&&&better research on efficacy Since both consumers and clinicians need access to good information about appropriate uses of CAM therapies, additional research on alternative modalities is imperative. Research takes money, facilities, training, and appropriate methodologies, and CAM research faces challenges on all these fronts. Only in the last decade has the United States government begun to make fundingin CAM a major priority, with the research budget from the National Institutes of Health's Na-UNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200417 tional Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine steadily mounting, providing an impe- tus for new and experienced r esearchers to enter the field. Yet, even experienced researchers ma y lack the understanding necessary to design a valid study of a specific alternative therapy. While the randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial (RCT) has long been accepted as the \"gold standard\" in biomedicine, it works best for pharmaceu- tical-type products, which can be administered in pill form. For other interventions involvinghuman beings as an integral part of the therapy, this type of research design may be impossible to implement fully. How does one conduct a randomiz ed, double-blind placebo study of acupunc- ture or mindfulness meditation, for example? How does one test the efficacy of an active ingredi- ent of a complex herbal medicine product, and does it make sense to do so when the standard of care is the complex herb? And how does one meet the challenge of testing a system of care for which the primary modus operandi is individualizing the remedy to match the unique characteristics of each patient, as in classical homeopathy? The fact that holistic and integrative methods do not lend themselves to RCT study does not mean that they are ineffective or even that the y are not measurable. What is evident is that the established standard for biomedical research\u2014the RCT\u2014needs to be reevaluated, and its useful- ness understood in the context of the multiple healing modalities in use. It is also clear that new approaches are needed to measure the effectiveness and safety of healing practices that work in an integrated rather than an isolated way. There are other research-related challenges faced by alternative modalities, including col- laborations with investigators w ho may be operating with different belief systems, levels and types of training, and language barriers, or who may be practicing without legal status in a particular state. Publication bias against alternative-therapy research appears to have decreased in the last several years, but is still a substantial considera tion for researchers who must maintain careers based on numbers of publications and quality of journals in which their research is published. need to address safety concerns Issues of safety and compatibility of treatments arising from different medical systems are a concern to both patients and providers considering inte grative care. Since for many treat- ments\u2014both CAM and conventional\u2014the underlying mechanisms of action are not well under- stood, it may be especially difficult in these cases to predict outcomes or side effects. Information about therapeutic outcomes is useful for addressing possible safety con- cerns. Understanding is hampered by insufficient or inaccessible sources of evidence-based infor-mation on such topics as herbal medicine, drug-herb interactions, manual therapies, homeopathy, and acupuncture. Conventional health-care professionals often rely primarily on reports in U.S. peer-reviewed journals and are unaware of foreign or non-mainstream publications. Much of side-effect reporting related to alternative therapies in the conventional medical literature is in the form of case reports of drug-herb interactions. Evaluating these reports is often difficult given the limited space afforded to case reporting. Negative reports may be emphasized over positiveoutcomes in the name of safety. Likewise, many alter native providers are alarmed by the docu- mented side effects and risks of conventional medicine. In either instance, fears about the safety and risks posed by unfamiliar therapies may slo w the process of integration significantly.THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200418 Quality assurance for products, services, and practitioners is an important issue to address in moving to an integrated health care delivery model. How to accomplish that goal is an open question in most states. For example, one concern relates to the credentialing ofCAM providers in the name of both competency and patient safety. Among conventional health professionals, quality standards are established under a system of licensure that reflects their training andpractice. However, while licensing is standardized for conventional medicine, and therefore a familiar method of addressing quality issues, it may not be an appropriate method for many alternative care providers.Practitioners of some CAM disciplines, such as chiropractors, have well established educational and licensure standards, while some, such as homeopaths, are self-re gulating through mechanisms including nationally recognized certification pr ograms (Eisenberg, et al., 2002). Others, such as Reiki practitioners, undergo training programs that are recognized by consumers and health providers. For still others, such as mindfulness instructors, there are multiple styles anddegrees of competency set by a variety of schools and programs, but uniform standards are not established. The \"health freedom\" laws passed in several states (Minnesota, California, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Idaho) distinguish between medical professions and alter native healing, recognizing the wide diversity of approaches these man y practices take to assure quality. Under health freedom laws, alternative healing professions and lay health advisors are exempt from their state's medical practice legislation, and their own individual methods f or evaluating, credentialing, and certifying their members are accepted (http://www .minnesotanaturalhealth.org/index.htm; http:// floridahealthfreedom.org/main/miller_interview.php). A number of states are considering laws intended to assure the availability of a broad diversity of health care options for consumers. Herbs are at the forefront of the debate over CAM safety for a number of reasons, including the variability of their purity and content. Current U. S. regulations classify these prod-ucts as \"dietary supplements\" and exempt them from the pre-marketing testing required of food additives and pharmaceuticals (Dietary Supplement Act of 1994, 1995; Burdock, 2000). Standard- ization of herbal products is challenging due to the lac k of information about their active con- stituents. In addition, in contrast to Canadian standards, requirements for good manufacturing practices for herbal products and other dietary supplements are still voluntary in the United States. Thus, strength, bioavailability, purity, and composition of these products can be highly variable.Those readers interested in the history of dietary supplement regulations may refer to the 2004 Report of the Committee on the Framework for Evaluating the Safety of Dietary Supplements published by the National Academies Press. Finally, in a system of integrated health care, it will be necessary to determine what con- stitutes appropriate standards for labeling, disclosure of training and informed consent so that consumers and providers are assured access to inf ormation critical to treatment for each disci- pline. What governing body or bodies should determine safety standards, safety violations, and disciplinary actions for providers?

For example, when surgery is proposed for chronic low back pain, what is the relative risk and relative efficacy compared with acupuncture or craniosacral therapy? Without a shared definition of safety standards, integration efforts will falter. need for political & financial changes in health care Many of the greatest challenges to integration stem from the political and economic policies and structures that shape the conventional health care system. The U.S. health-care system's commitment to a model of high-tech care carries with it soaring expenses for the development and administration of complex and costly therapies. Advanced medicines and groundbreakingsurgical techniques are possible as the result of major financial investment. A pharmaceutical company will invest years and millions of dollar s to develop a patented medicine, but cannot practically invest in testing the efficacy of a commonly available, non-patentable plant. The eco- nomic outcome is that patients pay the sometimes-exorbitant price of medicines so that the manufacturer's investment will be repaid while little or no information is available on the effective- ness and safety of what might be a low-cost, accessible alternative. Similarly, hospitals, physicians, and insurers oper ate, by necessity, as competitive busi- nesses, intent on capturing \"market share\" in order to cover the cost of the high-tech services theyoffer. Unwittingly or not, they also become partners in marketing pharmaceutical products. Phar- maceutical companies are now the primary drug-product educators of physicians through drug- company sponsored lunches and free-sample distribution programs. The ethical dilemmas escalateas pharmaceutical firms pay for clinical research on their own products and control data analysis and publication (Angell, 2000; Angell, 2004). In this context, it is challenging indeed to find ways to introduce the typically low-cost, low-tech alternative therapies that may also mean lower rev- enues for a powerful economic interest. Indeed, a major barrier to integration is the affordability of alternative-care services. Re- imbursements for conventional care are largely under the control of insurers, while reimburse- ment for CAM comes primarily from direct payment by consumers. This situation further limitsintegration at the practice level, despite the sometimes excellent rapport that can exist between CAM and conventional providers. what next? steps toward integrated health care The process of integrating CAM and conventional care is likely to be an incremental one, influ- enced by many social, economic, and cultural factors. Since the U. S. health care system is market- driven, continued consumer demand could accelerate integration. Models of collaboration and integrative care are emerging and can offer guidance and insight for moving forward. The first steps typically are taken by conventional practitioners seeking better understanding of alternative healing options. For some this takes the form of a network of collegial and referral relationships; for others the path may be to acquire specialized tr aining in a CAM practice, such as acupuncture or homeopathy (Mann, Gaylord, & Norton, 2004). More complex models are also appearing in greater numbers, particularly in academic settings. These may include an association of conventional and CAM practitioners focusing on a particular disease or condition\u2014such as pain; or a fully integrated primary care practice whereTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200420 practitioners from many disciplines collaborate on all patient care. Research also is needed to determine the effectiveness, including cost-effectiveness, as well as outcomes, of such integrative care models. Finally, and perhaps foremost, educational venues are needed to inform conventional and alternative providers about the variety of systems of care available and their safety and effec-tiveness, and to improve cross-disciplinary communication. Appropriate integration will r equire the participation of inf ormed consumers and informed providers, as well as policy makers and health care administrators. Together, we can foster new and better ways of providing health care services\u2014ways that draw on the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of many healers and healing traditions. recommended reading The publications listed below provide an excellent foundation for further study of complementary and alternative health care.
