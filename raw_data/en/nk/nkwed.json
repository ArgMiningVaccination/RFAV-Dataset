Axis Natural Medicine regularly uses these formulas to treat a wide variety of medical concerns. Natural medicine works to help the body heal itself with its own natural processes. This results in the ability to address the cause of the disease rather than just masking the symptoms. Although prescribing herbal medicine isn't easy, Dr. Snow is up to the challenge. He considers many factors when selecting a formula for you. These include your body type, lifestyle, and health concerns. As a result two patients with the same complaint may have different prescriptions. While Dr. Snow is experienced in creating custom formulas, most people don't enjoy drinking medicinal tea (and we don't blame them!). Because of this, he usually prescribes herbs in pill format. Special orders and raw formulas can be made upon request. You should only take herbs that are prescribed by a board certified acupuncture physician. Some herbs interact with prescriptions, over the counter medications and supplements. When using herbs, results may take longer to see than with prescription drugs. Addressing the cause of the problem leads to longer lasting results with fewer side effects. Are you ready to try herbal medicine to improve your health? Call us! We are ready to schedule your free consultation with Dr. Snow. He will discuss the benefits of herbal medicine with you while taking the time to answer all of your questions. Come in to Axis Natural Medicine and start to feel well again. "}
