[Treatment](https://www.pyramid-healthcare.com/category/treatment/)| Recovering from drugs and alcohol addiction is a journey, and each day will be unique. Each stage in the process will require different care, and you'll want support that matches your needs. That's why the first few days and weeks of recovery will demand their own type of treatment: medical detox. If you've never attempted to get clean from substances before, detox will be new to you. Here, we'll explain the definition of withdrawal and why it's important to have medical supervision, plus the best detox benefits. What is detox? Detox refers to the body's reaction when someone suddenly stops or cuts back on substance use. This process is also called withdrawal, and it occurs because the body, which has become accustomed to the presence of drugs or alcohol, has to quickly readjust to a body without substances. This manifests in painful psychological and physical symptoms. The period of detox tends to be worse for those who have build up a stronger tolerance over time. This means that the higher the amount and frequency of drug use is, the harder withdrawal will be. Symptoms of detox can include the following: - shaking; - sweating; - irritability; - fatigue; - anxiety; - difficulty sleeping; - changes in appetite; - nausea and vomiting; - muscle soreness; - hallucinations; - seizures; - delirium tremens. These symptoms can be severe, so detoxing in a medically supervised facility is highly recommended. Pro tip: generally when people say \"detox,\" they're talking about treatment during withdrawal. Detox benefits When you decide to spend the withdrawal period in a licensed detox facility, there are plenty of perks and you'll want to take full advantage of them. Sadly, relapse during the first days and weeks of sobriety is all too common, so protect your recovery by signing up for detox treatment. When you do, here's what you can expect. Structure The first thing you'll notice at a medical detox program is the structure of the treatment. The vast majority of detox facilities operate on a 24/7 basis, offering residential programs meaning participants stay overnight. This allows for doctors and nurses to monitor and alleviate symptoms around the clock. This type of structure is critical because detox can be dangerous and even deadly. Aside from medical supervision, there's also a daily structure to detox. You'll find peer support and group therapy are built into your day, and these will lay the building blocks for long-term recovery. This schedule can help you reset, and it will be a significant change from a drug or alcohol-dependent lifestyle. Decreased pain Withdrawal can be excruciating, especially for someone who has struggled with a substance use disorder for years or decades. As toxins leave your system, you may reach a level of discomfort that is so severe, you feel overwhelming urges to use again just to make the pain go away. Thankfully, medical detox offers pain relief options that won't feed an addiction. Doctors and nurses can soothe symptoms with approved medications. This is called medication-assisted treatment. These drugs either reduce cravings, ease symptoms or both, and they've proven to increase rates of success in long-term abstinence. Professional support Detox facilities are equipped with medical and mental health professionals whose sole job is to encourage you and provide assistance in your recovery. Detox staff will be able to offer counseling, aid with managing medications, advice to cope through triggers, information on detox timelines, connection to continuing services, education, resources and so much more. While it can be intimidating to reach out for help, the staff at your detox center are eager to help you, and have helped dozens or hundreds of people in your same situation. They are experts in their field and their goal is to help you find freedom again. Peer support One of the overlooked pros of participating in a detox program is the peer support that is inevitably incorporated into treatment. Whether your center has four beds or twenty, you're bound to be surrounded by people who can relate to your situation and sympathize when you need a friend. Where do I find detox programs? Finding healing from substance use disorders is within reach. Take advantage of detox benefits like a daily structure, decreased pain, professional support and peer support so you can get back on track for the life you want to live.
