As a physician, I love empowering parents with the knowledge and tools to safely and effectively treat their child from home. I've created this workshop with the intention to help mothers navigate the common childhood illness with confidence and grace. \"CREATED BY A NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR Natural therapies work! They just need to be used appropriately- with the correct herbs and used at the therapeutic dose! I love the convenience of grabbing natural supplements at the grocery store; however, these formulas are often not created with the same potency and cleanliness as those that I use in office. There are many great therapies that don't require expensive supplements! Hydrotherapy is a traditional naturopathic modality using water that has profound impacts on the immune system. Herbal Elixirs can be made with simple ingredients that you can easily add to your shopping list!PHYSICIAN GRADE SUPPLEMENTS HYDROTHERAPY & HOME REMEDIESPrevention through Lifestyle Sleep: It is important that your child is getting an ample amount of sleep. This is when the body repairs itself and resets, which helps the body increase its natural defenses against external infectious agents. Sleep and circadian rhythm have a regulatory effect on the immune system, and optimal sleep has been shown to positively influences a variety of immune parameters. The American Academy of Pediatrics Recommends the Following: Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis.. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis. Diet: Breastfeeding If your child is under 2 years of age, breastfeeding is the best way to decrease their risk of illness through passive immunity. Avoidance of Sugar and Processed Foods Sugar impairs the function of the immune and inflames the body. It has been shown that just 1 tablespoon of sugar can suppress the immune system for up to 5 hours! Avoidance of Dairy This is especially important in cases where your child has excessive mucus or phlegm, as dairy contributes to the production of mucus. Inclusion of Immune Superfoods -Garlic: It's thought that much of garlic's therapeutic effect comes from its sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin, which are also what give it its characteristic smell. In order to release the allicin, a fresh clove can be chopped, squeezed, or juiced. -Bone Broth: Researchers believe the amino acids in broths and stocks\u2014like arginine, cysteine, and glutamine\u2014help reduce inflammation and boost our immunity. Bone broth has the additional benefit of healing the gastrointestinal tract, which is a key factor in protecting immune function, as 80% of the immune system is wrapped around our intestines! -Mushrooms: Beta glucans and proteoglycans are the primary biologically active compounds in the mushroom that support your immune system. Get Outside: Part of the reason why cold and flu season is more common in the winter is because we spend more time inside in stagnant air. Exposure to sun also increases levels of Vitamin D, which is extremely important for proper immune function. Exercise: Exercise has been shown to increase natural killer cells (the body's first line of defense). It also can help promote more restful sleep. Frequent Hand Washing: Washing hands with soap and warm water is highly effective in destroying and removing viruses and bacteria from the skin's surface. This should be done frequently, especially when in public places. Avoidance: I recommend staying clear of sick people and those who have been recently vaccinated via the nasal flu vaccine (mostly children). The nasal vaccine contains a live-attenuated virus, which can shed infectious virus particles. It is also important to avoid areas where the flu and other serious viral infections are common, such as hospitals. In general, I advise using caution in crowded areas, such as, amusement parks and airports. \u00a9 Copyright: All rights reserved to Dr. Ari Calhoun, ND No copying or distributing of this document is permitted unless given written permission Supplementation Prevention: Vitamin D: Underlying Vitamin D deficiency increases the chances of contracting a cold or flu, as suboptimal vitamin D levels can impair the immune response. I recommend the following dosing during cold and flu season: **Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin and can accumulate, so testing is recommended with long-term supplementation IU/ per 25 lbs Berry Well Immune Support (Vital Nutrients) This unique formula is my all time favorite supplement for long-term immune support. Within it, elderberry is helpful for both prophylactic and acute treatment of viral ailments. Arabinogalactin is a great form of dietary fiber that feeds to good microbes while supports the immune system through enhancing the function of natural killer cells and macrophages (your immune system's first line of defense). Finally, Isastis and Astragalus are both traditional eastern medicine herbs that are known to activate host immune response and stimulate long term immune modulation, respectively! Dosing: preventatively, 3x daily for acute illness) 18 months -3 years : 1/2 tsp (1x daily preventatively, 3x daily for acute illness) 1/2 tsp- 1 tsp (1x daily preventatively, 3x daily for acute illness) Vitamin A (Ortho Molecular): Recent research has suggested a close correlation between vitamin A deficiency and infectious diseases spread through the respiratory and digestive systems in children. Vitamin A plays a crucial role in the establishment and maintenance of the human immune system. More importantly, Vitamin A has demonstrated a therapeutic effect, in diseases transmitted through the respiratory system, such as pneumonia and measles in children, or in contagious digestive diseases in children, such as infantile diarrhea and hand, foot, and mouth disease. The World Health Organization has suggested that, in less developed countries, a child between 6 months and 5-years-old should be supplemented with high doses of Vitamin A. ** Vitamin A is a fat soluble nutrient and can cause toxicity, It is crucial that dosing be followed as prescribed. Prevention Dosing: I recommend dosing at the beginning of cold an flu season and/or before being around high-risk situation (airport, holiday party, starting day care) x 10 days to increase Vitamin A status to adequate levels: 6-12 months: years +: 20,000 IU daily Acute Dosing: For Children > 2 years of age (to begin on first sign of illness): 50,000 IU x day 1, 40,000 IU x day 2, 30,000 IU x day 3, 20,000 IU x day 4, 10, 0000 IU x day 5 SBI Protect (Ortho Molecular) SBI protect is an IgG immunoglobulin supplement that is dairy free! Immunoglobulins bind microbes and toxins in the GI tract and eliminate them prior to immune system activation. As these unwanted triggers are removed, it resets healthy immune tolerance and builds a stronger barrier to the external environment. Dosing: 2-5 years: 1/4 scoop 2x daily 5-12 2x daily 12 +: 1 scoop 2x daily Zinc Zinc is an essential mineral that helps modulate the immune response. Acute zinc deficiency can lead to a greater chance of infection, while long term zinc deficiency can lead to chronic systemic inflammation. There is no zinc in breast milk, so exclusively breastfed children are at risk of zinc deficiency .**Zinc can cause nausea, so it is important to dose WITH food (not on empty stomach). ** Do not use more than 1 month without consulting a physician, as daily dosing could lead to copper deficiency. Dosing: 6-12 months: Recommended to get through regular intake of food high in zinc (beef, lamb, oysters, chicken dark meat, lentils, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds) 1-5 years: 15 mg >5 year: 15-30 mg depending of food Supplementation Acute Treatment: GENERAL: Elderberry Syrup (Wise Woman Herbals) While there are many elderberry syrups on the market, this is my all-time favorite. It is crafted with organic elderberry, extremely concentrated, and uses vegetable glycerin as sweetener instead of cane sugar! Dosing: 6 Imu-Max (OrthoMolecular) This formula combines two of my favorite herbs for acute illness: Echinacea and Propolis. Echinacea is stimulating to the immune system, while propolis helps balance the immune system maintain normal inflammatory balance. Dosing: 6-12 months- Recommend Echinacea Kids (Herb Pharm) 2-3 drops 3x daily . Can also be used for older children (Follow dosing on packaging for children> 25 tsp 3x daily Vitamin C Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant and helps boost both innate and adaptive immune response. Vitamin C can cause loose stools, so dose to bowel tolerance. Dosing: 1-5 years: 250-500 CONGESTION: Sniffle Support (Gaia Kids) The formulation supports a healthy inflammatory response and promotes normal mucous production and supports the mucous membranes of upper solution is all-natural nasal spray that contains xylitol, purified water, salt, and grapefruit seed extract. The Xylitol and saline solution is hyper-osmotic, which draws moisture and keeps the nasal passages and sinuses more moist and clean than saline alone. For Younger Children: Lie child on his/her back. Clear nasal passages first with bulb syringe or other device. Tilt bottle upside down and allow the solution drops to flow into the nostrils. Use at least 3x daily. For Older Children: Insert nozzle into one nostril and squeeze bottle to dispense spray. Remove the nozzel before allowing the bottle to re-inflate. Repeat this 1-2 times/nostril. NAC NAC is a precursor for glutathione (the body's chief antioxidant) and excellent at breaking up mucus. Using NAC can thus make it easier to clear mucus and phlegm out of the respiratory passages. NAC can be used as soon as your child is able to swallow caps (breaking caps open is not recommended, as it oxidizes quickly) Dosing: >6 years : 500 mg 3x daily EAR ACHE: **Must see a physician for ear exam prior to ensure that tympanic membrane is intact. Kids Mullein Garlic Oil (Herb Pharm) Dosing: Ages 1-10: 1 drop per ear 3x daily Ages 10+: 2 drops per ear 3x daily TUMMY ACHE: Tummy Tonic (Gaia Kids) This gentle formula is great at calming irritation of digestive tract and promoting normal motility, preventing constipation. Dosing: 6-24 Acute Treatment: SORE THROAT: Ensure that sore throat is not due to Group A Streptococcal Infection! It is not recommended to treat strep throat on your own without the guidance of a physician. Signs of Strep Throat include: no other signs of nasal congestion or cough, Fever >102 F, red swollen tonsils, white patches or streaks on tonsils. Biocidin Throat Spray (Bio-Botanical Research) Biocidin is an incredible formula crafted with Chinese Medicine wisdom. Spray at the back of the throat as soon as you start to feel the first signs of a sore throat. This is great for both children and adults, but dosing needs to be adjusted based on weight. (Safe for Breastfeeding Moms) 20-30 lbs: 1 COUGH: Natranix (Ortho Molecular) Natranix is an herbal formulation designed to support the respiratory system. The formula includes botanicals echinacea, thyme, sage, elderberry and anise. If your child is already taking echinacea and elderberry from another formula, you may skip this formula and get the benefits from the other herbs via steam inhalation and/or an oxymel! Dosing 1-5 1 tsp 4-5 x daily Homeopathic Remedies Below are descriptions of the most common homeopathic remedies used for coughs. If you are having trouble figuring our which remedy best describes your child's cough, you can opt for a cough syrup through Boiron or Hylands that contains several remedies in one. ** Dose at 200 C. 2 pellets 3-4 x daily Ipecac - rattling cough; coughing until vomiting; coughing until turning blue Drosera - recurrent spells of spasmodic cough; severe cough; hard to catch breath; coughing until turning blue; cough with bleeding nose; coughing until vomiting; cough is painful and child holds chest Spongia - dry, hard cough; croupy cough; barking cough; tickling throat that causes cough; cough worse late at night; cough better warm drinks or food Ant-tart -rattling cough; wet cough but no mucus comes up; weakness and debility from cough; difficulty breathing Aconite - hard cough; sudden cough; child is frightened and restless; shortness of breath with fear and restlessness Chamomile - dry cough, worse 9pm to midnight; croupy cough; one cheek pale and one rosy; child is irritable, capricious, difficult to console; wants to be carried Kali Bic -productive cough with thick, stringy, green mucus; asthma; 2-4am; thick pain; loss of appetite; can't sleep; tends to be chilly and affected by drafts Kali Sulph -rattling cough without weakness; wheezing and rattling during sleep; loose cough with thick yellow discharge; worse warm air, warm wraps; nasal obstruction with yellow discharge; soft and timid like pulsatilla, but more irritable Pulsatilla - asthmatic cough; shortness of breath; worse lying down; bronchial coughs that are worse lying down; cough at night that prevents sleep; worse suppressed eruptions and emotions; worse warm room Phosphorous - every cold goes to the chest; lingering or tickling cough; worse exertion, laughing, talking; pneumonia with a painful, burning cough Nux vomica - cough, worse when warm, or warm in bed; hard, dry cough; spasmodic cough; loose cough after eating FEVER: Homeopathic Remedies: ** Dose at 200 C. 2 pellets 3-4 x daily Aconite- sudden onset of symptoms; patient intensely nervous, restless, anxious and fearful; skin is hot, dry; bounding pulse.

Hydrotherapy & Home Remedies General: MAJIC SOCKS 1) Collect items these items before you get your feet wet. Warm woolly socks (smart wool ok, real wool ideal) Thin ankle socks - cotton is ideal but hard to find - use what you have as long as they aren't 100% nylon. 2) Get them wet with cool water and wring them out so they are not dripping. 3) Warm your body - this is most important. A shower, or bath are ideal, but a foot soak will work too. **IMPORTANT: If you already have a fever you can skip this step 4) After you are plenty warm - dry off. Put the wet thin socks on your warm feet. 5) Put the wooly thick socks over the wet socks. Make sure the wooly socks cover the wet socks completely. 6) GO TO BED - if you need to stay up you MUST stay warm, in bed and covered. Cozy is key. **Best results are if you do this at least three nights in a row. Fever: A fever is an important part of a healthy immune response. This is the body's innate way of fighting off pathogens (bacteria and viruses). It is important to allow the body to do this work, and not immediately suppress a fever. An effective fever is between 100.4-102F. When in this range, the illness will likely be shorter and there is very little risk of unwanted side effects. WARNING SIGNS When do you NEED to go to the doctor? Baby is <3 months of age with ANY fever >100.4 F Fever with signs of dehydration (wrinkled lips, not urinating normally, not consuming fluids, tenting) Fever with rash Fever with severe ear pain Fever that lasts longer than 3-4 days Fever with throat pain WITHOUT a cough FEVER REDUCERS: In general, I'm not a huge fan of fever reducers, as they inhibit the body's natural defense against pathogens and all have potentially negative effects on other organ systems (especially the gastrointestinal tract and liver). However, there are times where fever reducers are essential to reduce the risk of dehydration, febrile seizures, and overall discomfort. Tylenol vs Motrin: Tylenol can be used in children <6 months, while Motrin is usually reserved for children >6 months. Motrin can have blood thinning effects, so there is risk of bleeding (if given around any surgical intervention). Motrin is a much stronger analgesic and lasts longer. Tylenol produces a toxic byproduct during metabolism, called NAPQI. The body must use glutathione to neutralize this toxin, potentially depleting the body of the stores to neutralize other toxins ** Important implication for post-vaccine care. In most cases, I recommend Motrin over Tylenol. TEPID SPONGE BATH: This is recommended for any fever >103F. Use lukewarm water (90-95 F) - fill bathtub to a shallow level - 2-4 inches. Sponge water over child's body for 20-30 minutes. Discontinue if the child starts to shiver. Ear Infection: PREVENTION: Breastfeed, if possible! Studies show breastfed babies are at least half as likely as formula-fed cohorts to get ear infections. Get rid of the bottle after year 1 and have child avoid drinking fluids while lying on their back. Avoid exposure to smoke (tobacco, smoke from wood stoves, etc). Avoid environmental allergens (pet dander, dust mites, molds) and consider using a HEPA filter in the child's bedroom ONION MUFFS: Onion muffs are a great adjunctive treatment to a viral ear infection, which is the most common form of otitis media. It is important that bacterial ear infections are treated with antibiotics to avoid more serious infection and complications. Cut a whole onion in half (Scoop out a couple inner layers to create a cup to surround the ear) Heat onion in oven (250 - 300 degrees) for approximately 15 minutes or until the onion is warmed and juices are visible on the surface. Wrap onion in a cheese cloth and allow onion to cool to a temperature that is comfortable to place over the ear Cup onion over the affected ear for 15 minutes Repeat as necessary to reduce pain and inflammation Hydrotherapy & Home Remedies Cough/Nasal Congestion: STEAM INHALATION Steam inhalations can help moisten the respiratory passages and loosen mucus. Essential Oils or Fresh Herbs can be added to bath tub or pot of warm water. If added to a pot of warm water, you can place a towel over the pot and child's head, allowing the steam to be trapped under the towel. For children under 8, it is recommended that you are under the towel with the child, Recommended Herbs/Essential Oils: Eucalyptus, Thyme, Rosemary, Peppermint, Clove HERBAL ELIXER/ AKA OXYMEL Oxymels are a traditional herbal formula that has been used for a variety of respiratory and immune system issues including coughs, mucus, and difficulty breathing. Oxymels are herbal extractions in vinegar and honey, They are simple to make and can be used for all ages! Ingredients Dried herb of choice (Rosemary, Thyme, Peppermint, Sage, Oregano, Cayenne Pepper) Fresh Spices of choice (Ginger, Horseradish, Garlic) 1 part apple cider vinegar 1 part raw honey Directions In a clean, dry pint jar place enough dried herb and fresh spices to fill \u00bc of the way full. Cover the herbs with the vinegar and honey until the jar is full or slightly less than full (strive for a ratio of approximately 1:3, herbs to vinegar/honey mixture). Stir the mixture with a clean, dry spoon, screw on a tight plastic lid, then shake until well mixed. Store the jar in a dark, cool place and shake every couple days. Strain the mixture after about two weeks and store in a glass jar. Recommended Intake: Children: 1 tsp 4-5x daily Adults: 1 tbsp 4-5 x daily Can be added into seltzer water for a fresh \"mocktail\" \u00a9 Copyright: All rights reserved to Dr. Ari Calhoun, ND No copying or distributing of this document is permitted unless given written permission This information is for educational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice.
