Unfortunately , they tend to forget where some of the prescription medicine s currently being used , came from. Researchers spent thousands of hours going to remote areas like the Amazon jungle to find plants with medicinal properties. Those findings wer e used to create some of the pharmaceutical drugs. Every country has a long history of civilization and their indivi dual methods , concerning how to deal with illness, developed after time. In North America, the native Indians used sage, American ginseng and will ow bark as medicine. In China, cat's claw was used for high blood pressure and in India, the use of turmeric was key in fighting inflammation in the body. It is hoped that one day, traditional North America n medicine and ancient natural solutions will find a common meeting ground as it is key to the health of all. While exploring the use of natural herbs and spices, one does have to be cautious as there may be those who are not entirely interested in their health . These people or clinics could be involved in practi ces that are based mor e on the money that can be made, than the actual healing. Investigating natural methods takes common sense and the use of one' s own research to ensure that no harm is caused. With that in mind, it is best to think about whether the general practitioner should also be consulted. For example, if a person is already prescribed a drug to combat an issue, it is best to check and see if a particular spice or herb, may cause a n adverse reaction. The role of natural health solutions is to provide an overall healing to the body and the mind. With that said , the material covered in this E -Book has been carefully researched and the best solutions presented in concise form. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 7 Chapter 1: The Mind Issues with the mind are often c aused by overwhelm.

In ancient India, the practise of Ayurveda began for treating the ills of the peo ple. Ayurveda healers found that Ashwaganda was very helpful in reducing stress.

Once insomnia has been experienced, the best thing to do is address it quickly. Saying a mantra once the head hits the pillow, has been shown to be very effective. The simple mantra used in yoga is, \"Om.\" Using the phrase Om repeatedly, is connecting yourself to the universe. As it is the only phrase repeated, it induces deep peace within the body, allowing it to drift off. Many people prefer to come up with their own mantra, which has a deep meaning to them. Frequently they will journal their thoughts and narrow phrases down until finding the perfect one for their needs. An example of a personal mantra would be, \"I am safe while drifting amongst the warmth and light of the heavenly stars.\" Along with the mantra, music very low in the background is helpful for inducing sleep. The type of music used, should be something along the lines of Gregorian chanting. The repetitive nature of the music has a hypnotizing quality to it. Making your own healing tea can be an enjoyable time, as you learn what mixtures work best for you. Even making tea just for g eneral enjoyment, can turn into a bit of a hobby with... different pots, cups and special tea bags to fill with your choices.

After you prepare your pot of tea, strain the mixture and add honey. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 12 The magnesium that we get from our food, is often not enough. Magnesium helps your tense muscles to relax and has also be en shown to combat stress. Both these issues can contribute to insomnia, instead of restful sleep. Magnesium can be introduced several ways. Having a warm bath before sleep is always good and why not try adding magnesium flakes to the bathwater.

Taking melatonin can cause dizziness or headaches if the dosage is too high.\u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 13 Chapter 2: Skin The skin is considere d to be a large organ and at some point in time in their lives, most people will b e affected with a skin issue. Many skin issues are not severe such as the pimples we get as teens . Other issues could be sunburns, exposure to certain plants or minor chemical reactions. In many cases, skin issues are caused by different factors we face, f rom eating the wrong foods to having a mental trauma that activates an issue with our skin. There are genetic factors that can be involved for some people that end up with a skin condition. Self -awareness of what we eat and how we think can certainly help with many skin issues. Acne Acne can sometimes be influenced by genetic factors. Typically acne starts to set in when the pores become clogged. Each pore is attached to a gland which will produce sebum and that oil attracts the growth of bacteria. The bod y is designed to protect itself and in that regard, white blood cells will start to wage war against the bacteria, resulting in the red acne you see some people suffering from. Apple cider vinegar is known for helping in weight loss but it can also be use d as a facial treatment. Apple cider vinegar has organic acids due to being fermented. Applying it to the afflicted area may kill the bacteria and reduce inflammation that in some cases will be left after the acne has disappeared. The proper way to apply apple cider is to first cleanse your face. Next take a diluted solution of apple cider vinegar and apply to the face using cotton balls or a folded piece of gauze. Never apply the vinegar without diluting it first. The best ratio is 1 tablespoon of vinegar , mixed with three tablespoons of water. The final step is to wait approximately 30 seconds to wash the face with cool water and pat dry with a clean towel. Always pat the face dry as rubbing it dry with a towel can irritate the acne. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 14 Honey is one of th e most amazing foods in the world. It also has a lot of health properties and when paired with cinnamon, it can be a great alternative to over the counter topical remedies. The bacteria fighting abilities of both honey and cinnamon are shown to reduce acne and the inflammation that occurs during a breakout. To use this natural method, mix two tablespoons of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon. This mixture has a pleasant odour and the next step is cleanse the face and to lather gently the mixture onto the affected areas. Sit back and relax for 20 minutes while the mixture is absorbed by the skin. Afterwards, gently rinse the face with cool water and again...gently pat the face dry. It might come as a surprise but the green tea you drink, works well at reduc ing acne flare ups. The green tea packs a double punch with its tannin and flavonoid properties. To use green tea, make one cup and let it sit to cool. Take a clean cotton ball and moisten it with the green tea, before patting each acne point on the face. This is targeting the individual spots but you can also put the green tea in a small spray bottle and apply it overall if you wish. It would be best to lean over the sink and close your eyes before using the spritzer as it will coat your face and run sligh tly. Just use a clean washcloth to pat up the extra green tea. Stress can attack sensitive parts of the body and make things more painful. For example, people who suffer from tendonitis find that when their stress levels go up, so does the occurrence of severe tendonitis. Unfortunately stress can also increase acne production as it make sebum production and inflammation skyrocket. The acne lesions may have difficulty in healing as well because stress has been shown to inhibit the body's ability to close a nd heal any type of wounds to the skin. Reducing the stress factor by drinking special tea mixtures , will help in reducing acne outbreaks. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 15 Eczema One solution t hat is available is the use of c olloidal oatmeal. This is created by taking oats and grind ing it to a powder before boiling it down to release the skin healing properties within. Colloidal oatmeal comes in a lubricant form like many skin conditioners and is used for itchy skin. For tougher problems like eczema, it is essential to get a good col loidal oatmeal from the health food store. When purchasing from the health st ore, ensure that it is powered c olloidal oatmeal and does not contain any fragrance or has anything else added to it. Use the powdered oatmeal in the bathtub. Fill the bathtub wit h warm water, enough to be able to lay down in and cover the entire body. The powdered oatmeal is placed in a large piece of cheese cloth and tied off to prevent leakage of the oats. Once in the tub, begin gently squeezing the cheese cloth to release the l iquid from the oats. The water will turn a mild milky color from the substance being released. Make sure to hand mix the water and if not laying down in the tub, cup your hands and run the milky water over your body. Tea tree oil is used in many ways. Peo ple suffering from extremely bad breath find that the tea tree toothpaste helps to reduce the bacteria in the mouth associated with bad breath. Tea tree oil is actually extracted from the leaves of a tree found in Australia called the melaleuca alternifoli a. To use tea tree oil, it is best to dilute it with another oil that is considered to be a \"carrier.\" One such oil would be olive oil. In a small bowl, thoroughly mix the two oils and t hen apply to the affected areas, using a cotton ball and gently pattin g. If you prefer creams over oils, then give calendula a try. This cream is a long time herbal remedy and works in three ways. It has been found to combat inflammation, skin infections and work to hydrate the skin. You can also use it to sooth burns or he lp heal minor skin cuts. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 16 Psoriasis There are a number of reasons why Epsom salts may work to reduce or eliminate psoriasis. Epsom salts contain magnesium which the body is usually lacking in due to the chemical treatments of the food we eat. By soaking in a bathtub with the salts, the magnesium can be absorbed by the body. Some skin conditions like psoriasis can arise from too much stress. Epsom salts has been shown to be a great stress reliever as well as relieving pain and inflammation throughout the body.

Turmeric can be easily adde d to the food you eat on a regular basis. Try some in oatmeal, stews, soups, spaghetti and chilli. Hot turmeric milk is another option and it is commonly called, \"Golden Milk.\" Be aware that you need separate pots and glassware to drink from, as the turmer ic will stain a pot or porcelain cup. Try adding oats to a warm bath. The oats have a healing property that can be released as the warm water works to dissolve them. The oats need to be dissolved in the water in order to release a milky colored liquid. Ma ny people put a cup of oats in a blender and grind them slightly, before putting them in piece of cheesecloth. The cheesecloth is then tied off and when in the bath, it is held under water and hand squeezed. Squeeze the cheesecloth until, there is an end t o the milky substance coming from the cheese cloth. Hand stir the water around to fully mix the cloudy milk colored substance with the warm water. The psoriasis needs lots of moisture to heal up. Try putting your favorite cream on the area and then wrap i t gently with clear plastic wrap. To keep that in place, you can use a flex bandage roll and then pin that to hold everything in place. Do this before you go to bed, so that the affected area, gets maximum moisture. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 17 Chapter 3: Respiratory Diseases and Ill ness's A large number of diseases and illnesses rel ated to the throat and lungs, are due to airborne pollution and germs.

In fact, many scholars believe the Egyptians were at the forefront for the use of essential oils for health and for beauty. For colds, eucalyptus oil is considered to the best to use because of its antiviral and antimicrobial healing properties. When the flu hits, grab some peppermint oil to reduce the congestion and aid in dropping your temperature. Most people are extremely h appy with the scen t once they apply the peppermint oil as the over the counter medicinal rubs, tend to be \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 18 overpowering. Remember for all essential oils, you need to use a carrier oil like olive oil, to aid in diluting. Laryngitis A case of laryngitis can be really annoying, especially if your job requires a lot of speaking. Laryngitis can stick around for a week or more, so it is important to get on top of it with a treatment. Moisture is your friend here, so boil water and place it in a bowl.

Making the throat and lungs mo ist is the optimum thing to do. You can use a humidifier or personal vaporizer to get moisture into your airway. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 21 Chapter 4: Digestive System The food and liquids we ingest do not always agree with our digestive system. Mo st of the digestive problems cause pain and in some cases can do damage to the body, such as the acid reflux which can damage the esophagus. This occurs because the backwash of foods are mixed with digestive fluids which are used by the body to break down food. Type 2 diabetes has been included in this digestive segment as it is caused by a lack of natural insulin which is normally produced in the pancreas. It can also arise when the body becomes resistant to the insulin produced. Acid reflux When you sle ep with one pillow under the head, the stomach is either lined up with or slightly higher than the head. This allows for stomach fluids to backwash into the throat and mouth due to gravity. This can be extremely dangerous as a small amount of this fluid ca n end up in the throat and lungs, causing severe choking. There will be an extreme burning sensation in the throat and you must clear the material and then dilute what remains in the throat, by slowing sipping water. To avoid the backwash from the stomach, you can purchase foam wedges to use instead of stacking pillow s. Avoid stacking pillows because this will cause neck pain, while a foam wedge gives your upper back and neck, gentle support. Ginger is used for upset stomachs and nausea. It can also be use d for acid reflux issues, instead of using an over the counter pharmaceutical. Use a 2 inch piece of ginger root finely chopped . Add it to a pot of boiling water and then reduce the heat to low for five minutes. Remove the pot from the stove and let it coo l to drinking temperature before straining it. Add honey to taste. The ancient Egyptians knew the value of aloe vera . Yes it is used in skin treatments, but the juice of the aloe vera plant can help with acid reflux and assist with proper digestion of th e food you consume.

Make sure to check the labels \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 22 for how the juice has been processed. Look for \"flash pasteurizati on,\" which means it has not been subjected to extreme heat, reducing how effective it will be. Indigestion Try to determine what caused the ingestion for starters. If you think that you ate too much acidic food, then baking soda is a go to solution. Dis solve some in a glass of warm water and add a couple drops of lemon as a precaution. The lemon is slightly acidic but it still needs to be added as baking soda can be disruptive and the lemon drops will fix that. Head to the health food store and ask for DGL licorice . This comes in tablet form and you need 1 -3 tablets to work on coating the inside of your stomach lining. DGL licorice is recommended for any type of stomach issue, including those who suffer from acid reflux. Type 2 Diabetes Using a natural method to combat diabetes is desirable, as this disease requires two to three types of pills to keep it under control. And it is possible that after a number of years, you may have to incorporate a needle once a day, to cut down on the dosage of pills and the damage that can occur to some organs with prolonged use. That would of course be up to your doctor. The best thing to do, is once you have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, is to have a long conversation with your doctor. It is important to ask if using some natural solutions may prevent you from having to start on the pills used to combat these disease or allow you to use a combination of both. Studies have been done on the idea of using American ginseng to reduce blood sugar levels. This particul ar ginseng has shown better results than ginseng from other parts of the world.

These compounds go to work on reducing the amount of inflammation and oxidative stress found within the body. Cinnamon is tasty but most people consume it with sugar, as in cinnamon buns and cinnamon/sugar on toast. It is healthier all round to consume it without sugar, either ground up or in stick form. In addition to reducing glucose levels in the body, cinnamon will work on dropping the triglycerides, lipoprotein and cholesterol levels. The most exciting news is that studies have shown consistent cinnamon use will help with weight loss and insulin control within the body. Cinnamon can be used in the same way as turmeric , which is another health benefit spice. Just add between around \u00bd to \u00be of a tablespoon, to your soups, stews and even your meatloaf...just for starters. Constipation This issue affects many people even when they are young. The elderly tend to suffer from it frequently and studies suggest that one cause may be the lack of hydration as the elderly slow down and are not active enough. Not being active means less water intake as the elderly may not feel thirsty, so they do not hydrate like a middle aged perso n out playing tennis. Drinking enough water is an issue many people face. While doing sports, they may consume water due to thirst, yet ignore the rest of the day. Having a glass of warm water upon waking will help not only with constipation but the overa ll health. Water consumption should be throughout the day and evening, rather than blasting down 2 litres of water at once. Drinking a large glass of water before dinner, will not only help with the digestive system but also fill you up, so you eat less fo od, helping you with weight loss issues. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 24 Constipation issues are more than the inability to eliminate waste daily.

Try small amounts of added fibre and then increase as necessary. Once you find the right balance, your constipation issues will lessen. If this solution does not help, try a herbal supplement that you can use daily. Triphala is a special blend of 3 herbs, first used in the Ayurveda health systems centuries ago. The special combination of herbs works to keep you regular, without causing harm to your digestive system. You can purchase Triphala at your local health food store. Using prunes on a frequent basis will give you the fibre you need. While most people believe this is why prunes are so effective, the real reason is that it contains a natural laxative called sorbitol. The most comm on consumption of prunes is the dried variety. Prune juice works, however as with any product, you need to check the label for added sugar or any preservatives.

Back then children thought cough syrup was a joy to take, in comparison to the taste of cod liver oil. Omega 3 fatty acids , such as that found in salmon and mackerel have been found to reduce the blood press ure numbers and while eating those types of fish, is wonderful, not many people are willing to have fish 7 days a week.

With a heart attack you may feel chest pain and pain at the same time in the arm or lower back. Once you are positive that the occasional heart pain you feel is not a serious issue, then look at what might be causing the issues and the remedies.

Be sure to chew the almonds into a fine paste before swallowing to reduce any choking possibility.\u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 29 Chapter 6: Urinary System Urinary issues can affect anyone, however most often as we age, then we beg in to see minor to major issues Women who have gone through childbirth, end up having changes to the physical structure around the bladder area. This can cause frequent urination and other issues. Older men who start to have prostate problems such as incre ased size, will find urinating difficult. Urinating issues During the process of passing urine from the body, a person may feel a burning or even a painful sensation. This is an indicator of a urinary tract infection. Due to having a shorter urethra, wom en are much more prone to urinary tract infections. In comparison, the bacteria which causes this infection has a much more difficult route to travel when it comes to men. The bacteria from the skin around the testicles and from the anal region, has to tra vel to the tip of the penis, making it more difficult for the bacteria to take hold. While antibiotics are frequently used to attack the bacteria, many people have allergic reactions to the antibiotics and frequent use will lower the effectiveness of the prescribed medicine. One natural solution is drinking cranberry juice which has antioxidants. Many urinary tract infections come from E.coli bacteria found in the skin around the anus. Improper cleaning of the area, is one way the bacteria can produce an d spread to the urethra. Some studies have shown that frequent use of cranberry juice will make it much more difficult for the bacteria cells to actually pair up with the urinary tract cells. Oregon grape r oot is a herb that has been shown to be very effe ctive in treating urinary tract infections. The root has a special alkaloid called, \"berberine.\" It can be us ed on its own or combined with e chinacea to help repair the immune system and fight against future infections. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 30 Do you love yogurt ? If you suffer from urinary tract issues, yogurt can be a great way to combat it. Purchase yogurt with probiotic properties. Check t he label and look specifically for probiotic with lactobacilli acidophilus. This yogurt is a triple threat to the bacteria that may be caus ing the urinary tract issue. Like cranberry juice, this yogurt can help prevent the bacteria cells from connecting to the tissue cells. Secondly, the yogurt can help produce hydrogen peroxide within the urine and it works as an antibacterial in this regard . Lastly, the bacteria has a hard time surviving in low PH and the yogurt can help reduce the PH levels in your urine. Kidney stones Unfortunately kidney stones are all too common, so taking preventive measures to keep them forming is the best thing you can do for yourself. There are four types of stones but in general terms, they ar e waste material that has become hard and then turned into a form of crystal. Passing large stones in the urinary tract can be very painful. As well the stones when released from the kidney area, sometimes travel elsewhere and can end up lodged in tubes connecting to other organs. In this case they are hard to spot on an ultra sound and a specialist may need to investigate and remove them. Basil juice is a natural solution fo r making it harder to have kidney stones form. The stones can form due to high uric acid levels. Basil juice has acetic acid which goes to work on dissolving stones that are forming or already present. The recommended dosage is one tea spoon per day. Acidic fruits like oranges, limes and lemons are your friend when it comes to avoiding kidney stones or allowing them to increase in sizes that are very difficult to pass. The citric acid in these fruits acts as a binder and attaches itself to the calcium tha t is in your urine. When this happens, it makes it much harder for the stones to form. If your body is already in the process of stone production, increasing your acidic fruit consumption will bind the citric acid to the calcium oxalate crystals in your bo dy. These crystals will find it extremely difficult to increase in size when that happens and will be flushed \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 31 out in the urine elimination. Due to the very small size, you will likely not feel anything when this occurs.

Warm water can help in digestion, constipation, weight loss and flushing out the bladder and urethra. A natural method you can try is D-Mannose , an extract from two types of trees. While maple sap has high sugar content, D -Mannose does not and is fine for your overall diet. The D -Mannose travels through your digestive system and attaches itself to the bacteria causing the inf lammation. Then like a life raft, the D -Mannose flows with the urine out of the body. D -Mannose is typically taken in capsule or powder form. Quercetin is an anti -oxidant which is found naturally in foods like dark berries, such as blueberries, red grapes and cranberries. This anti -oxidant has been shown to be effective in reducing bacteria and the accompanying inflammation. As with over the counter medications, you should be prepared to take Quercetin daily for approximately 3 -4 weeks. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 32 The hot and cold therapy is a method to try out and see what results occur.

With heating pads, start with a lower heat in c ase you drift off to sleep as you don't want to overheat the skin. Alternate back and forth with heat pads or cold ice bags to gain relief.\u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 33 Chapter 7: Aches + Chronic Pain With chronic pain, there can be a number of factors that cause it. Inflammation in the body, is well known in regards to chronic pain, as is nerve damage. What many people are unaware of...is how much emotions has to do with chronic pain. Many people report that prior to a flare up with lower back pain or fibromyalgia pain, that they were depressed or going through a difficult situation. To reduce the number of aches and chronic pain that occur, it is a best practice to continue daily on managing your emotions. Reducing anxiety, depression or anger, will go a long way in keeping the pain mo nster toned down. Migraine It is always imperative to understand the food you eat and the benefits or the drawbacks of what is ingested. Migraine sufferers need to avoid certain foods as they can bring on the pain. One major type of food to avoid, is processed meats due to the nitrates they include. While hot dogs may taste great, they are definitely not the best meat to be eating. Other processed meats to avoid are cold cuts and bacon. Pickled foods should also be avoided, so if a person were to have sal ami sandwich and a couple of pickles, it is a double whammy as far as a possible migraine is concerned. Acupuncture and acupressure are two natural methods that can be considered for headaches in general and the tremendous pain caused by migraines. Certai n points are targeted on the body and once they are accessed, most people find they get relief. Body charts show that there are connections within the body that many people may not be aware of. For example there is a spot on the hand, between the thumb and forefinger that can be pressed to relieve pain and headaches. The moment a migraine starts to appear, apply peppermint oil to the forehead and temples. Gently massage the peppermint oil in and continue to gently massage while thinking about the pain melt ing away like snow on a sunny day. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 34 Coriander seeds have been used extensively in Ayurveda Indian medicine. One method is to put coriander seeds in a bowl of hot water and inhale the steam. To get the full effect, put a large towel over your head and lean directly over the steaming water. The seeds can also be chewed or to make a delicious herbal tea. Fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia is a disease that is difficult to diagnosis and treat, as there is no known cure for it. The symptoms are wide ranging and each per son will have a different reaction once this disease takes hold. It tends to affect the nerves and muscles of the body, causing pain and discomfort, with some people reporting depression as another symptom. There are approximately up to 15 symptoms that pe ople can experience. Fibromyalgia suffers do report that living or visiting a warm area, like Florida or the Islands for instance, does have a healing effect on their overall body. As that option is not available to everyone -using an infrared heat lamp can bring relief from some of the pain symptoms. The lamps are adjustable, so if the pain on a particular day is showing in the face and neck region, the lamp can be adjusted to target that area. Sandalwood oil is used for the treatment of fibromyalgia. I t is helpful in calming down the central nervous system and also works as an anti - inflammatory. Using it before sleep, will be beneficial as the oil contains santalol which is a natural sleep sedative. 5-HTP is a natural amino that has been shown to be h elpful with fibromyalgia. Some people report that it worked well in reducing pain and fatigue. Another huge benefit is that it helps the body to produce serotonin, which helps manage mood swings. This is important as sufferers of fibromyalgia often report going from sad to happy, then to anger, without being able to gather control over the swings. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 35 When the pain of fibromyalgia hits, try using capsaicin cream. Capsaicin is the heat element in the hot peppers or cayenne pepper that people love to flavor food with. This cream goes to work calming down the nerve endings in the body that produce pain. Be careful applying it to the facial area and stay away from the eyes. Arthritis Arthritis pain can be in the hands, knees and feet as examples. Weight manageme nt is an essential natural method of reducing arthritis pain. Too much fat in the abdomen region can overwork the lower back and glutes, resulting in arthritis flare ups. With fat in the stomach area, it pulls the body forward and the lower back has to com pensate to keep a person upright. The knees and feet, need to work to carry the body around and if a person is overweight, it puts an extreme amount of pressure on those areas and causes a great deal of pain. Look for a diet plan that works for you. Everyo ne responds to weight loss programs differently, so it is imperative to do some research, find a new eating pattern and stick to it. The spice we know as turmeric is beneficial in reducing the inflammation that ramps up arthritis symptoms. The key ingred ient in turmeric is called curcumin . Turmeric can be consumed in many ways and that makes it very popular as a natural health solution. It goes very well with most foods that are consumed for breakfast, lunch or supper. It can be added to scrambled eggs, s oups, stews, mashed potatoes and much more. It can also be taken in capsule form, if the taste is not to the liking. An extremely popular method of consuming turmeric every day , is making golden milk. There are a variety of recipes and one that can be used is to boil almond milk in a pan. Add in 4 teaspoons of turmeric powder, 2 -3 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of black pepper and finally take about \u00bd inch of fresh ginger and chop it finely before adding. The black pepper is necessary because it helps to activate the curcumin in the turmeric. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 36 After heating and stirring, pour into a cup that is dark in color, as the golden milk will stain white porcelain. Just let it cool a bit before sipping and if needed after tasting, dust the top of your golden milk w ith a bit more cinnamon. Arthritis responds well to heat and cold therapy. Most sufferers find that when they wake up, stiffness has set in. It is a good idea to take a hot bath with Epsom salts added, first thing in the more. Throughout the day, if the pain persists, apply gel packs that you can keep in the freezer. A warm shower or bath before bed, will help ease the pain before you sleep. Try making your own herbal cream to apply where the arthritis is causing issues. Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin which is well known for its pain reducing properties. You can mix one tablespoon of cayenne pepper to 4 -5 tablespoons of coconut oil . The method used, is gently heating the coconut oil in a saucepan. Slowly mix in the capsaicin while leaning back slightly . Capsaicin will irritate the nose, just like the juice of a ghost pepper and it is best not to inhale it or a floating particle of cayenne pepper. Once it is completely mixed, pour into a small mason jar and seal it tight. Let the mixture sit until the ne xt day and then begin applying to the affected spots, three times per day. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 37 Chapter 8. Personal Issues There are issues that people suffer from, that can cause some depression or cause their self -esteem to take a hit. They are likely to avoid talking about these issues, due to embarrassment. It should be noted that as humans, we are not immune to personal health issues and if the conversation comes up, it should be treated with respect. With some of the personal issues like chlamydia and herpes , it is essential to tell any potential sex partners of the issue and spend time discussing and reviewing safe sex to avoid transmitting the disease. Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are very aggravating to deal with. Located in the anus region, they can making si tting or walking difficult due to pain and itching. In some cases, these hemorrhoids which are actually veins can break out due to stool elimination and minor bleeding can occur. An alternative therapy for hemorrhoids, is the use of witch hazel . It has be en shown to work on both pain and itching that occurs dur ing hemorrhoid flare - ups. Aloe v era is typically used just for itching and it is possible to find products that com bine both witch hazel and aloe era. The products available are treated wipes or in l iquid form that can be applied to your own personal type of wipe. Cold compresses have been used effectively in reducing the swelling that comes with hemorrhoids. To use a cold compress in the anal region, make sure to wrap it in a clean piece of cloth th at can be washed. Typically a cotton washcloth would be used due to the softness of the material. Make sure to apply gently and do not rub the hemorrhoids in any fashion. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 38 Soaking the hemorrhoid area in warm water and Epsom salts has been shown to be very effective. Studies have shown that it is best to do this for up to 20 -30 minutes after each elimination. It is not necessary to run a full bath. Most large drug stores or healthcare facilities will carry a small insert that will fit over the toilet se at. The insert can be filled with warm water and Epsom salts to provide welcoming relief from the pain and itching. Chlamydia This bacterial infection can be treated naturally using echinacea , which comes in a lovely tasting tea or capsule form. Most pe ople associate echinacea tea with the prevention of colds and flu, however it has great antibacterial properties. Sufferers of chlamydia should try taking e chinacea in one of the forms, five times a day for up to 10 -14 days for relieve of the symptoms. Olive tree extract is another natural solution that has been used for many years. Chlamydia has been with us for a long time, however it was known by different names in parts of the world. Olive tree extract can be applied to the groin area once it has been thoroughly cleaned. Olive tree extract with its active ingredient of oleuropein can be purchased in other forms such as capsules or a concentrated liquid. Garlic is considered to be an all -round healer due to its high content of allicin. Allicin had anti bacterial and antifungal fighting abilities, which make it a great choice for those suffering from chlamydia. The best method of using garlic is eating two raw cloves a day. Other methods including baking a garlic bundle which causes the garlic to become c reamy in texture and can be spread on toast or using garlic capsules. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 39 Herpes Herpes shows as blisters, which are moist and itchy...usually in the groin area. In order to dry out the lesions left by herpes, try making a paste from cornstarch or baking soda . This will help with the itching. Unfortunately herpes virus stays with the body once it has invaded. Outbreaks will come and go, depending on many factors, including being under a lot of stress. To slow down the number of outbreaks, you can make some dietary changes. Try eating probiotic yogurt every day for starters, as the probiotics may help slow down the bacteria production. It may also be wise to try zinc supplements as studies have shown that increased zinc levels via about 30 milligrams per da y, tends to slow down the number of outbreaks. Coating a zinc cream to the affected areas has also been described as a method for treating the herpes virus. A diet rich in vitamin C will work to speed up the process of healing herpes sores when they appea r. Make sure to eat plenty of raw yellow or red peppers for side dishes at dinner or for a bedtime snack. Colorful fruits such as raspberries , strawberries , kiwi and of courses oranges will really help with the vitamin C you need. Some herbs have superior antiviral pr operties. Eating herbs such as echinacea and elderberry are recommended. These two herbs may reduce the symptoms of herpes or even prevent a new outbreak on the body.\u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 40 Chapter 9: First Aid Everyone should learn first aid and it is important to get children involved at a very young age as they can help in many ways, including learning how and when to call 911. Every household should have the basic first aid kit and it is a great idea to carry one in the trunk of the car. Common first aid complai nts can be treated with natural solutions but remember to consider when and if a doctor or hospital should be consulted. Insects bites When speaking of insect bites, we are mainly discussing the type of bite that does not leave a stinger in. For those, yo u need to immediately remove the stinger or the actual bug like a tick right away. Mosquito and small fly bites can be treated for minor swelling and itching by using a number of natural methods. If you have tea bags in the house, you can make a cup of te a and remove the bag to cool. Once the tea bag is cool enough to place it on the arm, let it sit for approximately 10 -15 minutes to draw out any fluid associated with the bite. Tea tree oil is another effective method to treat bug bites and this should be used if it is possible for the bite to become infected. It is a triple threat in that it also relieves the pain and itching associated with a bite like those issued by horse flies. We hear a lot of the uses of coconut oil in terms of healthy eating, yet it can also be used to treat bug bites. Coconut oil has antibacterial properties and can help reduce the itchy feeling associated with bug bites. Coating a bite with coconut oil will help keep dirt and dust from infecting any open bug bite and it can be ap plied just like a sun screen. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 41 Burns Burns, especially those that occur in the kitchen cause a fair amount of pain and usually blistering afterwards. Hotel chefs swear by putting egg whites on the burn, yet it has never been proven to be anything but a placebo. In fact, hospitals frown on putting any heavy creams or essential oils on a burn. The best remedy to reduce the pain is to run cold water over the burn and repeat the process. Once you have done that, gently wrap the burn in gauze to keep out any dirt. Keeping a herbal cream at home or in your car may be just the answer. If you are out hiking and get sunburned or suffer a minor burn while putting together the camp fire, using the cream will help with the pain and blistering. Calendula cream is ma de from a flower. It has anti -inflammatory properties and has been shown to promote fast healing from burns. If the idea of putting something on a burn is weighing on your min d, put a very light coating of aloe vera on it. Aloe v era has antibacterial and anti- inflammator y properties. Growing your own aloe v era plant is wise and when needed, snip off a leaf and squeeze the gel out. Lightly pat the burn by applying the gel to a gauze pad and do not rub it in. Leave any gauze wrap off for as long as possible. If you are headed out for the day, then it is a good idea to wrap the burn gently first. Cuts Our friendly spice, turmeric is going to come into play again, when dealing with minor cuts. Applying turmeric powder directly to the wound has been shown to stop the bleeding quickly. The longer that you can leave the wound open to the air, the better. If the bleeding does not stop quickly, apply a gauze pad and apply pressure for approximately 3 -5 minutes before wrapping the wound and bandage with gauze. Do n ot remove the pad as it may cause the bleeding to continue. Drink several cups of golden milk, (made \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 42 with turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, pepper and milk) right up until bedtime. Taking the turmeric internally will help the overall healing of the wound. Garli c can be used in a similar way to turmeric , to add in stopping the bleeding. Take a large flat kitchen knife and once the garlic is peeled, lay the blade against the cloves and flatten them out. Place the cloves on the wound and gently wrap in gauze to hol d them in place. Sunburn Sunburns can be very painful and can sometimes blister quickly. Try putting a stopper that has straining ability in your bathtub. Next up , add some cool water and 2 -3 tablespoons of baking soda. After you swirl that around to ge t it mixed, add a cup of oats wrapped in cheesecloth , and again swirl it around. The baking soda will help reduce the amount of damage the sun has done to your skin. Oatmeal has been shown to reduce the amount of irritation that accompanies a sunburn. Mak e sure you are growing that aloe v era plant in your dwelling. It has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for sunburn. When you grow your own plant, you know it is pure aloe v era you are putting on your sensitive skin. Clipping the leaf and squeezin g out the gel inside, gets you the relief you need. Always remember to pat it on, instead of rubbing it into your skin. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 43 Chapter 10: Miscellaneous Issues Nose bleeds The nasal passages need to be kept moist yet it can be difficult depending on weather conditions and the type of heating used in the home environment. Occasional nosebleeds due to dryness in the home environment can be deal t with by using a cool mist humidifier in the bedroom at night. Another method to keep moisture in the nose, i s using cotton balls with a coating of petroleum jelly. By gently inserting and slowly rotating the cotton ball in the nostril, it will coat the walls without any discomfort. Frequent nosebleeds can be treated with nettle powder capsules or nettle tea. Us e either nettle leafs or ground up nettle powder to make your tea. Mild strains If you do manual labor outside the house or are very active in home gardening, there is a good chance you will occasionally suffer from strains in the shoulders, back... or eve n the legs. Major strains and sprains should be looked at by your family doctor, however a mild strain can be treated in several ways at home. Use a cold pack off and on during your day to reduce inflammation. Buying a reusable cold compact isn't always ne cessary. You can use a bag of frozen vegetables for 10 minutes and then return it to the freezer. With either the cold compact or the frozen veggies , use a very thin cotton cloth to wrap them first. It is better than putting the cold bag against the skin a nd more hygienic. Arnica comes from the arnica plant and is a wonderful herbal cream to apply to any muscle strain for relieve and to cut down on the amount of bruising that accompanies a painful strain. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 44 You can also consider purchasing a personal TENS machine . A TENS machine issues electrical pulses which travel down to the pads that you place on the area needed attention. The amount of healing pulse can be dial controlled and the TENS works to active the muscle area and increase blood flow. Ear ache s Two oils that can be used to treat ear aches and minor inner ear infections, are olive oil and garlic oil . With either oil, they need to be warmed but you must be able to dip your finger in and not feel any discomfort. While laying on your side, slowly drip the oil into the ear canal and then put in a cotton ball to keep the cold air from hitting the oil while it works. You must stay on your opposite side for 10 -15 minutes to allow the oil to coat the affected area and you can then get up while leaving t he cotton ball in place. Alternative hot and cold therapy has been shown to work well. For the heat part, you can purchase small cotton bags that have seeds inside. After putting the bag in the microwave, lay down on your side and place a clean washcloth over the ear and then place the heat bag on top. Monitor how warm the ear is and if it is too hot, remove and then replace in 60 seconds to test again. With the cold compress, you would start out the same way and use the clean washcloth. With the cold ther apy, you don't have to worry about burning the outside of the ear but if it becomes too uncomfortable, remove for a short time and then repeat. Try using the hot and cold therapy throughout the day.\u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 45 Bonus Material In this E -Book we have covered a wide ran ge of health issues and the natural solutions to eliminate the issue or reduce the occurrences of such issues. There is always the possibility that you want to take it a step further without the use of prescription drugs and for that we will briefly cover two possible solutions that may be the right fit for you. Hypnosis The idea of going under hypnosis for relief of some issues should not be dismissed.

Here is a link to one such site, however you are not limited to this site, as there are a number of them on the internet... including Amazon Programming ( NLP) NLP is Neuro -linguistic programming, the language of the brain. It was invented by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. The most simplistic way of explaining NLP, is to say that it is a computer code to rewire your brain where you want or must make changes. It combines the use of words and physical movements in many cases. For example, they teach the idea of \"anchoring.\" Using this technique, the new thought that you put into your brain can be triggered at any moment by p ressing your index finger to your thumb. There are many ways to set a physical anchor to a thought but in simple form, if you felt depressed, you could anchor your index finger to your thumb, in order to recreate the exact moment that you felt happiness an d joy in the past. \u00a9 www.365dailyhealth.com | 101 Natural Remedies Secrets 46 There are certified NLP practitioners around the world.
