Medicare sometimes provides coverage for services falling under the category of naturopathy.

Find Medicare Plans in 3 Easy Steps We can help find the right Medicare plans for you today Is Naturopathy Covered by Medicare Naturopathy is naturopathic medicine. Used to prevent and heal a full range of ailments, it includes practices like [acupuncture](/faqs/does-medicare-cover-acupuncture/) and [chiropractic](/faqs/does-medicare-cover-chiropractic-care/) services. Massage, exercise, and nutrition are other examples of this genre of medicine. Typically less invasive than most traditional methods, naturopathy focuses on alternative cures and treatments. Medicare recipients may opt for more natural remedies over expensive surgeries or prescription medications. But what does this mean for coverage? Well, Medicare only covers some services that fall under this category. Recently, acupuncture started receiving coverage from Medicare. This change aims to reduce opioid painkiller dependence. Yet, Medicare only covers acupuncture when treating chronic lower back pain. Some [Medicare Advantage plans](/medicare-part-c/medicare-advantage-plans/) provide additional acupuncture coverage. The back pain must meet specific criteria to get coverage. If you want to try acupuncture to relieve pain in another part of your body or if your back pain isn't chronic, you'll pay for the services. Also, chiropractic services have coverage under Medicare only to correct a misaligned spine. If you visit the chiropractor for any other reason, your services won't have coverage. However, some Advantage plans provide extra chiropractic benefits that aren't covered by Part B. As for nutrition, Medicare only covers [nutrition counseling](/faqs/does-medicare-cover-medical-nutritional-therapy/) if you have certain health conditions, such as diabetes or kidney ailments. A registered dietician is usually responsible for administering this counseling. Does Medicare cover Naturopathic Doctors? Medicare doesn't cover visits to naturopathic doctors (NDs). While the Medicare-covered services above technically qualify as naturopathy, Medicare won't pay for services from an ND, including generic visits. A licensed acupuncturist must perform Medicare-approved acupuncture. Many NDs also happen to be licensed acupuncturists, but acupuncture to treat chronic lower back pain caused by a misaligned spine is the only service from this practitioner that will receive coverage.

It's important to remember that the physical manipulation services NDs perform is similar to chiropractic care, but doesn't qualify as such. While naturopathic doctors go through extensive education and training, not every state issues licenses to naturopathic doctors. Also, naturopathic doctors don't need to complete medical residencies. Therefore, their training isn't comparable to that of a medical doctor. Yet, what Medicare covers is subject to change yearly. The range of what's covered will possibly expand to include visits to an ND. Advantage plans may cover services from NDs in certain states. Does Medicare Cover Osteopathy? Osteopathy isn't the same as naturopathy. In fact, Medicare provides coverage for services from doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO) as well as doctors of medicine (MD). Similar to naturopathy, osteopathy focuses holistically on the body and reduces the utilization of drugs. This type of medicine focuses on manipulating the bones and muscle tissue to promote healing. Yet, that aspect is considered an extra in the training that DOs undergo. DOs obtain the same training as MDs, complete residencies, and are recognized nationwide. Therefore, Medicare covers visits to a DO's office the same way they cover visits to an MD. The DO of your choice must accept [Medicare assignment](/faqs/what-is-medicare-assignment/), and your treatment should be medically necessary for coverage to kick in. Does Medicare Advantage Cover Naturopathy? Medicare Advantage plans must cover at least as much as Medicare. While many of them will follow Medicare standards and opt-out of covering naturopathy, it's not impossible to find a plan that offers more coverage for these services. Take a look at the [plans in your area](/faqs/best-medicare-advantage-plans/) to see if one offers more coverage for naturopathy. Does Medigap Cover Naturopathic Medicine? No, [Medicare Supplement plans](/medicare-supplements/) only cover services Medicare will approve. So, since Medicare doesn't cover naturopathic medicine, your Medigap plan won't either. Those with Medigap will pay for alternative medicine and treatments themselves.
