Editorial Policy | Research Policy Deciding that it's time for detox in order to rid your body of toxins can be a big step. However, the detox process can be overwhelming for a lot of people. How do you know what foods to eat? What kind of symptoms can you expect to experience? How long will it last? If this is your first time detoxing, chances are you'll have a lot of questions and concerns. One of the most common questions we get focuses on the additional vitamin and mineral supplements you should be taking. There are so many to choose from it's hard to decipher which ones are going to be critical to the success of your recovery. Below we highlight the seven most common and useful vitamins and minerals, as well as the foods and herbs they are found in, that will assist your body in the removal of toxins during detoxification. Iron and riboflavin are commonly referred to as vitamin B-2 and offer a lot in terms of detox support. Iron helps in supporting your liver breaking down toxins. Riboflavin also helps to improve the liver detox function. Some foods that are high in both iron and riboflavin include meat, fish, lentils, tofu, almonds, and milk. Vitamins A and D help to support your body during a time of detox, as well as, help to support your body on a day-to-day basis. Vitamin A and D help to nourish and improve the skin. This will help support your body during wound healing, and give you additional protection from the harmful UV rays of the sun. Foods that are high in both vitamin A and D include sweet potatoes, kale, spinach, carrots, eggs, and fish with a high healthy fat content. Vitamins E and C give your body antioxidant protection. This means they help to neutralize free radicals, which can end up doing damage to healthy cells and DNA. Consuming these vitamins are crucial during a detox phase and also for your long-term health. Some foods that are high in both these vitamins include oranges, strawberries, red peppers, olive oil, almonds, and hazelnuts. Your liver is going to be doing a lot of toxin processing. Fat-soluble toxins will need to be processed by the body before they can be excreted. For this reason, you'll want to give your liver extra support with vitamin and mineral supplementation and by eating the proper foods. Common vitamins and minerals that assist in liver detoxification include vitamins A, C, E, K, B1, and B6. Beta-carotene and biotin can also be helpful. Additional liver support can be found by ingesting the following herbs: dandelion, schizandra, milk thistle, garlic, and rosemary. The lymphatic system is responsible for cell cleanup and the detoxing of the blood. Proper lymph system functioning is necessary for a healthy body. During a detox, this system will need extra support. Vitamins that support the lymphatic system include, vitamin A, C, E, and B-6. Common herbs that also help include goldenseal, echinacea, and poke root. Giving your body antioxidant support is crucial during and after the detox process. Vitamins A, E, and D are all antioxidants, along with the minerals copper, zinc, selenium, and zinc. A herb that has antioxidant properties is grape seed. Once your liver has metabolized toxins it's crucial that these toxins are removed from the body. Some of the ways your body removes toxins are through the kidneys via urinating, through the skin via sweating, through the lungs via exhalation, and through the intestines via feces. Whether a medical or natural detox, it's important to give your body elimination support during the process.
