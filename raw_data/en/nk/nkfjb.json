Acupuncture is an important component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). During an acupuncture treatment, small needles are used to stimulate strategic points on your body in order to treat both physical and emotional ailments. TCM is composed of different modalities such as cupping, herbal medicine, Tui Na, Qi Gong, and others, and millions of people have found that acupuncture provides effective relief for many common health concerns. Can Acupuncture Help Me? Here at Mind & Soul Therapy, we offer a wide variety of acupuncture treatments. You might be aware of the mental health benefits associated with acupuncture. It is true that this form of TCM can help ease the symptoms of anxiety, boost your mood, and soothe your brain's response to stress, but did you know that acupuncture also provides many physical health benefits as well? The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) notes that [studies support](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction) that acupuncture treatments can help provide pain relief for certain types of chronic pain. This form of TCM has provided relief for millions of individuals with lower back pain, neck pain, osteoarthritis pain, and other forms of chronic pain. Additionally, it has also been found to help ease muscle tension, providing relief for those who suffer from tension headaches and migraine headaches. How is it possible that these tiny needles can provide an effective, natural method of pain management? The answer lies in neuroscience. Certain types of acupuncture techniques can help encourage the release of neuropeptides. Neuropeptides are an important part of the communication process between your brain and your body. When their release is triggered through acupuncture, something incredible happens: self-healing mechanisms and other amazing physiological effects occur.
