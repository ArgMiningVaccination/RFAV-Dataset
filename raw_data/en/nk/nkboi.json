Since its inception in 1981, the program has maintained as its objective the selection and enrollment of students who have demonstrated excellence in academic and leadership per - formance and have strong potential to become leaders on campus and in the community. The scholarship offers four levels of awards. For the students who entered Georgia Tech as freshmen in fall of 2010, the four-year award amounts were: Georgia resident: and $50,000. To apply for the President's Scholarship, a student must submit the Georgia Tech application for admission by November 1 of their senior year. The most qualified applicants in terms of high school grades, standardized test scores, writing ability, and demonstrated leadership and involvement in activities are selected as scholarship semifinalists. Each semifinalist is sent a supplemental application and interviewed by a Regional Committee in December or January. Approximately 110 of the top-ranked candidates in the competition are invited as finalists to attend the President's Scholarship Weekend on campus in the spring. HOPE -- Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally -- is Georgia's unique program, created by Governor Zell Miller, that rewards students' hard work with financial assistance in degree, diploma, or certificate programs at any eligible Georgia public or private college, university, or public technical institute. HOPE is funded by Georgia's Lottery for Education.

Ever since 1892, when the first football team was organized on The Flats, Georgia Tech teams in all sports have represented the Institute in outstanding fashion while producing some of the best-known names in athletics. Dan Radakovich, the current Director of Athletics, oversees teams in 17 sports, and also the following departments: a Total Person pro - gram, compliance, business, development, finance, accounting, ticketing, marketing, sports information and sports medicine. The most important function of Georgia Tech athletics, however, is academic support. The Georgia Tech Athletic Association is a non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the intercollegiate athletic program at Tech. The Athletic Association is overseen by the Georgia Tech Athletic Board, chaired by the president of the Institute and composed of nine faculty members, three alumni members, and three student members. Radakovich follows in the footsteps of some of the most honored men in college athletics: John Heisman, for whom football's Heisman Trophy is named, William Alexander, Bobby Dodd, Dr. Homer Rice and Dave Braine. Over the past 100 years, Tech has had only 12 head football coaches: John Heisman, Bill Alexander, Bobby Dodd, Bud Carson, Bill Fulcher, Pepper Rodgers, Bill Curry, Bobby Ross, Bill Lewis, George O'Leary, Chan Gailey, and our new head coach, Paul Johnson. Tech has won four National Championships in football in the years 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990. Other major highlights in sports have been two Final Four appearances by the Tech men's basketball team in 1990 and 2004, when the Yellow Jackets reached the NCAA title game, a NWIT women's basketball title in 1992 and a pair of College World Series berths in baseball. The GT Women's Tennis team captured the 2007 NCAA Championship, the first title ever won in an NCAA team championship. In 2008, Amanda McDowell became the first Yellow Jacket tennis player to earn an individual national championship by winning the NCAA Singles title. Some of the most prominent names in Georgia Tech athletic history have been Grand Slam Champion Bobby Jones, former Masters champion Larry Mize, British Open champions David Duval and Stewart Cink in golf; Billy Lothridge, George Morris, Robert Lavette, Maxie Baughan, Marco Coleman, Shawn Jones, Calvin Johnson, and Joe Hamilton in football. Georgia Tech also produced four Olympic gold medal winners in track: Antonio McKay, Derek Mills, Derrick Adkins, and Angelo Taylor, as well as three-time NCAA high jump champion and 2004 U.S. Olympian Chaunte Howard in women's track. Major League baseball stars include graduates Mark Teixeira, Nomar Garciaparra, Kevin Brown and Jason Varitek. Roger Yunkus, Mark Price, John Salley, Kenny Stephon Marbury, Matt Harpring, Jarrett Jack and Chris Bosh all attended Georgia Tech as Men's Basketball student athletes. Tech's facilities rank among the finest in college athletics. Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, one of America's oldest and most recognized football venues, has undergone an expansion and renovation project that raised its capacity to 55,000. Tech boasts Russ Chandler Baseball Stadium, site of NCAA Regional and Super Regional play in 2006, 2009 and previous years. Alexander Memorial Coliseum at the Henry F. McCamish, Jr., Basketball Complex, also known as The Thrillerdome, is home to the men and women's basketball teams. The 2006 NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships were held in the Aquatic Center, which was also home to Olympic swimming and diving events during the 1996 Games. In 2009, the softball team began playing in the Shirley Clements Mewborn Field, and the men's and women's basketball teams moved into a new state-of-the-art practice facility, the Zelnak Center. The hub of Georgia Tech athletics is the Arthur Edge Intercollegiate Athletics Center, which houses administrative and coaching staffs, a dining hall, locker rooms, training and weight facilities and the Andrew Hearn Academic Center. Georgia Tech teams participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference, generally regarded as one of the finest collegiate conferences in the country. The primary purpose of the Athletic Association is to help each student-athlete grow as a person, develop as an athlete, earn a meaningful degree and become a good citizen.

During the 2009-10 school year, 389 student-athletes competed in these sports:STUDENT RELATED INFORMATION115 2010 Georgia Tech Fact Book Source: Office of the President, Alumni AssociationALUMNI ASSOCIATION The Georgia Tech Alumni Association was chartered in June 1908 and incorporated in 1947 as a not-for-profit organization with policies, goals and objectives guided by a board of trustees. The mission of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association is to promote and serve our alumni and the Institute. We will continually create relevant and meaningful programs for current and future alumni to foster lifelong participation and philanthropic support. We will communicate the achievements of the Institute, maintain its traditions and engage the campus community . Underlying all that we do is the belief in the value of education, the commitment to integrity and exceptional customer service, and a pledge that we will perform in a fiscally responsible manner. The association's business can be categorized into four major disciplines: the proactive acquisition and management of information about Tech's alumni and friends; communication to these constituents; engagement of these supporters and fund raising. These disciplines are at the heart of building value for Tech's alumni in their relationships with the Institute. The association is currently organized into five departments: Administration, Marketing & Communications; Alumni Outreach; Events & Campus Relations; and Fund Raising & Business Development. Administration is responsible for three major operations at the association: treasury functions, including accounting, purchasing, finance and budgeting; data management operations, including data and gift entry and maintenance of biographical and gift records for all alumni and friends of the Institute; and technical services for the association' s hardware, information services and management of the facilities and other assets. During FY 2010, Administration processed 102,500 changes affecting 57+ million fields of data in the database and entered more than 40,000 gifts and pledges. Marketing serves a variety of roles in the association. Through its research arm, it provides data and analytics to shape the association's strategies and planning. Through its print and electronic marketing campaigns, it delivers the association's message to constituents and engages alumni, sending over 3.8 million messages during FY 2010. Its web department drives the association's online presence by fostering alumni networking along with communicating relevant news, profiles, videos, photos and events through the association's website, as well as social media presence on LinkedIn, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube. This year, the web department recorded 722,037 user sessions at gtalumni.org and 24,000 users of the association's social media. The Communications Department produces alumni publications and directs the Living History program, which records the personal memories of certain members of the Georgia Tech family. Alumni Publications produces the bimonthly Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine, the primary news link between Georgia Tech and its alumni, with an average print circulation of 84,000. Alumni Publications also produces the association's primary monthly e-newsletter, BUZZwords, sent to an average of 65,000 subscribers. Publications provides supplemental content through the magazine website, gtalumnimag.com, and provides timely news and updates through its blog and Twitter. The Living History program has produced 787 video interviews with alumni, retired Georgia Tech faculty, staff and friends and is focused on gathering relevant oral histories of Tech's alumni and supporters. Alumni Outreach focuses on the engagement and involvement of alumni in support of each other and Geor gia Tech. Advocacy, philanthropy, career services and student recruiting are strategic focal points. Responsibilities include Alumni Career Services, Alumni Groups, Geographic Alumni Clubs and Alumni Travel. For over 80 years, Alumni Career Services has provided job search support for Tech alumni, including job postings and resume database through JacketNet Jobs, career advisement, skill-building workshops and the annual Alumni Career Fair. More than 100 Georgia Tech clubs and affinity groups located throughout the United States and abroad provide opportunities for alumni to network professionally, socialize, recruit students, raise funds and perform community service. The Travel Department led over 25 educational group tours to exciting destinations around the world for over 375 Tech alumni and friends. Events & Campus Relations is responsible for engaging alumni, students and the rest of the Tech community in a variety of ways. The Events team planned and executed approximately 75 of the association's major events and engaged 10,754 members of the Tech community in FY 2010. Events included the George C. Griffin Pi Mile 5k Road Race, Gold & White Honors, Orange Bowl Tailgate and Homecoming among many others. The team partners with other association departments to stage events such as the Burdell- Phoenix Dinner, Alumni Career Fair, association board meetings and student graduation event, Ramblin' On. The Events team also planned one of Georgia Tech's most exclusive events, the Presidents' Dinner, a celebration for Roll Call Leadership Circle donors. The newly-formed Campus Relations department actively engaged 15,226 members of the campus community and 213,036 members through supportive efforts while focusing on its two primary goals. The first is to collaborate with students and various campus organizations to construct and implement a comprehensive student loyalty program. Over the past year, the department has been working with students to form a Student Alumni Association which will be the foundation of this effort. The second is to understand the needs of our campus counterparts and look for ways that we can help them achieve their respective missions through the resources of our association and alumni. The department is coordinating efforts with specific organizations/departments and educating them about what the association does and how we can partner with them on initiatives such as TEAM Buzz, Commencement, recycling and many others. Finally, Campus Relations has been managing the Student Ambassadors and the GT Student Foundation in addition to launching a Student Alumni Association. The Fundraising/Business Development department is responsible for raising monies through the association' s annual Roll Call and for building external revenue streams to support the association' s ability to run its operations. The Business Development department handles advertising and sponsorships, merchandise and affinity relationships with the Association's vendors. Partnering companies include Bank of America, Gas South, AirTran and Liberty Mutual. Roll Call is the single largest source of predictable, unrestricted funds at Georgia Tech, representing the broadest base of support for the Institute. More than 29,000 donors contributed more than $8 million to the 63rd annual Roll Call. Research-driven direct marketing, telemarketing and personal solicitations are used to manage a program that leads all public institutions in the percentage of alumni annual giving. Unrestricted funds provide for student scholarships and financial aid, assist the Institute in recruiting and retaining top faculty and support new academic programs. Offices of the Alumni Association are located in the L. W. \"Chip\" Robert, Jr. Alumni House at 190 North Avenue, Atlanta, GA 30313.
