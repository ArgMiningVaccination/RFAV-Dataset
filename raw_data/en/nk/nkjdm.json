The home department for this c ertificate is the Department of Academic Affairs at the U niversity of Wisconsin -Madison (UW -Madison) School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) and is administered by the Office of Global Health within that department. T he curriculum and policies described in this handbook have been approved by the SMPH . Program requirements may change over time; howe ver, students must meet the requirements in effect when they enter the program. (Exceptions may be granted in consultation with the program director .) Administrative procedures and processes can and do change over time; students are required to follow the procedures and processes listed in the most current handbook regardless of the year of their acceptance into the p rogram. Additional information is available at the OGH website : https://ogh.med.wisc.edu/graduate -professional -capstone - certificates -in-global -health -online/ . Program Description The Capstone Certificate in Global Health Online is designed to advance knowledge and skills among capstone students from any personal and/or professional background who have a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution and an interest in global heal th. The certificate curriculum focuses on global health topics and health issues that transcend national boundaries, with an emphasis on lower -middle income populations. Although \"global health\" is often equated with issues happening internationally, a global lens can also be effectively applied to topics of health and well -being in Wisconsin and other parts of the United States. This global -to-local philosophy is important to the program and ensures that the learning that takes place in the certificate will be applicable to professionals no matter where they ultimately work or volunteer. What will you learn? Historical and contemporary issues of global health How global health activities are governed and financed Different health system models globally How to use global health statistics to profile the health of a country Challenges and options for control of the major infectious and non -infectious disease threats in the world today How to effectively, ethically, and respectfully engage with com munities in culturally appropriate ways What will you gain? Knowledge and skills that equip you to address health challenges and disparities that transcend national boundaries, with an emphasis on lower -middle income settings and underserved populations a nd in a context of cultural diversity at home and abroad 4 Ability to collaborate with partners to help lead advances in global health, from small local projects to multi -disciplinary, multi -sectoral initiatives to enhance the health and well -being of indi viduals, families and communities around the world. Certificate program highlights: Tailored to the needs of special students who want to advance their knowledge and skills in global health Partially asynchronous, online courses that provide global health knowledge across a wide breadth of topics and potential areas of personal interest Instructors who are health professionals with decades of global health experience and connections all around the world Opportunities to work with faculty and on -site mentor s to complete a culminating field experience and understand disease, health, and well -being through multiple lenses. Capstone certificate students have the option of completing a structured, in -depth analysis of a contemporary global health issue in place of an actual field experience if fieldwork is not possible (due, for instance, to family/childcare commitments, work commitments, impediments to travel in their home country, financial constraints, etc.). Certificate Program Learning Objectives Learning objectives for the Capstone Global Health Certificate Online Upon completion of the certificate, students should be able to: 1. Exhibit the ability to describe and compare the health care systems in different areas of the world (such as: an understanding of pros and cons of systems, comparison to the US system, and trends in the evolution of health care systems over time). 2. Demonstrate knowledge of the epidemiology of common global health concerns, both communicable and non -commu nicable (such as: differences between high/middle/low -income countries and programs to mitigate the impacts of these health issues). 3. Demonstrate the ability to integrate information from multiple perspectives into an assessment of a country/location's heal th status (such as: history, politics, culture, societal structure, economics, environmental sciences, health care system[s], health databases, disease epidemiology, human rights, human subjects' protections) . 4. Model ethical behavior in global health engage ment (such as: appreciation of the bidirectional nature of learning and mutual benefits between stakeholders and learners, cultural humility and flexibility, recognition of the importance of program sustainability over time, openness to new information/ide as). 5. Demonstrate professionalism, effective communication, leadership, problem - solving, and collaboration across multiple health education disciplines and stakeholders in addressing a global health issue (including an understanding of One Health approache s). 6. Exhibit the ability for growth in one's approach to global health work through self - assessment and structured reflection (such as: personal biases and perspectives, views on equity and disparities, personal limitations) . 5 Key Individuals and Roles Ann Evensen, MD Certificate Program Director & Faculty Advisor ann.evensen@fammed.wisc.edu Betsy Teigland, Programs Coordinator teigland@wis c.edu James H. Conway, MD Program Advisor & Director of the SMPH Office of Global Health jhconway@wisc.edu Program Completion Expectations Though it is technically possible to complete the certificate's course of study in one year, capstone certificate students , who are often meeting the demands of full - or part -time work while simultaneously pursuing the certificate , should generally allow two to three years to finish the program. It is expected that students will complete the certificate in no more than 4 years . CURRICULUM Course Registration/Enrollment The 11 graduate credit curriculum includes five two -credit on line courses that are partially asynchronous to optimize flexibility for students, plus a mentored field experience.

Financing the Field Experience: Responsibility for funding the global health field experience lies with the student. Depending on the site and duration of the experience, costs could range from $1000 to $4000+, including program fees, travel, UW -Madison tuition, and in -country living expenses. OPTION 1 - Faculty -led Field Courses : Sites include Uganda, Thailand, and Ecuador, though all sites may not be active every year; courses in 2023 will be dependent upon restrictions related to the COVID -19 pandemic and/or 10 other travel and safety issues. Please visit the SMPH Office of Global H ealth website for more information on these graduate -level interdisciplinary field courses . This site will link you to the details of the specific courses on the IAP website. Please note that the deadline for applying for these courses is typically the first Friday in December each year. In addition to completing PUBLHLTH 714, site -specific orientation w ill be required by all students taking part in a faculty -led global health field course. Upon completion of faculty -led field courses, all students must submit to the Certificate program office: 1. Summary of reflections on the field course -The requirement o f journal ing during an experience is intended to encourage student s to reflect on their own responses to the global health experience they undertake . Students are encouraged to reflect on both positive experiences as well as challenges, considering issues related to professionalism, cultural competence, and/or ethics. This may take the form of a self-reflection journal kept throughout the field course pursuant to the requirements of the individual field course , or if a journal was not kept, students should use the template provided in Attachment A . 2. Evaluation of the student by the faculty -led field course instructor (see, Attachment B) 3. Presentation and /or project repo rt required of the field course OPTION 2 - Independent Field Experiences: Students choosing the independent field experience option will typically have had experience traveling and living in low/middle income countries. Independent field experiences are focused on an issue/topic of particular interest to a student and usually take place in a country outside the U.S. where that issue can effectively be addressed but may also be carried out among an international/underserve d population in the United States. Students may also work with international agencies, such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or non -governmental organizations. Students will design an indepen dent field experience at the site of their choice and write a proposal that describes project goals and objectives and outlines a tentative schedule of activities to be reviewed and approved by their chosen faculty advisor and the Certificate Program Direc tor. Please see Appendix for more detailed information. Purely clinical global health experiences do not satisfy the expectations of a global health certificate independent field experience. Certificate field experiences must focus substantially on an iss ue of community/public health of importance in a global health context . Students must register for independent study credit for the field experience in the department of their UW -Madison faculty mentor (a 699 course number in most health sciences and gradu ate departments). Please note: The execution of an Affiliation Agreement between the SMPH/UW -Madison and the field site organization is required for independent study field experiences. Please contact Betsy Teigland, teigland@wisc.edu , to begin this process as soon as a site is selected and at least four months prior to planned departure . 11 Upon completion of an independent field experience, all students must submit to the Certificate program office: 1. Summary of reflections on the field experience -The requirement of journal ing during an experience is intended to encourage student s to reflect on their own responses to the global health experience they undertake . Students are encouraged to reflect on bot h positive experiences as well as challenges, considering issues related to professionalism, cultural competence, and/or ethics. This may take the form of a self-reflection journal kept throughout the field experience, or if a journal was not kept, student s should use the template provided in Attachment A . 2. Evaluation of the student by the on -site preceptor (see Attachment B) 3. Reference -cited, academic paper/project report (see Appendix for details) 4. Site evaluation (see Attac hment C) OPTION 3 - In-depth analysis of a contemporary global health issue (PUBLHLTH 715) If fieldwork is not possible (due, for instance, to family/childcare commitments, work commitments, impediments to travel in their home country, financial constraints, etc.) , please consult with the Certificate Program Director about this option. 12 SATISFACTORY PROGRESS It is expected that all students will complete the Capstone Certificate in Global Health Online in no more than 4 years . For successful completion of the certificate, students must meet the following standard: earn a grade of C or better in A-F graded certificate courses and Satisfactory in Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory graded certificate courses. Grades of Incomplete , Unsatisfactory, below a C (for A -F gra ded courses) or that otherwise fail to meet conditions set by the Certificate Program may result in required remediation activities, academic probation, a hold on future enrollment, or su spension or dismissal from the p rogram. Students may not elect to ta ke a course Pass/Fail for credit toward the certificate. For any course in which a student earns a grade below a C (or an Uns atisfactory) , the course must be repeated. Courses may only be repeated once. Failure to receive a C or higher (or a Satisfactory ) in the repeated course may result in dismissal from the program. Students must do all the work in the repeated course, including completing all assignments, taking examinations, writing papers , and participating in any synchronous activities . The cours e will count only once toward meeting credit re quirements for the Certificate P rogram. Continuation in the Certificate Program is at the discretion of the Program and the SMPH . Failure to meet the academic expectations of the Certificate Program outlined above or the expected standards of professional, academic, and nonacademic conduct outlined below are grounds for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from the Certificate Program. Graduate Assistantships and Enrollment in Courses/Programs Outside of the Capstone Certificate in Global Health Online The UW campus has adopted a policy regarding graduate students enrolled in 131 programs (this includes the Capstone Certificate in Global Health Online) who are ALSO pursuing gra duate assistantships ( UW-1029 The Graduate Assistantship Policy for Students Enrolled in Academic Programs Approved for Service -Based Pricing).

For successful completion of the certificate, students must meet the following standards: earn a grade of 2.0 or better in courses counting for credit toward the certificate; maintain a cumulative grade -point average (GPA) of 2.00 (on a 4.00 scale) or better during and at completion of the program for courses used to meet certifica te requirements; and, earn a grade of Satisfactory in Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory graded certificate courses. 17 Grades of Incomplete, Unsatisfactory, Fail/No Credit, or that otherwise fail to meet conditions set by the Certificate Program may result in required remediation activities, academic probation, a hold on future enrollment, or su spension or dismissal from t he program. In addition to the requirements outlined in this policy, students must meet the academic standards set by their applicable primary degree program . Continuation in the Certificate Program is at the discretion of the Program and the School of Me dicine and Public Health. Failure to meet the Program's academic expectations can result in disciplinary action , up to and including dismissal from the Program. If a student is not making satisfactory progress in regards to academic expectations, the Pro gram will determine if remediation or dismissal is recommended. Students who have been dismissed from the Program for academic reasons may petition for appeal as set forth in the Appeals Process outlined below. Academic Misconduct Students at the University of Wisconsin -Madison are expected to uphold the core values of academic integrity which include honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. (https ://students.wisc.edu/student -conduct/misconduct/academic -integrity/ ) The following information includes examples of Academic and Non -academic Misconduct; however, it is important to understand that these examples are not all -inclusive, and in fact represe nt a few brief illustrations. Not all violations are considered equal and the severity of the penalty will determine the sanction. Serious offenses may lead to prompt dismissal from the program.

Much of graduate educa tion is carried out not in classrooms, but in laboratories and other research venues, often supported by federal or other external funding sources. Indeed, it is often difficult to distinguish between academic misconduct and cases of research misconduct. At UW -Madison, misconduct in scholarly research is defined as fabrication (making up data), falsification (changing or misreporting data), plagiarism (representing work of others as your own), or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scholarly community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research (https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW -869). The Graduate School is responsible for investigating allegati ons of research misconduct. This is often done in consultation with the Division of Student Life as well as with federal and state agencies to monitor, investigate, determine 20 sanctions, and provide training about the responsible conduct of research. For more information, contact the Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Policy, 333 Bascom Hall, 608 -262-1044. Areas of responsible conduct of research defined by the UW -Madison Graduate School include: animal care and use in research; authorship; conflict of interest; human research protections; intellectual property rights; misconduct of research; patents; research regulatory compliance; and, safety (biological, chemical, radiation).

This document further provides the formal procedures for objective, consistent review and adjudication of such grievances if they cannot be resolved through preliminary informal measures. A grievance is defined as a complaint made by a student alleging that the student received a grade or academic evaluation that was arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory - i.e., unfairly based on race, gender, religion, personal animus, or any other factor(s) other than objective assessment of th e student's academic performance and/or the student's compliance with his or her Program's Professional Behavior Code. The Grievance Board is the committee of UW -Madison SMPH faculty and staff that provides formal review and adjudication of Grievances whe n informal resolution measures are unsuccessful. 1. SMPH students have the right to fair and equitable treatment with respect to grading and evaluation, and may dispute a grade that they feel was awarded unfairly. 2. Students are expected to make reasonable efforts to resolve Grievances informally and directly, but if those efforts fail, any student may file a request for a Grievance hearing. 3. The student and Program will follow the SMPH Health Profession Program Grie vance Procedure (see below) for formal resolution of any Grievance. Grievance Procedure: Informal Resolution 1. Students should first attempt to resolve a Grievance informally with the Certificate Program or instructional faculty or staff member directly involved in the matter within thirty (30) days of receiving the disputed grade. 2. If the student feels the Grieva nce was insufficiently addressed, or, due to the nature of the grievance, is uncomfortable interacting directly with the faculty or staff member involved, the student should contact the person responsible for the course, e.g., the course director or clerks hip/clinical director/administrator, for resolution according to individual course grading policies on grade disputes. 3. If the course -level review process does not resolve the Grievance, the student may request a review by the Graduate/Professional/Capstone Certificate in Global Health Program Director. 4. The student's request for review must be in an email or written letter and include the reasons the student believes the grade or evaluation was unfair. 5. The Program Director will attempt to resolve the Grievan ce through informal mediation with the parties involved within ten (10) business days of receiving the student's written request for review. 6. Following this review, the person responsible for the course makes the final decision. 22 7. The course director will inf orm the student of the final decision by telephone and/or email within 24 hours of the decision, to be followed within five (5) business days by a written letter. 8. If the Grievance has still not been resolved to the student's satisfaction, he or she may request a formal Grievance hearing as outlined below. Formal Resolution 1. Any student wishing to request a Grievance hearing must do so in an email or written letter to their Program Director. The request must be submitted within seven (7) calendar days of re ceiving written notification of the final decision by the course director as outlined above. Petitions received after this time will not be considered. For clarity, a student receiving written grade/evaluation notification on a Tuesday has until midnight on the following Tuesday to submit their petition. 2. Requests for Grievance hearings must outline the student's basis of the Grievance, the person(s) against whom the Grievance is filed (\"Respondent(s)\"), the informal resolution efforts made thus far, and t he remedy or correction requested. 3. The Program Director will review the student's written statement for timeliness and completeness and to determine whether grounds for reconsideration have been reasonably established. If grounds for reconsideration have not been established, the final decision of the course director will be upheld. If grounds for reconsideration have been established, the Program Director will notify the student and Respondent(s) and provide the Respondent(s) with a copy of the student's request for a hearing. 4. The Grievance Board shall be convened for a hearing within four (4) weeks of the student's request, at a time that is mutually agreeable to the Grievance Board members and both parties. A quorum of at least two -thirds (2/3) voting Grievance Board members must be able to attend the hearing in person. 5. The Grievance Board shall be comprised of the following members: Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and Services Associate Dean for Public Health Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Education Director Continuing Professional Development Doctor of Physical Therapy Program Director Genetic Counseling Program Director Master of Public Health Associate Program Director Physician Assist ant Program Director Graduate/Professional/Capstone Certificate in Global Health Online Program Director Administrative Director of Academic Affairs 6. The Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs shall serve as Chair of the Grievance Board and does not vo te unless the Grievance Board is tied. The Chair cannot overrule a majority decision of the Grievance Board. 7. At least ten (10) business days prior to the hearing, both parties will provide the Chair of the Grievance Board with any additional documentat ion to be presented at the hearing. Each party may have one support person at the hearing whose name and relationship to the party must be identified in writing to the Chair at this time. 23 8. At least five (5) business days prior to the Grievance hearing , the chair will provide the parties and the Grievance Board members with the following: a. The names of the parties b. The nature of the issues to be heard and any relevant policies c. The date, time, and place of the hearing d. The names of each party's support pers on, if any 9. To protect the confidentiality of the parties, the Grievance hearing shall be closed to the public unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties. The student, Respondent(s) and any support people may attend the entire Grievance hearing othe r than the Grievance Board's deliberations. 10. The parties may confer with their respective support person, but the support person may not address the Grievance Board, question witnesses, or otherwise participate in the hearing. 11. The chair must recognize indiv iduals before they speak. Once recognized, a party may speak without interruption, though the chair may announce and enforce time limits on each party to present its case. 12. The Grievance hearing will proceed as follows: a.

The Re spondent(s) makes their statement relevant to the Grievance and answers questions from the Grievance Board and student; e. Each party may refute any stateme nt by the other party and make a closing statement; f. Chair excuses parties and support people; and g. The Grievance Board deliberates in closed session. 13. Determinations of the Grievance Board are based on a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard where the student bears the burden of proof. Specifically, the student must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the grade or evaluation was based up on factor(s) other than objective assessment of the student's academic performance and/or the student's compliance with the Program's Professional Behavior Code. The Grievance Board should strive to reach consensus on a workable solution with a final determination made by simple majority as a last course of action. 14. If the Grievance Board finds that the student's Grievance has merit and that redress is possible, it will direct the Program Director to implement an appropriate remedy. If the Grievance Board finds that the Grievance is without merit, it will so inform the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and the decision of the course director will stand final. 24 The Program Director will notify the student of the Grievance Board's decision by telepho ne and/or email within 24 hours of the Grievance hearing, to be followed within five (5) bu siness days by a written letter. 15. Details discussed during the Grievance hearing and the outcome are private and will only be disclosed as permitted by the Family Ed ucational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), 20 U.S.C. s. 1232g.

If you have a grievance regarding unfair treatment towards yourself, please reference the procedures and resources identified above. If you learn about, observ e, or witness misconduct or other wrongdoing you may be required to report that misconduct or abuse. Depending on the situation, it may be appropriate to consult with your advisor, Graduate Program Coordinator, or other campus resources (such as the UW Office of Equity and Diversity , Graduate School , Mc Burney Disability Resource As sistance , Ombuds Office , and University Health Services ). Research Misconduct Reporting The University of Wisconsin -Madison strives to foster the highest scholarly and ethical standards among its students, faculty, and staff. Graduate students and research associates are among the most vulnerable groups when reporting misconduct because their source of financial support and the progress in their careers ma y be at risk by raising questions of wrongdoing. They are also often the closest witnesses to wrongdoing when it occurs and therefore must be appropriately protected from the consequences of reporting wrongdoing and be informed of their rights. Please fin d full details a t: https://research.wisc.edu/respolcomp/resethics/ Academic Misconduct Reporting If you know a classmate is cheating on an exam or other academic exercise, notify your profes sor, teaching assistant or proctor of the exam. As a part of the university community, you are expected to uphold the standards of the university. Also, consider how your classmate's dishonesty may affect the overall grading curve and integrity of the pr ogram. Sexual Assault Reporting UW-Madison prohibits sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. These offenses violate UW -Madison policies and are subject to disciplinary action. Sanctions can range from reprimand to expulsion from UW -Madison. In many cases, these offenses also violate Wisconsin criminal law and could lead to arrest and criminal prosecution. Students who experience sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking have many options and services avai lable to them on and off campus, including mental health counseling, victim advocacy and access to the criminal and campus disciplinary systems. For a list a confidential support and reporting options, ple ase visit https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/survivor -resources/ . Faculty, staff, teaching assistants, and others who work directly with students at UW -Madison are required by law to report first -hand kno wledge or disclosures of sexual assault to university officials for statistical purposes. In addition, disclosures made to certain university emp loyees, such as academic advisors or university administrators, may be forwarded to the campus Title IX coordin ator for a response. For -assault -dating -and-domestic UW -Madison employee (under Wisconsin Executive Order #54 ), you are required to immediately report child abuse or neglect to Chi ld Protective Services (CPS) or law enforcement if, in the course of employment, the employee observes an incident or threat of child abuse or neglect, or learns of an incident or threat of child abuse or neglect, and the employee has reasonable cause to b elieve that child abuse or neglect has occurred or will occur. Volunteers working for UW -Madison sponsored programs or activities are also expected to report suspected abuse or neglect. Please find full details at : https://youthsafety.wisc.edu/report -child -abuse/ . Reporting and Response to Incidents of Bias/Hate The University of Wisconsin -Madison values a diverse community where all members are able to participate fully in the Wisconsin Exp erience. Incidents of Bias/Hate affecting a person or group create a hostile climate and negatively impact the quality of the Wisconsin Experience for community members. UW -Madison takes such incidents seriously and will investigate and respond to reporte d or observed incidents of bias/hate. Please find at: https://doso.students.wisc.edu/report -an-issue/bias -or-hate-reporting/ . 30 Appendix Capstone Certificate in Global Health Online Guidelines for Global Health Independent Field Experience s Updated July 8, 2022 Certificate students may choose to design an independent field experience at a site of their choice. Students choosing the independent field experience option will typically have had experience traveling and living in low/middle income countries. Indepen dent field experiences are focused on an issue/topic of particular interest to a student and usually take place in a country outside the U.S. where that issue can effectively be addressed but may also be carried out among an international/underserved popul ation in the United States. Students may also undertake work with international agencies as an independent field experience, e.g., the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or non - governmental organ izations. Students must identify both a UW -Madison academic advisor and a local site preceptor. PUBLHLTH 714 must be completed prior to undertaking an independent field experience. Select a Focus and Site for the Field Experience Students should develop a global health topic of interest and begin site selection by considering locations where local health issues will provide a learning environment related to their topic. Students should learn about the health status of their chosen country/site; international organizations and programs already working on their topic of interest at the site; and, general information about health care delivery and population demographics for the site . Students may find useful information at the SMPH Office of Global Health website , (https://ogh.med.wisc.edu/resources/ ). Once students have completed their own preliminary investigations , they are encouraged to consult wi th global health faculty and others who have relevant experience or contacts. When choosing a site, health and safety risks in a potential location should be carefully considered - see https://internationaltravel.wisc.edu/ and the information below for more details. Consideration of Travel to Warning List Countries All UW -Madison students are -policy/ . This policy precludes university - affiliated student travel to locations under a current U.S. Department of State (DoS) Level 3 or Level 4 advisory designation; those specifically designated as a \"travel warning\" location by the Provost; or, that is under a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Warning Level 3 notice. The U.S. State Department Tr avel Warning list can be found at: https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html . 31 Students who wish to pursue study in locations listed on one of these warning lists can seek exemption by submitting a waiver request: Travel Warning Waiver Request Form . These requests are processed through the SMPH Office of Global Health, and we recommend submission at least four months prior to the planned study. The request will be reviewed by a committee of SMPH faculty and if approved, then reviewed by the Universi ty International Travel Committee and the Office of the International Safety & Security Director. Possible reasons for granting an exemption include: student will be pursuing a unique educational experience that cannot be gained elsewhere and that is directly related to their graduate studies or career plans; student is a citizen of the country in question; student has considerable experience in the country in question. Students are discouraged from purchasing airline tickets or any other related financia l transfers prior to formal approval. For more information, please contact Betsy Teigland (teigland@wisc.edu , 1191F HSLC). In all cases, students should periodically consult the U.S. State Department (http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/al ertswarnings.html ) and CDC (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices ) websites for warning and notice updates on the country they will be visiting. Select a UW -Madison Academic Advisor and Field Preceptor Students must identify a UW -Madison academic advisor AND a field preceptor for their independent field experience; this should happen as early as possible in the planning of a field experience. Certificate program staff can assist students to identify an appropriate advisor for their work. Submit Field Experience Proposal Once students have identified a topic and site of interest , an academic advisor , and a field preceptor, they work with the Certificate Director to prepare a field experience proposal . The proposal describes the go als and objectives of the field experience, outlines activities that will be carried out, defines the product (s) of the experience ( e.g., summary paper and presentation) , and includes basic information about the location country and the proposed dates for the experience. The proposal must be approved by the academic advisor and the field preceptor , as well as the Certificate Director to ensure that it will meet the certificate field ex perience requirements. Note: projects that involve human subjects and require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, animal use approvals, or other regulatory oversight may require much more preparation time. Contact Programs Coordinator Regarding Independent Field Experience Affiliation Agreements All students completing independent field experiences are required by the SMPH to have an affiliation agreement in place between the field site organization and the 32 SMPH/University of Wisconsin -Madison. Such an affiliation agreement outlines the expectations and responsibilities of the student, the field site organization, and the SMPH/UW -Madison. As soon as the field experience site is identified, students should contact Betsy Teigla nd, teigland@wisc.edu , in the SMPH Office of Global Health to initiate the agreement process. Some sites have existing institutional affiliate agreements which may simplify the process, but students and their ad visor/mentor will still be responsible for working with administrative staff to ensure that these are current and applicable. Note that for new sites it may be a time -consuming process to execute the agreements, so please begin as early as possible in fie ld experience planning (at least 8 weeks ahead of departure for the field site). *** Note: purely clinical global health experiences do NOT satisfy the expectations of a global health certificate independent field experience. Certificate field experiences must focus substantially on an issue of community/public health of importance in a global health context. Register for Independent Global Health Independent Study Credit Students must register for independent study credit for the field experi ence in the department of their UW -Madison faculty mentor (a 699 course number in most health sciences and graduate departments). Contact Betsy Teigland, teigland@wisc.edu for assistance in registering for 699s. General roles of the Student, UW -Madison Faculty Advisor, Field Preceptor, and Certificate Program Staff Student: complete all academic and administrative requirements ; comply with all applicable UW-Madison policies for interna tional travel , professionalism, academic and nonacademic conduct (including those of the Certificate Program and those of the university at -large); d emonstrate culturally appropriate professional and personal behavior in all activities during the field exp erience UW Academic Advisor: provide advice, support, consultation , and feedback to the student regarding academic preparation, site selection , topic area , and the field experience proposal ; grade the final paper/presentation ; submit the student's overall course grade Field Preceptor: provide input into the field experience proposal ; orient, support and conscientiously supervise the student throughout the field experience ; model professional work habits and attitudes ; evaluate the student 's performance using preceptor assessment form Certificate Program Faculty and Staff: serve as a resource regarding field experience requirements and responsibilities for students, faculty and preceptors ; verify compliance with administrative require ments for international travel ; review the student's field experience reflection summary, field experience paper, site evaluation , and preceptor evaluation of the student 33 Administrative Requirements to be Completed Prior to Beginning t he Field Experience Independent field experiences are administered by the SMPH Office of Global Health. For independent field experiences, students must submit the following information and forms (forms are contained in the \"Independent Study Packet\") to the SMPH Office of Global Health office at least 8 weeks before departure: 1) Confirmation of registration for credit 2) SMPH Office of Global Health Approval Form 3) Student Agreement Form 4) Approval Letter from field site preceptor/ organization 5) Contact Information 6) CISI (insurance REQUIRED by the UW System ) - Contact Betsy Teigland in the SMPH Office of Global Health office to ensure that CISI enrollment is through the correct unit. 7) Health Self -Assessment 8) Statement of Responsibility 9) Co py of airline itinerary 10) Copy of passport photo/signature page (Plan ahead: your passport must be valid for at least 6 months past your anticipated date of return to the United States. Also ensure you have a valid VISA if a VISA is required for the cou ntry(ies) to which you will be traveling or transiting through .) Please contact Betsy Teigland, teigland@wisc.edu to request an \"Independent Study Packet\". Academic Components to Submit after the Field Experience The Programs Coordinator of the Certificate in Global Health Online will monitor completion of requirements for the field experience. In addition to turning in assignments to the academic advisor, copies of all items described below should be submitted to the SMPH Office of Global Health Programs Coordinator (Betsy Teigland) by the student. The academic advisor will assign a grade for the independent study course credit for the experience . 1) Reflection summary : The requirement of jo urnaling during an experience is intended to encourage students to reflect on their own responses to the global health experience they undertake. Students are encouraged to reflect on both positive experiences as well as challenges, considering issues rel ated to professionalism, cultural competence, and/or ethics. Submission of a summary of reflections on the field course/experience may take the form of a self -reflection journal kept throughout the field course/experience, or if a journal is not kept, stud ents should use the template provided in Attachment A . 2. Preceptor evaluation : A brief report from the field preceptor (this may be submitted via e-mail) should comment on the student's performance in the planned tasks, as well as professionalism and cros s-cultural skills. It is the responsibility of the student to assure that the preceptor report is filled out and submitted on time to the Certificate Programs Coordinator. (See Attachment B for preceptor evaluation form.) 34 3. Site evaluation : Students are a sked to fill out an evaluation of the field experience site. This is particularly useful to the program in advising future students on potential field sites. (See Attachment C for the site evaluation form.) 4. Reference -cited field experience report : Stud ents are required to prepare a summary report about the field experience. Whenever possible this report should be shared with international colleagues in addition to being submitted to the UW -Madison faculty advisor and the Certificate Programs Coordinator . o The written report should be approximately five pages in length (not including the references) and should include a concise summary of project objectives and outcomes of the field experience, with background information about the site and its health status as is appropriate to the topic. The student should include reference citation s to any information/facts/opinions of others that are cited in the text as in any professional paper, including but not limited to, health data about the country and problems addressed, the information or evidence -base that provided a foundation for their work, and any other sources that were used to carry out the work. Students who plan to prepare a paper for publication may submit a draft in the format specified f or an identified journal. Financing the Field Experience Responsibility for funding the global health field experience lies with the student. Depending on the site and duration of the experience, costs could range from $1000 to $4000+, including program fees, travel, UW -Madison tuition, and in -country living expenses. Attachments: A. Guidelines for reflection summary; B. Preceptor Evaluation form; C. Site Evaluation form 35 Attachment A: Reflection Summary Guidelines UW-Madison SMPH Office of Global Health Journaling is a tool that allows for deep reflection on educational experiences and helps to solidify and synthesize new learning and prior knowledge. For students who regularly keep a self-reflection journal throughout the field experience, they may submit that journal. For students who do not regularly keep a journal, a reflection summary can be prepared following the template below. A journal or reflection summary helps the SMPH Office of Global Health to document and evaluate , in part, the student's achievement of the certificate Learning Objectives related to planning and participation in the practical aspects of the field experience as well as demonstrating professionalism, cultural sensitivity, humility, and adaptability. Reflection summaries should contain at least (3) reflections: one from the beginning of the experience , one from t he middle of the experience, and one at the end of the experience . In each case there will be two standard questions that are to be answered each time, as well as some additional questions that vary. Beginning of the Field Experience: REFLECTION 1 1) RATE YOURSELF on each of the following skills related to professionalism and cross - cultural experiences as you began your field experience (see page 4 for the full list of Educational Benchmarks and Learning Objectives). Use scale ratings from 1 to 5 (with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent): Active listening (listening for meaning rather than just the words) ____ Use of foreign language or interpreter __ __ Cultural humility ____ Professionalism ____ Conflict resolution ____ 2) Please comment on one or two of these skills. Briefly explain why you rated yourself the way you did. What areas would you like to improve on and how would you plan to make those improvements? 3) Describe one challenge and one exchange/event that you enjoye d or are proud of in relation to your interactions across cultures (e.g., cross cultural differences , demonstrating cultural humility ) in previous work/travel . Why did this experience have such a big impact on you? Please limit the response to no more th an one (1) page. 36 4) What were your thoughts/views on the role of community in health, based on personal experience or previous coursework as you beg an your field experience ? 5) Please outline some of your beliefs. For example, (you do not need to address all of these): Identify your own cultural and family beliefs and values. Define your own personal culture/identity, e.g., ethnicity, age, experience, education, socio -economic status, gender, sexual orientation, religion. Are you aware of your per sonal biases and assumptions about people with different values than yours? Describe a time when you became aware of being different from other people. ............................................. ..................................................................................... ........... Midpoint in the Field Experience: REFLECTION 2 1) RATE YOURSELF on each of the following skills related to professionalism and cross - cultural experiences at the midpoint of your field experience (see page 4 for the full list of Educational Ben chmarks and Competencies). Use scale ratings from 1 to 5 (with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent): Active listening (listening for meaning rather than just the words) ____ Use of foreign language or interpreter __ __ Cultural humility ____ Professionalism ____ Conflict resolution ____ 2) Please comment on one o r two of these skills. Briefly explain why you rated yourself the way you did. What areas would you like to improve on and how would you plan to make those improvements ? 3) Describe one challenge and one exchange/event that you enjoyed or are proud of in relation to your interactions across cultures (e.g., cross cultural differences, demonstrating cultural humility ) that you have encountered so far during your field experience . Why did this experience have such a big impact on you? Please limit the response to no more than one (1) page. 37 4) How do you understand equity as sp ecifically related to access to health care? Based on your experience s, what were the barriers to access that you see at your field site ? What are strengths of this system with regard to access? Please compare the U .S. and the country you were in for the Field Experience. 5) Reflect on the benefits and challenges of working as part of an interdisciplinary team. What role do you see yourself playing in a team? Where do you and your discipline fit? (Please answer in relation to your field experience; if your field experience was not explicitly multidisciplinary, answer in terms of your overall beliefs/ideas.) ............................................. ....................................................................... ......................... End of Field Experience: REFLECTION 3 1) RATE YOURSELF on each of the following skills related to professionalism and cross - cultural experiences as you completed your field experience (see page 4 for the full list of Educational Benchmarks and Competencies). Use scale ratings from 1 to 5 (with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent): Active listening (listening for meaning rather than just the words) ____ Use of foreign language or interpreter __ __ Cultural humility ____ Professionalism ____ Conflict resolution ____ 2) Please comment on one o r two of th ese skills.

Why did this experience have such a big impact on you? Please limit the response to no more than one (1) page. 4) Short -term \"mission\" models of global health intervention are rarely an optimal approach for long-term improvements; instead, sustainability should be strived for in programs. In this regard, reflect on the sustainability of the programs /interventions you observed and/or participated in during your field experience , including your UW-Madison program. 5) Reflect on your overall experience s in your field experience . How did these experiences reinforce or change your thinking , understanding of , or beliefs about global health ? 38 Reflection Summary Guidelines for Assessment Entries must be legible. This means typed or clearly written with dark ink and large letters. Entries must be coherent (well organized with clearly expressed ideas) . Assessment of the Reflection Summary is based on a 20 -point scale related to responsiveness to the questions asked, synthesis of learning, thoughtful reflection of knowledge , and id entification of areas for personal growth. ASSESSMENT RUBRIC 5 Points 3 Points 1 Point Responded to Questions Addresses all of the questions . Draws on previous course material and/or past experiences, and links this information to the current field experience. Responds to most of the questions. Draws some from previous course material and/or past experiences and makes some links to the current field experience. Responds to only a few questions. Does not bring in previous course material and/or past experiences and does not link these to the current field experience. Synthesis of learning Demonstrates strong synthesis of new learning and past experiences. Identifies new learning , but demonstrates minimal synthesis to past experiences. Limited recognition of new learning and no synthesis to prior knowledge . Reflection of knowledge Reflects on past experiences, knowledge , lectures , and current field experiences and learning. Some reflection on past experiences, knowledge , lectures , and current field experiences. Little to no reflection on past experiences, knowledge , lectures, and current field experiences. Identification of areas for personal growth Identifies strengths, misconceptions, questions, and weaknesses to result in a thoughtful statement of areas for growth. Identifies some strengths, misconceptions, questions, and weaknesses, but does not prepar e a well - thought -out statement of areas for growth. Does not identify strengths, misconceptions, questions, and weaknesses ; does not present a statement of areas for growth.
