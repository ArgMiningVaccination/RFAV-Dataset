Menopause is a normal part of aging in most females over the age of 40. It happens when the ovaries no longer release an egg every month and menstruation stops. Having said that, some women can go through menopause early or premature menopause. It can be because of hysterectomy surgery or damaged ovaries due to procedures like chemotherapy. Andropause in men is a condition that is associated with the decrease in the male hormone known as testosterone. As men get older, the level of testosterone in the body and production of sperm decreases. Approximately 30% of men in their 50s will experience this. Some studies also state that testosterone decreases about 10% every decade after men reach the age of 30. With these low levels of testosterone, men will experience physical and psychological symptoms. Unlike menopause the decrease in testosterone and the development of symptoms is more gradual than what occurs in women. What are the symptoms? For females, the degenerative hormones affects both the body and mind. Common symptoms includes the following: - hot flashes throughout the body - sweating on hands and feet especially at night - fatigue - palpitations - insomnia - lack of appetite - sagging breasts - dry or thin skin - memory loss (especially short-term memory) In some cases, it might trigger early stage dementia or Alzheimer's. It can also affect the mind and create anxiety, fear, irritation, lack of self-confidence, paranoia and inability to adapt to changes. For males, abnormalities that occur may not be as obvious and severe as females. Common symptoms for Andropause are as follows: - profusion sweating - insomnia - weight gain - depression - lack of sexual interest However, the key concern in men when reaching Andropause is impotence or erectile dysfunction. This issue has tremendous effects on men's mental status, self-confidence and may affect relationships. Treatments The conventional treatment guideline for menopause is synthetic hormone replacement. This is to rebalance the hormone levels in the body to be equivalent to that of a 25-35 year old. However, synthetic hormones, whether they are estrogen or progesterone, can be harmful. It cannot be use for more than 5 years as it has a high tendency to cause breast cancer, cervical cancer or colon cancer. In integrative medicine, we restore hormone levels using nature-like hormones by relying on the laboratory analytical results and individually producing them to meet each client's needs. This will help reduce side effects. The doctor will calculate the dose of hormones accordingly as well as solve the problem at the source by detoxifying toxins from the body, strengthening immunity with essential vitamins and minerals. This is combined with the procedure of cells restoration by using brain cells and pituitary gland cells to repair plus restore the brain function. This will enable the pituitary gland to create hormones naturally by reviving the cells that create hormones, maintaining the organs, stimulating the ovaries to work and prolong the production of hormones without causing any risks. There are several types of treatments for Andropause. The treatment for male hormone therapy can in the form of cream, oral medication, sublingual medication, or injectable. Chelation is one treatment that has high efficacy, it helps detox accumulated heavy metal toxins and provide good results as well as treat secondary conditions like erectile dysfunction which is one of the side effect of Andropause. It stimulates blood circulation and can correct the problem. Biomolecular therapy in turn uses specific peptide nutrients to repair and restore the testicular cells. This is the area where the degenerative or affected male hormones will be divided to replace the cells that have expired. Sadly for males, there is no definite timeframe once Andropause symptoms starts. If the symptoms are serious or prolonged, it can have an adverse effect on one's quality of life.
