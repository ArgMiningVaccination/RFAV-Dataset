As it is with all of my patients, my goal is to help them heal and achieve outstanding health.

I help my patients reduce their toxic load using various drainage methods, followed by deeper detoxification. The drainage methods I employ and teach my patients to make a part of their overall healthy lifestyle, stimulate the liver, kidneys, colon, lymphatic system, and the skin\u2014all of which are your body's organs of elimination. Among the self-care approaches you can use to accomplish drainage is starting your day by drinking 12 to16 ounces of pure, filtered water mixed with the juice of a fresh-squeezed organic lemon. Do this at least 10 minutes before you eat breakfast. I recommend doing this every morning, along with drinking additional healthy water throughout the day (at least 64 ounces total). Eating a plentiful supply of fresh, organic vegetables each day is also recommended. Such foods act as natural cleansers and are rich in fiber, nutrients, and enzymes. Eat them raw or lightly steamed, and try to \"eat the rainbow,\" meaning make it a point to consume vegetables of different colors. I also advise dry skin brushing to stimulate your body's lymphatic system and promote healthy skin, obtaining at least 8 hours of restorative sleep (go to bed each night no later than 11 pm, ideally earlier), and taking care to manage your stress. Practicing deep breathing a few times each day for 5 to 10 minutes or more is a very helpful tool, both for further stimulating your lymphatics and for relieving stress. After a few weeks of following these and other drainage methods, it is time to move into the detoxification phase. During the drainage phase, you will be priming your organs to release toxins. The detoxification phase involves removing toxins from their binding sites in the tissues and organs. As these toxins are removed, they enter the lymphatic system, followed by the bloodstream, and are then eliminated in the urine and stool. Many patients and physicians alike ignore the drainage phase and jump right into the detoxification phase. This is a mistake. Attempting detoxification without first doing drainage can make people very sick, because the organs of elimination cannot handle this toxic load. Instead, as toxins are dislodged from the tissues, they can overwhelm the elimination organs, causing the toxins to back up in the lymphatics and bloodstream, where they cause havoc. So, it's best if you can undertake drainage and detoxification under the supervision of a health care practitioner who is trained in both methods. You can also find further tips and recommendations in my book, Outstanding Health. GOING DEEPER WITH HOMEOPATHY While the processes of drainage and detoxification, properly undertaken, will reduce toxicity, sometimes patients' organ function may still be suboptimal and susceptible to future physical, environmental, nutritional, and emotional stressors. In such cases, the body's tissues and organs, despite now having a reduced toxic burden, are still in need of regeneration. Regeneration is defined as the natural renewal of a cell, tissue, or organ. Life consists of catabolic and anabolic processes. In catabolic processes, energy is created. In the anabolic phase, cells are created anew. To achieve optimal organ regeneration, we need to ensure that energy production in the body's trillions of cells occurs most efficiently, while also supporting the creation of new cells so that they are ideally healthier than the old cells they are replacing. Each of the different tissues of your body has its own natural life cycle. Your stomach creates a new lining every five days. Skin replaces itself every 30 days. Red blood cells have a lifespan of 120 days. In addition, each of your organs, and the cells and tissues that comprise them, have their own specific \"energy frequencies.\" Optimizing their frequencies is essential to organ regeneration. Based on my experience practicing Energy Medicine, one of the most effective therapies for achieving the twin goals of healthy energy production and the creation of new, healthy cells is homeopathy. Homeopathy is also ideal for balancing and restoring the organs' energy frequencies, making it a most appropriate method of regeneration. Why use homeopathy for regeneration, you may ask? Why not use nutritional supplements, herbs, vitamins, minerals, and food for regeneration? To answer this, we need to briefly review the biophysics of regeneration. Unlike most therapies in the fields of both conventional and integrative medicine, which interact with and affect the body's biochemistry, homeopathy operates on a bioenergetic level. Bioenergy supersedes biochemistry, meaning that both health and disease first occur in the body's energy field before showing up within the body itself. Simply put, healthy people have vibrant energy fields, while people who are ill have weaker energy fields. The same is true of healthy and unhealthy cells, tissues, and organs. Each organ system, while connected to the essential life force (or Qi) of a person, is also a unique bioenergy system, vibrating at a certain resonant frequency. An imbalance in the organ's frequency represents a disturbance in its bioenergy and slows the process of doing what it inherently is programmed to do\u2014that is to regenerate and renew itself. In order to stimulate regeneration, cells and organs need a specific input of a cell- or organspecific frequency. They need the right amount of energy coupled with the right message. The ideal regenerative formula is a booster shot of subtle energy, which imprints the specific energy pattern into the matrix of that organ system, creating a message which ultimately returns that organ system to its natural resonant frequency. The best way to stimulate this process is by homeopathy.We must remember that the concentrations of the key nutrients and hormones in the blood and in the intracellular fluid are expressed in milliosmoles. Homeopathy also deals with micro concentrations of substances that are necessary for cellular health to be sustained and renewed. Vitamins, minerals, foods, and herbs need to be digested, processed, and assimilated, requiring energy before they can be converted to the ultra-diluted form that can then be used by the body. Many sick patients are already energy depleted and would greatly benefit from homeopathic micro doses that would conserve their energy. In addition, homeopathic remedies work to further stimulate drainage and detoxification of organs, while also stimulating regeneration and renewal of the organs' cells and tissues. As an important added benefit, homeopathy helps to balance patients' metabolism by bioenergetically stimulating the thyroid, adrenal, and other endocrine glands to maximize their function. The ideal regenerative remedy is a booster shot of subtle energy, which imprints the proper energy pattern into the matrix of that organ system, producing a message that ultimately returns that organ system to its natural resonant frequency. The best way to stimulate this process is again, by homeopathy. THE REGENRX PITUITARY FORMULA: MY PRACTICE Based on my personal experience proving homeopathy's effectiveness, I have made homeopathy a central part of my overall medical practice and have developed a product line of homeopathic remedies, called RegenRx formulas from Apex Energetics. These homeopathic formulas are intended to strengthen these energetically weak organs. They tonify and strengthen these sluggish organs in the same way that you would use resistance training to build muscles at the gym. Research has shown that the pituitary gland is not only the \"Master Gland'' of the body, but it also sends out a signal that promotes regeneration of other glands and organs. This elaborate process involves the release of the growth hormone in a pulsating fashion. The RegenRx Pituitary formula enhances the growth hormone release from the pituitary gland and improves receptor activity at the cellular level. I have found that this process very gently, safely, and effectively stimulates regeneration throughout the body's various organs and organ systems. Homeopathy is an ideal system with no side effects and can have therapeutic value in cellular and "}
