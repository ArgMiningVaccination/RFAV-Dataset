While Covid 19 can affect anyone, scientists are finding that among those who catch the virus, older patients and those who have underlying health problems are more at risk for severe symptoms and fatalities. These are patients with weakened immune systems, because immune function declines as you get older, and immunity becomes compromised when you have [other health problems](https://www.acupuncturewestorange.com/conditions-and-disorders-we-treat/). If you're like most people, you may not think much about your immune system until you get sick. In addition, immunity may seem like this vague part of your body that's very complicated and hard to measure\u2014which is true. It's a system made up of several kinds of white blood cells, antibodies, your lymphatic system, bone marrow, spleen, and thymus. However, in the age of Covid 19, it's clear that having a strong immune system has become more important than ever before. The question is how can you support your immune system or rebuild immune function if it has become weak? This is crucial whether you've been exposed to Covid 19 or seem to catch every cold that's going around each winter. One answer comes in the form of [Chinese medicine](https://www.acupuncturewestorange.com/non-needle-treatments/), as the Chinese have a long and valuable history of providing effective treatments and preventing fever-related illnesses for literally thousands of years. Research backs up what the Chinese have known for millennia, that [acupuncture](https://www.acupuncturewestorange.com/acupuncture-faqs/) can boost immune function. Studies have documented that [electro- acupuncture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5391063/) can raise your body's production of T cells, which are a kind of white blood cell that destroys harmful microbes. In addition, several research studies have concluded that acupuncture decreases inflammation, which is an immune system reaction to harmful microbes, toxins, and other damage. Let's face it, whether you're worried about Covid 19 or wanting to stay healthy in the long run, acupuncture can help improve your immune function.
