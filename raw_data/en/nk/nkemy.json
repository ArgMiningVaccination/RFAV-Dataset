Published: 15th July 2018 05:00 AM | Last Updated: 14th July 2018 05:33 PM | A+A A- Parents with special children often agonise over the ways in which they can improve the child's cognitive and mental development. Other than physiotherapy, western medicine does not have much to offer. In Ayurveda, Kaumaram or pediatrics has been a separate science since hundreds of years. During the past 40 years or so that I have been in public service, I feel that cases of autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Syndrome (ADHS) are on the increase. My gut feeling is that this may have something to do with mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccination about which there is a raging controversy. To be on the safe side, I would not advise taking children for any kind of immunisation if they are at all feeling ill or a bit under the weather. Anti-MMR protagonists say that when the intestinal flora is disturbed and vaccination is done at that time, untoward reactions such as autism, etc, formulations often prescribed by our acharyas for manasika rogas (psychological and mental problems). The restlessness that children experience with ADHD is often addressed with 'Rudraksha Churanam'. Rudraksha seeds are not only made into a mala that can be worn, they can also be taken internally. I think the reason saints and sadhus wear the rudraksha is perhaps because of its calming effect. 'Rudraksha Churanam' is said to help in depression. By associating rudraksham with spirituality and giving it visibility, our acharyas brought the knowledge of its importance to the common folk. I find that they have systematically tried to educate people on herbs that are important. Take turmeric for example; every self-respecting Indian would probably know about it. It is not only a common culinary herb but it is also used on all auspicious occasions. And of course its medicinal uses are legion. 'Mahakalyanaka Ghritam', which is a ghee preparation used in the treatment of manasika or mind-related issues, contains turmeric and tree turmeric (daruharidra), triphala, some of thedasamula ingredients, some cooling herbs such as sandalwood, lilies and jasmine. The ghee is prepared from the milk of cows which have calved for the first time. Probably these contain different bioactive compounds. However, I am not sure whether store-bought preparations are so particular about the manner in which milk is procured. There is an area that needs to be addressed by ayurvedic drug manufacturers. Labels need to indicate what exactly is used and whether they differ from the original formula. Where preservatives are used, it should be indicated. Kotakkal, a very big name in ayurvedic drug manufacture, does not indicate the use of preservatives. Omissions such as these detract from the way ayurvedic drugs are perceived. For the treatment of autism, we first need to improve the digestive power of the children; Rajanyadi and Ashtachuranam would be a good choice as it brings down kapham. Then the ghee-based medicines can be administered. Panchakarma in the form abhyangam with Lakshadi kuzhambu is ideal for bringing down restlessness. Laksha has what is called sthira guna, and Takra Dara are some of the Panchakarma techniques that can be done. To make the buttermilk for Takra Dara, milk boiled with mushta, amalaki and jatamanshi (after filtration) is set as curd and then made into buttermilk. Many options are available depending on the individual symptoms of the patient. Early treatment addressing these issues will help affected children.
