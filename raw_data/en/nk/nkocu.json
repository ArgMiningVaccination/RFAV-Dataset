This article is published with open access Over the past few years, several large-scale studies using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of whole-genomes (WGS) and whole-exomes (WES) have de ned the muta- tional landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)[1-4]. NGS studies have also revealed the clonalheterogeneity in CLL and showed that clonal evolution contributes to the variability in clinical course among CLL patients [ 3]. Clonal evolution is considered a key condition in CLL progression and relapse after treatment. Most CLLcases are diagnosed during the inactive disease phase, genetic aberrations 'underlying progress in CLL activity leading to the need for therapy are poorly understood andshould be explored. A large number of frequently mutated genes have been identi ed and several putative driver mutations likely to confer selective growth advantage toCLL tumor cells have been proposed [ 1-3]. In addition, clonal shifts between paired treatment-na\u00efve and relapsed CLL samples have been reported due to pre-existing sub-clone expansion under therapeutic pressure, demonstrating that clonal evolution likely underlies CLL relapse [ 3,5]. Nevertheless, there are still a limited amount of longitudinalWES studies analyzing consecutive CLL samples before treatment intervegntion [ 6]. The acquisition of driver mutations accompanied by selectively neutral passengerchanges during disease prior to therapy in fluence is there- fore poorly documented. Here, WES was performed on consecutive treatment-na\u00efve samples of CLL patients fromthree groups with different disease course: Active disease (AD) group: patients with an active disease before the second analyzed time-point (TP2); Stable disease (SD)group: cases with a period of stable phase after diagnosis followed by progression within 3 years after; and Indolent disease (ID) group: those with a long-term stable indolentdisease. Moreover, we applied a novel integrative bioin- formatics tool called \"Cancer Genome mutations [ 7]. Thirty- ve CLL patients were included in the WES study. In total, 70 tumor samples -(two tumor time-points (TP) for each patient) - as well as 26 matched germlinesamples, were sequenced.

Sample characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table S1, sample pro-cessing and WES analysis are detailed in Supplemental Material. In order to distinguish driver from passenger mutations, the novel bioinformatics tool \"Cancer validated by deep-targeted sequencing (DTS),as described previously [ 9]. Moreover, FISH data from testing of four recurrent cytogenetic aberrations (del13q, trisomy 12, del11q and del17p) were available for allsamples. WES analysis of samples from both TPs obtained from 26 CLL patients with available paired germline materialshowed presence of 25 somatic mutations. From WES analysis of 9 CLL patients with no available non-tumorcontrol, 67 putatively somatic mutations were identi ed. Taken together, a total of 392 non-silent somatic or puta-tively somatic mutations (363 non-synonymous and 29 indels) were identi ed in 353 genes across the 35 CLL patients (Supplementary Table S2).

Time-point 1 (TP1) for all tested samples was set to the inactive stage of the disease close to the diagnosis (median from diagnosis to TP1 = 2.1 months). Second time-points (TP2) were all collected prior toCLL-related therapy. Three groups of patients were then characterized based on disease activity in the TP2: (i) Active disease (AD) group - patients with TP2 in disease 's active phase ( n=20, median TTP = 33.9 months, median TTFT =41.9 months); (ii) Stable disease (SD)group - patients with TP2 in disease 's inactive phase followed by active phase and therapy need ( n=6, median of time to progression (TTP)=44.7 months, median of time to rst treatment (TTFT) = 46.8 months); (iii) Indolent disease (ID) group - patients with TP2taken in inactive phase, no disease activity or therapy need was reached during follow-up of 3 years ( n=9, median follow-up = 158.1 months). Only one ID case (P31) progressed after 150 monthsand required therapy interventionBrief Communication 519driver mutation, 11 had previously been reported as drivers in CLL patients [ 2,3]. Additionally, CGI analysis also predicted were unknown for CLL to date (Fig. 2). Among them, the tumor suppressor FAT1 has been related to chemo-refractoriness in CLL [ 10];HDAC2 is known to 11]; and DHX9 ,GATA3 , and IDH1 have described be recurrently mutated in other hematological malignancies [ 12]. To identify somatic mutations which could be involved in clonal evolution, we analyzed the VAF dynamicsbetween TP1 and TP2. Twenty-six out of 57 (46 %) driver mutations showed a signi cant change in allele frequency at the TP2: 4 were detected only at the TP2, 21 showed VAFincrease at the TP2, and 1 mutation showed a decrease (Fig. 2). Additionally, FISH analysis of four recurrentcytogenetic aberrations at both TPs showed that 11/35 patients acquired one or more new cytogenetic alterations at TP2 (3/9 ID, 2/6SD, and 6/20 AD) (Fig. 2). The most often acquired aberration - deletion 13q, was detected in 7 cases (2/9 ID, 1/6SD, and 4/20 AD). Acquisition of deletion 11q was detected in 4 cases (2/9 ID, 1/6SD, and 1/20 AD). Twopatients who acquired a 17p deletion were from the SD and AD group. Taking together the WES and FISH results, clonal evolution was observed in 5/9 ID patients, in 6/6SDpatients and in 14/20 AD patients. Of note, 5/9 ID patients showed clonal evolution although they showed a long-term indolent disease (median follow-up =158 months). Muta- tions in CLL drivers associated with aggressive clinical course such as TP53 ,BIRC3, RPS15 ,a n d NFKBIE [4,13-15] were mostly detected within the AD/SD groups (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, there were well-known CLL driver mutations (NOTCH1 ,SF3B1 ) detected in two of eight ID patients, Fig. 2 List of genes with driver mutations validated using deep tar- geted sequencing and their changes in variant allele frequency time-points. Cut-off 5% of VAF was applied for validation of mutations. Allele frequency differences were tested across leu- kemia samples using a Fisher 's exact test. Mutations were considered to be changed if they were signi cantly different between samples(evolution p-value < 0.05) and their ratio of VAF between TP2 and TP1 was higher than 1.5 (for \"increased \"mutations) or lower than 0.375 (for \"decreased \"mutations). Genes with dark blue labels (on the left axis) were CLL drivers previously identi ed in Puente et al. 2and Landau et al.3and, where those in light blue were unknown as CLL drivers to date520 Brief Communicationrevealing the fact that the simple presence of such a muta- tion does not immediately lead to disease progression. Follow-up of these two patients with indolent disease already bearing a driver mutation at TP1 reached 99 (P5), and 213.1 (P46) months with no clinical evidence of disease activity to date as documented in Supplementary Table 1(Fig. 1). In summary, we performed a longitudinal study using whole-exome sequencing to characterize genetic alterationsoccurring during disease course before CLL-related therapy intervention in 35 CLL patients. We compared samples from indolent CLL to samples from a stable or active dis-ease. To de ne potential driver mutations, we used novel integrative bioinformatics tool \"Cancer Genome Inter- preter \". We showed continual evolution with cytogenetic aberration and somatic mutation accumulation during the time prior to therapy intervention. Despite clonal evolution, including driver mutation presence in genes such asNOTCH1 orSF3B1 , observed in indolent CLL cases, there was no clinical evidence of disease activity during long- term follow-up after sampling. We conclude that theacquisition of aberrations is not limited to the active disease phase or relapses after therapy [ 3,5,6]. Moreover, muta- tional pro les of indolent or outwardly stable CLL cases show that the presence of CLL clones bearing driver mutations do not have to correspond directly with disease progression. Therefore, simple mutation acquisition doesnot necessarily lead to immediate disease progression; nevertheless, accumulating changes precede the manifesta- tion of disease activity. In addition, clonal evolution canoccur in the absence of adverse prognostic factors such as the presence of high-risk cytogenetic alterations or unmu- tated IGHV. In fact, the acquisition of mutations can happenin the absence of any FISH alterations (P35 or P45) as well as in IGHV-mutated CLLs (P46). Unfortunately, analysis of genomic changes does not fully explain the transformationto a more aggressive stage in all CLL patients (P40). It was reported that epigenetic changes could also fuel CLL evo- lution during disease progression [ 6]. Understanding CLL evolution from the time of diagnosis to therapy need may be essential to gain insight into the process of transformation from the initial inactive form to later more aggressivestages. Although white blood cells (WBC) count during disease course is more feasible than performing NGS stu- dies, we have observed that the acquisition of genomicalterations does not have to simply correspond with an increase of WBC (P4 or 35). Then, genomic analysis should be made in larger longitudinal-based cohort studies in orderto evaluate how to predict disease activation in CLL. On the other hand, to understand the genomic changes underlying CLL relapse, mutational analysis at the time of diagnosismay be irrelevant as additional aberrations may appear during time and clonal shifts are likely to happen. Suchanalysis should be done before therapy intervention to monitor tumoral clones that are responsible for CLL relapse.

Transfusion depen- dency in MDS is associated with reduced survival andsignicant impairment in quality of life [ 1,4,5]. Despite the extensive use of blood products in MDS, little is known about the clinical and disease-speci c factors that drive red cell and platelet transfusion need in these patients. In this study, we added mutational patterns to clinical data and transfusion information in a large cohort of MDSpatients to investigate predictors of transfusion intensity and the association between transfusion patterns and survival. A retrospective cohort of 309 consecutive patients from the MDS biobank at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, diagnosed between 2003 and 2013,met the inclusion criteria of MDS or MDS/myeloprolifera- tive neoplasm according to the revised World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classi cation (Supplementary Figure 1). Clinical and laboratory data for each patient, including mutational status at diagnosis, was linked to their transfusion history, comprehensively retrieved from thelocal transfusion database (Supplementary Table 1). Patients were followed with regard to transfusion history from the date of diagnosis until the date of death, allogeneicstem cell transplantation (SCT), or 1 December 2013, whichever occurred rst. The mutations were categorized according to their involvement in histone modulation, DNAmethylation, DNA splicing, cohesin complex, and signaling or transcriptional regulation, in analogy with previously published data [ 6-8]. TP53 mutations were considered separately, and 'other mutations ', occurring in only a few patients each, were grouped together (Supplementary Table 2). All patients were treated according to the Nordicguidelines ( www.nmds.org ) which follow the European Recommendations for treatment of MDS [ 9] (Supplemen- tary Table 3). The study was approved by the RegionalEthical Committee in Stockholm. The cohort received a total of 11,350 red cell and 1956 platelet units over 777 person -years of follow-up, corre- sponding to an overall transfusion intensity (TI) of 14.6 and 2.5 units/person-year for r ed cell and platelet units, respectively (Table 1). These data were tted in Poisson regression analyses estimatin g the relative TI associated with a number of considered clinical parameters, expres- sed as incidence rate ratios (IRRs). High and very highIPSS-R (International prognos tic scoring sys tem-revised) and male sex were found to be signi cantly associated with a high red cell TI (IRR 2.0, 95% con dence interval (CI) 1.9 -2.1; 95% 2.6 -3.0; and IRR tional regulators were positively associated with red cell TI, while mutations in DNA methylation, splice factors, cohesion factors, TP53 mutations, and 'other 'mutations were negatively associated with red cell TI (Table 1; Fig. S2A). For platelet TI, male sex and very high IPSS-Rrisk were signi cantly associated with high platelet TI 95% 1.8 -2.3; and IRR 95% CI 1.9 respectively) (Table 1; Fig. histone modulators, signaling factors, and transcriptional reg- ulators were positively associated with platelet TI, while in DNA methylation, splice factors, cohesionfactors, and 'other 'mutations were associated with lower TI (Table 1;F i g .S 2 B ) . The analysis of TI and association with patient survival was conducted using a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model, estimating hazard ratios of death, with 95% CIs, censoring patients by date of allogeneic SCT or end offollow-up. The number of red cell and platelet transfusions in the past year, i.e. TI, was signi cantly and independently associated with an increased risk of death. In fact, TI wasthe only factor that remained strongly signi cant after adjusting for age, sex, IPSS-R, and most mutations in a multivariable analysis (Fig. 1). Interestingly, histone mod- ulator mutations, including ASXL1, which was positively linked to TI (Table 1), was negatively associated with risk of death in the same multivariable analysis (Fig. 1). Given the importance of well-known MDS mutations for hematopoietic function as well as for disease prognosis, links between mutations and TI are not surprising. It wasexpected that transcription factor mutations should be associated with a higher TI, as these mutations also drive poorer overall disease outcome [ 8,10]. More unexpected was the association between mutations in histone mod- ulators and increased TI of both red cells and platelets. When other risk factors and transfusion need wereaccounted for, histone modulator mutations were no longer associated with poor survival, suggesting that these muta- tions are more involved in mechanisms underlying inef-fective hematopoiesis than disease progression. Furthermore, splice factor and DNA methylation mutations were associated with reduced TI. The former group,dominated by lower-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations, was protected from transfusion need early on in disease course, but lost this effect afterapproximately 2 -3 years (data not shown). This corre- sponds well with the fact that these patients receive erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESA) as rst-line treat- ment (Supplementary Table 3) and have a high probability of response during the rst years [ 11,12]. Finally, the seemingly 'protective' effect of TP53 mutations on TI mayhave two explanations. The rst is that TP53-mutated higher-risk MDS often have a good but short-lastingBrief Communication 523Table 1 Predictors of red cell and platelet transfusion intensity No. of patientsRed cell transfusions/ person-yearMultivariable model for red cell transfusion intensityPlatelet transfusions/ person-yearMultivariable model for platelet transfusion intensity Incidence rate ratio (95% CI)PvalueaIncidence rate CI)Pvalue Total 3753/343 1305/434 agents (HMAs) [ 13], and the other that once the disease relapses, overall survival is poor, and usually without a long palliative phase with multiple transfusions. The question is to what extent the association between TI and mutational status is in fluenced by MDS therapy. Theonly therapy that permanently affects transfusion need in MDS is successful allogeneic SCT, hence all patients were censored at SCT. Other therapies, with the possible and rare exception of anti-thymocyte globulin, are associated withrelapse, usually within 1 -3 years. The majority of the lower-risk MDS patients who are anemic receive rst-lineTable 1 (continued) No. of patientsRed cell transfusions/person-yearMultivariable model for red cell transfusionintensityPlatelet transfusions/person-yearMultivariable platelet the reference subgroup within the group (indicated), except for the mutation group in which signi cance was calculated for each mutational subgroup bMutations were categorized according to their involvement in histone modi cation, DNA methylation, splicing, cohesin complex, signaling, mutations >5 Male Female 65-74 <65 <30 >50 Histone modulator mutations DNA methylation mutations Splicing factor mutations Cohesin factor mutations Signaling factor mutations Transcription factor mutations TP53 mutations Other mutationsNumber of red cell transfusions past year Number of platelet transfusions past year Sex Age at diagnosis IPSS-R Bone marrow cellularity Factor mutation 0 4 8 121620 Hazard ratio (HR)Factors associated with survival - relative risk of death Fig. 1 Forest plot of the association between transfusion intensity and survival.

IPSS-R International prognostic scoring system-revisedBrief Communication 525treatment with ESA according to guidelines, and relapse with transfusion dependency after a median of approxi- mately 25 months. In our cohort, the vast majority of these patients received chronic transfusion therapy as second-line treatment. Thus, since ESA treatment primarily is given early in the course of the disease, its in fluence on TI over time and during the last year, an important piece of data in our study, is limited. Secondly, we noted that the group of patients receiving ESA only was approximately twice aslarge in the splice factor mutation/DNA methylation groups compared to the group of patients with histone modulator mutations (Supplementary Table 3). This indicates that theresponse to ESA treatment is better in the former groups, but also that a lost response to ESA in these patients is usually not associated with progression to higher-risk MDSmotivating treatment with, e.g., HMA. Patients with histone modulator mutations constitute a more heterogeneous group with regard to risk and treatment(Supplementary Table 3), hence not considered to be influenced by any particular therapeutic option. In addition to ESAs and SCT, there was only one additional patientgroup of size; those treated with HMA ( n=70). It is well documented also in our own cohort that the overall response rate to HMA is less than 50% and that the frequency ofcomplete and partial remission is around 30% [ 6,14]. The median response duration is less than 1 year and most patients in our cohort received palliative treatment afterrelapse but with complete follow-up with regard to trans- fusions and survival. In conclusion, except for the early protective effect of ESA treatment in splice factor mutatedlower-risk patients, we believe that treatment is not a major confounding variable in this cohort, since a major part of the observation period consists of time without response ortreatment. A novel and unexpected nding in our study was that male patients presented with around twice the TI for bothred cell and platelet units, compared to female patients. It is known from earlier studies that male MDS patients have overall poorer survival [ 15]. Indeed, we found a poorer survival of males in unadjusted analysis (data not shown) and it is possible that male patients simply had a more aggressive disease, requiring more transfusions. However,male sex was strongly associated with transfusion need even when adjusting for several clinical parameters, including mutations, indicating that the effect is not entirelydriven by disease biology. Furthermore, there were no relevant differences in the pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels between males and females, nor could the transfusionintensity be explained by the generally larger blood volume in males (data not shown). This unexpected male bias needs further investigation. We conclude from our study that TI is a much stronger predictor for survival than previously recognized.Furthermore, the strong association between mutational prole and TI indicates an important role for speci c mutations and gene pathways in the control of hematopoi- esis. Speculative mechanisms may include yet unknown effects of speci c mutations on the bone marrow niche, affecting circulation and survival of transfused cells.Alternatively, mutations could affect the lifespan of the patient 's own red blood cells and platelets, leading to an increased transfusion demand for this reason. Experimentalstudies will have to be designed in order to investigate these alternatives.

Gertz1 Received: 7 June 2018 / Revised: 9 August 2018 / Accepted: 14 August 2018 / Published online: 26 September 2018 \u00a9 Springer Nature Limited 2018 The baseline level of involved free light chains (iFLC) is prognostic in light chain (AL) amyloidosis [ 1,2]. A reduction in iFLC is associated with improved survival and organ response [ 1,3,4], making the serum free light chain (sFLC) assay the basis for the hematological response cri- teria [ 5]. Since AL amyloidosis is associated with a low burden of iFLC, different clinical outcomes can be seen atsimilar response depth. In patients who achieve normal sFLC ratio (sFLCR), high iFLC continues to predict a worse outcome compared to those with a normal iFLC [ 6].This study explored the impact of depth of hematological response using sFLC assay parameterson organ response and survival. The inclusion criteria were: (1) newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis within 90 days of diagnosis between 1/2002 and 8/2015; (2) achievement of very good partial response (VGPR) or complete response (CR) to rst-line therapy [ 5]; and (3) serial sFLC studies available. The Mayo Foundation Institutional Review Board approved the study. All patients gave written informed consent to have their medical recordsreviewed. sFLC assay measures at the end of rst-line therapy and at nadir iFLC after therapy completion were analyzed, andincluded: iFLC, the difference between involved-to- uninvolved light chains (dFLC) and sFLCR. Treatment was categorized autologous stem cell (ASCT,n=248) or non-ASCT ( n=148). Day +100 from ASCT was considered the end of therapy for ASCT. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method.

Overall survival (OS) was de ned as the time from diagnosis until death from any cause. Mul- tivariate analysis was performed using the Cox Proportional Hazards model. The median age was 59. Men comprised 59%. The kidney was the most commonly involved organ at 69% (Supplementary Table 1). Complete response was achievedin 63% of patients, 37% achieved a VGPR. At the end of rst-line treatment the median iFLC was 1.7 mg/dL (IQR, 1.1-2.9) the median dFLC was 0.5 mg/dL -1.3).

Baseline characteristics based on iFLC level at the end of therapy isin Supplementary Table 2. The median nadir iFLC after treatment completion was 1.4 mg/dL (IQR 0.9 with a median dFLC [IQR ( 0.2) -0.8)]. A normal was achieved in 76% of patients at nadir iFLC. The median time from end of therapy to nadir iFLC was 3.9 months (IQR 2.8 -12.6). The time to nadir iFLC was 7.3 months in ASCT patients and in non-ASCT patients ( P< 0.001). Nadir mg/dL, IQR 0.8 -1.8) compared IQR 1.3 -3.0; P< 0.001). No differences between groups in dFLC at time of nadir iFLC ( P=0.34) or in the frequency of sFLCR normalization ( P=0.28). Organ response data was available for 93% of patients with cardiac and renal involvement and 97% of patientswith hepatic involvement. In all three organs, iFLC 2 mg/ was associated with a higher organ response rate compared to iFLC > 2 mg/dL (cardiac response 86% a better organ response prediction over dFLC in all three organs (Sup-plementary Table 3). Normalization of sFLCR at the end of therapy did not predict for a higher organ response rate compared to patients with abnormal sFLCR ratio ( P= 0.33-0.88). At the end of therapy 2.0 mg/dL was associated with signi cantly longer hemPFS compared to patients with an iFLC > 2 mg/dL (median 118 vs56 months, P< 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 1a). Lambda amyloidosis resulted in a larger difference in hemPFS between iFLC groups (median 118 vs52 months, P< 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 1b) comparted to kappa amyloidosis (median 117 vs. 76 months, P=0.048; Supplementary Fig. 1c). dFLC at 0.5 mg/dL had similar predictive value for hemPFS as iFLC at 2.0 mg/dL (median 117 vs. 56 months, P< 0.001;Supplementary Fig. 1d). Normalization of sFLCR had no hemPFS compared abnormal P= 0.53; signi cantly longer hemPFS compared to patients with iFLC > 1 mg/dL(median 145 vs. 67 months, P< 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 2a). By light chain isotype only lambda amyloidosis remained sta- tistically signi cant in predicting hemPFS (median 145 vs. 65 months ,P=0.001; Supplementary Fig. 2b), whereas kappa amyloidosis was not (median 117 vs. 82 months, P=0.25; Supplementary Fig. 2c). The median follow-up of surviving patients was 89 months. iFLC 2 mg/dL by the end of rst-line therapy predicted for improved OS compared to iFLC > 2 mg/dL (10-year OS 76% vs. 55%, P< 0.001; Fig. 1a). light predicted for improved OS ( P< 0.001; Fig. 1b), while kappa ( P=0.86; Fig. 1c). iFLC 1 mg/dL was associated with longer OS compared to iFLC > 1 mg/dL (10-year OS 80% vs. 64%; P not predict for to dFLC > 0.5 mg/dL ( P=0.11; 1d), even by subgrouping based on light chain isotype (both P> 0.2). Patients who achieved normal sFLCR did not have a better OS compared to patients with abnormal sFLCR atend of therapy ( P=0.91; Fig. 1e). HemPFS and OS by iFLC groups among CR and VGPR subgroups is in Sup- plementary Fig. 3. We examined the performance of sFLC parameters at the end of therapy among patients with estimated glomerular ltration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2(n=49). The median iFLC among these patients was 3.3 mg/dL and the median dFLC was 0.3 mg/dL. Normalization of sFLCR occurred in 69% of patients, higher in lambda restricted disease com-pared to kappa restricted disease (79% vs. 50%, P=0.04). There was no difference between lambda and kappa isotype groups in iFLC value (median 3.1 vs. 3.5 mg/dL, respec-tively; P=0.93). No difference was seen in hemPFS when considering iFLC at 3 mg/dL (value close to median at this subgroup) ( P=0.9) or dFLC at 0.5 mg/dL ( P=0.44). Similarly, no difference in OS was seen, either by using iFLC at 3 mg/dL ( P=0.21) or whom nadir iFLC was reached >12 months from the end of therapy had a signi cantly longer hemPFS compared to patients in whom nadir iFLC was reachedwithin 12 months from end of therapy (median 147 vs. 65 months, P< 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 4a). There was also a difference in OS between groups (10-year OS 82%vs. 62%, P< 0.001; Supplementary was signi cantly longer in patients with nadir iFLC reached >12 months from diag-nosis compared to their counterparts (median 147 vs. 87 months; P =0.002), as well as for those who received528 Brief Communicationstandard chemotherapy (median 118 vs. 53 months; P < 0.001). An OS advantage was noted only for patientswith a nadir iFLC reached >12 months in the standard chemotherapy subgroup (10-year OS median 56% vs. 43%;P=0.04), but not in the ASCT subgroup (10-year OS 86% vs. 75%; P =0.12). A multivariate analysis of hemPFS and OS is presented in Table 1. iFLC 2 mg/dL at end of rst-line therapy and Fig. 1 Overall survival strati ed by: aiFLC level at end of therapy using the 2 mg/dL cut point in the entire study cohort. biFLC of 2 mg/ dL at end of therapy in Lambda light chain amyloidosis. ciFLC of 2mg/dL at end of therapy in Kappa light chain amyloidosis. ddFLC level at end of therapy using 0.5 mg/dL cut point. esFLC ratio nor- malization status at end of therapyBrief Communication 529time to nadir iFLC > 12 months were strong predictors for hemPFS and OS. An alternative model which includes response category had similar output (Supplementary Table 4). We have demonstrated the importance of achieving a low iFLC at the end of rst-line therapy in AL amyloidosis. Our data support that iFLC should be reduced as low as possi-ble, preferably to 2 mg/dL. This is associated with a higher organ response rate and improved hemPFS and OS. sFLCR Normalization does not predict for organ response or sur-vival and should not be used as a measure of therapeutic efcacy. It is not always possible to determine if elevation of the iFLC is polyclonal, often secondary to signi cant renal impairment or perhaps infection/in flammation. In such cases, a bone marrow biopsy coupled with multiparametric flow cytometry study may be required to determine the persistence of clonal plasma cells [ 8,9], which would argue for further chemotherapy. Anti-plasma cell therapies are toxic to normal B-cell and plasma cell populations. This will cause immunoparesis (including of serum free light chains) at the end of therapy with anticipated recovery over time. Therefore, it is notsurprising that most patients have achieved nadir iFLC close to the end of therapy, at a median of 4 months. However, some patients achieved a nadir iFLC more than a yearfollowing therapy completion. This predicted long-term control of the amyloidogenic clone and is associated with improved outcome. Time to nadir iFLC is also independentof depth of iFLC at completion of therapy. ASCT was more likely to result in a nadir iFLC well beyond the end of therapy (median of 8 months from end of therapy), whichmatches our experience of longer remission achieved with ASCT. Study limitations include its retrospective design and lack of systematic assessment of sFLC assay after com- pletion of therapy, which may impact ability to accurately capture time of nadir iFLC. The cohort size should reducesampling bias.Acknowledgements The study was supported in part by the Jabbs Foundation (Birmingham, United Kingdom), the Henry J.

Plasma cell (PC)-directed therapy in AL induces hematologic response (HR) and, in turn, organ response (OR), with improvement inquality-of-life (QoL) and overall-survival (OS) [ 1,2]. Despite therapeutic advances, AL remains a challenging disease to treat and newer therapies are needed. Daratumumab is an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, with an established role, both as monotherapy with an overall response-rate (ORR) of 30% in heavily-pretreated multiplemyeloma (MM) [ 3] and in combination with alkylating- agents, proteasome-inhibitors and immunomodulatory-agents (ORR > 90% in both and pretreated MMpatients) [ 3,4]. As in MM, AL-associated PCs uniformly express CD38, the target glycoprotein for daratumumab [ 5]. Although daratumumab has been studied in relapsed and/orrefractory (RR) AL, with impressive preliminary results [6-9], only a single study evaluating daratumumab mono- therapy (DMT) has been published [ 5]. Furthermore, the efcacy of daratumumab combination therapy (DCT) in AL is unknown. We examined the impact of daratumumab-based therapy (DBT) in RRAL.

Event-free survival (EFS) was de ned as the interval from initiation of DBT till dis- continuation of DBT due to toxicity, progression or death due to any cause. Duration of response was de ned as interval from the rst documentation of at least partial response (PR) to progression or death due to disease, with patients dying from causes other than AL being censored.All time-to-event analyses were performed from dar- atumumab initiation using the Kaplan-Meier method on JMP 13.0 software. Forty-four patients received DBT; median age at initiation was 64 years (range: 46 -82). Twenty-four (54%) patients were male. The median time from diagnosis toDBT initiation was 4.0 years (range: 0.4 -17) and median follow-up from DBT initiation was 10.2 months (95% CI: 8.0-13.1). The Mayo 2004 Stage with European modi ca- tion [ 12], Revised-Mayo 2012 Stage, laboratory parameters and the type of organ(s) involved are outlined in Table 1a. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 1 -8) and 11% of patients had received more than four lines of therapy previously. Prior therapy-related data are depicted in Table 1b. Twenty-two (50%) patients received DMT and 22 (50%) received DCT. The decision to commence DMT or DCT was per the clinician 's preference. The median number of cycles of DBT was 8.0 most commonly used DCTs. The main treatment-emergent adverse effects (AEs) arehighlighted in Table 1c. Twenty-two (50%) patients (11 each in DMT and DCT groups) were refractory to their lastline of treatment before initiation of DBT.

At last follow-up, 10 patients had discontinued DBT and 4 haddied while on DBT. The reasons for discontinuation of DBT included progression ( VGPR ( n=1), concern of cardiac rejection after cardiac transplantation for AL ( n=1), myelodysplas- tic syndrome ( n=1) and patient opting for palliative care only ( n=1). Three patients received subsequent line of treatment after DBT discontinuation and the median time-to-next therapy was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.0 -10) The median time-to- rst HR for the entire cohort was 2.2 months (95% CI: 1.7 -4.8); 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.7 - with DMT and 1.9 months (95% CI: 0.9 -3.4) for patients treated with DCT and median duration of HR was NR in either group. Two (4.5%) patients had progressivedisease. Additional response assessment data, including frequency of assessment and HR after the rst and second cycle of DBT are outlined in the Supplementary Material.Among patients with cardiac (61%), kidney (50%) and liver (7%) involvement, the respective OR rates were 44% last follow-up. The median time-to-best cardiac response was 13.5 months (95% CI: 7.5-NR) for the entire cohort; 8.3 months (95%CI: 6.2-NR) in patients treated with DMT and 14.6 months (95% CI: 4.6-NR) in patients in patients treated with DCT. Table 2demonstrates other outcome data. Our study underscores the safety and ef cacy of both DMT and DCT in RRAL. To our knowledge, this is the rst study to report outcomes with DCT in heavily-pretreated AL.An impressive HR of 83% (88% with DCT, 78% with DMT) comparable to those in the previously published reports [ 5,6] predominantly VGPR or deeper, is remarkable consideringour multiply RR patient-population. Two studies, currently in abstract form, reported HR of 63% after 3 months follow-up [7] and 50% after one dose of daratumumab, respectively [ 8]. In some studies, patients with coexisting MM or dFLC <5 mg/dL have been included for HR assessment [ 7,10], making response-assessment inaccurate. Our results are particularly encouraging compared to historically observed HR rates of 50 -75% with conven- tional chemotherapies [ 13]. Furthermore, traditional che- motherapeutic agents are commonly associated with substantial toxicities, with more than one-third of patients experiencing grade 3 AEs [ 13]. Hematologic-response rates of 40 -80% [ have been documented inRRAL [ 15].Table 2 Hematologic response and outcomes Entire cohort, DMT, DCT, n=44an=22bn=22c,d,e Prior lines of therapy, n(range) 3 (1 -8) 3 (1 -5) 3 (1 -8) ORRa,n(%) 25 (83) 11 (78) 14 (88) CRa,n(%) 5 (17) 2 (14) 3 (19) VGPRa,n(%) 19 (63) 9 (64) 10 (63) PRa,n(%) 1 (3) 0 1 (6) Time to 1st/ best response, months (95% CI)a2.2 (1.7 -4.8) / 5.7 (3.4 -7.7) 2.6 (1.7 / 6.2 (2.2-8.9)1.9 (0.9 -3.4)/ 5.7 (2.3-12.2) Median follow-up, months (95% CI) (8.0 7.7 97% and 89% 94% 100% 89% EFS, months (95% CI) 15.5 (12-NR) 13.2 (8.1 -15.0) NR (11.3-NR) EFS for 6 and 10 months (% of patients) 86% and 76% 80% and 56% 90% and response rate, CRcomplete response , VGPR very good partial response, PRpartial response, PFS progression free survival, OSoverall survival, CIcondence interval, patients on DCT were rst treated with DMT; in one patient who ultimately received DCT, daratumumab monotherapy was initially administered to assess initial tolerance to this agent. In the other patient DCT was administered due to progressive disease on DMT. eDaratumumab was added to ongoing regimen due to inadequate response in 3 patients (2 non-responders and 1 with partial response as best response), resulting in complete response in two patients and very good partial response in one patient, subsequently.534 Brief CommunicationAlthough the baseline characteristics and organ invol- vement for patients on DMT and DCT appeared compar- able, in the absence of randomization, a formal statistical comparison of the 2 groups was avoided. Importantly, the high ef cacy of daratumumab was coupled with a favorable safety pro le in both groups, with less than 10% of patients exhibiting grade 3 anemia and neutropenia and none experiencing severe thrombocytopenia. One patient with gastrointestinal involvement developed bowel perforationon DMT while another had a myelodysplastic syndrome, presumed to be related to prior exposure to melphalan and cyclophosphamide. Although, a phase II study ( n=8) reported no signi cant infusion-related reactions (IRR), possibly due to elaborate prophylaxis [ 9], other recent stu- dies have reported 33 -60% IRR [ 5,8]. Our study, showed comparable rates (22%), which were also similar to our experience in MM [ 3]. However, retrospective data collec- tion may have underestimated IRR. For accurate HR assessment, we excluded patients with concomitant MM. Additionally, larger patient-population in our study, and a longer follow-up may have improved thevalidity and accuracy of the OR rates compared to those reported in prior studies [ 6,7]. However, the limitations inherent to our retrospective study design persist, includingunderestimation of treatment-emergent AEs and absence of QoL data. Further, given that this cohort had received median three prior lines of therapy, a selection bias withinclusion of less t patients may exist. We recognize that the use of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) can increase NT-proBNP levels and can interfere with adequate cardiacresponse assessment [ 1]. None of the patients on an IMiD- based DCT ( n=9) in our study had a cardiac progression per the 2012 Consensus criteria, thereby ruling out any falseprogression events. Since our study incorporated patients treated outside of clinical trial setting, response assessment was not at regular intervals which may have adverselyimpacted the assessment of time-to- rst HR and time-to- best HR. In summary, daratumumab, both as monotherapy and in combination, appears safe and highly effective in heavily pretreated AL-amyloidosis. Rapid achievement of HR with daratumumab-based therapy, particularly with DCT, isimportant. Notably, these results appear to be far superior to those observed with DMT and DCT in MM, highlighting the value of targeting CD38 in AL, a disease typically withsubstantially lower level of clonal plasmacytosis. Addi- tionally the favorable toxicity pro le makes it a particularly valuable agent for AL associated with major organ, such ascardiac and/or renal dysfunction. Early results for cardiac and renal responses and outcome measures are promising, but extended follow-up will shed more light on theseendpoints.Acknowledgements We acknowledge all the patients, their families and the clinicians who were involved in the patients 'care.

This article is published with open access Highlights Activation of NF- B signaling in mesenchymal cells is common in LR-MDS. Activation of NF- B in mesenchymal cells leads to transcriptional overexpression of in flammatory factors including negative regulators of hematopoiesis. Activation of NF- B attenuates HSPC vivo. (MDS) are clonal disorders characterized by and the pro- pensity for leukemic transformation. Cumulating evidence has challenged the traditional view that MDS is exclusively driven by hematopoietic cell intrinsic factors. Mesenchymalcells in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment have emerged as key players in disease pathogenesis, as eitherinitiating or contributing factors [ 1-4]. We have earlier demonstrated that the transcriptional landscape of highly puried mesenchymal elements from human low-risk MDS (LR-MDS) is distinct from normal mesenchymal cells and characterized by cellular stress and the upregulation of inflammatory molecules with known inhibitory effects on normal genotoxic stress in hematopoietic stem/progenitorcells (HSPCs) and is related to leukemic evolution in a subset of LR-MDS patients [ 3]. An important question emerging from these ndings is the nature of the upstream drivers of cellular stress and in flammatory programs in LR- MDS mesenchyme. Here, we show that activation of NF- B in mesenchymal cells is common in LR-MDS, drivingtranscriptional activation of in flammatory programs and attenuating HSPC function.

In order to identify candidate master regulatory pathways upstream of in flammatory programs in LR-MDS, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing the transcriptomes of these 45 Brief Communication 537patients to mesenchymal cells puri ed from healthy controls (n=10) [4]. In total, 120 gene signatures were signi cantly enriched in the LR-MDS mesenchyme, while 8 signatures were enriched in normal mesenchymal cells. Among the signatures upregulated in LR-MDS patients was a remark-able abundance of signatures related to the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- B) family of transcription factors (Fig. 1a, b). To corroborate the notion of activation of this pathway and provide better insight into the hetero- geneity within the population, we assessed the expression levels of NF- B inhibitor NFKBIA (also known as IB-), which forms an autoregulatory loop with activated NF- B transcription factors and therefore directly re flects activation of NF- B signaling [ 5,6]. Overexpression of NFKBIA was found in the majority of patients, suggesting that mesenchymal NF- B activation is a common feature in LR- MDS (Fig. 1c). To con rm the functional activation of NF- B in mesenchymal elements in LR-MDS, we demonstrated increased phosphorylation of p65, a component of the activated NF- B complex, in intramedullary located CD271 +mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1d) as well as in bone-lining CD271+stromal cells (Fig. 1e, f). Moreover, pathway analysis (GSEA) con rmed the transcriptional activation of NF-B signaling in patients with increased NFKBIA expression in their mesenchymal niche cells (Figure S1A and S1B). NFKBIA expression was cantly correlated with the expression of in flammatory cytokines and negative regulators of hematopoiesis, which are bona de NF- B downstream targets such as IL6,IL8,a n d CCL3 (Fig- ure S1C). No correlation was found between NFKBIA S100A8 orS100A9 (spearmancorrelation 0.11 and P-adjusted 0.62 with activated NF- B signaling (NFKBIA+) in mesenchymal niche cells had no signi cant difference in overall or progression-free survival in com- parison to the NFKBIAsubset (Figure S2A and S2B) in this cohort of uniformly treated LR-MDS patients [ 4]. No signicant correlations were found between mutational status and activation of NF- B signaling in mesenchymal cells (Figure S2C). While the genes encoding in flammatory factors and negative regulators of hematopoiesis [ 4] are bona de downstream targets of NF- B signaling in other experi- mental settings, we next wanted to provide experimental support for the view that NF- B activation speci cally in mesenchymal precursor cells results in upregulation of thesetargets. To this end, we designed a strategy of activating NF-B signaling in mesenchymal progenitor cells by stably overexpressing the constitutively active form of IKK2(FLAG-IKK2SE), a kinase upstream regulator of NF- B, via a lentiviral vector (Fig. 2a, Figure S3A-C) 7] CD271 +cells [ 4], express osteolineage commitment markers as well as HSPC regulatory factors and robustly support the expansion of human HSPCs [ 8]. NF-B activation in OP9 cells resulted in overexpression of NFKBIA (Fig. 2c) and canonical NF- B downstream LR-MDS patients. Similar to the results in OP9 cells, activation of NF-B in human mesenchymal cells (HS5 cell line and expanded bone-marrow-derived primary mesenchymal cells) (Figure S3D) also resulted in upregulation of NF- B downstream targets including negative regulators link the transcrip- tional landscape of in flammatory alterations in mesenchy- mal cells to activation of NF- B in LR-MDS. As earlier reported, in human MDS, the majority of CD34 +HSPCs is in direct contact with CD271+ mesenchymal cells [ 9]. To assess the effect of NF- B activation in mesenchymal cells on the biology of normal HSPCs, we performed co-culture experiments with bonemarrow CD34 +HSPCs (Fig. 2d). Co-culture for 7 days on IKK2SE-transduced OP9 resulted in sig-nicantly reduced numbers of immunophenotypically HSPCs in comparison to mesenchymal cells In addition, reduced HSPC number was re flected in a reduced number of CFU-Cs (Fig. 2e), indicating attenuation of progenitor function in this setting. NF- B activation resulted in impaired pro- liferation of mesenchymal cells in serum-containing culture conditions (Figure S4A) which may contribute to theFig. 1 Activation of NF- B-mediated signaling in LR-MDS mesenchymal cells. aRepresentative GSEA plots demonstrating activation of signaling in mesenchymal cells from LR- MDS. bSummary of gene sets implicating NF- B activation in mesenchymal cells from 45 LR-MDS patients.

Demonstration of mesenchymal activation of NF- B provides human disease relevance to a number of murine studies implicating NF- B activation in ancillary cells to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic disease. NF- B activation in non-hematopoietic cells has been shown to induce 'MDS- like'myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in mice [ 10]. In another study, NF- B activation in bone marrow mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells, as a result of elevated levels of the microRNA miR-155, generated a persistent pro-in flammatory state of the bone marrow niche leading to an MPD-like disease in a Notch/RBPJ loss-of- function mouse model [ 11]. Our experimental data demonstrate that NF- B activation in the mesenchyme attenuates normal hematopoiesis, which is of key relevance to LR-MDS characterized by cytopenia. The implication of mesenchymal NF- B activation in the pathogenesis of MDS may also point toward common mechanisms between the pathogenesis of MDS and oncogenesis in other systems. NF-B-mediated chronic tissue in flammation has been shown to drive cancer initiation and progression via secre- tion of cytokines and soluble factors in models of several other forms of cancer [ 12,13], including skin, prostate, and colon cancer. In these models, activation of NF- B signal- ing, speci cally in broblasts, promoted malignant in (pre)cancerous cells, supporting the hypoth-esis that mesenchymal in flammation may facilitate tumor- igenesis in the hematopoietic system as well. The activation of NF- B signaling in mesenchymal cells in most LR-MDS patients raises intriguing questions about the events driving this activation. This includes the question whether mesenchymal cell-intrinsic alterations or extrinsicevents are driving NF- B activation. While the answer to this question remains speculative in the absence of experimental evidence (and may vary between patients), it is conceivablethat primary alterations in hematopoietic elements drive activation of NF- B activation in the mesenchymal niche. This notion is supported by recent ndings where activa- tion of the NF- B pathway implicated in MDS pathogenesis [ 14] and CD271+mesenchymal cells co- localize with CD34+HSPCs in the bone marrow section of MDS patients [ 9]. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that activated NF- B pathway in HSPCs signals to the adja- cent mesenchymal elements, resulting in NF- B activation in mesenchymal cells. As NF- B activation is likely maintained through autocrine/paracrine feedback signaling networks, other cellular types that anatomically localize with the acti-vated HSPCs and mesenchymal elements could be involved as well, suggesting that diverse cellular components may participate in this crosstalk. The combined ndings suggest that in LR-MDS, activation of NF- B occurs in both hema- topoietic and mesenchymal cells, likely through autocrine andparacrine feedback signaling networks, leading to a NF- B- mediated in flammatory milieu in the LR-MDS bone marrow and an overexpression of a repertoire of secreted negative hematopoietic regulators. S100A8/9, recently shown by us to induce NF- B activation and genotoxic stress in HSPCs and to be associated with an increased likelihood of leukemictransformation, was not correlated with NFKBIA expression in patients, indicating that its regulation is more complex and may include upstream TP53 activation [ 3]. Taken together, the ndings support the notion that mesenchymal factors, in addition to hematopoietic cell autonomous characteristics, may be therapeutically targetedin LR-MDS and warrant ongoing experiments de ning the contribution of NF- B activation and in flammation to ineffective hematopoiesis and leukemic evolution in MDS.

Resistance to vemurafenib in melanoma frequently results from reactivation of ERK pathway signaling by a variety of genetic mechanisms that include activating mutations of NRAS orKRAS , ampli [ 7,8]. ERK-independent mechanisms are less fre- quent and include activation of PI3K signaling [ 7]. The predominance of genetic mechanisms converging on ERKreactivation has led to the successful use of dual MEK/ BRAF inhibition in melanoma [ 9]. In colorectal cancer however, different mechanisms apply; here primary resis-tance usually results from reduced feedback inhibition upon upstream receptor tyrosine kinase activity leading to restoration of ERK activity [ 10]. In this scenario, combined BRAF and MEK inhibition has not proved effective [ 11]. In contrast to our comprehensive understanding in solid organ cancer, very little is known about the mechanisticbasis of vemurafenib resistance in HCL. Given the diversity of resistance mechanisms established in other cancers, it is unclear which, if any, of these might predominate in HCL.Two acquired subclonal, activating KRAS mutations were previously reported in a single patient with vemurafenib resistance [ 5]. Deletions of NF1 andNF2 have been pro- posed as an alternative mechanism in another case of pri- mary resistance [ 12]. The use of MEK inhibition has been suggested as a logical therapeutic strategy in patients whohave reactivated ERK signaling. However, the use of MEK inhibition has never previously been reported in a patient with HCL and at present there is no consensus on theoptimal management of patients relapsing on vemurafenib. A 74-year-old patient with HCL had been treated at our institution with splenectomy, cladribine, and pentostatin.We previously reported his initial response to vemurafenib at a dose of 240 mg twice daily [ 4]. This dose was lower than used in the initial phase II trial [ 5], but has since been shown in several reports to be an effective dosing strategy for HCL [ 3,13,14]. Vemurafenib was initially stopped after 58 days; however, this was associated with rapid return ofmarrow in ltration and thrombocytopenia. Vemurafenib was restarted at the same dose and cytopenias rapidly resolved. Continuous low-dose vemurafenib continued tosustain his remission for over 3 years, attesting to the ef - cacy of this dosing schedule. However, 38 months after restarting vemurafenib, his blood indices deteriorated, andhe required platelet transfusion (Fig. Bone marrow trephine rmed of HCL. trial with continued vemurafenib led to transientrecovery of hematological indices. However, bone marrow inltration did not improve over the next 4 months, and the patient became anemic, thrombocytopenic, and requiredfurther platelet transfusion. A second trial of two doses of rituximab produced a minimal improvement of plateletcount to 30 \u00d7 10 9/l. The patient became systemically unwell with B symptoms. Bone marrow trephine biopsy con rmed 99% in ltration with HCL. To elucidate the mechanism of his resistance we per- formed whole-genome and deep-targeted sequencing of 292 genes (Supplementary Table 1) of DNA from puri ed tumor cells collected prior to starting vemurafenib and again at relapse. Samples were used with informed written patient consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki andappropriate institutional ethical approvals. Sequencing stu- dies revealed the presence of the known BRAF V600E mutation and chromosome 7q deletion. Remarkably, we alsoidenti ed seven distinct activating mutations in KRAS and two mutations in MAP2K1 (encoding MEK1) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). These were detectable at relapsebut were not detectable prior to vemurafenib exposure. Allele frequencies were consistent with the parallel, con- vergent evolution of multiple clones. Deep-targeted ampli-con sequencing at multiple time points showed how KRAS mutations developed early, initially with codon 146 muta- tions, followed by emergence of the more classical activat-ing mutations of codons 12 and 61 [ 15].MAP2K1 mutations appeared later with MAP2K1 p.K57T expanding to become the dominant clone (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 2). The convergent nature of these mutations strongly impli- cated reactivation of MEK-ERK signaling as the likely mechanism of resistance. Indeed, immunohistochemistryconrmed strong pERK activity in all tumor cells (Fig. 2a). We looked for other mechanisms of resistance reported in melanoma. Speci cally, we found no genetic or protein evidence of either increased pAKT activity or altered BRAF splicing (Supplementary Figure 1A & B). We concluded that reactivation of MEK/ERK activity was the most likely driver of relapse and hypothesized that MEK inhibition might be a successful therapeutic strategy. Expression of the KRAS and MAP2K1 mutants in a lym-phoid cell line showed that while each mutation was able to activate ERK in the presence of vemurafenib, all mutations remained sensitive to MEK inhibition (Fig. 1d). Exposure of the patient 's puri ed tumor cells to vemurafenib ex vivo failed to completely suppress ERK activity and did not induce apoptosis. In contrast, ERK activity was completelysuppressed and apoptosis induced by exposure to a MEK inhibitor (Supplementary Figure 1C and Fig. 1c). Based on our in vitro experiments, we treated the patient with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib, initially at 20 mg daily combined with vemurafenib 240 mg twice daily. Remark- ably, B symptoms resolved within 1 week, followed byrapid platelet count recovery. A bone marrow biopsy at 4 months showed complete suppression of ERK activity (Fig. 2a). However, HCL marrow in ltration persisted, and therefore cobimetinib dose was increased to 60 mg daily (taken 21 out of 28 days). The dose was well tolerated and544 Brief Communicationwas associated with further resolution of cytopenias, a substantial reduction in bone marrow cellularity and HCL inltration, ongoing suppression of ERK activity and restoration of normal hematopoiesis (Fig. 2a, b). Ongoing treatment was also associated with suppression of mutant allele frequencies for BRAF ,KRAS , and MAP2K1 mutations (Fig. 2c). At 12 months, the patient remains well and asymptomatic with continued combination therapy. Thending of nine activating mutations, all converging upon the activation of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, underscores the centrality of this pathway in HCL and its reactivation as a potent mechanism of resistance tovemurafenib in this disease. This report provides a detailed analysis of the molecular basis for acquired vemurafenib resistance in HCL. It is the rst reported use of a MEK inhibitor to treat vemurafenib-resistant HCL. It proposes a new therapeutic option for such patients and provides impetus for testing in a formal trial setting.

Cancer The majority of newly diagnosed myeloma patients do not ful ll the inclusion criteria in clinical phase III trials Tobias W. Klausen1Henrik Gregersen2Niels Abildgaard3Niels Received: 31 May 2018 / Revised: 18 August 2018 / Accepted: 3 September 2018 / Published online: 28 September 2018 \u00a9 Springer Nature Limited 2018 Real-world data (RWD) are important as randomized clin- ical trials (RCT) have strict in- and exclusion criteria that do not allow evaluation of the effect and toxicity of new drugsor treatment modalities in patients that do not ful ll these criteria. Since 2005, clinical data on all newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients have been registered inthe Danish Multiple Myeloma Registry (DMMR) [ 1,2]. The Danish National guidelines for treatment of MM, are based on the results of phase III RCT ( www.myeloma.dk ). The median overall survival (OS) for patients above 65 years registered in DMMR in 2009 -2014 is less as com- pared to the Hovon 87 trial (32.9 months (mo.) versus 48mo.) [ 3,4]. In patients eligible for high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM-ASCT) the median OS in the DMMR was 74 mo. in 2009 -2014 (Abstract 1946 EHA 2016). A review of OS for patients treated in HDM-ASCT RCT describe a 3-year OS of 80% and 75% in patients treated with and without bortezomib,respectively [ 5]. In the DMMR, 3-year OS was 77% in thecalendar period 2009 -2013 [ 4]. The worse OS of the elderly in the DMMR let us to compare OS for patients registered in DMMR who ful lled the inclusion and exclusion criteria in phase III RCT with OS for those patients who did not. Furthermore, we analyzed the fraction of population-based cohort of newly diagnosed elderly and younger myelomapatients that ful ll the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Four recent phase III RCTs for MM patients ineligible for HDM-ASCT (Hovon 87 trial [ 3]; VISTA trial [ 6]; FIRST trial [ 7]; and the SWOG S0777 trial [ 8]) and four recent phase III RCTs in MM patients eligible for HDM- ASCT at diagnosis (STaMINA trial [ 9]; IFM2013-04 trial IFM DFCI 2009 trial [ 11], and the Hovon95/EMN02 trial [ 12]) were used and 11 inclusion and exclusion criteria, reported in at least 3 out of 4 trials, were selected (Sup-plementary Tables S1 and S2). The three inclusion criteria were CRAB, measurable disease, and bone marrow plasma cells (PLC) 10%, and the eight exclusion criteria were kidney failure, WHO performance status (PS) > 2, AL amyloidosis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within last 6 months, human immunode ciency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C, cancer within 5 years (excluding stage 0 -1 cervical cancer, some skin cancers), severe comorbidity (congestive heart failure (CHF), dementia, severe diabetes, moderate, orsevere liver disease, hemiplegia) [ 2] (Supplementary Table S3). The validated DMMR has been described [ 1]. ICD-10 codes from the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) were used (Supplementary Table S3) [ 2]. In the relapse setting, thalidomide was introduced in 1999, bortezomib in 2003, lenalidomide in 2005, pomalidomide in 2014, car lzomib, elotuzumab, and daratumumab in 2016, a n di x a z o m i bi n2 0 1 7[ 13,14]. Combination treatment including thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide are now treatment options at diagnosis. Clinical data from 2189 MM patients at diagnosis were collected from DMMR and DNPR between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2013 (Supplementary Table S3) [ 1,2].*Annette J. Vangsted annette.juul.vangsted@regionh.dk Copenhagen, material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-018-0272-0 ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.546 Brief CommunicationPatients were divided into elderly patients (>65 years) and younger patients ( 65 years) and further separated into two cohorts, those that were eligible for protocol inclusion (IC) and those that were not (non-IC). Patients were described by frequency and percentages for categorical variables and median and inter-quartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. Comparisons of categorical variables between groups were done by chi-square test and continuous variables were compared by Mann -Whitney U-test.The Kaplan -Meier method was used for drawing survi- val curves and calculating survival probability at speci c time points. The Cox proportional hazard method was used for calculating hazard ratios (HR) with 95% con dence intervals (CI) and Pvalues. The proportional hazard assumption was inspected by scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate whether handling of missing values and de nition of age cohorts could affect main ndings this study. All P-values were two-sided and a P-value below 0.05 was consideredTable 1 Distribution and effect on overall survival of inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients registered in DMMR Criteria Distribution of criteria Effect on OS dependent on criteria Fulll IC No ful llment of IC HR (95% CI) >65 ( 1391 34 (1.5 -3.1) 4 (0.3%) Cancer Y 1277 -1.4) (1.5 -1.9) <0.0001 ALCYONE study with Daratumumab Criteria Ful ll IC No ful llment of IC HR (95% CI) P Hemoglobulin < 5 IFM DFCI 2009, EMN02 trials Criteria Ful ll IC No ful llment of IC HR (95% CI) P CRAB 714 (93.5%) 50 (6.5%) 0.6 764 0 (0.0%) -- Cancer within 5 Y 720 44 (5.8%) 0.9 (0.6-1.4) 419 (54.8%) 1.3 (1.0-1.5) 0.021 Table 2 shows distribution and effect on OS of single inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical trials.

R statistical software version 3.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)was used for all calculations. The characteristics and treatment of 1425 patients >65 years and 764 patients 65 years are presented in Supple- mentary Table S4. Median follow-up for OS was 62.2 mo. in the elderly cohort and 77.0 mo. in the younger cohort. In the elderly cohort 36.6% patients ful lled the IC. The most frequent non-IC was kidney failure (26.1%), severe comorbidity (18.5%), and PS > 2 (16.4%) (Table 1). The non-IC cohort had a higher age, a higher ratio of men, ahigher proportion of IgA MM, a higher level of 2-micro- globulin, LDH, and CRP, and lower levels of serum albu- min. In the IC cohort more patients received melphalan andprednisone compared to the non-IC cohort (65.5% vs. 47.8%, 0.0001) (Supplementary Table S5). Median OS in the non-IC cohort was OS 21.3 mo. compared to 44.0mo. in the IC cohort, HR =1.7 (95% CI: 1.5 -1.9), P< 0.0001 (Fig. 1a). OS depending on individual criteria is shown in Table 1. Among patients >65 years 87 (6.3%) received HDM-ASCT and of these 44 (8.4%) were in the IC cohort for the elderly. Excluding these 87 patients from thecalculations did not change the conclusion (OS in the non- IC cohort HR: 1.7 (95% CI: 1.5 In the patients 45.2% ful lled IC. The most frequent non-IC was kidney failure (22.2%), PS > 2 (14.8%) and PLC < 10% (13.1%). The non-IC cohort had higher age, lower proportion of IgG MM, higher levels of 2-micro- globulin, LDH, and CRP. More patients in the IC received cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone induction (52.0% vs. 42.7%, P=0.010). Median the non-IC cohort was 65.5 mo. vs. 78.4 mo. in the IC cohort, HR: 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0 -1.5), P=0.021 (Fig. 1b). In the 65 years cohort 72.5% of the patients received HDM-ASCT. In theIC cohort 84.0% patients received HDM-ASCT compared CI: 2.2 P< 0.0001. Single exclusion criteria associated with no HDM-ASCT are presented in Supplementary Table S6. When we compared OS for non-IC with those ful lling IC in 547 patients treated with HDM-ASCT, we found in OS, 0.9 (95% Table S7 illus- trates the frequency and risk for not ful lling the criteria for a phase III RCT in patients treated with HDM-ASCT. Kidney failure was the only criteria signi cantly associated with shorter OS with a HR of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1 -2.0). In this large population-based study our RWD show that only 36.6% of the elderly and 45.2% of younger patients ful lled the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the eight chosen phase 3 RCT and these patients have better OS. Drug registration phase III RCT are often the quickest and easiest design to show superiority of new treatment but notreflective of clinical standard of care in the community where we adjust the dose of the individual drugs according to the co-morbidity, frailty, and disease complications. Renal failure, affected PS and severe co-morbidity were the most frequent exclusion criteria. In our real-world set- ting many younger patients with kidney failure and poor PSwere treated with a transplant within 4 -5 mo. from diag- nosis and no difference was found in OS compared to patients ful lling the IC. The EMN002 study, accepted a creatinine clearance 15 ml/min and in this study 53.3% patients ful lled IC. No signi cant effect was found on outcome for the exclusion criteria \"cancer within 5 years \". We know that comorbidity affects OS but not if this inferior OS is caused by a less effective treatment [ 2]. Decision on inclusion in RCT is based on available data and this study is based on retrospective data collected for other purposes. However, annotation of all patients in the DMMR is completed yearly. Patients ful lling IC in this study may have been included in RCT and thus have better OS due to new treatment strategies whereas we expect few in our non-IC to have been included in RCT. In our DMMRwe annotate whether patients participate in clinical trials, but not which trials. From our DMMR we know that 10% Fig. 1 Kaplan -Meier estimates of overall survival (OS) in the >65 years cohort ( a) and the 65 years cohort ( b). The red lines represent patients that do not ful ll inclusion criteria (non-IC) and the blue lines show patients that do ful ll inclusion criteria (IC). For both age cohorts a signi cant difference was found548 Brief Communicationof the elderly in the IC were included in clinical trials and 5% of the patients in the non-IC cohort. Among the younger patients 20% in the IC cohort were included in clinical trials and 15% in the non-IC cohort. The clinical phase III RCTs were the pamidronate trial, which do not affect OS [ 15] and the Hovon 95/EMN002 trial [ 12] and the Hovon 87 trial [ 3] We plan to use the RWD from our DMMR and the DNPR to analyze outcome and major side effects of new drugs in patients in clinical practice with focus on patients that do notfulll the inclusion criteria in RCT. We suggest that inclusion criteria in RCT for PS, renal disease, and other cancers are adjusted and that the design of studies is reconsidered to betterreflect daily practice. Furthermore, we recommend word-wide investigator-initiated studies on patient's not ful lling IC. Acknowledgements The work was funded by The Research Fund at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen.

This article is published with open access Recently, we have reported a 2.6 \u00c5 crystal structure of DUX4 HD2complexed with a consensus DRE consensus derived from the wild type DUX4 ChIP-seq analysis [ 1,2] The DRE consensus site is also present in the leukemia NALM6 and Reh cells harboring oncogenic DUX4/IGHs (Fig. 1a Figure 1a) [ 3,4]. Furthermore, the GATXXGAT-like, TGAT-ATTA-like repeats are also fre-quently associated with wild type DUX4 and DUX4/IGH target genes (Fig. 1a). In order to gain more insight into the true nature of DUX4-DRE interaction, we have determinedthe structure of DUX4 HD2 bound with endogeneous ERG DNA sequences derived from the B-ALL patient RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis [ 3,4]. The recombinant DUX4 HD2 domain was puri ed as described before [ 1]. The crystal of HD2-DRE ERGdiffracted remarkably well (1.6 \u00c5) compared with that of DUX4 HD2- DRE consensus (2.6 \u00c5). The statistics detail of X-ray data collection is shown in Table 1. For structural determination, the re ned HD2 structures (PDB codes: 5Z2S and 5Z2T) [1], but not DNA coordinates, were used for molecular replacement (MR) approach implemented in PHASER [ 5]. The DNA duplex of 5 -TGATGAGATTA-3 /3- ACTACTCTAAT-5 were built manually using COOT ThenalRandRfreefactors are 20.1 and 20.7%, respectively. Consistent with previous report [ 1], one ERG DNA duplex can bind to two HD2 molecules (Fig. 1b). Unlike the previous 2.6 \u00c5 HD2-DRE consensue structure, the electron density map of ERG DNA is of high quality (1.6 \u00c5, Sup- plementary Figure 1b) and allows 5 -T 1GATGAGATT 11-3/3-A1CTACTC TAA 11-5. The electron density map of the last pair of nucleotides, T11 and A11, are disordered and hence notavailable for model building. For the HD2 molecules, the nal re ned models contain residues Arg95 to Gln152. As reported before [ 1], the HD2 domain folds into a global domain of three helices, 1-3, respectively. The N- terminal poly-Arg/Lys motif, perpendicular to the helix 1, engages the DNA binding. In this structure, the Arg95 andArg98 side-chains dip into the minor groove. In particular, Arg98 forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of T1 nucleotide (Fig. 1c). Consistent with previous HD2- DNA ERG is 67.4 \u00c52, much higher than the rest of the structure (40.3 \u00c52), reiterating a secondary role in the two- step mechanism of DUX4-driven transactivation [ 1]. In current HD2-DNA ERGstructure, the QNR motif is also the major DNA-code-reading module (Figure 1d-f). The previous report suggests QNR can bind to the consensus TAAT repeat [ 1]. To our surprise, the Asn144 and Arg148 form two pairs of hydrogen bond with the G2 and A3nucleotide (Fig. 1d). The invariant Asn144 among homeo- box superfamily lies in the heart of the major groove. The carboxamide side-chain form two hydrogen bonds with theA3 nucleotide (2.7 and 3.0 \u00c5, respectively). In parallel with Asn144 side chain lies the Arg148 guanidinium head group, which in turn forms two hydrogen with the G2 nucleotide(3.1 and 3.1 \u00c5, respectively). Besides, in the region sur- rounding T 1GAT 4nucleotides, it is enriched with con guration observed in His149These authors contributed equally: Xue Dong, Hao Zhang, Nuo Cheng Senior author: Guoyu Meng *Guoyu Meng guoyumeng@shsmu.edu.cn 1State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute ofHematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences andBiotechnology, Shanghai JiaoTong University, 197 Ruijin ErRoad, Shanghai 200025, ChinaElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-018-0273-z ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.550 Brief Communicationis a strong indication of side-chain reshuf fle upon DNA binding/recognition. In the major groove also lies another important residues, Gln143. Consistently with previousobservation, the (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, via water- mediated hydrogen-bonding network, Gln143 can con- tribute to side-chain of Asn144 and its sub-sequent reading/binding of A3 importance of QNR motif in DUX4/IGH-driven transactivation was vigorously checked in our previous report [ 1]. Here, the major DNA-reading motif was char- acterized with luciferase assay using ERG DNA sequence. reisidues Gln68/ Gln143, Asn69/Asn144 activity of DUX4/IGH (Fig. 1g). In good agreement with our previous assays, the mutations of Asn69/Asn144 and Arg73/Arg148 were always moredestructive when compared to that of Gln68/Gln143, reiterating the biological relevance of HD2-DNA ERGand HD2-DRE consensus structures. Indeed, the Asn144, Arg148 residues/positions appear to be the most, tive less and least conserved positions, respectively (Sup- plementary Figure 2). This has led to the proposal that,while the invariant Asn residue in the middle of the DNA- binding-triol might play the most critical role in DNA binding, the residues Gln/Arg (or other variants) in theflanking positions might contribute to motif recognition specicity (Supplementary Figure 2). Until now, it is well recognized that most HD domains can bind DNA with TAAT motif. Like PAX/PAX3, DUX4 HDs, which contain the same sets of poly-Arg/Lys QNR motifs, can interact with TAAT. Agreeably, usingluciferase assay, Zhang and co-workers demonstrated that were required for DUX4-driventransactivation [ 7]. Consistently, TAAT repeat was also frequently associated with leukemia cell lines that contain DUX4/IGH [ 3,4] (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figure 1a).Fig. 1 Structural and functional cauterization of DUX4-Responsive- Element (DRE) sites. aRepetitive motifs in wild type DUX4 and DUX4/IGH target genes.

As discussed in our previous report [ 1], the coordinates and positioning of the second HD2 molecule in this structure also allow the envisage/modeling of DUX4 HD1-HD2 complexed with ERG site 5 -TGATGA GATTA-3 , in which it also contains repetitive GAT sequences. This has led to the re-examination of the pre- vious model, HD2-DRE consenesus (the consensus DNA sequence used in previous crystallization is 5 -TTCTAA TCTAATCA-3 /3-AAGATTAGATTAGT-5 ). When GAT repeat was modeled into the DNA electron density map thatengages QNR interaction, the R freefactor is 29.4% (previous renement is 29.9%). In light of the new HD2-DNA ERG high-resolution structure, the previous DNA registration in the poor electron density map of HD2-DRE consensue (Rsym and signal-to-noise level in the highest resolution shell 2.7 - 2.6 \u00c5 is 155% and 1.5, respectively) might be interpretedwith caution although it suggests a TAAT-binding possi- bility. In this model, it is clear that DUX4 HD2 can bind to GATXXGAT-like repeat. In support of this claim, therevision of the published DUX4/IGH ChIP-seq data showed that, among 364 DUX4 target genes, 109 genes contain GATXXGAT motif (Fig. 1a). In addition, TAAT-like repeat is also frequently reported in wild type DUX4 and DUX4/IGH [ 3,7] (Fig. 1a). Consistently, via structural superimposition and sequence alignment, a possibleengagement between DUX4 HDs and TAAT site could be envisaged (Fig. 1h). Indeed, the TGAT motif (in the for- ward DNA chain) and the TAAT motif (in the com-plementary DNA chain) display the strongest consensus in DUX4-driven transactivation (Supplementary Figure 1a). Taken together, the new DUX4 HD2-DNA ERGstructure shed new insight into the DUX4-DRE recognition: (1) DUX4 HD1-HD2 might bind preferentially to 5 -GATXXGAT-3 ,5 -TAATX TAAT-3 and 5-TGAT/ TAAT-5 (the complementary chain is underlined) motifs. (2) This helps to de ne a novel HD subclass, in which DUX double homeobox can displayremarkable double-kiss and double tolerance activities in recognition of TGAT- and TAAT-like repetitive sequences. In addition, the current observation/proposal in DUX4 willundoubtedly prompts a more extensive revision of the versatile HD-DNA interactions summarized in Supplmen- tary Figure 2.

Even with continued treatment, however,relapse is common [ 1,2]. Many pretreatment factors, most notably cytogenetic and molecular pro les, are associated with disease recurrence and shorter survival and allowoutcome prediction, albeit with limited accuracy, at the individual patient level [ 3-5]. It is increasingly recognized that post-treatment information provides valuable insightinto which remissions are of higher quality. One important characteristic of more durable remissions is the lack of measurable residual disease (MRD) [ 6]. On the other hand, whether it matters that a remission is obtained early, i.e., with the rst cycle of chemotherapy, has remained con- troversial. Data from historic and contemporary trials withdouble induction chemotherapies showed patients who achieved a CR with the rst induction cycle were less likely to relapse than those requiring two courses of therapy toenter CR [ 7,8]. Contrasting these ndings, an analysis of six ECOG (now ECOG-ACRIN) trials conducted between 1983 and 1993 indicated patients who achieved a CR afterone or two cycles of induction chemotherapy had similar prognoses [ 9]. The relationship between timing of remission achievement and outcome has not been examined in con-temporary cohorts of adults treated with 7 +3. Here, we used data from participants of ve SWOG trials between 1983 and 2015 and studied the association between prog-nosis and need for 7 +3 reinduction therapy and how it has changed over time. We analyzed 1247 patients randomized to 7 +3 in treat- ment arms of ve National Cancer Institute (NCI)/National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) trials conducted by SWOG. We analyzed patients aged 65 younger: enrolled patients between November 1986 and December1991, S9031 between November 1991 and January 1995, S9333 between January 1995 and December 1998, S0106 between May 2004 and August 2009, and S1203 betweenDecember 2012 and November 2015.

Forexample, trials S9031 and S9333 were restricted to patients aged 55 and older; the other studies included patients aged 18 and older. Patients with secondary AML werenot eligible for S0106, which tested the addition CD33 antibody -drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin to induction chemotherapy. There were also differences in thechemotherapy regimens administered since, in all ve trials, 7+3 was given as per standard at that time. Speci cally, in S8600, S9031, 2and 45 mg/m2, respectively, used mg/m2and 60 mg/m2, respec- tively. Finally, in mg/m2for cytarabine and 90 mg/m2for daunorubicin were used. Institutional review boards of participating institutions approved allprotocols, and patients were treated according to the Declaration of Helsinki. CR was de ned conventionally (<5% marrow blasts by morphology, absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 1000/\u00b5L, platelets 100,000/\u00b5L) [ 2]. Overall, survival (OS) was measured from the date of study registration/randomization to date of death due to any cause; patients last known to be alive were censored at the date of last contact. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was measured from the date of CR to therst of relapse from CR or death due to any cause; patients last known to be alive in CR were censored at thedate of last contact. OS and RFS were estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression models included covariates (modeled quantitatively unlessotherwise speci ed): age at study registration, gender, cytogenetic risk, pre-study white blood cell counts (WBC),Table 1 Characteristics of study cohort S8600 (n=530)S9031/S9333 (n=156)S0106 (n=301)S1203 (n=261)Pvalue Median age, years (range) 45 (15 -64) 61 (56 -65) 48 (18 -60) 48 (19 -60) <0.001 Gender, n(%) 0.68 Female 247 (47) 70 (45) 147 (49) 131 (50) Male 283 (53) 86 (55) 154 (51) 130 (50) Performance status, n(%) <0.001 0-1 374 (73) 114 (75) 255 (85) 221 (85) 2-4 140 (27) 38 (25) 44 (15) 40 (15) Cytogenetic risk, n(%) 0.0035 Favorable 9 (9) 5 (5) 42 (19) 28 (11) Intermediate 56 (58) 68 (62) 126 (57) 168 (66) Unfavorable 32 (33) 36 (33) 55 (25) 60 (23) Missing 97 109 223 256 (16) 25 (15) NPM1 ,FLT3 /ITD unknown 183 169 Type of AML, n(%) <0.001 De novo 506 (95) 122 (78) 301 (100) 236 (90) Secondary 24 (5) 34 (22) 0 (0) 25 (10) Laboratory studies at baseline WBC (\u00d7103/\u00b5L), median (range) 18 (0 -416) 13 (1 -274) 12 (0 -244) 13 (1 -800) 0.029 Platelets (\u00d7103/\u00b5L) 54 (2 -700) (6 -1,200) 55 (7 -9,300) 50 (4 -8,500) 0.045 Marrow blasts (%) 74 (0 -99) 61 (10 -99) 66 (3 -100) Number of induction courses, n(%) 0.036 1 381 (72) 126 (82) 234 (78) 198 (76) 2 149 (28) 27 (18) 66 (22) 63 (24) Induction response, n(%) <0.001 CR on rst induction 219 (41) 74 (48) 178 (59) 137 (52) CR on reinduction 68 (13) 7 (5) 32 (11) 27 (10) No CR 243 (46) 72 (47) 91 (30) 97 (37)Brief Communication 555Fig. 1 Treatment outcomes in study cohort. aOverall survival and brelapse-free survival by trial/decade. cOverall survival and drelapse-free survival by CR status and decade of therapy (1980s/ 1990s versus 2000s/2010s). eOverall survival and frelapse-freesurvival in patients treated on S0106 who achieved morphologic CR with the rst cycle of 7 +3, strati ed by results from MRD test, assessed centrally by multiparameter flow cytometry556 Brief Communicationpre-study platelets, pre-study marrow blasts, type of AML (secondary vs. de novo), indicator of receiving reinduction and study/protocol. We analyzed study/protocol separately and also grouped the studies by 20-year period (S8600/ S9031/S9333 representing 1980s and 1990s vs. S0106/ representing 2000s and 2010s). The earlier of thesegroups (S8600/S9031/S9333) corresponds to the period of time covered in the analyses previously reported by ECOG-ACRIN [ 9].NPM1 andFLT3 mutation data were available for participants of S0106 and S1203 and separate regression models in restricted to these two trials were t that included these molecular data. To control for the fact that patients needed to live long enough to receive reinduction, we performed landmark analyses among the patients who were alive at day 45. However, to allowmore direct comparison with the data previously reported by ECOG-ACRIN, which were not based on landmark analyses [ 9], we also performed analyses among all patients. All analyses were performed with R ( http://www.r- project.org ). Table 1summarizes the characteristics of the 1247 patients included in our analysis, group by decade of treatment (S8600 vs. S9031/S9333 vs. S0106 vs. S1203). Consistent with the differences in eligibility criteria notedabove, patients enrolled in S9031/S9333 were older than those on the other studies. The proportion of patients with performance status 2 and higher decreased over time. Incontrast, CR rates were higher in the studies conducted more recently compared to the earlier ones. In parallel with improved CR rates, OS and RFS were higher in S0106 andS1203 compared to S8600 and S9031/S9333 (Fig. 1a, b). We then built multivariable models to examine the relationship between CR achievement with the second cycleof 7+3 and OS as well as RFS in the older cohort of studies (S8600, S9031, and S9333) as well as the newer cohort of studies (S0106 and S1203) separately. After adjustment forage, gender, performance status, cytogenetic risk, WBC, platelet count, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, and type of AML, CR achievement only upon reinductionchemotherapy was not statistically signi cantly associated with OS (hazard dence inter- val: (HR=1.15 [0.86 -1.54], P=0.34; Supplementary Table 2) in the older studies. These ndings are similar to those reported by Rowe and colleagues on 1980 adults withnewly diagnosed AML treated on six consecutive ECOG trials conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s [ 9]. In the ECOG trial analysis, 5- and 10-year DFS and OS was notsignicantly affected by the need for one cycle or two cycles of induction chemotherapy in any of the six trials, even after multivariable adjustment. Using the same meth-odology as the prior ECOG analysis (analyzing all patientsinstead of performing a landmark analysis), we found similar results to the landmark analyses above for both OS (HR=1.21 [0.91 -1.63], P=0.19) and RFS (HR =1.14 [0.85 -1.53], P=0.37). In contrast to the data obtained from the older studies, we found receiving two cycles of induction chemotherapy before CR is documented was associated with worse outcome in the S0106 and S1203 trials. Speci cally, in these two trials, CR achievement only upon reinductionchemotherapy was statistically signi cantly associated with worse OS (HR =1.82 [1.24 -2.66], [1.34 -2.70], P< 0.001; Supplementary Table 4). Fitting a model with an interaction between time-period and reinduction, that interaction was signi cant (for OS: P=0.046; for RFS: P=0.016). Kaplan -Meier estimates of OS and RFS stra- tied by older vs. newer studies summarize these results graphically (Fig. 1c, d). These ndings indicate adults with newly diagnosed AML treated on more recent cooperative group trials who achieve remissions early, i.e., with the rst cycle of 7+3 chemotherapy, have better survival outlooks than those who need two cycles of chemotherapy to enter a CR, even after adjustment for other risk factors. These dataare reminiscent of those obtained from trials of double- induction chemotherapy regimens [ 7,8]. Why the relationship between time-of-remission achievement andoutcome with 7 +3 therapy is not seen in older studies is unclear. Possibilities may include the change in anthra- cycline dose over time (i.e., chemotherapy resistance maybe more apparent after the rst cycle of chemotherapy with more intense regimens), selection of patients who receive on-study reinduction therapy, and changes in frequency/routine of transplantation, among others. Finally, having found evidence that early achievement of morphologic CR was associated with survival with 7 +3 chemotherapy, we examined whether data from MRD tests provide additional prognostic information in such patients. For S0106, we previously reported patients in remissionwithout flow cytometric evidence of MRD after completion of induction chemotherapy (either 1 or 2 courses of 7 +3) had better outcomes than patients who achieved CR with upto two courses of chemotherapy but had a positive MRD test [ 15]. Here, we limited these analyses to patients who achieved a morphologic CR with the rst cycle of 7 +3 and had data from MRD testing available ( n=70). Acknowl- edging limited power in these analyses because of a rela- tively small sample size, we found having a negative MRDtest ( n=55) after cycle 1 was associated with statistically signicantly better OS ( P =0.049) and a trend toward better RFS ( P=0.098) compared to having a positive MRD test after cycle 1 ( n=15; Fig. 1e, f). Patients who testedBrief Communication 557negative for MRD after the rst cycle of 7 +3 also had signicantly better RFS ( p=0.02) and a statistically non- signicant trend ( p=0.11) toward better OS than those who achieved a MRD test-negative CR only after two therapy cycles (Supplementary Figure 1). Together, our ndings not only highlight the prognostic signi cance of achieving a remission early, but also support the value of \"MRDnegCR\"as recently proposed by the European Leu- kemiaNet [ 2] as new response entity.
