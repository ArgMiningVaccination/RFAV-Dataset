He will serve as guest editor of the special issue alongside, Mauro Toledo Marrelli, Ph.D., a professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Public Health's Department of Epidemiology. Vector-Borne Diseases in a Changing World will be comprised of studies investigating how global increases in temperatures and urbanization are impacting the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, resulting in severe outbreaks, even in formerly non-endemic areas. \"It is essential to understand how vector species are adapting and thriving in urban environments to guide and improve future vector management and control strategies,\" Dr. Wilke said. Without this understanding, there has been a rise in the outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the ones transmitted by mosquito vectors. \"We have seen environmental crimes devastating natural areas of the world, leading to an environmental disequilibrium and biodiversity loss of unprecedented proportions,\" Dr. Wilke and Dr. Marrelli noted. \"The worsening of the ecological imbalance caused by anthropogenic alterations in the environment will impact the range and abundance of mosquito vectors and, consequently, the incidence of vector-borne diseases.\" More information on Insects and Vector-Borne Diseases in a Changing World, as well as manuscript preparation guidelines, can be found at [http://www.mdpi.com/journal/insects/](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/insects/).
