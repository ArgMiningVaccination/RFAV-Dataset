[so] the heart becomes the lifelong guarantor of the mediation between the earthly and the cosmic part of being human that we are prophetically given as a gift. The heart does not belong to the earthly I, the everyday I, nor to its own I of the spheres, of the night, but to the I that can connect all people, the I of humanity. Wolfgang Schad: Der periphere Blick. Die Vervollst\u00e4ndigung der Aufkl\u00e4rung, Stuttgart 2014. Dear Colleagues, Wolfgang Schad's words quoted above beau- tifully sum up the guiding theme of this year's annual conference of the Medical Section: the importance of the therapeutic community. After almost three years of social distancing, of restric- tions on meeting and travelling, the sense of the importance of real person-to-person encounters has been sharpened again. Something that was known for a long time became tangible. Diseases often arise in a social context that favours them or creates opportunities for healing. Communities can thus be part of the problem - and at the same time a necessary part of the solution. This is a bitter realisation at a time of war in Eastern Europe, the spiral of rearmament and the resulting global harms, especially for the poorest of the poor. The medicine of our time is gradually prac- tising looking at disease and health with an ecological eye. The connections with regard to health between consciousness and the immune system, between loneliness, mental conflicts and diseases of the heart, between social status and education are, on the one hand, gradually finding their way into holistic treatment paths. On the other hand, precision medicine at the genetic Welcome .................................................................. 3 Programme .............................................................. 6 Specialist conferences Medicine and pharmacy .......................................... 8 Anthroposophic arts therapies - painting and drawing section ................................... 10 Therapeutic speech ................................................ 12 Eurythmy therapy .................................................. 14 Patient advocacy ................................................... 16 Psychotherapy ....................................................... 18 Prelude to the day .................................................... 32 33 \"Mysterium Cordis\" .................................................. 343Welcome Welcome Human soul! You live in the beat of heart and lung, Which leads you through the rhythm of time Into the feeling of your own soul's being: Practice spirit contemplation In equilibrium of soul, Where the surging Cosmic creative deeds Unite Your own I With the cosmic I; And you will truly feel In human soul's creating.Let this passage from the second verse of the Foundation Stone Meditation be preparation for and accompaniment to the conference: Literature for preparation of the conference: Rudolf Steiner: The Challenge of the Times, CW 186. Fourth lecture, Dornach, 6 December 1918. Rudolf Steiner: Manifestations of Karma, CW 120. Tenth lecture, Free Will and Karma in the Future of Human Evolution, Hamburg, 27 May 1910.and molecular level is being driven forward with tremendous input. Processes of consciousness are interpreted purely as processes of data pro - cessing, with corresponding effects on the image of the human being and social coexistence. Ar - tificial intelligence and robotics are increasingly finding their way into medicine. The big questions associated with this devel - opment form the background for this year's Medi - cal Section conference. In numerous lectures and workshops we intend to focus on the healing fac - tors of human coexistence and therapeutic com - munity building. The heart as organ of the middle offers the appropriate medical and therapeutic link in this respect. The question of how human health can become the focus of medicine forms a thematic arc from the beginning to the final day of the conference. Like last year, the conference is structured in three parts. Parallel, profession-related confer - ences of eurythmy therapy, therapeutic speech, art therapy, psychotherapy, medicine and phar - macy and a conference of patients' associations form the prelude. The middle section offers the opportunity for spiritual deepening and to work on the 16th class lesson. The multiprofessional conference carries the heart theme through the five CARE areas: birth and childhood, infectiolo - gy, anxiety and trauma, oncology and palliative medicine. Workshops with contributions from India, Rus - sia, USA, France, Holland, Italy, Switzerland and Germany offer an interesting international pro- gramme filled with content. All three parts of the conference can also be attended individually. Participation in the whole event, however, brings the composition of the whole to life and gives cohesion to the parts. The lecture programme, the morning preludes, almost 50 working groups, and guided tours of the Goetheanum promise a special experience and a contribution to strengthening Anthropo- sophic Medicine at a time when it is subject to major public attacks.

The stability of the bridge depends primarily on its piers: scientific knowledge, the evidence of clinical experience, but also the spiritual scientif - ic dimension of medicine. Such a bridge can lead to a system of medicine that is in tune with people and its time. Integrative medicine is based on multi- and interdisciplinary collaboration. In mutual under - standing and respect as well as in the further de- velopment of integrative therapy concepts, the wealth of perspectives can be focused and reach its maximum extent for the patient's wellbeing. Against this background, this year's specialist conference on medicine and pharmacy will con- cern itself with integrative approaches using the example of pollinosis and allergic asthma. Phar - maceutical, medical as well as social aspects will be consolidated. How can we understand this now so common clinical picture? What is the mechanism of action of anthroposophic medicinal treatment here? Be - sides the understanding of the disease - current and historical - and the practical experience with an integrative medicinal treatment, we look at re - search activities on Citrus and Cydonia and con - sider the linguistic challenges of conveying the medico-pharmacological approaches in day-to- day work with colleagues and patients. Sufficient space is also provided for personal exchange. On the one hand, the specialist conference provides inspiration and a broader perspective on a well-known clinical picture and its treat - ment. On the other hand, we would like to expe- rience, through examples, enrichment through diversity, practising in the spirit of integrative medicine, and provide encouragement to further develop this path.Conference languages DE / EN14 Sept - Wednesday 8.15 Creative speech Agnes Zehnter 09.15 The Goetheanistic botanical aspects of Citrus and Cydonia Jean-Georges Barth 10.30 Coffee break 11.15 The pharmaceutical processes of the manufacturers on Citrus limon and Cydonia oblonga Annette Greco, Claudia Suhr, Peter Pedersen Open questions on the development of the pharmaceutical processes of typical anthroposophical compounds using the example of Gencydo Broder von Laue 13.00 Lunch break 14.30 Methods and results from preclinical research Carsten Gr\u00fcndemann Clinical research on preparations from Citrus and Cydonia Erik Baars / Discussion Results of preclinical and clinical research - the practical and therapeutic experience with Citrus / Cydonia 16.00 Coffee break 16.45 Constitutional, immu nological and of allergic asthma Georg Soldner Integrative treatment of pollinosis and allergic asthma from an anthroposophical perspective Eva Streit 18.30 Evening break 20.00 Crises and developments of therapeutic communities Herbert Salzmann 21.00 Conclusion around the Goetheanum Poetry evening in the yurt13 Sept - Tuesday 14.30 Joint start of conference Welcome Matthias Girke, Georg Soldner Health and community Machteld Huber Mennet-von Eiff Dialogue walk - medico\u00ad pharmaceutical dialogue (key phrases, keywords) Hay fever as a disease of our time - Rudolf Steiner's accounts in a historical context Ulrich Meyer / Discussion 18.30 Evening break 20.00 Therapeutic healing impulses through music, speech and Bothmer\u00ae gymnastics Laura Piffaretti, Gudrun Rehberg, Esther B\u00f6ttcher 21.00 Conclusion around the Goetheanum 15 Sept - Thursday 8.15 Eurythmy therapy for pollinosis and asthma Kaspar Zett 9.15 Looking at the substance lead Wolfram Engel Lead in the treatment of pollinosis and allergic asthma (case vignette) Andreas Arendt 10.30 Coffee break 11.15 Communication and practice regarding pollinosis and allergic asthma in the dispensary and the practice \"Discussion with customers / Discussion with patients\".

Under the motto \"Our world, our art, our spirit\" we intend to deal with mineral colours, with gold, with plants and plant colours, with communities out in the world and very close by, as well as with the spiritual possibilities in the context of painting therapy. After almost three years of travel restrictions, the conference is finally taking place again in an - alogue form at the Goetheanum. In addition, we will offer workshops that will take place in hybrid form or exclusively online. This is also intended to enable colleagues who are unable to travel to the conference to participate. We will also be joined by participants from all over the world in a livestream.

The connecting, stress-reducing and strengthening effect of this community experience could be validated in a study in 2021. The workshop is only being offered online.

From the col - laboration with Weleda UK, an exchange arose with visual art therapists in Argentina Centro Vertical. What was initiated in preparation for the conference was a deeper shared investiga - tion into the spirit nature and medicine of plants both through artistic exploration and honouring ancient wisdom.

We will examine and practise texts and techniques to trace the therapeutically effective forces of soul qualities. Franziska Schmidt von Nell The morning activities and evening events are common to all specialist conferences. Johannes Duve (contact: johannesduve@icloud.com) will To have one's heart in the right place, to have something at heart, to take heart, to pour out one's heart - it is not only in the physical organ- ism that the heart occupies a special place as a central organ. We also connect emotional pro- cesses with the heart. And just as on the physical level this organ is connected with the concepts of centre and periphery, so the heart also oscillates on a soul level between the I and the periphery. Here \"health\" lies in rhythm, in the situationally adapted alternation of systole and diastole, of tension and relaxation. During the specialist conference \"The Breath- ing Heart\" we intend to concern ourselves with the healing powers that lie in the pulse and breathing. We will explore our topic in three di-mensions: on a bodily-etheric level we will look at physiology and the effect of creative speech on the heart; on a soul level we will explore the field of empathy and our own boundary as a source of illness and health; in a spiritual dimension we will raise questions about multidisciplinary coop- eration and the meaning and importance of the therapeutic community. Our specialist conference for educational and therapeutic creative speech will begin on Tues \u00ad day, 13 September 2022 at 09.00. This will give us time to work practically in four work - shops and to exchange ideas on the keynote speeches in the plenary session. Workshop 1: \"Incarnating exercises in adolescence\" Language as an incarnating art is becoming in- creasingly significant for young people. Digital reality alienates us from our own body, creates a non-sensory relationship with the world. How do we work with young people in upper school? Jutta N\u00f6thiger Workshop 2: \"Strengthening the breathing through sound, syllable, rhythm\" Proven \"small breathing exercises\" from the \"Sound Informed Movement\" concept. Experiences with speech in early childhood as active forces in adulthood with reference to post- and long Covid. Dietrich von Bonin Workshop 3: \"Take courage in your heart\" How can we accompany patients from fear to courage? Among other things, I will present a series of exercises for use in acute panic attacks. The exchange among colleagues is very welcome, and participants are also welcome to contribute suitable texts or exercises. Claudia Kringe Workshop 4: \"You only see well with the heart...\" Burn-out (often also chronic exhaustion) is char - acterised by the disconnect between thinking, be happy to receive artistic contributions for the poetry evening on 14 September 2022 from 21.00 onwards.

The rhythmical system as a bridge This year, too, we would like to present cases from our practice for each other and discuss exercis - es, methods, approaches and principles of action. Undoubtedly everyone has experienced special treatment episodes that they would like to share with others. Here the focus is on the patient, their rhythmical system with the beat of heart and lung. Regardless of whether you have worked prophylactically or with indications, whether, for example, you work with children at school, in pri- vate practice or in a hospital: we hope for active listening among colleagues. Case vignettes will be presented, discussed and considered in parallel moderated workshops in German and English. For the workshops this means specifically: everyone should, if possible, present a case vignette from the aspect of the rhythmical system. On two afternoons we will all meet together, once on the topic of the centre, once on the topic of the periphery.13 Sept - Tuesday 14.30 Joint start of conference Welcome Matthias Girke, Georg Soldner Health and community Machteld Huber 16.00 Coffee break 16.45 Start of the eurythmy therapy specialist conference Joint work on the topic of the surroundings Plenary work 18.00 Evening break 20.00 Therapeutic healing impulses through music, speech and Bothmer\u00ae gymnastics Laura Piffaretti, Gudrun Rehberg, Esther B\u00f6ttcher 21.00 Conclusion around the Goetheanum Sept - Wednesday 08.15 Artistic and meditative prelude 09.15 Joint start and case presentations in workshops 10.30 Coffee break 11.15 Case presentations in workshops 12.30 Lunch break 14.30 The eurythmy therapy community - what lives in the centre and in the surroundings?

Make a wish / set a goal 12.30 LunchCreating health together with patients, physi- cians and therapists is the main theme of this conference. It brings together patients and physicians cre- ating initiatives for patients. During this conference, we hope that all par - ticipants will connect with each other and take home the intention and inspiration to connect with the international or national patient move- ments to help our citizens become more aware and co-responsible for their quality of life and health on both personal and societal levels. The National Patient Associations for Anthro- posophic Medicine need (administrative) support in representing \"The Patient\" to all relevant health and consumer authorities. At this confer - ence we want to bring together all patient move- ments (existing and in development) and enable them to work together. On the first day, we will open with a short lec- ture by Stefan Schmidt-Troschke on the challeng- es of civil society (45') and an opening lecture by Georg Soldner (45'). On the second day, we will focus on how to practice advocacy effectively and share what difficulties we encounter. In the afternoon we will zoom in on empow - erment and the patient perspective and engage in dialogue with pharmacists about access, avail- ability, affordability, applicability of Anthropos - ophic Medicine. The third day is designed for encounters. Pres - entations of anthroposophic therapeutic initia- tives from different countries are planned, with a focus on the Patient Perspective and sharing of initiatives and best practices by patient move- ments from different countries. Wieneke GrootConference language EN17Patient advocacy 16Psychotherapy specialist conference Treating anxiety disorders Dear colleagues in the anthroposophic medical movement! The International Federation of Anthroposophic Psychotherapy Associations is honoured to invite you to a conference on a clinical picture of great topicality. While concrete anxiety is initially a protective emotion, generalised anxiety disorder has the potency to change a person's life in such a way that the prenatal goal is lost from sight, that the common thread is lost, that the self-cho- sen path of life fails. Based on the most up-to-date research into anxiety, we will present the different forms of ex - pression of anxiety, depending on culture, with its specific spirituality. The respective historical background as well as the respective present so- cial and political living conditions cause a kind of basic disturbance in the structure of the human constitutional elements. In the detailed descrip- tion of the vegetative regulatory systems, we will come across the pathologising traces of previous traumatisation. Anxiety often masks itself by developing so- matic or other psychopathological symptoms. A specific feature of anthroposophical psychodiag- nostics is a procedure divided according to life phases, which is presented in three steps. As this conference is being prepared, a war is beginning in Europe which affects our topic in an almost unimaginable way. Under the impression of these shocking events, we are planning a work - ing unit that will deal with the then given situa- tion in Ukraine in September and its frightening effects reaching into the following generations. Although paling completely in comparison, a review of the consequences of the Covid-19 pan - demic up to this point will nevertheless be under - taken. A differentiation will be made between the frightening effects of this novel viral disease per se and those appeals to fear that trigger anxiety epidemics and have been deemed necessary to control the behaviour of large groups of people. \"Forming surroundings with the forces of the heart for the benefit of our patients\" is our mot - to. Anthroposophical psychotherapy unfolds in the interprofessional collaboration of psycho- therapists with physicians, art and movement therapists as a special feature and benchmark of anthroposophical medicine. The conference will take place in Dornach in English with synchronous translation into Ger - man and at the same time as an online event with local translation into the national languages.

Singing can playfully and largely unconsciously convey community-building resonance on a so - cial, emotional and functional-organic level and thus become a \"matter of the heart\" - and not only in a figurative sense; in choral singing, the breath as well as the heart rhythm of the partic - ipants adapt to each other. Exercises based on the School of Uncovering the Voice of Valborg Werbeck-Sv\u00e4rdstr\u00f6m stimulate the perception of tone, breath and sounds and enliven the voice. Viola HeckelWorkshops Spiritual deepening Thursday, 16.45 \u2014 18.00 / Friday, 09.15 \u2014 10.30 1. The meditations of the 16th lesson of the meditative path of knowledge of the Michael School (DE) (For class members of the School of Spiritual Science with blue card) Free rendering of the class lesson on Thursday with conversation on the meditations of the 16th class lesson on Friday. Matthias Girke 2. The temple meditation of the 16th class lesson (EN) (For class members of the School of Spiritual Science with blue card) Free rendering of the 16th class lesson in English for members of the School of Spiritual Science. We will deepen our consciousness and under - standing of the temple meditation. On the next morning we will share different perspectives and insights about the meditation in a class conver - sation. And in a third step we will explore how the fruits of this meditative work can flow into our daily life and work. Bart Vanmechelen 3. Introduction to the School of Spiritual Science (DE) This workshop is addressed to everyone who wants to familiarise themselves with the School of Spiritual Science and the schooling path of the class lessons. No previous knowledge is necessary. Marion Debus 4. Sun forces in the therapeutic community - working together on the gospels (DE) Guiding meditations and prayers from their con -tent to experience. Gestures illuminated from the soul combine the breath with the word and lead into our own inner being along the thread of the mantric text. Such dialogue contributes to a healthy professional practice and can also serve as a guide for patients. Georg Soldner, Jan Vagedes 5. Rudolf Steiner's studio October 1924 to March 1925 (DE on Thursday / EN on Friday, the one does not build on the other) Meditative reflection on the last period in Rudolf Steiner's life, his work and intentions, as well as his support from Ita Wegman, at the location of the historical events, of his dying and death. Peter Selg 6. Tuning the community singing (EN) Singing in a group creates a resonating commu- nity circle. Can I find myself in it, through sound and listening? Can I perceive my own musical centre and the periphery of the sound in the circle? Can I find the right place for me? Can I give strength to the group circle? Can I feel myself nurtured by sound and empow - ered by the force of the circle? We will explore those questions through singing, listening, and playing, knowing those musical questions are spiritually and socially relevant too. Comfortable clothes, comfortable shoes or eu- rythmy shoes are recommended. Marina Sacchetti The two units of the workshops build on one another.21 207. How can we accompany pregnancy, birth and early childhood spiritually as the environment for the growing life? (DE) By looking at the early phases of life, we would like to jointly develop through exercises and ideas how reflection on the spiritual origin of the child can support a successful / healthy incarnation. Claudia Grah-Wittich Angelika Maaser 8. Exercises in perceiving the beings in nature - working together with the elemental world (DE) The modern soul seeks to experience the beings of nature. We want, through our own cognitive powers, to get to know those beings that work in nature. Equally we want to show gratitude to- wards the beings of nature and support them in their work. In this workshop we intend to sharpen our own perceptive skills. There are many ways and meth- ods to approach the world of elemental beings. Some of them will be introduced in the course and then practised. Together we will exchange experiences afterwards. There will also be time for questions and discussion. Part of the time is spent outside. Please there- fore bring appropriate clothing. Karsten Massei 9. Listening with the heart - speaking from the heart (DE/EN) Mantric poetry is performative: it takes place in the act of speaking. What does it take for the word to become action? The resources of crea- tive speech enable a relationship to be built with the text on many levels. Through thinking, feel- ing and volition, in sound, rhythm and sentence structure, with voice and breath, we will try in this workshop to make a friend of a verse. Partic- ipation is possible without prior knowledge. Franziska Schmidt von Nell 10. \"Listening between the words\" as a training path in groups (DE) \"Listening between the words\" is a call for a particular attitude. We intend to practise this to- gether using the words of the 24th week of the Calendar of the Soul. Jan Ziolkowski 11. The heart as it is formed from its surroundings and as starting point for the metamorphic series of the organs - the etheric heart (DE) This course will look at the heart as the starting point of the metamorphic series of the organs. Here the starting point is the formation of the four heart chambers from the six currents (physi - cal body, etheric body, astral body, I, sentient body, sentient soul, see GA 115). The human form arises from the confluence of these six currents. In the course, practical aspects in diagnosis and therapy will be considered which open up from the con - nection of the metamorphic series of the organs with the constitutional elements. Special atten - tion will be paid to the etheric organs, the etheric heart (see anthropophonetics for physicians). Christoph Broens, Hartmut Endlich 12. Social aspects of health: community as the earth area for realisation of individual spiritual abilities (EN/RU) Human beings have different abilities they need to be human beings. Some of these abilities people get from their bodies, some others are brought by individuals by themselves from the spiritual world, but there are also some abilities which could and must be developed just during earthly life in communication with other human beings. At our workshop we will consider the es - sence and spiritual aspects of human abilities, the conditions and possibilities of their devel- opment and of health and disease in connection with the realisation and development of abilities at different stages of human life. Tatiana Pavlova 13. Paths of spiritual training - alone and/ or together? (EN) Those of us applying the fruits of anthroposophic research in their clinical practice may feel the longing to also find access to its roots. How can we develop capacities to accurately perceive and evaluate supersensible realities? Meditation in quiet solitude will always remain an indispen- sable requirement. However, certain steps on the path may also be taken in community with others, notably in the context of medicine. Along- side the often underestimated methodic study of anthroposophic texts, this can include a method of 'shared phenomenological research' of organs, plants etc. which may eventually lead to the beholding of their spiritual context. A new inde- pendence in the application of anthroposophic medicine may result. In our workshop we want to portray and discuss this collaborative approach (some call it the 'Saturn path') as it may emerge from - and enhance the fruits of - the path of solitary meditation. Martin Wittchow, Robert Fitger 14. Thou spirit of my earthly realm (DE) In the so-called Samaritan Course, Rudolf Stein - er gave three mantras that create a strong spiritual bond between the first aider and the wounded person. The third mantra addresses those spirits who look with loving interest at how we as humans try to resolve our conflicts peacefully. We intend to deepen this in the work - shop, especially with regard to the current so - cial, scientific and international conflicts. Rolf Heine 15. Together in resonance, holistic perception of the patient (DE/EN) In this course we would like to practise holistic perception of the patient with the help above all of the sense of touch. In doing so, we enter into resonance with the spiritual world, with the pa - tient and with ourselves. This is a schooling path that can be followed in stages. Please bring comfortable clothes and an open- ness to enter into new experiences. Gabriele F\u00f6rster, Ute K\u00fcpper23 22Workshops Spiritual deepening Workshops Spiritual deepening16. Look in your soul (DE) We intend to approach the social element in the meditation \"See in thy soul power of radiance\". A reflection on gold and the artistic experience in speech and eurythmy will bring us closer to what is unspoken in this meditation. An interdiscipli- nary working group for medical and therapeutic professions. Please bring eurythmy shoes. For preparation, CW 316, lecture eight, 9 January 1924. Theresia Knittel 17. ...from our hearts, through our heads... Introduction to the concept of anthroposophy \u00adbased psychotherapy (EN) Anthroposophy-based psychotherapy is not a new theory, but a spiritual activity. This con - cept brings the understanding of the human being and the psychology of anthroposophy into the practical application of the I-You situation in psychotherapy. It adds the bio - graphical-spiritual dimension to the common biopsychosocial model of illness and therefore, in the training of therapists, includes as basic elements the Daily Review and the Six Steps of Self-Development, the practice of Rudolf Stein - er's subsidiary exercises and other basic medi - tations. The course provides an introduction to the essential elements of the concept and their application in daily psychotherapeutic practice. Johannes Reiner 18. Eurythmy work on the Foundation Stone Meditation (DE) Joint eurythmy practice with the meditation. Please bring eurythmy shoes, light shoes or good socks. Stefan Hasler 19. Between microcosm and macrocosm - moving Rudolf Steiner's Foundation Stone verse together (DE/EN) Together we will illuminate different aspects of this \"foundation stone of the heart\" of the an- throposophical community and, in keeping with this, we will also move and explore Spacial-Dy - namics\u00ae exercises and ideas. Jaimen McMillan, Henrik Szo ke, Christina Spitta 20. Medicine and meditation: meditation in daily practice (DE/EN) How can I perceive and experience the fourfold constitution and the functional threefoldness di- rectly in myself? Practical exercises. Preparation: CW 316, Understanding Healing. Meditative Reflections on Deepening Medicine through Spiritual Science. Robert Kempenich 21. How do spirit and body resonate? Religious ritual in the mirror of the life processes (DE) The question of the resonance of spirit and body underlies both the path of the body as the basis of spiritual life and the path from the spiritual into physical effectiveness. In the mirror of the life processes described by Rudolf Steiner, we intend to find a spiritually and physiologically deepened understanding of the path in religious ritual from the gospel reading via the offering and transsubstantiation to the communion - and vice versa. Martin G\u00fcnther Sterner, Renato GomesWorkshops Multiprofessional \u2014 12.30 and 16.45 \u2014 18.00 22. Rediscovering the joy of parenthood in the light of anthroposophy (EN) The mode of management of a prospective parent in the context of the understanding of the fourfold and threefold nature of the human being, including art. Integrating a holistic cultural, social approach in management. A new amazing possibility of therapy in an unex - plored field of gynaecology. Wahida (DE/EN) Transgender, dysphoria and gender issues: using real case histories, narratives and statistics as well as physiology, endocrinology, ensouled move - ment and imagination, inspiration and intuition, we will try to understand gender and modern gender and sexuality issues. This will give us a matrix to support clients, those to be healed and friends. David Martin 24. How development of the inward senses builds capacities for social health (EN) To meet outside challenges we need inner resilien - cy. If we do not have inner capacities for orienta - tion we are captive to the outside world. Children gain more courage and flexibility as they strength - en and explore their \"inward\" senses (of smell, touch, balance, movement and life). Both children and adults use this inner pathway to calm, recover and soothe in the face of stress or change. We will explore the therapeutic aspects of this pathway, it's developmental progression, as well as Stein -er's specific indications about the senses, such as how our touch relates to \"permeation by the feeling of God\" and movement to \"experience of one's own free soul nature\". Adam Blanning 25. Vaccination from a medical and from a patient perspective (DE) Vaccination, vaccination questions, vaccination decisions are becoming more and more impor - tant. Stefan Schmidt-Troschke is a paediatrician and heads the patient association \"Gesundheit aktiv\" in Germany. He represents the concerns of patients there and is active on the board of the association \"\u00c4rztinnen und \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr individuel - len Impfentscheid\" Vaccination Decision). Georg Soldner and Stefan Schmidt-Troschke have been working on vacci - nation issues for decades, in recent years espe - cially on measles and Covid-19. The aim of the workshop is to understand the different perspec - tives and experiences of physicians and patients using concrete examples such as vaccinations against Covid-19 and measles. Models of good communication will be discussed. In addition, the workshop offers the opportunity to respond extensively to the questions of participants. You can contribute to the success of the work - shop if you send us your questions in writing one week before the start of the conference to info@medsektion-goetheanum.ch with the sub - ject: Vaccination workshop. Georg Soldner, Stefan Schmidt-TroschkeThe two units of the workshops build on one another.25 24Workshops Spiritual deepening26. Long Covid - interdisciplinary: a joint discussion about aspects relating to our understanding of the human being and to practical experiences in its treatment (DE/EN) The symptoms of long Covid or post-Covid syn- drome are not uniform and individual. The spec - trum ranges from mild exhaustion to disabling fatigue, poor concentration, agonising changes in the sense of smell and persistent shortness of breath or neurological disorders. It is estimated that up to 15% of all Covid-19 patients are affect - ed. In hospitalised patients, more than half may be affected. From the point of view of Anthropos - ophic Medicine, we can speak of a general weak - ening in the etheric. We aim to exchange views about our perceptions and experiences with pa- tients and medicinal substances in an interdisci- plinary discussion between colleagues. Severin P\u00f6chtrager, Robert Fitger 27. Trauma therapy, anthroposophically extended (DE/EN) What could anthroposophical trauma therapy be? There are established methods of psychotherapy for trauma sequelae. We intend to develop an understanding of how trauma sequelae are to be understood from an anthroposophical per - spective and what can be derived from this for practice. Boris Krause 28. Interprofessional oncological case discussions (DE/EN/ES) Deepening interprofessional work on various oncological clinical pictures based on case dis - cussions with special consideration of eurythmy therapy. How do I make a good initial therapy decision with regard to mistletoe therapy - slow dose escalation, fever-inducing or intralesional? How do I assess progress or adjust the therapy? What aspects arise with regard to the use of eurythmy therapy? The workshop will discuss oncological experiences from the Centro M\u00e9dico Antropos\u00f3fico in Lima / and Debus, Maike Kergel, Norman Kingeter, Yv\u00e1n Villegas 29. Consciousness, relationship and pain as essential aspects of birth and death. What makes our support helpful for the person at the threshold? (DE) Birth and death, marginalised in life, predom- inantly alienated from the context of life, and with fragmented professional support, needs individual, emphatic and integrating support more than ever. How can we find a way of deal- ing with the desire for consciousness or uncon- sciousness, with physically and / or emotionally painful moments in events, from anthroposophi- cal knowledge about these existential phases of life? Where do we experience parallels or met - amorphosis between being born and dying, and what significance does \"being with\" have for the person coming or going? On the basis of individ- ual observations and experiences of the partic- ipants and the experience of practical external treatments, we will try to face these questions in a practising way in order to understand the essence and to make individual support a reality. Sabine Braun, Christiane Eberhardt, J\u00f6rg Eberhardt 30. Chronic pain - a comprehensive challenge (DE/EN) People with chronic pain experience limitations in very many areas and aspects of life. Often a hardening or also rigidity is found on different levels of the organism. In order to address these people with their suffering and to enable devel- opment, we find interdisciplinary collaboration to be very helpful. We are therefore pleased to present aspects of breathing and movement therapy, medical and psychotherapeutic support to you in our working group and make them tangible. Kristina Gerstetter-Schmidt, Nina Klinger, Kordelia Kunisch 31. Interprofessional cooperation regarding in the end\u00adof \u00adlife process with case reports (DE/EN) What forms of interprofessional patient review and team meetings are there? We welcome the contributions of participants to this question. The group is open to all profes - sions in palliative care and hospice work. For the preparation of the content, you are wel- come to bring along contributions on \"Forms of a patient review\" and reports on experiences of joint support with a focus on: What has proved to be important or less important? Regula Utzinger32. The importance and meaning of the heart forces in the healing process (DE/ES) The seminar is based on my experience as an art therapist and psychooncologist. We intend to fo - cus on the path of salutogenesis. In the exchange of experiences we will focus on the questions: how can hope, faith in healing, gratitude, interest, courage and trust support the healing process? Can these forces help us in the transformation of pain, loneliness, fear and guilt? What role does the conversation with oneself, with the other, play in this? How can human beings reconnect with their own spirituality and the certainty of spiritual guidance? With the help of simple eu - rythmy exercises, Susana Ulrich will bring the topic to life and internalise it. Please bring eurythmy shoes. Josef Ulrich, Susana Ulrich 33. Endometriosis from a medical and music therapy perspective (DE/EN) We will present a single case of a girl suffering from endometriosis, a disease that has become in - creasingly common in recent decades. In the field of Anthroposophic Medicine there are some inter - esting medicines, such as Mixtura Stanni comp. and Helleborus niger. In allopathic medicine there are synthetic hormones to stop the growth of the endometrial cysts and soothe the menstrual pain. Regarding the relationship between ears and ova - ries, the idea arose to recommend music therapy. Over the course of some months, the endometrial cyst astonishingly disappeared. The music thera - pist will describe the steps which led to this result. Angelo Antonio Fierro, Laura Piffaretti 27 26Workshops Multiprofessional conference Workshops Multiprofessional conference34. How do I strengthen the heart space in today's world? (DE/EN) Due to today's world situation, many people ex - perience fears that affect the structure of their constitutional elements. Concrete examples will be used to work on how inner attitudes, value systems, courage and fear are related to health and illness. Through meditative exercises and eurythmy therapy, the heart space will be expe - rienced and widened as a source of joy in order to connect to our deeper will impulses. Roman Huber, Christiana Link 35. Touching the heart (DE/EN) All anthroposophical therapies of the heart have one thing in common: they give expression to reverence for the centre of the human being in a practical technique. What has moved from the centre into illness is reintegrated into the whole. We present this process from the perspective of massage as developed by Dr Simeon Pressel, rhythmical massage therapy and the pentagram Einreibung. Rolf Heine, Elma Pressel, Wolfgang Linnigh\u00e4usser 36. The Heart School as a multiprofessional approach to prevention and holistic treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stress disorders (DE) The subsequent treatment following the acute phase of a cardiovascular disease in the sense of a \"gardener's medicine\" is much more difficult when it comes to promoting sustainable health after the acute correction of organ pathologies. Here it is important to enable lifestyle changes to prevent progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. Underway with their illness, questions arise for those affected about further support possibilities for the healing forces, about mental influences on illness and health and about the meaning of an illness as a biographical event. The deeper meaning of healing lies not in the suppression of disease symptoms but in their transformation. Please bring comfortable shoes. Jakob Gruber 37. Heart and I\u00adorganisation in correspondence with remedies from the different realms of nature: Tourmaline, Aurum, Apis, Cardiodoron (Primula / on the topic \"12 gemstones & 12 sense organs\" we will come to understand the signature of tourmaline in correspondence with the heart as the sense organ of the blood and ego organ - isation. Tourmaline's signature leads us to three different kingdoms of nature and remedies that can come from them to support heart function. Denis Koshechkin, Albert Schmidli 38. The immune system in the concert of the human constitutional elements and life processes (DE) The immune system is a central organ that ena - bles us to deal with the substances of the outside world without danger. We intend to look at this special organ from the perspective of an anthro - posophically extended physiology. Against this background, we will derive basic therapy options and develop treatment possibilities using aller - gies as an example. Martin G\u00fcnther Sterner39. Crises and developments of therapeutic communities (DE) The lecture and workshops will focus on how spiritual strength can be effective in therapeutic communities. Crises in communities can also be understood as a call to develop qualities of the consciousness soul. These can be seen, for exam- ple, in a strong mission or in the spiritually alive constitution of learning and decision-making groups. Anthroposophically oriented therapeutic communities thus also have an inspiring effect on other organisations and on society as a whole. Herbert Salzmann 40. Becoming capable of community - on a personal, interpersonal and spiritual level (DE/EN) Together we will reflect on and move ideas and experiences around this topic and also include concepts and exercises from Spacial Dynamics\u00ae. Henrik Szo ke, Jaimen McMillan, Christina Spitta 41. Practical tools for spiritual community building (DE/EN) The coronavirus pandemic has considerably exacerbated tensions and frictions in social in- teraction. But it has also awakened us in a good sense to the need to embrace ideals of spiritual community building and to understand and im- plement the techniques needed to put them into practice. These techniques will be presented and discussed in the workshop in the hope that peacemaking and therapeutic impulses for the work locally can emerge from them. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler42. Anthroposophical biography work as a modern basis for a new culture of encounter from person to person (DE/EN) We live in a time when the ground that used to be based on tradition and social cohesion no longer supports us. In many biographies there is also a deep rupture in the natural basic trust and confidence in our own life. The current cri - sis is now also challenging the normal encounter from person to person. A deeper understanding of what it means to be human and a knowledge of the laws of biography have become a neces - sity in our time in order to find a new culture of encounter in the family, at work, in society. We will discuss the subject in its topicality in small groups, come to a deeper understanding through biography work in the \"house of our life\" and through art therapy exercises, and finally try to formulate the new insights for a future culture of encounter. Susanne Hofmeister, Karin Jarman 43. Systemic constellations, a possibility for development out of stagnation towards flowing (DE/EN) Working with systemic constellations offers a powerful contribution to healing and develop - ment in somatic, psychosomatic and relational issues by perceiving and acknowledging in - clusions in the etheric body. How can we un - derstand this method in terms of the fourfold human being and contemporary human devel - opment? How can we avoid losing ourselves in illusions or making things worse? A workshop with small constellations and eurythmy. Please shoes. Multiprofessional conference44. Mystery medicine - a path towards a future system of medicine? (DE) Our medicine and health care today draw on the enormous wealth of scientific knowledge and have a beneficial effect in many areas. Research in recent decades has also increasingly focused on the soul and spirit of human beings. Integra - tion in thought and action is still difficult on the basis of materialistic and reductionist ways of looking at things and thinking. Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman inaugurated and worked for an extension of the art of healing. In this context the question about the renewal of the mysteries and of mystery medicine played a crucial role. In this course we aim to address the questions: how can we approach the mysteries and their system of medicine? How can we understand a renewed mystery medicine? Which elements can play a central role in this context? What contribution can a renewed mystery medicine make to the further development of medicine? And how can we participate in its development and help shape it for the future? Together, as a multi-professional team of lec- turers, we intend to approach these questions together with you - by means of eurythmy, art appreciation, keynote contributions on earlier mysteries and their medicine, and interactive exchange (individual, small group, plenary work). Diethard Tauschel, Monika Layer, Angelika Stieber45. Working on inner and outer transformation in the face of the climate crisis - from (atmospheric) consciousness to (climate\u00adfriendly) therapeutic centre / practice / hospital (DE/EN) The climate crisis is advancing. Forests burned in many parts of the world and there were heat records in the Arctic. Never before has the Green- land ice sheet thawed as quickly as it did in 2021. Sometimes it seems that all is already lost, but that is not true. What steps can we take today and now for inner and outer transformation? Where can every person and where can Anthrop- osophic Medicine make a contribution? We want to exchange concrete and practical ideas on two topics: climate-friendly health facilities - where do we stand and how can we help each other on the path of transformation? How do we develop atmospheric awareness? Christian Grah, Cornelia Buldmann, Stefan Ruf 46. Healthy nutrition and community (DE/EN) A meal builds community, offers opportunities to meet and enhances enjoyment. In community, nutritional and living habits can also be reflected upon and changes can be established in a sus - tainable way. Beyond the fellowship of the table, our food choices are the basis for relationships. What we eat is directly related to the health of the earth. So it matters how the food is pro- duced, processed and traded. Cooperation based on trust and appreciation is the best prerequi- site. In this respect, nutrition and community are broadly defined. In this workshop we will work with inputs, discussions and practical exercises. Jasmin Peschke, Lea Spr\u00fcgel47. Eurythmy therapy for animals (DE/EN/IT) We would like to exchange views with partici- pants and do eurythmy therapy for animals to- gether with them. The discussions will of course take place indoors, but the exercises with the cows, sheep and donkeys will of course be done outside in the meadows around the Goetheanum. The Goetheanum farmer Paul Pieterse has agreed to be present during the workshop.

In us human beings, this is taken care of by the heart. The venous cross, with which the heart is held, indicates the four spatial directions in which the heart is actively involved through the blood circulation. The blood encounters spherical forces and light in the head region through the senses and through thinking. In the middle chest region, with the breathing and heart rhythm, the blood is rhythmised and ensouled with feelings. In the limb and metabolic region, the blood internalises the external world in the form of food and through the movements performed. Thus the heart is related to spiritual, soul and physical phenomena. The heart is not a mechanical pump but like a dam regulates the flow of water. It listens like an ear as an organ of empathy. It is a pulsating midpoint that experiences the outer and inner world. If it is healthy, it is like life, joy and love. In the relief, the heart and the circulatory system are depicted in a form that is adapted to the size of the human being. In this way, the person standing in front of it can connect with the qualities of the heart. The relief is the visual leitmotif of this year's conference. It is located in the entrance area of Klinik Arlesheim and can be viewed there.
