HOODLESS,1, 3 PATRICIA 35(1): 77\u201481 (1998) ABSTRACT Pheasants, Phasianus L., constitute a major part of the ground-feeding avifauna of England and Wales and are important hosts to immature stages of Ixodes ricinus L., the principal tick vector of Lyme borreliosis spirochetes in Europe. Therefore, their competenceas hosts pheasants by needle with 1 310 6cultured B. burgdorferi s.s. organisms, and a 2nd group of birds was infested with I. ricinus nymphs collected from a focus of Lyme borreliosis in southern England. Both bird groups were subjected to xenodiagnosesusing uninfected I. ricinus nymphs. All recovered engorged ticks, as well as pheasant skin biopsies, were analyzed by a nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the 5S-23S rRNA genesofB. burgdorferi s.l. Both groups proved to be infective for ticks. The birds that were infected by tick bites proved to be signi\u00decantly more infective for ticks (23% of the xenodiagnostic tickspositive) than those infected by needle (5%). The results show that pheasants can be infectedexperimentally with B. burgdorferi s.l., that they can pass the spirochetes to ticks and that their infectivity for ticks may persist as long as 3 mo. We conclude that pheasants are reservoircompetent for Lyme borreliosis spirochetes and potentially play an important role in themaintenance of B. burgdorferi s.l. in England and Wales. KEY WORDS Borrelia burgdorferi, pheasants, ticks, reservoir competence on anincreasingly widely recognized range of wild ver-tebrate species, including birds (Anderson et al.1986; Humair et al. 1993a, b; Olsen al. 1995; Randolph and Craine1995; Stafford et al. 1995). The risk to humans ofinfection is subject to \u00dfuctuating patterns of inter-actions between humans and wildlife, often as aresult of changes in habitat or wildlife management.For example, in the United States, increased deerpopulations, especially in areas close to human hab-itation, have led to increased tick populations andgreater contact between humans and ticks (De-blinger et al. 1993). In the United Kingdom, pheas-ants,Phasianus colchicus L., are part of these chang- ing patterns. As signi\u00decant hosts for the principalEuropean tick vector, Ixodes ricinus L. (Randolph and Craine 1995; study), pheasants were introduced as gamebirds to Brit- ain from Asia many centuries ago. These originalstocks have since been largely replaced by ring-necked pheasants, a group of races originating fromEast Asia (e.g., P. c. mongolicus J. F. Brandt, P. versicolor versicolor Vieillot). Over arti\u00decially reared pheasants released intoBritish woodlands in early summer to supplementshooting in winter has increased at 4% per annumand now stands at '20 million (Robertson et al. 1993). In terms of biomass, pheasants now consti-tute the majority of the autumn land-based avifaunain England and Wales, and densities may reach ashigh as 50/ha in some woodland habitats (A.N.H.,unpublished data). As ground-foraging birds, pheas-ants have frequent contact with I. ricinus (Randolph and Craine 1995). Furthermore, they have beenimplicated as competent amplifying hosts for Lymedisease spirochetes, B. burgdorferi s.l., by virtue of the higher infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in engorged larvae removed from a sample of pheas-ants from Thetford Forest, Norfolk (22%), than inunfed larvae collected from the same site (0.0%)(Craine et al. 1997). This article demonstrates thatpheasants can be infected experimentally with B. burgdorferi s.l., both by needle inoculation and by naturally infected tick bites, and that they can sub-sequently pass these spirochetes to I. ricinus ticks feeding upon them. Animal experiments carried out in the current study were au- thorized by the Home Of\u00dece Secretary under the terms of theAnimals (Scienti\u00dec Procedures) Act 1986 (Home Of\u00dece referencenumber: PPL 30/751). 1Current address: Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, OX1 3PS, Oxford, U.K. 2Natural Environment Research Council Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology, Mans\u00deeld Road, OX1 3SR, Two groups of ring-necked pheasants that had been hand-reared by professional breedersat Fordingbridge, Hampshire and Culham, Oxford-shire, free from contact with I ricinus were held in the laboratory at 20 8C on an antibiotic-free diet. Group 1 was composed of 4 chicks aged 6 wk andgroup 2 was composed of 5 adult birds aged 6\u20148 mo. Ticks. I. ricinus larvae and nymphs from the tick colony maintained at the Natural Environment Re-search Council Institute of Virology and Environ-mental Microbiology, Oxford, were used for xeno-diagnosis. The colony was maintained by feedingthe ticks on speci\u00dec pathogen-free hamsters andrabbits and was regularly for the absence ofspirochete infection. Infected nymphal I. ricinus were collected by blanket dragging 1\u20142 mo beforeuse from the Wimborne St. Giles Estate, Dorset, aknown endemic focus of Lyme borreliosis. Theywere shown by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)diagnosis (see below) to have an infection preva- lence of 5% for B. burgdorferi s.l. Infection of Pheasants and Xenodiagnosis. Group 1 birds were injected subcutaneously with 1 310 6B. burgdorferi strain, a tick isolate from Freiburg, Germany).Group 2 birds were subjected to an initial xenodi-agnosis and 2 wk later exposed to I. ricinus nymphs collected in Dorset. From 15 to 80 nymphs per birdfed successfully, resulting in an average of 0.75\u20144.0infected tick bites on each bird. Five to 10 wk afterinfection, all the birds were subjected to xenodiag-noses, using both larvae and nymphs on group 1birds, but only nymphs on group 2. To introduce ticks, the feathers on each bird\u00d5s throat, back of the head, and under the wings wereclippedandtheskinwasintensivelydegreasedusing70% ethanol. Ticks were contained in neoprene cells(1 cm i.d.) glued with latex onto the prepared skinsurface and were allowed to feed to engorgement.Ticks that died during feeding were counted andthen discarded. Ticks did not feed successfully un-der the wings of group 1 birds, therefore ticks wereintroduced to the head and throat only of group 2birds. Partially or fully engorged ticks were col-lected, weighed immediately, stored for 10 d in adessicator over MgSO 4, and then frozen at 2208C. Twelve weeks after infection, all birds were bled,euthanized, and autopsied; biopsies (2 32 mm) were taken from skin sites where the xenodiagnosticticks had fed. All biopsies were stored at 2708C before processing. Polymerase Chain Reaction. DNA from tick and biopsy samples was extracted using phenol-chloro-form (Livesley et al. 1994, Moter et al. 1994). B. burgdorferi s.l. speci\u00dec DNA was detected using a nested PCR targeting the 5S and 23S rRNA al. 1994; Rijpkema et al. 1995, 1996a,b). Using cultured spirochetes, this PCR protocolallowed the detection of DNA equivalent to $2 spirochetes. To assess whether this PCR detection of B. burg- dorferi s.l. was inhibited by host tissue, DNA (Cogs- well et al. 1996), or tissue derived from engorgedticks, varied numbers of extracted spirochetes werespiked with different dilutions of lysates of hosttissues and engorged ticks and subjected to PCR.Host DNA at .500 ng/ ml and engorged tick tissue at.600mg/50 ml lysate proved to be inhibitory to any PCR ampli\u00decation of DNA equivalent to ,100 spirochetes. Accordingly, all lysates were dilutedappropriately before the PCR reaction in order toachieve the desired sensitivity $2 spirochetes per reaction mixture. Results Of the 40 nymphs and 50 larvae introduced to each bird of group 1 for xenodiagnosis, 13\u201415nymphs per bird were recovered engorged 5\u201410 wkafter infection (12 larvae had fed successfully ononly 1 bird) (Table 1). No ticks introduced underthe wings were recovered alive, therefore all thexenodiagnostic ticks that were analyzed for spiro-cheteinfectionhadfedontheheadandthroatofthebirds. Two of 4 birds were infective to I. ricinus ticks, and these birds infected 8\u201413% of the engorgedticks. The initial xenodiagnosis on group 2 birds (using 20 larvae on each of birds number 5 and 6, and 40nymphs on each of birds numbers 7\u20149) yielded fewengorged ticks (2 larvae, 11 nymphs), none of whichwas infected. During the 10-wk period after expo-sure to infected nymphs, totals of 60\u2014120 uninfectedxenodiagnostic nymphs were introduced and re-moved when engorged. Of the 4 birds (bird number9 yielded no engorged ticks), 3 birds infected 17\u201442% of the ticks with B. burgdorferi s.l. (Table 1). Overall, group 2 adult birds that had been infectednaturally by tick bites transmitted the native strainofB. burgdorferi s.l. to 10/43 523.3% of the nymphs that fed on them. This was a signi\u00decantly higherprobability of transmission than from group 1 chicksthat had been needle-inoculated with a Germanstrain of B. burgdorferi s.s., which on average in- positive biopsy skin samples (Table 1). Duringthese experiments, the feeding success of larvae onpheasants was low compared with that of nymphs.This was consistent with natural tick infestationlevels recorded on pheasants from woodland sites inDorset (Table 2), which con\u00dermed that pheasantsare indeed quantitatively important as hosts for im-mature stages of I. ricinus, especially nymphs. Discussion Our results show that pheasants are competent amplifying hosts both for cultured B. burgdorferi s.s.78 Vol. 35, no. 1 J OURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGYintroduced by syringe inoculation and for natural infections of B. burgdorferi s.l. derived from I. ric- inustick bites. Experimental birds remained infec- tive to recipient ticks for at least 10 wk from the timeof infection. It remains to be demonstrated whetherpheasants can maintain the spirochetes throughoutperiods when conditions preclude active circulationthrough the tick population, for example during thewinter when tick feeding activity in British wood-lands declines (Table 2). Chickens, a laboratorymodel of an avian host for B. burgdorferi, although able to infect I. scapularis Say with B. burgdorferi s.s., lose their infectivity after a few weeks (Piesmanet al. 1996). The recovery of infected xenodiagnos-tic ticks from pheasants until the termination of theexperiment (10 wk after infection) suggests that thisseminatural avian host exhibits a rather higher de-gree of reservoir competence to B. burgdorferi s.l. than do chickens. The detection of spirochetes in the current study was based on the successful ampli\u00decation of spiro-chetal DNA, which cannot distinguish between vi- able and nonviable borreliae. However, because allthe engorged ticks were allowed to digest theirbloodmeal for 10 d after repletion, it is unlikely thatthe PCR was detecting only naked DNA from spi-rochetes in the ticks\u00d5 midguts, particularly becausethe target of this PCR is located on the chromosomerather than on a plasmid (Postic et al. 1994). The \u00dending that the infectivity to ticks of needle- infected birds is much lower than that of tick- infected birds has also been observed in naturalrodent reservoir hosts and has been correlated withthe quality of the immune response to B. burgdorferi (Kurtenbach et al. 1994). For birds, the mechanismunderlying this difference in infectivity remains tobe determined. The differences observed in thecurrent study may have been as much related to theparticular strains or genospecies of B. burgdorferi involved or to the different ages of the birds, as tothe different modes of infection. All 3 pheasants that had PCR positive skin samples transmitted B. burgdorferi s.l. to xenodiagnostic ticks, indicating the presence of viable borreliae inthe birds\u00d5 skin (see above). However, because 2 ofthe 5 birds that transmitted infections to ticksyielded negative skin samples, PCR-based xenodi-agnosis appears to be much more sensitive in de-tecting spirochetal infection in birds than directampli\u00decation of B. burgdorferi DNA from skin. Therefore,relianceonPCRdetectionofspirochetesfrom avian skin biopsies may underestimate theprevalence of Borrelia infection in avian reservoirs,Table 1.

In the course of repeated tick infestations, the experimental pheasants developed strong in\u00dfam-matory reactions at the tick feeding sites, suggestingthe possibility of acquired anti-tick immunity. Sim-ilar \u00dendings were observed in another natural host,the vole, glareolus Schreber (Randolph 1994, Dijiz and Kurtenbach 1995). Thedifferential rates of recovery of alive and engorgedlarvae and nymphs (Table 1) indicates that thefeedingsuccessoflarvaeonthisbirdspeciesislowerthan that of nymphs, possibly caused by in\u00dfamma-toryresponses.Infact,mostoftheintroducedlarvaedied while attempting to feed on the pheasants. Ourlaboratory-based observations were consistent with(but not necessarily explanatory of) the \u00deeld ob-servations on natural infestation levels (Table 2). Asimilar observation on the differential feeding suc-cess of larvae and nymphs has been reported forchickens (Piesman et al. 1996). It is now apparent that many of the major host species for I. ricinus in British woodlands contribute to the transmission of B. burgdorferi s.l., but they do so in different, complementary ways because theyfeed different fractions of the tick population. Smallrodents (mice and voles) feed mainly larvae, butvirtually no nymphs (Humair et 1995, Randolph and Craine 1995),whereas pheasants show the reverse pattern, feed-ing large numbers of nymphs but many fewer larvae.Alongside these abundant rodent and bird hosts inwoodlands are grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis Gmelin, less large larvae and nymphs (Craine et al. 1995) andknown to be B. burgdorferi -competent hosts (Craine et al. 1997). In addition, roe deer, Capreolus capreolus L., play an important role in supporting the tick population by feeding large numbers of all3 life stages (A.N.H., unpublished data). In view of the current results we conclude that pheasants, which constitute a major part of theland-based avi-fauna in Britain, play an importantrole in the transmission dynamics of B. burgdorferi s.l Acknowledgments We thank S.G.T.
