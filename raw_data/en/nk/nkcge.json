Through careful and considerable investment, the funders have collectively built capacity in the sector; and enabled a dramatic change in the use of large patient data and research datasets to help understand, treat and prevent disease. The MRC has prioritised strategic support to this domain of activity, with key investments including: the Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research; MRC Medical Bioinformatics awards: contribution to Genomics England Ltd; and most recently, leading the establishment of the new national institute for health data science, Health Data Research UK (HDR UK). Together with funding from government, universities and charities, these investments have provided a significant step-change in the UK health data landscape across the spectrum, from molecules to man. However, many of these investments are at risk of operating in isolation from each other, with data, knowledge and methods tending to be developed in silos, particularly between the molecular and health informatic fields. Furthermore, the sector still has significant methodological challenges and digital skills shortages. As the volume and complexity of data continues to increase, it's clear that we need to build on UK expertise, enhance our cutting edge analytical methods, and take a more coordinated approach to managing our unique data resources. Until now, there has been no UK overview of the health data research landscape. The report Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research and Innovation gives a unique window into the major investments made across 26 research organisations throughout the UK. This report was prepared by the MRC to support the funders' investment decisions into HDR UK. However, it also underscores the importance of health data research for the nation in general - and for science in particular - and will help funders develop a more coordinated and mutually beneficial approach, with an aligned set of delivery mechanisms for future investment. This is a transformational time for the health data research community, with significant activity across the world. The UK not only has a tremendous wealth and variety of health data but also a real strength in analytical skills. This report reveals that the UK has a very real opportunity to be a global leader in health data research and by harnessing this potential could yield huge benefits for our nation's health and wealth. Dr R S Buckle Chief Science Officer, MRC 6 Background to this review6 1. BACKGROUND TO THIS REVIEW CHAPTER 1 BACKGROUND TO THIS REVIEW8 Background to this review1.1. Aims As part of the activities to establish Health Data Research UK (HDR UK) - previously known as the UK Health and Biomedical Informatics Research Institute - the MRC conducted a health data research and innovation landscape mapping review with the following aims: To create a broad baseline of current activity in health data research relevant to health/biomedicine and innovation programmes; To inform the next phase of investments in this area and in particular the new informatics institute (HDR UK), and other related activities, such as opportunities arising from the Life Sciences Industrial Strategy ; To compile qualitative insights that will help create a common understanding of the purpose, likely direction, and impacts of existing investments in health data research across different stakeholders that will result in strengthened partnerships and closer alignment of common objectives across existing and new initiatives; and To present to the HDR UK Director, and the independent Expert Review Group (ERG), a body of knowledge to help them develop a comprehensive research strategy for HDR UK, including the selection of the research organisation sites that will constitute the institute. 1.2. Scope and sections Scope This review focuses on health data research and innovation investments and activities in the UK, and mainly in England due to the complexity and fragmentation across the breadth of activities in England. It was agreed with the sponsors of this review that if required, it could be broadened to include further investments (e.g. international), and/or deepened to include further analysis on specific investments at a future stage. Sections In its first section, the review provides a top-level view of some key informatics/health data science-related investments from several funders including the: MRC: Farr Institute of Health NIHR: Health Informatics and other informatics activities supported through the NIHR Biomedical Research Centres Department of Health and Social Care England: Academic Health Science Centres NHS England: Academic Health Science Network; and the National 100,000 Genomes Project ESRC: Administrative Data Research Centres and Network; and other investments in Big Data EPSRC: Alan Turing Institute and Health Data Analytics Network In its second section, the review provides an insight analysis of the confidential Statements of Interest (SoI) submitted from the different Research Organisations (ROs) in response to a targeted call issued in December 2016 to express their interest to become an HDR UK substantive or partner site. 9 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationOut of scope This review does not include activities or investments on: computational tools and platforms developed by the digital healthcare industry; detailed description of data resources and population cohorts; and information governance and data access processes and policies. 1.3. Approach The review staff (Dr Ekaterini Blaveri) used a combination of desk research and stakeholder communications to gain an understanding of the key UK programmes in health data research. Going forward the use of surveys, structured interviews; and workshop(s) with key opinion leaders could be considered to gain a deeper understanding of certain activities. It should be noted that the material searched could potentially be much more extensive, since aspects of research collaboration are referenced over a wide range of publications. However, because of the limited time available to this review, information was collated predominately from the funders of key programmes. Extracting insights from the Statements of Interest received from UK Research Organisations in response to the December 2016 call The MRC office received SoIs from 26 ROs interested in becoming a substantive site of HDR UK. These were subdivided into seven geographical clusters, to make easier to identify the regional strengths and interconnections. As the information requested from the ROs was very high-level, a modified \"SWOT\" analysis - (Strengths, Translational and Innovation Capabilities, Opportunities and Gaps - STOG) was performed to synthesise meaningful insights from the SoI and address the following questions: Strengths What the organisation already does well? What resources (both tangible and intangible) do they have that will help them become a substantive site? Have they developed a leading position in health data science-relevant areas - based on what? Translation and Innovation capabilities What are the resources in place to aid research translation and innovation? Do they have strong industry collaborations? Do they have links with the NHS? Are they innovating in ways that others aren't? Opportunities Are there areas that they have the capability to build on or expand? Are there any clear opportunities for collaboration and synergies?10 Background to this review Potential gaps Which informatics/health data science areas they have not developed? Is there a perception that hampers its ability to succeed? Any information that was deemed secondary to the \"SOTIG\" analysis, but was still a valuable piece of evidence, was broadly grouped into: Research themes: research domains (e.g. discovery science, digital health, stratified medicine and population and public health) and disease areas; Analytics: methodology innovation and new tools; e-Infrastructure : platforms/environments/systems and compute to enable data usage and support collaboration; and People: public engagement, training and partnerships/collaborations. Where possible, the information provided within the SoI was cross-checked with other sources. 1.4. Challenges Scoping the UK (and international) landscape and identifying the different health and biomedical data research and innovation activities and trends is not an easy task. As this is an emerging field and the discipline is not yet clearly established/defined, identifying what actually qualifies as health and biomedical data research, and what does not, was the first challenge. Another challenge with identifying investments is that not all of them are clearly visible to an external audience. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that no one knows exactly how many investments currently exist in the UK. Against this background, it is impossible to obtain an exhaustive picture of the current global position regarding health data research investments. This review aims to gain an overview of the main features of the general landscape, rather than to try to fill in every detail. Hence, although this isn' t conclusive work, it sets the baseline and will contribute to the on-going discussion and shaping of investment in health data research and innovation, particularly during the early phases of establishing HDR UK. Given the rapid pace of change, there will be an on-going need to refresh and review this landscape - potentially including adapting this report into a web-based community resource. 1.5. Acknowledgements The information provided in section three of this review was mainly extracted from the SoIs of Research Organisations interested in becoming a Substantive Site of the UK Health and Biomedical Informatics Research Institute (now known as HDR UK). This was in response to a targeted call from MRC that preceded the call for the HDR UK Phase 1 investment in Substantive Sites announced in August 2017. We would like to sincerely thank all the representatives from across the different Research Organisations who have contributed to this report. Also, we are grateful to the HDR UK funding partners for their input and support in shaping this report.2. OVERVIEW OF MAJOR INFORMATICS INVESTMENTS BY FUNDER CHAPTER 2 OVERVIEW OF MAJOR INFORMATICS INVESTMENTS BY FUNDER12 Overview of major informatics investments by Funder2.1. MRC 2.1.1. The Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research 2.1.1.1. The e-Health Informatics Research Centres and Network In 2012 the MRC brought together 10 government and charity research funders1 to invest \u00a319M (\u00a35.8M MRC) over five years (awards end in April 2018) through four e-Health Informatics Research Centres (e-HIRCs) - based at: University College London (UCL), University of Manchester; University of Swansea; and University of Dundee. Collectively the e-HIRCs involve 24 university partners across the UK. The funders also provided an additional \u00a32.18M -award to establish a UK Health Informatics Research Network (UK HIRN) . The Network aimed to promote best practice, build partnerships (particularly with academia, industry and the NHS) and co-ordinate activities in outward-facing priority areas including: methodology; information governance; and public engagement. This joint investment aimed to enhance capability in cutting-edge research in developing informatics tools and methodologies for using and linking e-health data at scale as well as building capacity and skills across a range of areas from cardiovascular to maternal health, using public health, clinical, educational, housing, pollution, accident and demographic datasets. 2.1.1.2. The Farr Institute of Informatics Research In 2013 the MRC invested a further \u00a320M capital (predominately compute infrastructure and buildings) into the four e-HIRCs to establish the Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research and accelerate the development of a UK-wide platform for health informatics research, including digital infrastructure to securely share data, support linkage at scale and develop standards. After the establishment of the Farr Institute, the four e-HIRCs changed their the UK HIRN changed its name to be: the Farr Network. The vision for the Farr Institute was to: \"Create a UK-wide initiative that acts as a catalyst and accelerator for large-scale data science harnessing the knowledge from health records and research data to improve the health of patients and communities across the UK and beyond\". 1. Arthritis Research UK, the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Medical Research Council, the National Institute of Health Research, the National Institute for Social Care and Health Research (Welsh Assembly Government), the Chief Scientist Office (Scottish Government Health Directorates) and the Wellcome Trust13 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation2. The information provided in this section was extracted from the Farr Annual Reports. Further information of the Farr institute's activities can be found in other section of this report, under the lead Research Organisations of the individual Farr Centres (University of Edinburgh, University of Manchester, University of Swansea and UCL).Farr Institute's key activities2 1. Performing pioneering multidisciplinary research with large and complex health-related data Research excellence is a primary goal of the Farr Institute, ideally through collaborations across the UK so that it acts as a single institute. To this end, it has initiated several cross-Centre research programmes (Box 1 ) to facilitate research at scale, and answer questions that the individual Farr Centres or investigators would be unable to pursue in isolation, many with collaborators from other organisations beyond health care research. It's noteworthy that the e-HIRCs and the Farr Institute awards did not include funding to support cross-centre research. Instead, the Farr Institute's Network grant was used to: convene new groups with complementary expertise; and pump-prime collaborative research by reprioritising the budgets of the individual Centres. Box 1 - Farr Institute's Cross-Centre Projects - Examples (extracted from the 2016/17 Farr Annual Report) : Health outcomes of children and adults with learning difficulties This project seeks to investigate factors associated with the diagnosis, treatment, health and educational outcomes of vulnerable groups in society, particularly those with learning difficulties and/or Autistic Spectrum Disorders. A multi-disciplinary team from the Universities of Glasgow, Cardiff and Swansea with expertise in epidemiology, learning disorders and health informatics have been creating comparative cohorts from multiple sources including; education, general practice, inpatient, mortality and population registers. The population cohorts involve more than 1.5 M linked records and the first analysis on relative risk of hospitalization from all and selected causes has commenced. Identifying episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) across healthcare settings using routinely collected data The Kidney Disease@Farr collaboration brings together a multidisciplinary group of researchers with interests in health informatics and kidney disease. This project aimed to evaluate and improve the portability of an existing AKI electronic phenotyping algorithm developed in Grampian, Scotland. The algorithm has now been implemented across three other UK regions: Hampshire, Salford and Swansea. All datasets consisted of linked electronic health record data across primary and secondary care. Using the algorithm, researchers compared the incidence and character of AKI episodes in each region and index year and found substantial differences between regions in AKI incidence. The group are currently systematically investigating potential reasons for these differences. Anticipated outcomes of the project in the next few months are: a publically available AKI phenotyping algorithm, including associated metadata and guidance for local implementation; a clinically focussed paper on incidence and characteristics of AKI episodes in four UK healthcare populations, including potential explanations for differences; a methodological paper providing guidance how to implement electronic phenotyping algorithms across datasets that have different contexts and underlying infrastructures.14 Overview of major informatics investments by Funder2. Develop new health data research infrastructure, methods and technologies The Farr Institute has also launched several initiatives to demonstrate secure inter-operability between research data infrastructure investments across the UK, to facilitate data sharing and federated meta-analyses. For example: all Farr Centres are actively participating in the JISC SafeShare project (together with the MRC Medical Bioinformatics initiative and the ESRC Administrative Data Research Network ( see section 2.5.1) ) piloting a high capacity, encrypted network between research centres across the JANET network3. Swansea University and Cardiff University are the first to complete trialling the new infrastructure. ADRN researchers at these universities are actively using the service for access to sensitive research data. MRC's capital investment in the Farr Institute established the UK Secure eResearch Platform (UKSeRP) , which is hosted by the Farr@CIPHER(Swansea) and provides ISO27001 certified data curation, management, sharing and analysis facilities to the UK research community. Imbued with capabilities derived from 10 years of operating the Secure Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank in Wales ( see also section in this report describing investments at Swansea University ), UKSeRP is provisioned with a suite of capabilities that allow data owners to remotely share their data in line with best information governance principles using an easy-to-use interface in a ready to use solution. UKSeRP provides underpinning technology for Dementia Platform UK ( Box 2 ); the SAIL Databank - its biggest user; UK Biobank; the Administrative Data Research Centre Wales; and the MRC Medical Bioinformatics CLIMB (Cloud Infrastructure for Bioinformatics) programme ( see section 2.1.2 ). The Farr@HeRC(Manchester) has provided the research and analytical platform for Connected Health Cities, a cornerstone of the Northern Powerhouse ( see section in this report describing investments at the University of Manchester ). Box 2 - The Dementia Platform UK (DPUK) has selected UKSeRP as the unifying Data Portal to bring together and share data from 33 pre-existing research cohort studies (extracted from the 2016/17 Farr Annual Report) . With robust legal agreements for data transfer now in place with five academic institutions and an industry partner, data is now being received in Swansea from cohorts across the UK. Three cohorts have currently shared baseline study data to the Portal. Another six are currently online and using our front-end to the infrastructure to upload their data and supporting documentation or are in advanced discussions for sharing multi-omics data. After a short period of testing, this data will be made available to the wider research community, subject to successful project applications. It is envisaged that 16 cohorts which are currently deemed 'research-ready' will have shared data by June 2017 and preliminary feasibility and case study projects are due to start in order to provide operational evidence of the capability and functionality of the DPUK Data Portal. New UKSeRP infrastructure builds include the integration of the DPUK genomics platform to allow for centralised genomic research to take place within a specialist analysis platform on UKSeRP , along with epidemiological, imaging and wearables data. In partnership with the European Medical Information Framework (EMIF), DPUK will be the recipient of extra metadata tools for in-depth cohort discovery, and subsequently, an integrated participant finder tool that will be enhance the capability of DPUK cohorts to be used to recruit for clinical trials, which is of particular interest to the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) consortium. UKSeRP has recently added XNAT, an open source imaging informatics platform, to support DPUK's needs, as well as making it available to other tenants. 3. JANET is a high-speed network for the UK research and education community.15 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation3. Work with the owners and data controllers to support the safe use of patient information for medical research across the UK The Farr Institute recognises that ensuring privacy, security and good governance are paramount. In Wales and Scotland, it has built good relationships with NHS and Government and local authority data controllers. This has been instrumental to facilitate access to data, proportionate governance and improve data linkage. In Scotland, the Farr Institute co-designed the Public Benefits and Privacy Panel launched in 2016. In England, there is senior Farr Institute representation on the NHS Digital Research Advisory Group, and it has made important contributions to the recent National Data Guardian Review of data security, consent and opt-outs . In terms of the Farr's quest to mobilise new datasets for research, there have been notable developments in national prescribing and national imaging in Scotland and incorporation of local authority and other public datasets in Wales. 4. Training and capacity building As a research collaboration, the Farr Institute represents a variety of postgraduate (e.g. Masters) and professional education courses (CPD and MOOCs) run and hosted by its member and partner universities and has co-hosted numerous events reaching over 5,000 people. This has created a thriving community of doctoral and post-doctoral researchers across the UK, including over 100 PhD students and the successful launch of the Farr Institute Future Leaders programme , with the aim of training the next generation of leaders in health informatics. 5. Public engagement The Farr Institute has been very active in public engagement with exposure delivered across science festivals; creation of the 100 Ways case studies series ; development of the #datasaveslives campaign; and strategic input to the Understanding Patient Data initiative led by Wellcome. 6. Partnerships The Farr Institute further developed existing collaborations and fostered new relationships with diverse groups from across the pharmaceutical and health technology industries (e.g. Intel Life Science, GSK, Jansen) but also government departments and the NHS (e.g. established the Prudent Healthcare Intelligence Hub , an academic/NHS partnership in Wales; and the Innovative Healthcare Delivery programme in Scotland to realise the vision of harnessing informatics to improve NHS services). It also continues to establish collaborations across the globe with the leaders of health data science in other countries. For example, it has a memorandum of understanding with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Canada , solidifying a commitment to work together in areas of common strategic operations and interest.16 Overview of major informatics investments by Funder2.1.2. MRC Medical Bioinformatics initiative In March 2013, the MRC made a \u00a339M (\u00a328M capital for spend in 2014/15; and \u00a311M resource for spend over 5 years of award, ending in 2019) investment to build and extend the UK's capacity, capability and infrastructure in medical bioinformatics by: building flexibly on the capabilities already in place in Universities and Centres of Excellence; developing new infrastructure, tools and increased coordination and sharing of capabilities; and supporting career opportunities for computational scientists, technologists and programme leaders. Fellowship funding was also available for recruitment of research leaders in bioinformatics and computational biology. This initiative strongly aligned with MRC's existing investments in informatics research, including the EMBL- European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), ELIXIR , the Farr Institute/e-HIRCs; and those of other funders including those of the Department of Health and Social Care. The awards were targeted at the \"molecule to man\" interface and aimed to: improve informatics and computational approaches to understanding mechanisms of human disease - from the cellular level through to the whole disease phenotype facilitate research linkage between basic genomic information, complex phenotypes, and clinical data sets build analytical capabilities tailored to medical research and in particular the challenge of integration across differing degrees of resolution, dynamic scales and heterogeneity of data, and interpretation of very large and rich data sets including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, imaging, population data. The following six awards were made: 1. Data-driven discovery Institute; University College London London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM); King's College London (KCL); Queen Mary University of London Sanger Institute; and the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) (co-leads: Jim Smith and David Lomas. Research lead: Nick Luscombe) - \u00a38.9M This MRC investment has established one of the world's largest secure biomedical cloud infrastructures built to integrate and share heterogenous data from personal healthcare records, imaging, pharmacoinformatics and genomics. Through co-location eMedLab eliminates the delays and security risks that occur when data is moved. It also provides a platform to develop analytical tools that allow biomedical researchers to transform raw data into scientific insights and clinical outcomes. It stores data securely and its modular design ensures sustainability through expansion and replacement. Currently, eMedLab supports the efforts of over one hundred biomedical researchers from academia and industry, studying cancers, cardio-vascular and rare diseases, including six MRC Stratified Medicine projects focusing on auto-immune diseases through hosting their tranSMART infrastructure where they have captured and integrated their complex multi-omic data on several thousand rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients. The system is operated as a private cloud through a Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform with Lenovo Flex System hardware to enable the creation of virtual HPC clusters bespoke to individual researchers' requirements. It is housed in the Virtus DataCentre in Slough, UK through the Jisc Shared Data Centre Agreement. MRC eMedLab has won an award at the UK Cloud Awards 2017 for the 'Best Public Sector Project' category.17 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation2. Consortium for medical microbial bioinformatics ( short name: CLIMB ) University of Warwick, Cardiff University, Swansea University, University of Birmingham, University of Bath, University of Leicester and The Quadram Institute (a BBSRC research institute) (co-leads: Mark Pallen & Sam Sheppard) - \u00a38.5M This investment established what is probably the largest computer (distributed, web-based) system dedicated to the analysis of microbial genomes in the world, the Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB). MRC CLIMB is a public, free to use cloud for the medical microbial bioinformatics community in the UK and currently supports over 1,000 researchers from over 300 research groups across the UK. This state of the art inter-disciplinary facility for use by the academic, industrial and healthcare communities - will enhance regional and national capability and infrastructure in microbial bioinformatics and improve our understanding of bacteria of medical importance. The system is based on an open source platform for cloud computing powered by OpenStack and provides large scale data storage and compute capacity on demand whilst making these mor e cost-efficient by optimising the utilisation of hardware while capitalising on economies of scale. CLIMB has allowed UKSeRP to be augmented with significant HPC capabilities to support genetic analyses. Operating fully as part of the UK-wide CLIMB consortium this investment has been accommodated into the existing UKSeRP infrastructure to allow unused cycles to be repurposed for other studies and tenants, as well as providing the necessary secure circumstances to allow the co-analysis of microbial and human genetic data, along with clinical and population data. MRC CLIMB won two HPCWire Readers Choice awards in 2017; 'Best use of HPC in the life sciences' and 'Best HPC Collaboration (Academia/Government/Industry)'), which were presented at the international Supercomputing conference in Denver, Colorado. 3. MRC Medial Bioinformatics Centre at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics University of Leeds (lead: Alex Markham) - \u00a37.0M The focus of the Leeds Medical Bioinformatics award is to link molecular, phenotypic and health record datasets, sourced locally and nationally, for research to deliver patient benefit. In this respect this award aligned well with the focus of the Farr Institute. Their plan is to create an integrated clinical research campus on the Mayo Clinic model where all patients are potential research subjects with all routine phenotype data captured on the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system and made available in a secure \"Phenobank\". The core of this investment is a partnership between the University, the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and the Leeds-based Phoenix Partnership (TTP: the supplier of one of the largest primary care clinical records system in the world). The award contributed towards upgrading the computing infrastructure (high speed network connections and data storage) that links clinical practice and research activity across the campuses of the University of Leeds and its Teaching Hospitals and establishing a Virtual Research Environment safe haven. This infrastructure supports researchers studying cancer, inherited rare diseases and acute kidney injury.18 Overview of major informatics investments by Funder4. The Big Data Institute University of Oxford (leads: Gil McVean Director, Martin Landray, Deputy Director) - \u00a36.0M The Big Data Institute (BDI) lies at the heart of Oxford's ambitions in health data science ( see also section 3 in this report describing investments at BDI@Oxford University ). The MRC Medical Bioinformatics award provided capital funding only that went towards the \u00a347M building, where BDI is housed (opened in May 2017). BDI has received funding from diverse sources including the UK Government: UK Research Infrastructure Investment Partnership (\u00a310M); the MRC (\u00a31M addition Li Ka Shing \u00a320M fellowships). 5. Partnership to develop the aggregation, integration, visualisation and analysis of large, complex data (short name: UK MEDBIO ) Imperial College London (lead: Paul Elliot) - \u00a35.9M The focus of this investment was on linking 'omics data to the phenome/exposome4 through the work in the MRC-Public Health England (PHE) Centre for Environment and Health. This entailed bringing together the necessary patient/cohort data, new 'omics technologies, computing and other r esources, with dedicated infrastructure in data management, integration, analysis and visualisation, to enable major advances in understanding the aetiopathogenesis of chronic human diseases, and the gene-environment-microbiome interactions that underpin them. This award mainly funded capital infrastructure underpinned by a full-time bioinformatician, system administrator and three five-year fellowships (jointly supported by Imperial College London). It provided extensive computing, data storage and HPC infrastructure that is enabling the analysis of very large datasets (e.g. UK Biobank, GWAS/sequencing, epigenomics, immune data), and for the overlay of multi-omics data (e.g. GWAS/metabolomics). Currently, around 100 projects are using this facility. 6. Improved analysis of population health and biological data MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit (lead: Pontiano Kaleebu) - \u00a32.8M Aligned to the MRC's global health strategy and long term investment in the MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit, this MRC Medical Bioinformatics award established the MRC/UVRI Medical Informatics Centre in Entebbe, Uganda. It capitalises on the technological advances in genomics and medical informatics and to ensure the efficient utilisation of data resources in clinical epidemiology and large scale genomics across Sub-Saharan Africa from existing and on-going research programmes. The Centre builds on established strategic collaborations with UK Research Centres\u2014the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; the MRC Functional Genomics Unit; MRC and Global Health; the MRC Epidemiology Unit; School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh; and the MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology at Imperial College, UK. These UK Centres provide scientific and logistical support to develop infrastructure and computational processes, cloud computing and human research capacity, as well as supporting pan-African and north-south research partnerships (Africa-UK medical informatics consortium). 4. Refers to the totality of internal and external exposures from a variety of sources including but not limited to chemical and biological agents, gut microbial and psycho-social factors from pre-conception onwards.19 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationAlthough the MRC Medical Bioinformatics awards were predominately focused on infrastructure, a diverse range of capacity building activities were also supported, including training through MSc and PhD studentships, at least 10 post-doctoral career development fellowships, and several \"training academies\" covering a breadth of career stages and disciplines, including clinical and non-clinical. 2.1.3. MRC Capital Investment in Genomics England Data Infrastructure Aligned to the Medical Bioinformatics initiative, in 2014, as part of the MRC-led \u00a3230M Clinical Research Infrastructure initiative, \u00a324m capital was invested in Genomics England Ltd (through Queen Mary University London and partners) to support the UK 100,000 Genomes Project. This was used to help establish the main Data Centre and to make the rich data resources securely available to researchers and clinicians from across the UK. 2.1.4. Established infrastructure and capabilities Over this short period (2012-2014), the MRC, working with its partners invested over \u00a3100m (\u00a372M capital, \u00a328M resource) through the initiatives described above. This delivered significant progress towards building the necessary capacity and infrastructure to deliver a step-change in the UK's health and biomedical data science capabilities. The Research Organisation footprint of these awards is illustrated below. Figure 1: Farr Institute Centres and MRC Medical Bioinformatics awards Institute WarwickSwanseaCardiffCLIMB UCLEMBL-EBISanger CrickeMedLab Medical Bioinformatics Uganda 20 Overview of major informatics investments by FunderHealth Data Research UK, will benefit and build on these capabilities. The individual MRC Medical Bioinformatics and Farr Institute awards will not be renewed, except where they are incorporated into on-going research programmes e.g. the MRC/UVRI Uganda research Unit. 2.2. The National Institute for Health Research The NIHR is a government body that receives funding from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in England. Its vision is to improve the health and wealth of the UK through research; and its mission is to provide a health research system in which the NHS supports outstanding individuals working in world-class facilities, conducting leading-edge research focused on the needs of patients and the public. To do this, the NIHR funds from early to late stage translational health research and a range of infrastructure facilities to support it. Furthermore, it works with the patients and the public to shape its research agenda, which spans a number of different areas: from finding new ways of preventing, identifying and treating disease, to evaluating the effectiveness and impact of new treatments, and making sure that the best possible evidence is available to inform decisions about health and social care. The NIHR and the MRC co-fund several research programmes, which support basic and early translational research. The two bodies work together closely, overseen by the Office for Strategic Coordination of Health Research (OSCHR) to ensure that there is a continuum of research opportunities along the translational pathway. This also applies to informatics/health data research, where there is an OSCHR health informatics sub-board (chaired by Professor Sir Alex Markham) to provide an overview of the health informatics landscape including NHS, research and commercial needs, funder alignment and data access. In a time of high activity, the sub-board provides oversight across the community and brings a wide number of organisations operating in this area together.

The NIHR Biomedical Research Centres The NIHR infrastructure investments include the Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs), which support several informatics research activities.5 The NIHR BRCs are partnerships between: an 'Academic Partner', usually a research university or similar specialised institution; and an 'NHS Host', usually in the form of an NHS Foundation Trust. The aims of the BRCs are to: drive innovation in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of ill-health through early translational (experimental medicine) research; translate advances in biomedical research into benefits for patients, the health system and for broader economic gain; and provide a key component of the NHS contribution to UK's international competitiveness.

Please note that details on other NIHR informatics-relevant investments, including the NIHR Bio resource and the NIHR CRIS, are provided in the key informatics investments by Research Organisation (section 3).22 Overview of major informatics investments by FunderThe first five BRCs were established in 2007 with the aim to transform scientific breakthroughs into life-saving treatments for patients. Two further five-year cycles of funding followed, with the most recent commencing in April 2017 and allocating \u00a3816M across 20 BRCs. Each BRC has a substantial portfolio of world-class biomedical research across a range of themes and diseases including: cancer, cardiovascular, dementia, endocrinology and metabolism, infection, immunity and inflammation, genetics and genomics, musculoskeletal, neuroscience, nutrition and lifestyle, ageing, paediatrics, respiratory disease, stroke, surgical innovation. For more information see Annex 1 . Details on informatics research activities delivered through the BRCs are provided in the sections of this report describing the wider activities of each Research Organisation. 2.2.2. The NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative programme Background The NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) programme is a stand-alone investment involving more than one BRC. It was conceived in response to a 'grand challenge' from England's Chief Medical Officer: \" to show that data collected in the course of routine patient care across the five largest biomedical research centres can be re-used for collaborative, translational research\" . The HIC is a collaboration between five leading BRCs. These are: 1. Oxford BRC: Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH) and University of Oxford; 2. Cambridge BRC: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) and University of Cambridge; 3. St College London; 4. Imperial BRC: Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT) and Imperial College London; and 5. UCLH BRC: University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) and University College London. Three other NHS Trusts are working with the Collaborative: Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust; Kings College Trust; and Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust. Originally, the programme lifecycle was for two years, from April 2013 to March 2015, but this was later extended. The HIC investment was \u00a311M total from NIHR, which was matched by the partner NHS Trusts and the BRCs in the form of funds, existing resources and other contributions. Further funding for the HIC is currently under consideration. Programme Governance The Programme is governed by an Oversight Board, comprising the five NHS Trust CEOs; and a Programme Board, comprising BRC Directors and CIOs, with Programme Management teams at each BRC. The Oxford BRC provides the coordinating hub for the programme.23 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationAims The aims of the HIC are to: establish and maintain catalogued, comparable, comprehensive flows of patient data at each Trust; create a governance framework for data sharing and re-use across the Trusts and partner organisations; and demonstrate this new capability - the data flows and the governance framework - through the delivery of a number of exemplar research studies, one in each of five specific therapeutic areas. Research themes The development of the HIC capability has focussed on five therapeutic ar eas, chosen for their importance to patients and the NHS and also for the different challenges that they present in terms of data quality and availability. These are: Theme Lead Investigator Lead Partner Site Acute coronary syndromes Dr Jamil Mayet Imperial Viral hepatitis Dr Ellie Barnes Oxford Critical care Professor Mervyn Singer UCLH Ovarian cancer Dr James Brenton Cambridge Renal Transplantation Dr Paramit Chowdhury Guy's and St Thomas' The success of the programme has led to an increase in scope, with data now also being collected for prostate, breast, colorectal, and lung cancer. Data is also being collected on a wider range of infectious diseases. These new areas will interface with the 100,000 Genomes Project. Deliverables The HIC deliverables are: Data collection and sharing will be facilitated by a models (metadata) catalogue , showing how relevant data is acquired, managed, and made available. All sites hold and collect data according to agreed candidate data models . The catalogue relates these datasets to models describing local systems and processes. Study datasets based upon these models will be delivered by each Trust to support the exemplar research projects. A framework to govern data sharing and processing will be established to support the delivery of these datasets, including a data sharing agreement, allowing for the transfer of de-identified and/or identified information between Trusts. The Metadata Catalogue Partner sites have different systems for electronic patient records and little or no data has been shared between them previously. To address this, a single Model (Metadata) Catalogue has been established. This tool provides a standard way for recording, storing and organising data in a unified format, to create a shared data resource across the partner sites. Context is given to each result or data entry, which makes the data easier to understand and avoids miscommunications and errors being made.24 Overview of major informatics investments by FunderThe Shared Datasets Research leaders from across the five sites have agreed an appropriate, minimum dataset or shared standard for each theme, while the informatics teams at each site have established the clinical data repositories and data flows to extract and link data, and to match these shared standards, ready re-use in support of multi-site research programmes. These are: i. Acute Coronary Symptoms (ACS) dataset This dataset contains data from the HIC partners involved in the ACS theme and is stored at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust research warehouse. It is an anonymised dataset derived from routinely collected NHS patient data (100k patients and continues to grow) who have received a troponin assay since 2010 (or as far back in time as possible). These are secondary care- local deep episodic patient-level data including: A&E records; pathology revascularisation (percutaneous, surgical); echo imaging; transfusion. ii. Critical care dataset This dataset contains identifiable data supplied by all participating T rusts (GSTT, CUH, OUH and ICHNT), and stored in the UCL Trusted Research Environment. It is secondary care - deep episodic patient-level data including: demographic, physiological, laboratory and drug data for all patients admitted to Critical Care and Intensive Care Units from January 2014 onwards (c. 8,000 - 10,000 patients anticipated if all Trusts contribute). iii. Renal transplantation dataset This dataset contains de-identified renal transplantation data from the HIC participating centres and is stored within a GSTT research data warehouse. It includes data from patients who have undergone kidney, or pancreas and kidney, transplantation after January 2005, and have been followed up in any of the HIC participating centres. This is a secondary care - local deep episodic patient-level data (currently estimated 6,500 unique patients for the observation period) including information on recipient donor demographics, medical history, transplant details, pathology/biopsy and HLA results, medication and follow up. iv. Viral hepatitis dataset Anonymised data from patients (currently 1,200 patients) with a diagnosis of hepatitis B, C, D, E or autoimmune hepatitis, collected from the collaborating sites since 2013, primarily from hospital outpatient clinics. These are secondary care - local deep episodic (per consultant episode) data including admission, treatment, follow up, treatment outcome data. v. Ovarian cancer This is a dataset of additional data items to supplement the national cancer data collections (Cancer Outcomes and Services Datasets (COSD) and Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT)) to enable research on cancer outcomes in ovarian cancer. This is secondary care - local deep episodic (per surgery, per investigation, per outpatient visit datasets) including: risk factors; surgical resection details; and record of progression events. Currently, only CUHT has provided data on 400 patients from April 2014; however, the data collection is expected to extend to GSTT and Imperial soon. vi. Ovarian Cancer - chemotherapy The dataset has been designed to collect information on all drug tr eatments with an anti-cancer effect, in all treatment settings, including traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and all newer agents. Each site obtains its monthly SACT from their cancer reporting team, and run a process to anonymise the patients and select the records with the specified diagnosis range. The collection will be done prospectively in line with the SACT national submission starting with the September 2015 return.25 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationCurrently the dataset has 534 chemotherapy records from three Trusts. These are secondary care - local deep episodic (per drug administration of chemotherapy, grouped at regimen and cycle levels) data including: chemotherapy regimen, cycle, drug administration, and treatment end. Strategic interconnections Genomics England - the work of the NIHR HIC involved the development of data models for each clinical theme (mentioned above). In particular, the ovarian cancer model, and learning gathered from a focus on re-use of target data points from national cancer datasets (COSD and SACT) were used as basis for cancer metadata modelling for the NHS 100,000 Genomes Project. The University of Oxford/Oxford BRC team who worked on the NIHR HIC data architecture also worked directly with Genomics England (the two programmes share a Chief Technology Officer - Professor Jim Davies), ensuring strategies are aligned and encouraging the consolidation of HIC and the Genomic Medicine Centres (GMCs) approaches within each NHS Trust. The metadata catalogue was re-used by the NIHR Health Data Finder Programme. HIC subject matter expertise and toolsets were used in developing the Health Data Finder and 'onboarding' meta datasets from NHS Digital, Public Health England and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Professor Ellie Barnes (University of Oxford) who leads the HIC Viral Hepatitis theme also leads the MRC Stratified Medicine consortium STOP-HCV , which aims to optimise patient outcomes for Hepatitis C Viral infection. The Oxford team have gathered data on cases from across the five comprehensive BRCs, and the development of a national surveillance system for Hepatitis-C with Public Health England (PHE). 2.2.3. The NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care The Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs) undertake high-quality applied research focused on the needs of patients and support the translation of research evidence into practice with the wider NHS and Public Health. They are collaborative partnerships between a university and the surrounding NHS organisations, focused on improving patient outcomes through the conduct and application of applied health research. They create and embed approaches to research and its dissemination that are specifically designed to take account of the way that health care is increasingly delivered across sectors and a wide geographical area. The nine CLAHRC pilots were established in October 2008, and have completed their five years of funding. There are now 13 CLAHRCs around the UK (2014-2018) and their geographic coverage aligns with that of the Academic Health Science Network. 26 Overview of major informatics investments by Funder2.3. Department of Health and Social Care 2.3.1. Academic Health Science Centres The Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs) in England emerged from a commitment by the Department of Health and Social Care to speed up the adoption of medical advances by mainstream clinical practice; and to make the NHS the very best in research and health care. They are a model of healthcare organisation that helps ensure that research breakthroughs lead to direct clinical benefits for the patient by combining world- class research with leading edge clinical services, and excellence in education and training. They also drive economic growth through partnerships with industry, including life sciences companies. In 2009 a \u00a360M investment was made to establish the first five AHSC in r ecognition of depth and breadth of clinical and academic excellence. These were renewed for a further five years in April 2014 with the addition of a new Centre. The AHSCs, which are University-NHS Trust Partnerships, are: 1. University College London Partners AHSC: University College London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, Barts Health NHS Foundation Trust, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 2. King's Health Partners AHSC: King's College London, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust 3. Imperial College AHSC: Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust 4. Oxford AHSC: University of Oxford, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 5. Cambridge University Health Partners AHSC: University of Cambridge, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 6. Manchester AHSC: University of Manchester, University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust, Salford Clinical Commissioning Group, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (SRFT) The AHSCs are corporate entities (federation of partners legally embodied in a company limited by guarantee) with integrated governance and leadership structures that have assumed the role of strategically and operationally managing both healthcare and relevant academic resources. The six Centres focus on discovery science and the early stages of translational research (T1-T2) within the Trust and usually they have an integrated approach to late stage translation and dissemination of innovation with their local NHS Academic Health Science Network. The delivery of each of the AHSC's objectives is underpinned by strong clinical informatics platforms/ programmes. Details on the specific informatics research activities within each AHSC are provided in the relevant sections of this report describing the wider activities of the Research Organisations.27 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation2.3.2. Genomics England | 100,000 Genomes Project As part of the strategy to deliver genomic medicine to the NHS, \u00a3100M was allocated through the Department of Health and Social Care in England to sequence 100,00 genomes in rare diseases, cancers and infectious diseases from 70,000 patients by the end of 2017. Genomics England Ltd (GeL) was set up to deliver these ambitions and to bring the benefits of personalised medicine to the NHS. Researchers and clinicians, from both academia and the NHS ( see also section 2.4.2 ), are working together to continually analyse data from the 100,000 Genomes Project through the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP) . The researchers have formed groups or 'domains'. Each GeCIP domain covers a different disease or topic in the project. The groups are focused on interpreting the data to improve clinical care, but will also undertake complementary research - this includes medical, computational and social research. Devolved nations MRC also offered to help the Devolved Governments (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) in their engagement with the 100,000 Genomes Project through GeL. The ambition is to establish a UK-wide partnership to bring together larger assets of genomic data and capability to link to genomic, phenotypic and health record information to offer much greater value and impact than individual collections working in isolation. Plans are driven by the needs and ambitions of the Devolved Governments as well as developing a UK-wide asset and capability. GeL Data Centre The Genomics England main Data Centre is based in the Ark Data Centre in Corsham Wiltshire. MRC invested \u00a324M to help establish the Data Centre to deliver the research data management and analysis needs.28 Overview of major informatics investments by Funder2.4. NHS 2.4.1. Academic Health Science Networks The Academic Health Science Networks (AHSN) aim to deliver a step-change in the way the NHS identifies, evaluates and adopts new technologies and are predicated on partnership working and collaboration between the NHS, academia, the private sector and other external partners, including industry, within a single AHSN context and across AHSNs. This means that they are uniquely placed to identify and spread health innovation at pace and scale; driving the adoption and spread of innovative ideas and technologies across large populations. There are 15 AHSNs across England, established by NHS England in 2013 as autonomous bio-enterprises and small-medium enterprise in nature. Their impact rests in their ability to bring people, resources and organisations together quickly; delivering benefits that could not be achieved alone. Each AHSN works within its own area to develop projects, programmes and initiatives that reflect the diversity of their local populations and healthcare challenges. However, they all share the following priorities: Promoting economic growth Diffusing innovation Improving patient safety Optimising medicine use Improving quality and reducing variation Putting research into practice Collaborating on national priority programmes including: - NHS test beds - National Innovation Accelerator - Supporting New Care Models e.g. NHS Vanguards - 100,000 Genomes Project - Data and informatics Specific programmes of activity for 2016/17 include the areas of Digital Health; and Data integration/ interoperability. AHSC vs AHSN The AHSC focuses on: discoveries arising from basic and applied research (T1-T2) developing innovation and collaboration with industry excellence as a provider of multi-professional education The AHSN focuses on: the diffusion and adoption of discoveries (T2-T4) engagement with industry new ways of delivering healthcare across a wider population29 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationNorth East and North CumbriaNote: East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust sits with Greater Manchester AHSN Yorkshire & Humber East Midlands Eastern UCL Partners Health WestWest EnglandOxfordWest The of major informatics investments by Funder2.4.2. NHS Genomic Medicine Centres Thirteen Genomic Medicine Centres (GMCs) have been established by NHS England and are pivotal in delivering the 100,000 Genomes Project. The GMCs cover the country delivering an end-to-end genomic medicine pathway. They are enabling the participation of patients and family members with their informed consent; collecting samples to extract DNA; capturing clinical information to inform the interpretation of the genome sequence; and establishing the infrastructure to make genomic medicine a routine part of NHS care.

NHS Global Digital Exemplars6 A key component of the NHS Driving Digital Maturity programme is to create Global Digital Exemplars (GDEs). These are internationally recognised NHS provider delivering exceptional care, efficiently, through the use of world-class digital technology and information. Exemplars will share their learning and experiences to enable other Trusts to follow in their footsteps as quickly and effectively as possible ( Box 3 ). Funding of the GDEs is through the \u00a34.2B 'Paperless 2020' programme announced by Jeremy Hunt in February 2016, overseen by the National Information Board . 6.

ESRC's investments in Big Data The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) received \u00a364M in April 2013 to invest in a Big Data initiative as part of the wider announcement of capital funding. This covered three distinct areas of activity: 1. Administrative Data Research Network - aimed to facilitate researcher access to administrative data routinely collected by Government Departments; 2. Business Datasafe - aimed to facilitate researcher access to transactional/ consumer data collected by commercial organisations; 3. Understanding Populations - aimed to extend and enhance the ESRC's portfolio of large-scale surveys. This work was subsequently split into three distinct Phases aimed to deliver the first two areas of activity; and a third covering two further types of data highlighted as important for social science research - social media data and third sector data. The Phases were as follows: Phase 1 focused on the development of the Administrative Data Research Network (ADRN), which provides access to de-identified administrative data collected by government departments for research use. The ADRN awards were made in October 2013. More details are provided in the next section. Phase 2 supported the establishment of centres with a focus on business and local government data. The Centres make data, routinely collected by business and local government organisations, accessible for academics to undertake research that makes a difference: shaping public policies and making business, voluntary bodies and other organisations more effective as well as shaping wider society. The awards were made in March 2014. Further information on each of the investments is provided in Annex 2 . Phase 3 focused primarily on civil society data and new forms of data. Investment in this area has included: investment in the RCUK Digital Economy Hubs; investment in Civil Society Data Partnerships; New and Emerging Forms of Data Policy Demonstrator Projects; and the Centre for Doctoral Training in New Forms of Data. Further information on each of the investments is provided in Annex 2 . 2.5.1. Administrative Data Research Network The Administrative Data Research Network (ADRN) is a UK-wide partnership between universities, government departments and agencies, national statistics authorities, the third sector, funders and researchers. The ADRN is funded until September 2018. ADRN consists of the Administrative Data Service which coordinates four Administrative Data Research Centres (ADRCs) , all at different locations across the UK: Administrative Data Research Centre England (Director: Professor Peter Smith): This is led by the University of Southampton with UCL being a key partner. The ESRC has invested in safe settings and technical infrastructure in both Southampton and UCL; in UCL, the Centre is co-located with Farr@ London at 222 Euston Road . Administrative Data Research Centre Northern Ireland (Director: Dr Dermot O'Reilly): This is led by Queens University Belfast in partnership with University of Ulster. It is worth highlighting that the service element of the Centre is provided by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency who provide the data linkage, user service and physical safe access facilities. As a result, ESRC has not made investments in the technical or physical data infrastructures of these two leading universities in Northern Ireland. This is the only ADRC that is not co-located with a Farr Institute Centre. Administrative Data Research Centre Scotland (Director: Professor Chris Dibben): This is led by the University of Edinburgh in partnership with most universities in Scotland. The Centre is co-located with Farr@Scotland , and has developed the technical and physical infrastructure including safe settings in close collaboration with Farr.33 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation Administrative Data Research Centre Wales (Director: Professor David Ford): This is led by the University of Swansea in partnership with University of Cardiff. ESRC invested over \u00a32m in a data science building which also attracted funding from MRC in the context of Farr Institute in Wales. ADRC and Farr@Swansea share location, staff and other resources . Safe settings have also been created in the University of Cardiff. The ADRN helps accredited researchers carry out social and economic research using linked, de-identified administrative data - information which is routinely collected by government organisations. The ADRN makes sure any information which directly identifies people (such as names and addresses) is removed from the data before any research is done. An Approvals Panel examines every research proposal thoroughly. Once they give their approval, the data custodian has to agree to share its data before the research can go ahead. The ADRN provides a secure environment for the researcher to work in. They can't take any data out of this safe setting, and ADRN staff will scrutinise their results before publication to make sure they are relevant to the project and don't disclose any information about individuals. 2.6. EPSRC's health data research investments The EPSRC supports the development of computational techniques to model, analyse and interpret health and medical data across the breadth of its research funding portfolio, including, but not limited to artificial intelligence technologies, advanced compute infrastructures, information systems and statistics, and applied probability. Two strategic investments relevant to health data research include: The Alan Turing Institute The Alan Turing Institute is a joint venture between EPSRC and five founding universities (Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, UCL and Warwick). The Institute was established in 2015, with a five year \u00a342M government investment, together with a matched \u00a325M investment from the partner universities (\u00a35M per partner). The institute has also formed partnerships with the Lloyds Registry Foundation, Intel, GCHQ and HSBC. The institutes mission is to undertake data science research at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, statistics and systems engineering; provide technically informed advice to policy makers on the wider implications of algorithms; enable researchers from industry and academia to work together to undertake research with practical applications; and act as a magnet for leaders in academia and industry from around the world to engage with the UK in data science and its applications. Core research areas for the Institute include data-centric engineering, high-performance computing and cyber-security, to smart cities, health, the economy and data ethics. The institute aims to apply its data science research to real-world problems, working with partners in industry, government and third sector. UK Health Data Analytics Network (UK-HDAN) The UK Health Data Analytics Network (UK-HDAN) is a broad community of over 400 health data scientists across the UK that works together to better understand the UK health data analytics landscape. The network has convened several community meetings since being established in January 2016 and drafted a research roadmap, as working document that aims to provide a clear statement of the research challenges and opportunities within health data analytics.34 Overview of major informatics investments by Funder London area inset Alan Turing Institute Partners NIHR Biomedical Research Centres Administrative Data Research Centres MRC Medical Bioinformatics awards (UK) Farr Institute Centres Newcastle Edinburgh Swansea Cardiff Bristol Leeds Manchester Nottingham Birmingham Warwick Leicester Oxford Sheffield Cambridge London (see insert) Southampton Belfast Figure 6: National footprint of key research investments relevant to health data science3. KEY INFORMATICS INVESTMENTS BY RESEARCH ORGANISATION CHAPTER 3 KEY INFORMATICS INVESTMENTS BY RESEARCH ORGANISATION36 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationThe sections that follow below provide early insights drawn mainly from the Statement of Interest (SoI) submitted from each Research Organisation (ROs) in January 2017. This was in response to a targeted call from the MRC in advance of the call for HDR UK Phase 1 investment announced in August 2017 . In total 26 ROs expressed their interest in becoming a HDR UK Substantive Site and nine ROs expressed their interest in becoming a HDR UK Partnership Site. These have been grouped alphabetically according to their geographic region to make it easier to the reader to navigate through this report - and not for any other reason. Where possible the information provided within the SoIs was cross-checked and supported with further information collected from desk research. Modified \"SWOT\" analyses were then produced for each Research Organisation and used as tools to extract useful insights. Please note that this report contains information on the ROs submitting a Substantive Site SoI only37 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland East Anglia and Midlands University of Cambridge EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute University of Birmingham University of Leicester University of Warwick London Imperial College London King's College London London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Queen Mary University of London University College London North University of Leeds University of Liverpool University of Manchester University of Newcastle University of Sheffield South University of Oxford University of Bristol University of Southampton University of Surrey Northern Ireland Queen's University Belfast Scotland University of Dundee University of Edinburgh University of Glasgow Wales University of Cardiff Swansea University 38 Key informatics investments by research organisation 38 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationENGLAND - EAST ANGLIA AND MIDLANDS East Anglia Separate Statements of Interest (SoIs) were received from three Research Organisations (ROs) in this geographic region: 1. University of Cambridge 2. EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) 3. Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute These three ROs propose to submit a joint, strategic proposal to become a Substantive HDR UK Site, if invited at a subsequent stage of the selection process. It is noteworthy that at the SoIs stage, these were the only ROs to have proposed such a strategic alliance. Each of the three individual SoIs present a very strong case for becoming Substantive Sites; however, if they join their forces, they will have put together outstanding world-leading, expertise and resources, covering the whole breadth of health data science research from the laboratory to the population to the clinic. Furthermore, these ROs are situated within the \"Cambridge cluster\" , where large pharmaceutical (e.g. Astra Zeneca, GSK, Pfizer), and technology companies (e.g. ARM, Micr osoft) and SMEs (e.g. 1500 high-tech SMEs) have a major presence, offering an exceptional breeding ground for collaborations and further investment. In addition, the Wellcome Genome Campus has the opportunity to build on the exceptional quality of its current research and service capabilities to become an outstanding centre for scientific, business, cultural and educational activities emerging from genomics and computational biology. As a result, the Campus community is expected to double from 2,000 to at least 4,000 over the next 25 years. Midlands Statements of Interest (SoIs) to become a Substantive HDR UK site were received from the following ROs within this geographic region: 1. University of Birmingham (West Midlands) 2. University of Leicester (East Midlands) 3. University of Warwick (West Midlands)GEOGRAPHIC REGION:39 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands39 39 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation 39Cross-region Strategic Activities The Government's agenda for this region The Government estimates that the Midlands economy could grow by \u00a334B by 2030 if it matched the predicted growth rate for the UK as a whole. In achieving this, it is also suggested that a further 300,000 jobs could be created by the end of this parliament across the Midlands as a whole. The Midlands Engine Prospectus is a response to these Government ambitions and sets out the aims for the whole of the Midlands to work more collaboratively to accelerate economic growth and improve productivity across the region. It will also develop into a global brand that allows the Midlands to promote itself in its entirety to the world. To deliver this, it sets out a plan by 11 Local Enterprise Partnerships to encourage economic growth and investment in the Midlands. It focuses on 5 themes: skills, innovation, transport, promoting the plan; and finance for business. Region-wide health and biomedical informatics activities The University of Leicester's multi-disciplinary approach in biomedical informatics - BINERI (\"Biomedical Informatics Network for Education, Research and Industry\") Leicester - was extended with Nottingham to form BINERI-Nottingham (with joint East Midlands efforts badged as BINERI-EM). BINERI - Leicester is also leading a Midlands-wide effort in a Midlands Bioinformatics Network aiming to address the challenges and opportunities identified by Midlands Health Innovation . The Universities of Leicester, Nottingham and Birmingham now meet regularly to bring added value to each partner's efforts. Specific focus is on four topics: (i) catalogue and make discoverable existing health-r elevant datasets and bio-resources; (ii) enable optimal and equitable access to health relevant datasets for research purposes, across organisations; (iii) harmonise consent approaches that enable patients to unambiguously express their desire to have their health data better used; and (iv) establish a platform for a Midlands training network in health and biomedical informatics. The West Midlands Informatics Network is a group of health informatics professionals aiming to improve health service, by collating relevant information and providing guidance on health informatics solutions for the benefit of healthcare organisations in West Midlands. The Network is looking to support educational initiatives that will enhance health informatics knowledge among healthcar e staff and research programmes that will transform patient care. It is also facilitating forums through social media, website, workshops and conferences around priority areas in health informatics. The HPC Midlands Plus (\u00a33.2M) regional centre was created in January 2017 with investment from EPSRC and contributions from the seven partners: Loughborough University (Lead Site), Aston University, University of Birmingham, University of Leicester, University of Nottingham, University of Warwick, and Queen Mary, University of London. It is currently installing a 0.5Pflop/s service at Loughborough University, of which 15% will be free for use by non-consortium members. Other region-wide healthcare research related activities The East Midlands Academic Health Science Network (EM-AHSN) brings together the NHS, universities, industry, third sector, patients and social care to transform the health of the 4.6M East Midlands residents and stimulate wealth creation. EM-AHSN runs award-winning training programmes for Information Analysts, Clinicians and Managers.

In addition to the access to world-leading, interdisciplinary, quantitative expertise from across the Cambridge area, the University of Cambridge has also access to significant coputational capability including: Peta-5, one of six national Tier-2 HPC facilities for data intensive computation which offers unique capability to test novel data analytics at scale. Though its partnership with the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, they aim to address major informatics research challenges, with their major focus on the eHospital programme, which led UK's largest ever deployment of an EHR system serving a catchment area of 5M individuals; and the development of a research interface which enables a wide variety of research studies. The University of Cambridge has extensive track record of partnerships with industry (e.g. with Astra Zeneca, Microsoft and other large companies and SMEs in the \"Cambridge Cluster\"); and the NHS (e.g. through the Cambridge Partners Academic Health Science Centre and the East Anglia Academic Health Science Network); and interconnections with other strategic health data-related investments. The University of Cambridge has not been supported through the Farr Institute or MRC Medical Bioinformatics awards; hence, the extent of its links/collaborations with these investments is unclear. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments The Cambridge Big Data Initiative , is a University-wide strategic initiative launched in 2012 to develop a clearly identifiable critical mass of expertise in data science, mobilising expertise in the fundamental technologies of data science and key disciplines needed to make data science work (legal, ethical, societal and economic research). The EPSRC Centre for Mathematical and Statistical Analysis of Multimodal Clinical Imaging at the University of Cambridge is a collaboration between mathematics, engineering, physics and biomedical scientists and clinicians. It aims to achieve synergies between applied mathematics and statistics through the focus on the analysis of clinical imaging, particularly that arising in neurological, cardiovascular and oncology imaging. The MRC Biostatistics Unit is a major centre for research, training and knowledge transfer, with a mission 'to advance biomedical science and human health through the development, application and dissemination of statistical methods'. Its current and recent research on evidence synthesis policy evaluation, new models and trial designs, and association between genetic information in health, has direct impact and influence on clinical practice and public health.42 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands The Cambridge Computational Biology Institute brings together the unique strengths of Cambridge in medicine, biology, mathematics, computer science, physics and engineering. Its aim is to promote excellence in research and teaching and to provide a focus in the Cambridge region for computational biology interpreted broadly. The NIHR Cambridge BRC (see section further down on 'NHS links') is also one of five NIHR HIC sites (see also section 2.2.2 ) with a focus on cancer data collection to supplement national cancer datasets The University of Cambridge is one of the founder members of the Alan Turing Institute (ATI). Cambridge academics lead several engagements within ATI's health stream, for example: combining statistics and machine learning with EHR data and wearable devices. Knowledge/Expertise The University of Cambridge has experience in: establishing and leading major data-rich consortia (see next section ); developing and applying data science methods and data driven approaches to research; embedding large-scale research into routine NHS systems; and collaborating with industry around the themes of imaging, therapeutic target validation, and stratified trials. Data Cambridge coordinates multiple important national and international studies that include: Since 2012, Cambridge has provided national leadership for the recall-able NIHR BioResource (which builds on the success of BioResource ). By 2017, the NIHR BioResource included ~60,000 volunteers who provided information on health, lifestyle and biological factors, and consented to be recalled for biomedical research studies according to their genotype or phenotype. High- density gene arrays and metabolomics profiling is in process to facilitate recall. From 2017, Cambridge will lead efforts for a major expansion of the NIHR BioResource, which will aim to recruit ~200,000 recall-able participants with linkages to e-health records. Leadership of such national efforts complements Cambridge-led efforts in building regionally-focussed recallable bioresources, such as the 12,500-participant Fenland Study. Cambridge University Hospitals eHospital system provides access to EHR to enable a wide variety of new research studies. NHS Blood and Transplant Haemovigilance Platform , which has linkage of 2M blood donors with EHR. Multi-omics population cohorts with EHR linkages: INTERVAL (50K participants from 25 centres across England); EPIC-Norfolk (25K participants in East Anglia BioResource (14K recall-able participants); Fenland (12.5K participants with detailed metabolic assessments). Cohort data linked to extensive geospatial information to permit the integration of individual and wider environmental determinants of key health-related behaviours. Strategic contributions to national cohorts: UK Biobank (Danesh is a member of the Steering Committee and chair of the Outcomes Working Group; and Wareham leads efforts related to accelerometry (7-day 100Hz waveform in 103,000 participants); and Dementia Platform (Richardson leads biostatistical methods). Pan-European 520K-person EPIC prospective study: Cambridge leads studies of type 2 diabetes (InterAct), coronary disease (EPIC-Heart), and stroke (EPIC-CVD). An efficient case-cohort design has facilitated measurement of >1M genetic variants and hundreds of soluble biomarkers in a random sub- cohort of ~15K \"common controls\" who serve as referents for ~40K incident cases.43 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands43 Major international consortia: the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration has harmonised individual- participant data on ~2.5M participants in 130 cohorts; Breast Cancer Association Consortium (300K participants), Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA 1/2, Global BMI and Mortality Consortium (10M participants). Recall-able population resources in low- and middle-income countries: PROMIS (cardiometabolic outcomes of 50K participants in Pakistan); (household survey of 50K participants in Bangladesh); BRAVE (cardiometabolic outcomes in 16K participants in Bangladesh); MAVERIK (multi-ethnic study of cardiometabolic outcomes in 5K participants in Malaysia). Compute Peta-5 is one of six new Tier-2 HPC regional Centres (\u00a320M; EPSRC-funded), which provides access to diverse range of powerful supercomputers. This has been possible through a Cambridge-led national consortium that brings together 15 HPC system and application experts from 10 education institutions for creation of a breakthrough HPC and data analytics capability. Health informatics has been designated as a priority area for use. Translational and innovation capabilities Links with industry Cambridge is home to one of Europe's leading pharma clusters . For example, the University has major strategic partnerships with AstraZeneca (which has recently relocated its \u00a3500M global research headquarters to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus), GSK, and several other companies with a major research presence in Cambridge (e.g. Gilead, Pfizer, Takeda). The University is also at the heart of the \" Cambridge Cluster \", Europe's most successful technology cluster of over 1500 small and medium-sized high-tech firms, as well as large technology companies with interests in big data and mobile health, such as ARM and Microsoft. Extensive track-record of industry collaboration around themes of imaging, therapeutic target validation, and stratified trials. This has been achieved through bilateral collaborations (e.g. with Microsoft, AstraZeneca, Biogen, GSK, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer) plus multi-institutional partnerships (e.g. EC Innovative Medicines Initiatives such as BigData@Heart). Links with NHS Cambridge has a very strong comprehensive translational research pipeline, including informatics research, underpinned by the following investments in partnership with NHS Trusts: NIHR Biomedical Research Centre The NIHR Cambridge BRC is a partnership between the University and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (\u00a3114M; Director: Dr John Bradley ) and has a major cross-cutting theme in Population and Quantitative Sciences (including clinical informatics, biostatistics and bioinformatics). This BRC is also a partner in the NIHR HIC (see also section 2.2.2 ) leading the ovarian cancer theme (Brenton) aiming to supplement national cancer datasets. It is also informing the cancer strand of the Genomics England national 100,000 Genomes Project.44 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationEngland - East Anglia and MidlandsAcademic Health Science Centre The Cambridge University Health Partners Academic Health Science Centre (AHSC) is a strategic partnership between the University and three local NHS Trusts: Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; Cambridgeshire Foundation Trust; and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. This partnership maximises the potential for effective working with industry, helping to exploit translational funding streams and building capacity for translational health research. Medical informatics features very strongly within the AHSC strategic priorities, which aim to address major informatics research challenges such as the implementation of an EPR (as part of the eHospital programme). The eHospital programme (\u00a3200M, 10-year programme) is the largest ever deployment of Trust-wide EPR system in the UK, replacing paper-based records. It allows all members of a patient's care team to access records in real time, whenever and wherever they need to. It comprises an enterprise software solution from Epic, an American company/system, and supported by an entire refresh and upgrading of the IT infrastructure undertaken by Hewlett-Packard (now HPE). The EPR went live on Sunday October 26 2014, and the implementation programme transitioned to 'business as usual' on 1 April 2015. Cambridge was the first, and so far, the only Trust to deploy the Epic. UCL has just bought Epic which presents opportunities for further collaboration between the two AHSCs. Academic Health Science Network The AHSC is nested within the East Anglia AHSN . Through work within the EA AHSN and the East England Ambulance Service Trust, University of Cambridge can link patient data for research supported by their automated data linkage and anonymisation protocols. Opportunities Building on existing large-scale multi-purpose bio-resources , the University of Cambridge is pioneering the concept of \"living laboratories\" for biomedical research by involving participants in translational studies that seek high levels of commitment from participants. Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust is a NHS Global Digital Exemplar programme , one of 13 NHS Trusts to trail blaze NHS's Digital Revolution which will potentially create a breeding ground for innovation in digital health. This has the potential to open new avenues for research. In 2016, the University was designated the sole preferred bidder by the Health Foundation, which intends to establish a \u00a341M Improvement Research Institute in 2017. Cambridge's bid deploys informatics- based technologies (e.g. crowdsourcing) to identify and evaluate solutions to healthcare challenges. Potential gaps The University of Cambridge has not been supported through the Farr Institute or MRC Medical Bioinformatics awards; and hence, the extent of their links/collaborations with these investments is unclear. From the body of evidence collected so far, it seems that the University of Cambridge has not fully developed the areas of digital health and learning health systems research. However, they seem to have the resource and expertise to expand these two areas in the future.45 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands45 Other relevant capabilities An overview of further capabilities which potentially align with HDR UK's breadth and strategic interests are presented below. Research themes Discovery science Research activities in this area includes studies on: recall by genotype mechanistic studies; therapeutic target discovery/validation; and imaging. Precision medicine GAUCHERITE (MRC Stratified Medicine Consortia \u00a32M, Professor Tim Cox ): Predictive Measures to stratify clinical outcomes in children and adults with Gaucher's disease and responses to specific therapies. It brings together specialist doctors and scientists led by Cambridge University, who are currently examining approximately 85% of all UK patients and stratifying them by the nature of their disease to allow better targeted therapy interventions. Population/public health research Research activities in this area includes studies on: early detection, screening and prevention. Disease areas A number of areas with particular focus on: cancer, CVD, lung, diabetes, infectious disease/AMR. Analytics Data science and precision medicine methods/tools including predictive modelling of health outcomes integrating different data sources; accounting for selection biases created by non-random population selection in health records available for analysis; methodology for analysing health records embedded in clinical trials; longitudinal modelling of disease progression, co-morbidities and dynamic treatment processes; developing new ways to carry out complex evidence synthesis and to deal with informative missing data; exploration of heterogeneity in health outcomes with a view to stratification; development of computational tools and algorithms appropriate to the analysis of data on a large scale. University of Cambridge investigators are participating in the EU FP7 InterConnect project, which seeks to optimise the use of existing data to enable new research into the causes of diabetes and obesity through the development of co-ordinated platforms for undertaking federated analyses to mirror individual participant data meta-analysis without the governance and ethical challenges of physical data sharing. University of Cambridge researchers have developed \" PhenoScanner \", which is the first publicly available tool that provides rapid ability to assess associations for millions of genetic variants with a wide range of diseases, physiological traits, risk factors, and other intermediate phenotypes, drawing on a database of >3 billion genotype-phenotype associations. It has already been accessed >10,000 times by >3000 users in >60 countries. The capability exists to extend innovative tools such as this to help anticipate the broader phenotypic consequences of perturbing specific biological pathways.46 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationEngland - East Anglia and Midlandse-Infrastructure Compute Peta-5 will provide 3 petaflops (PF) of sustained performance derived from 3 heterogeneous compute 1PF Intel X86, 1PF Intel KNL a Pb/s HPC fabric (Peta-2) to an extreme I/O solid state storage pool (Peta-3), a petascale data analytics (Machine Learning + Hadoop) pool (Peta-4) and a large 15 PB tiered storage solution (Peta-5), all under a single execution environment. Training University has launched internationally recognised MSc courses in: Computational Biology, Machine Learning, Genomics Medicine, and Rare Diseases, which are being cross-linked through modular access with longstanding MPhil courses in Epidemiology, Public Health, and Primary Care Research. Examples of 4-year PhD programmes in quantitative health sciences in Cambridge include: those funded by the MRC (Biostatistics and Epidemiology Units), Wellcome Trust (Mathematical Genomics and Medicine), and British Heart Foundation (Cardiovascular Genomics, Population Health, Biology). An example of post-doctoral training in bioinformatics is the joint fellowship programme of the NIHR Cambridge BRC and EMBL-EBI. The University also runs joint fellowships - at doctoral, post-doctoral, and senior levels - with the Alan Turing Institute. For clinical informatics training , Cambridge provides senior leadership to the Global Digital Exemplar programme, UK Standardisation Committee for Care Information, and the UK Professional Records Standards Body. Public Involvement/Engagement University of Cambridge researchers have developed scalable approaches to consent, re-consent and re-contact. They also engage local communities through \"citizen science\" projects - for example, use of crowdsourcing to classify tumour data in collaboration with Cancer Research UK.47 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands47 Partnerships Key strategic interconnections with health data research and innovation related investments at a glance: Research Councils and other ROs Alan Turing Institute founders are the Universities of: Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, UCL, Warwick Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Peta -5 consortium DH & NHS Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trusts NIHR Cambridge BRC and NIHR HIC Cambridge University Partners AHSC East Anglia AHSN Industry AstraZeneca, GSK, Tech: Microsoft International collaborations EMBL-EBI ELIXIR UK - one of the 15 member organisations of the UK Node of ELIXIR EU FP7 InterConnect EU IMI BigData@Heart48 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationEngland - East Anglia and MidlandsEMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute Top-level insights The European Bioinfromatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), an intergovernmental treaty organisation, is a world leader in bioinformatics research and service provision with a well-recognised brand. It provides a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary environment in which research and service provision are closely linked, and take place in an international context, creating a unique organisational culture. Based at the Wellcome Genome Campus, EMBL-EBI works closely with its institutional partner and neighbour, the Sanger Institute, to collectively develop the Campus's strategy and offer an exceptional intellectual and physical environment for researchers and organisations with activities in genomes and biodata, not found elsewhere in the UK. As a result, the Campus community is expected to double from 2,000 to at least 4,000 over the next 25 years.

Data EMBL-EBI hosts the world's most comprehensive range of openly available and up-to-date biological and biomolecular data which include over 40 data resources receiving over 27 million requests per day. Its expertise lies in the analysis, storage and management of biological data at scale, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, molecular pharmacology and biological images.49 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands49 Through the European Genome-phenome database (EGA), EMBL-EBI will provide access to the genotype data for all 500,000 participants in the UK Biobank cohort. Compute EMBL-EBI manages a large IT infrastructure in three locations: an on-campus production facility; an off-site, highly resilient Tier III Data Centre which processes all external service needs; and a nearby data replication site. Together these sites have over 100 PB of raw storage and 50k computational cores. Embassy Cloud: EMBL-EBI operates a cloud service that currently has 30 academic and commercial tenants. The cloud service allows collaborating tenants to bring their computational environment and data close to EMBL-EBI public data resources, where they can undertake computational analysis without the large data transfers this would have traditionally required. It also is one of the partners of the MRC Medical Bioinformatics eMedLab private cloud consortium (see also section 2.1.2 ). Translational and innovation capabilities Links with industry EMBL-EBI data resources and analytics are used extensively not only by academic institutions but also by industry R&D departments. The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally been the biggest industry consumer of their bioinformatics services. As a result EMBL-EBI has a subscription-based Industry Programme for global companies that make significant use of its data and resources. Member companies represent most of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as well as several major agri-food, nutrition and healthcare companies. The programme is unique, providing regular quarterly strategy meetings, expert- level workshops on topics prioritised by the members, webinars and other activities. It also serves as an interface between industry-focussed initiatives at EMBL-EBI and organisations such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), the Pistoia Alliance, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) and others. Open Targets is a public-private partnership with GSK, Biogen, Takeda, and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute for pre-competitive target validation. Current research focus is on oncology, immunology and neurodegeneration through an R&D framework that can be applied to all aspects of human disease. EMBL-EBI is also involved in publicly funded projects that have strong industry participation, for example the FP7 and H2020 Innovative Medicine Initiatives (IMI) program and other EU-Framework Programme projects. Opportunities Many of EMBL-EBI's existing data resources provide human genetic and disease information for clinical applications, including: the Ensembl genome browser ; the European Variation Archive ; and the European Genome-phenome Archive ; whilst a collaborative effort is in progress to establish a new biological image repository for reference images, which will include medically relevant images of cells, tissues, and organs. EMBL-EBI has developed its own medical strategy , which is focused on building the necessary research and data infrastructures linking biological information and clinical data to enable the maturation of genomic medicine. Strategic goals include developing clinically relevant data resources, and participating in the construction and definition of infrastructures for medical data such as controlled clinical terminologies and integration with genomic data.50 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands Immediate plans are to increase support for clinical researchers and practicing healthcare professionals with the provision of bioinformatics services to analyse patient genome data, including the further development of tools such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor , a powerful toolset for the analysis, annotation, and prioritization of genomic variants in coding and non-coding regions. Via GA4GH, EMBL- EBI is developing resources for clinical and phenotypic data capture, data use and researcher identification systems and genomics knowledge standards. Potential gaps EMBL-EBI bioinformatics research currently not encompass much work with UK's health data controllers (e.g. NHS Digital) and the data they hold (i.e. routinely collected administrative data) but the expertise is there to do so. With regard to data service provision, EMBL-EBI has a mission to provide publicly available data resources which inherently exclude handling of NHS data. Other relevant capabilities Research themes EMBL-EBI's main focus is on cutting-edge basic bioinformatics research and the provision of data resources in all major molecular domains; dissemination of tools, data and expertise to academia and industry to enable discovery science translational biology. Future research priorities range from genomic analysis to systems biology and include sophisticated multidimensional statistical models for genotype to phenotype associations, evolutionary regulatory genomics, single cell genomics, large scale imaging, phylogenetics, infectious disease genomics, evolution of post translational modifications, integrative systems biology , and structural biology. Disease areas EMBL-EBI supports a wide range of disease areas with a strong interest in cancer genomics including clinical impact (e.g. CR-UK support for PanCancer on the Embassy Cloud) and infectious diseases (WT and MRC support for TB CryPTIC Consortium). Analytics EMBL-EBI hosts over 40 in-house and externally developed software tools for analyses or computation on user-supplied data and has specialised expertise in quantitative methods development, data integration methods, pre-competitive drug discovery tools and other domain-specific tools. e-Infrastructure Compute EMBL-EBI operates: one of the world's largest Life Science Data Centres (100PB storage and 50k cores); and a cloud service, Embassy Cloud , with 31k processor cores in the system; 3.2PB total usable storage; and 200-500 number of registered users. Dealing with the rapidly increasing wealth of 'reference' image data that can be linked to external resources will become a priority over the next few years and for this it has already installed 5PB of storage which is going to be expanded.51 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands51 Training EMBL-EBI's training and capacity building activities include: Currently hosts 31 EMBL International PhD programme students Supports three innovative postdoctoral programmes and has a Visitors and Scholar Programme Offers advanced bioinformatics training to the community and freely available eLearning material Plans to expand its support to clinical bioinformatics training Partnerships Significant experience in leading global and national partnerships that have contributed substantially to biological discovery.

The two organisations' health informatics capabilities are based around secondary (hospital-based) and tertiary (referral for specialised services) healthcare aligned with a range of academic expertise that can exploit linked opportunities. The UHBFT is continuously developing its EHR system - the backbone of which is the Prescribing Information and Communication System (PICS) that has been used for more than ten years: in an organisation with more than 1 million patient-episodes annually. Importantly, introduction of specific interventions via the EHR has been associated with quality improvements such as reduced readmission, rapid access to proven treatments and a reduction in mortality. This EHR system also provides significant benefits with respect to access to some of the world's most complete representation of secondary healthcare data. This provides the opportunity to map demographic and complex clinical data onto phenotyping and genomic information, offering a unique opportunity to explore mechanisms of disease and develop personalised medicine through stratification. Electronic systems developed by UHBFT underpin recruitment to and seamless data collection for the West Midlands Genomic Medicine Centre. These systems will deliver significant legacy capacity for data integration, for the purposes of both service delivery and collaborative research. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments Informatics research is mainly focused around the Birmingham Centre for Health Informatics , where the University of Birmingham and the UHBFT have a range of co-funded appointments within disciplines such as bioinformatics, clinical analysis, statistics and social sciences. In addition, the two organisations have invested more than \u00a320M in the Centre for Computational Biology (Cazier ) and Clinical Informatics facilities (Ball). As part of the MRC Medical Bioinformatics investment into the Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB; \u00a38.5M), the University of Birmingham is one of four distributed sites (Warwick, Birmingham, Swansea and Cardiff). CLIMB provides infrastructure based on OpenStack, with a variety of virtual server infrastructure provided to the research community. In addition to providing traditional data storage and compute infrastructure, this provides a large geo-replicated object store both to support longer-term storage and to underpin collaboration. The project is working on the automated provisioning of genomic software and pipelines to assist the microbial genomics community. CLIMB currently supports over 1,000 microbiological researchers across the UK ( see also section 2.1.2 ) The University also holds a number of EPSRC-funded projects within the Centre for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications in areas spanning healthcare software, data usage for personalized medicine and healthcare data security. 57 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands57 Knowledge/Expertise Birmingham has expertise in computational science, bioinformatics, integrative systems biology and comparative phenomics and clinical informatics. Data One of Birmingham's most important and unique assets is the amount of data collected on the Prescribing Information and Communication System , which forms the backbone of their in-house EHR system (e.g 10,000,000 in-patient drug administrations annually). This provides a comprehensive representation of secondary healthcare delivery and outcome. Birmingham's Health Improvement Network (THIN) database ( Marshall ) is a large UK general practice database which contains anonymised longitudinal patient records from over 500 practices (about 6% of the population). Translational and innovation capabilities Links with industry The University of Birmingham, the UHBFT and the Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust are members of Birmingham Health Partners (BHP) bringing clinical, scientific and academic excellence across an integrated medical and life sciences campus. They also work closely with Birmingham Women's Hospital, which houses the West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, the largest NHS genetics laboratory nationally. (Please note that BHP is not one of the AHSC) . BHP have established collaborations with many EMC, Orion Healthcare, Intersystems, Tibco, BluePrism, Cisco and Blackberry. This ensures access to innovative technological solutions. Links with NHS Although Birmingham has an NIHR BRC (\u00a312M from 2017), its focus is on inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory sarcopaenia; it is unclear if there are any informatics-related activities. Working with the West Midlands Academic Health Science Network (WM-AHSN), they coordinate an integrated pan-Birmingham research strategy, translating basic discovery science into clinical benefits through shared infrastructure, governance and expertise. A key example of success is the West Midlands NHS Genomic Medicine Centre (WMGMC), the largest hub of the national 100,000 Genomes Project, uniting all 18 regional NHS Trusts and leading and/or involved with several of the national Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnerships (GeCIPs). All WMGMC data and samples are linked through the University of Birmngham's Human Biomaterials Resource Centre. UHBFT hosts the NIHR West Midlands CLAHRC which supports systematic review and evidence synthesis of the impact associated with digital health technologies. Opportunities Access to the rich primary (THIN) and secondary care (HES/PICS) data sets that are available to Birmingham and their integration with genomic and phenotypic data that Birmingham is able to generate at scale can enable a number of novel research projects and development of innovative analytics solutions. UHBFT is part of the NHS Global Digital Exemplar programme, one of 13 NHS Trusts to trail blaze NHS's Digital Revolution which will potentially create a breeding ground for innovation in digital health. This could potential open new avenues for research.58 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationEngland - East Anglia and MidlandsPotential gaps Birmingham will benefit from developing research methodology in the area of learning health systems capitalising on its rich primary and secondary care datasets. Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery Science Birmingham's genomic capability is represented at both the academic and clinical levels, and includes: the largest Clinical Genetics laboratory in Europe; and the West Midlands NHS Genomic Medicine Centre . Areas of particular expertise include cancer genomics, microbial genomics (including leading expertise around nanopore technology), DNA repair and rare diseases. An MRC Clinical Research Infrastructure award (\u00a37.3M, 2014) has helped to establish the first regional Phenome Centre (\u00a38M) linked to the National Phenome Centre at Imperial College London and developing unique expertise in advanced metabolic analysis (one of only 4 such Centres globally) and with a capacity to analyse >30,000 samples each year. Importantly, Birmingham now holds the ability to integrate such data with genome and immunophenotyping data. The University of Birmingham received a MRC Discovery Award : \"Placing Discovery Science at the heart of Big Data\" ( Moss , \u00a3300K, 2015-16) to deliver a range of interdisciplinary early phase basic research, which can be subsequently developed to support the UK ambition to be an international leader within the exploitation of biomedical and health data. Immunology and Haematology have been strong disciplines on the Birmingham campus for many years, exemplified by the MRC Centre for Immune Regulation and Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Centre. Precision medicine As mentioned above, the MRC Clinical Infrastructure Award supports deep immunophenotyping of patients across the campus, enhancing their ability to connect immunology, genetics and metabolomics for stratified medicine. This major 'omics infrastructure allows them to focus on the molecular study and characterisation of different cell types within immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (e.g. arthritis and liver disease) and blood cancers and the associated molecular changes in the patient. Researchers develop and test the integration of multiple diagnostic methods, including mass cytometry, metabolic phenotyping and analysis of single cells. Population and Public health In partnership with the University of Edinburgh ( Professor Aziz Sheikh ), Harvard University ( Professor David W Bates ) and the University of Nottingham ( Professor Anthony J Avery ), they are involved in a multidisciplinary collaboration ( ePrescribing project ) to inform important national deliberations on the safe, effective and efficient procurement and implementation of electronic prescribing systems into hospitals in England. Birmingham ( Coleman ) is leading the work-package on assessing impact on prescribing safety - studying prescribing indicators judged by experts to have a significant risk of translating into actual patient harm. Citizen-driven/Digital health The Centre for Patient-Reported Outcomes Research (Calvert ) aims to optimize the use of such outcomes in clinical trials and routine care, to improve service delivery, enhance patient care and outcomes and ensure that the patient perspective is at the heart of health research and NHS decision-making. 59 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands59 Learning Health Systems The Quality Outcomes Research Unit (Pagano ) has developed a number of research outputs including key publications relating to '7 day hospital mortality' that have influenced policy and NHS practice. Disease areas Birmingham has research programmes on a number of disease areas with particular focus on: cancer, diabetes, immunity and infection. Analytics The School of Health & Population Sciences brings together major clinical disciplines from the primary and secondary health care settings and has a methodological focus in the areas of health economics, patient reported outcomes and biostatistics. For example, development of algorithms to identify patients with diabetes in hospital patients who are at high risk of adverse outcomes. Researchers in the Centre for Patient-Reported Outcomes Research have developed an electronic patient reported outcome system (ePRO) , which allows flexible data capture and real-time monitoring of symptoms as well as early detection of problems and intervention from the clinical team. An example includes the current implementation of real-time collection of ePRO reports from patients with chronic kidney disease to improve the information flow between patients and clinicians. UHBFT has created the 'GENIE' application , a bespoke tool for data entry, receipt and curation and transmission of data electronically from local systems. For example, a recent NHS England capital award (\u00a31.4M) will allow the seamless receipt and transmission of radiological image (DICOM) files from patients recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project. The use of GENIE in the 100,000 Genomes Project extends to Great Ormond Street Hospital, Royal Devon & Exeter and Newcastle Genomics Medicine Centres. UHBFT has also strengths in the linkage, interpretation and presentation of national datasets. For example, it has developed the HED product , an online benchmarking solution designed for healthcare organisations. This which provides business analytics to 67 organisations across the UK. It uses data sources such as: HES, HPA Data, HRG Tariff, NPSA, ONS Mortality, Workforce and VTE Risk Assessment to allow national benchmarking across a wide range of clinical indicators. e-Infrastructure Compute Built with a major investment by the University (including \u00a32M for Life Sciences) the Birmingham Environment for Academic Research cloud infrastructure provides compute and 5PB of storage to the life sciences community. Its HPC design is based on OpenStack, providing flexible computing environments with both virtual machines and classic cluster infrastructure. The Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB) includes a distributed four-site computing system capable of supporting over 1,000 virtual bioinformatics servers. This system consists of hardware with 7,680 cores, 2,304 TB of cross-site replicated storage and 78TB of RAM. Platforms UHBFT holds a unique position as an NHS Trust that has developed, and successfully deployed, optimal clinical systems both locally and into other NHS Trusts. For example, UHBFT has developed the OPTIMs Outpatient Management System , which has been delivered to over 40 UK hospitals (by a commercial partner).60 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands UHBFT has developed the Prescribing Information and Communication System (PICS) , which forms the backbone of their EHR system. It is a rules-based prescription support system that can be configured by speciality, allowing real-time drug prescribing, and checks for drug interactions, contra-indications, dose limits and more. In terms of research provision, this places them in a unique position of being able to collect highly detailed datasets that can be used to address very specific research questions. Training The University of Birmingham's existing educational capabilities in informatics research that include an M.Sc. in Bioinformatics and an MSc in Health Research Methods (with Health Informatics module). The Centre for PROs Research provides education through online learning resources, CPD workshops, with a Masters module in outcomes methodology in development. Other informatics-relevant courses under development include a massive open online course (MOOC) in digital healthcare; and a postgraduate certificate course on health informatics. Public Involvement/Engagement As part of the UHBFT EHR system, they have developed the 'myHealth@UHB' patient portal which allows patients to access their EHRs. There are currently 14,400 registered users, recruited primarily from chronic disease specialties. There is strong patient-level support for access to these records, and they are involved in co-design through their PPI, clinical and academic leads.

There is also an active working group on Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning. The Leicester Institute for Space and Earth Observation (EO) is spread across a number of Departments within the College of Science and Engineering: Physics and Astronomy, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geography, Geology, Engineering and Mathematics. The focus is on missions, instruments, data and innovation. Expected outcomes will bring science leadership alongside engineering capability, and develop expertise on data analysis, data exploitation and leading technology that can be applied both within space research and outside in other areas - for example, medical devices and diagnosis (already underway) - using their advanced HPC capabilities. The University of Leicester is one of the partners on the MRC CLIMB Medical Bioinformatics investment. This cloud infrastructure based on OpenStack, provides a variety of virtual servers to the research community. In addition to offering traditional data storage and compute infrastructure, it provides a large geo-replicated object store both to support longer-term storage and to underpin collaboration. The project is working on the automated provisioning of genomic software and pipelines to assist the microbial genomics community. CLIMB currently supports over 1,000 microbiological researchers across the UK (see also section 2.1.2 )63 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands63 Knowledge/Expertise The University of Leicester has established a multi-disciplinary approach to combining expertise across biology, engineering, statistical methods and clinical practice. For example, BINERI-Leicester is a synergistic network that has been active for more than five years. Members comprise senior staff that bridge university and the NHS, including informatics researchers, Leicester's BRC, computer scientists (Department of Informatics), IT Services teams, bioinformatics and analytical services, social scientists, physicists (earth observation and environmental researchers), and mathematicians (e.g. a network on 'Data and Modelling in Medicine' - DaMM). The University of Leicester has expertise in delivering data standards suitable for connecting and enabling federated querying of resources. For example, they lead a GA4GH task team that produced the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M) standards for computer-readable representation of consent. Leicester staff also co-Chair the IT committee of BBMRI.uk , and formally provide IT expertise to the UKCRC Tissue Directory and Coordination Centre (led by the University of Nottingham). Data The Extended Cohort for E-Health, Environment and DNA (EXCEED) project has access to data on ~8,000 adults, enriched for chronic lung disease, but applicable to other areas; The Genetics and Vascular Health Check (GENVASC) study combines clinical (recruitment and electronic data transfer from >100 GP surgeries - 22,968 patients) and genetic data to predict coronary artery disease. Compute The University of Leicester IT support and HPC capacity are nationally recognised, as evidenced by hosting one of four nodes of the BEIS/STFC 'DiRAC' national HPC Facility, and imminent Directorship of DiRAC. Translational and innovation capabilities Links with industry The University of Leicester has three main vehicles for industry engagement: - Medilink, a life science business support and investor network that hosts a 'Digital Health Special Interest Group'; - the Midlands Engine Network that links HEI and business across the Midlands to direct regional investment and growth; and - Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer Network-Med Tech and Health , facilitating mixed industry and academia workshops. The University of Leicester also works with industry on EU-IMI projects . Links with NHS The University of Leicester in partnership with the University of Loughborough and University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) NHS Trust received an NIHR award (\u00a311.6M) in 2017 to establish a new BRC in illnesses linked to respiratory conditions, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and the consequence of inactivity. 64 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands The Leicester region is covered by the East of England NHS Genomics Medicine Centre . Furthermore, University of Leicester staff are partners in 11 different Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIPs), with the Leicester Precision Medicine Institute 's Director ( Martin Tobin ) leading the cross-cutting methodological GeCIP entitled \"Machine Learning, Quantitative Methods and Functional Genomics\". This has been invited to be at the vanguard of accessing the data embassy ahead of other GeCIPs to help test the system. They also lead the Analytics work of the Musculoskeletal GeCIP . The East Midlands Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC- EM) is led by Professor Kamlesh Khunti based at the University of Leicester. The CLAHRC-EM coordinates numerous University, NHS, local authority, industry and public partners from across the East Midlands towards improved patient care. The focus is on cardio-metabolic diseases in multi-ethnic populations, integrating primary and secondary local healthcare data with environmental data to characterise the disorder and optimise treatment. They additionally conduct studies using large data such as CPRD and HES data, and perform interventional studies at practice level with large data capture being conducted remotely across the East Midlands. The University of Leicester is actively involved in the East Midlands AHSN , which brings together the NHS, universities, industry and social care to transform the health of their 4.6m East Midlands residents and stimulate wealth creation. Opportunities The University of Leicester provides specialist opportunities having: (i) majority Black and Minority Ethnic communities from South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa that provide additional opportunities to expand research with partner organizations in low and middle income countries; and (ii) big data and expertise from their space, earth observation and pollution research. In terms of the second opportunity mentioned above, an example would be establishing a national effort to use environment and earth observation data to guide healthcare capacity planning in semi-real-time. Unifying the efforts of the few ROs sufficiently advanced in this topic to contribute would be valuable, merging this with input from groups such as the UK Meteorological Office, Public Health England (their 'Environmental Public Health Surveillance System'), the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the University of Cambridge, and the University of Exeter (their 'Medical & Environmental Data Mash-up'). Potential gaps The University of Leicester has not developed significant activity in the areas of learning health systems and citizen-driven/digital health research. It also does not seem to have developed any public involvement/engagement activity relevant to health data science. Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery Science The University of Leicester is leading the first genetic study in UK Biobank ( UK BiLEVE ) that linked genotypic and phenotypic data and returned this to UK Biobank for wider exploitation.65 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & InnovationEngland - East Anglia and Midlands65 Precision medicine Leicester Precision Medicine Institute (Director: Martin Tobin ) unites the research expertise and facilities of the University of Leicester and University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust with industry to provide new discoveries and medical innovations that impact on the healthcare of Leicester's ethnically diverse population. Leicester researchers (Brightling) have developed and validated the utilisation of imaging and biological biomarkers in early phase clinical trials and the management of airway disease including coordination and participation in several multi- centre, multi-national consortia - for example: AirPROM, COPDMAP and, EMBER, EvA, and ATLANTIS. in Breathomics (EMBER; PI: Chris Brightling ) - University of Leicester with the University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust and Loughborough University lead one of six Pathology Nodes. It is unique in generating new data generation in the form of 'Breathomics' (i.e., breath analysis), using technology engineered for the detection of explosives in war zones. This cross-discipline approach is now being applied to respiratory and other disorders. The method requires advanced big data analytics for near-real-time signal interpretation. Methods for this are developed by Leicester's DaMM team in conjunction with mathematicians from Loughborough, simultaneously linking in clinical and 'omics data. University of Leicester has expertise on data management and analysis in several large stratified medicine and personalised medicine consortia in the UK and Europe and are now working with QMUL to determine how to achieve added value from uniting datasets and approaches from such projects (data structure level, software level, and discovery/sharing level), starting with MRC Stratified Medicine projects concerned with COPD, asthma, RA, SLE and Psoriasis. Population and Public health University of Leicester researchers ( Draper ) lead national and international research programmes focussing on the variations in outcome for babies, infants and children. This work involves the linkage of national databases with births and deaths data from ONS (and other similar organisations across the UK) as well as HES data. They are also leading data harmonisation efforts (H2020 RECAP - Research in Children and Adults born Preterm) which aims to link together all preterm birth cohort databases across Europe and with other international partners to enhance the power of the individual studies to enhance the current evidence base for preterm infants. Projects connecting health-related datasets with space and earth observation data include: - NERC \"EPI\" project with Cerner to predict hospital admissions, soon modelling 15 years of NHS admissions data; and - MRC \"ERICA\" project (with Bristol, Leicester and Imperial) making environmental data usefully discoverable.

The Institute of Cancer Research , which is based in this geographic region, had also submitted an SoIs to become a Partner HDR UK but this report doesn't contain any information on its informatics/health data research activities. Cross-region Strategic Activities It's noteworthy that three out of the six Academic Health Science Centres (AHSC) in England are based in London ( see also section 2.3.1 ), which are nested within wider Academic Health Science Network (AHSN) (see also section 2.4.1 ). These are: 1. Imperial College AHSC and Imperial College Partners AHSN 2. King's Health Partners AHSC and Health Innovation Network (AHSN South London) 3. UCL Partners AHSC and UCL Partners AHSN The three Centres have come together to discuss plans to establish a pan-London Trusted Research Environment (leads include: Professor Tim Hubbard from KCL and Professor Harry Hemingway from the Farr). MedCity is a collaboration between the Mayor of London, the capital's three AHSC and the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Supported by HEFCE and the Mayor of London and launched in 2014 to promote and grow the world-leading life sciences cluster of England's south east, it is promoting life sciences investment, entrepreneurship and industry in the region by: 1. providing a single front door and concierge service for industry and investors looking for partners, infrastructure and expertise; 2. facilitating and supporting collaboration across all parts of the sector to turn innovations into commercial products and services; 3. fostering an environment that support and encourages entrepreneurialism; and 4. raising awareness globally of the regions rich life sciences ecosystem.GEOGRAPHIC REGION:England - London75 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation75 DigitalHealth.London is a collaboration between MedCity, NHS England and London's three AHSNs and supported by the Mayor of London and the AHSCs. This collaboration was formally launched in February 2016 by George Freeman in response to the London Health Commission's 'Better Health for London' report recommendation for the creation of a digital health hub in the city. It has been created to improve quality of care, make healthcare more effective and efficient, and to generate economic growth. The aim is to meet the challenges for industry, clinicians, commissioners and patients by: 1. creating and supporting networks to build on London's existing critical mass of digital health expertise; 2. building knowledge between stakeholders to enable greater understanding of challenges, requirements and issues; 3. identifying digital solutions that meet the needs of patients and clinicians; 4. building the evidence base of the health outcomes and economic benefits of digital health; and 5. supporting the collaborative development of an environment that both meets the needs of the health system and allows businesses to develop by tackling issues such as procurement and commissioning. For example, the DigitalHealth.London Accelerator programme is uniquely positioned to provide in- depth knowledge of the NHS to a cohort of high potential SMEs. The Accelerator aims to speed up the adoption of innovation at scale, ensuring that together greater numbers of patients benefit from emerging new technology, more rapidly. The programme is receiving \u00a31.7M funding from the European Regional Development Fund. The year-long programme will run over three consecutive years to work with around 80 (20-30 in each year) SMEs and support them through meetings and events individually tailored to each business's specific needs, which focuses on: 1. engagement with clinicians and healthcare experts; 2. refining products to meet needs; 3. deepening understanding of the health system; 4. showcasing in health facilities; 5. developing business models in order to progress product development; and 6. access to market.England - London76 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationImperial College London Top-level insights Imperial College London (ICL) has a number of investments in informatics research (e.g. MRC UK MEDBIO, NIHR HIC, Imperial Data Science Institute) underpinned by excellent multi-disciplinary teams, bringing together complementary skills and expertise in medicine, computer science, data analytics and engineering (with substantial investment from EPSRC). ICL has a long track record (e.g. Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Dr Foster Unit, Big Data Analytics Unit) of processing, analysing and drawing knowledge and insights from national health and social care datasets; and patient and population data linked to 'omics and to clinical data (e.g. internationally leading position in the generation, analysis and integration of metabolomics data to other types of data). There is a substantial supercomputing resource, with (currently) up to 4 PB of data storage hosted in Imperial's Data Centres, and a commitment to further significant investment over the coming years to continuously develop their HPC hardware. Furthermore, the Imperial College AHSC is nested within Imperial College Health Partners (ICHP) AHSN; these have aligned strategic visions to support the progression of research from discovery to implementation and dissemination, with an emphasis on training and informatics. This facilitates the pull through of advances in informatics research from the lab bench to the clinical practice (e.g. they aim to develop and deliver a single EHR for NW London). Imperial was not involved in the establishment of the Farr Institute but is collaborating with the Farr@Swansea, as part of the MRC UK MEDBIO Medical Bioinformatics award and the Airwave study. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments ICL's major interdisciplinary investments in the areas of biomedical research and population health with relevance to data science include: MRC UK MEDBIO Medical Bioinformatics award (\u00a36M; Lead: involved in this Butcher, Glen, Nicholson, Guo ) (see section 2.1.2 ). The Imperial Data Science Institute (DSI) (Director: Professor Yike Guo ) is world-leading in the development and application of new software solutions and technologies for data assembly, data analytics and data visualisation for complex, high-dimensional clinical, 'omics and imaging data, and includes development of the tranSMART system. The NIHR Imperial BRC is one of the five NIHR BRCs involved in the NIHR HIC programme (see section 2.2.2 ), leading on Acute Coronary Syndrome ( Dr Jamil Mayet based at ICL is the lead investigator for this theme ). England - London77 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation77 Knowledge/Expertise ICL is the only UK University to focus exclusively on medicine, science and engineering, as well as business. It has strong inter-disciplinary research and training across biomedicine, computing, engineering, mathematics and statistics underpinned by substantial computing resources and wide-range of relevant expertise and critical mass. In addition to the bioinformatics, data analysis and visualisation expertise, Imperial has long track record of processing, analysing and drawing knowledge and insights from national health and social care datasets; and patient and population data linked to 'omics data and to clinical data. Compute Imperial offers a secure and productive environment for analysis in a flexible hybrid computational infrastructure using a range of HPC and networked servers (Imperial HPC, UK MED BIO, DSI) with (currently) up to 4 PB of data storage hosted in its Data Centres. A more detailed description of their computational resources can be found under the 'e-Infrastructure' section. Data ICL's MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health (\u00a36M; Elliott ) includes the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU), which holds over 300 M geocoded records including national data on Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), mortality, cancer registrations and birth records. It has established extensive highly phenotyped patient and population cohorts that include: - The London Life Sciences Prospective Population Study (\"LOLIPOP \") - a major UK research study investigating the mechanisms underlying heart disease stroke, diabetes, obesity and other major medical problems. The study has collected lifestyle information and samples from over 30,000 people in North West London; - The Airwave Health Monitoring Study has recruited more than 52,000 participants, hosted in the Farr@Swansea secure servers for inclusion in Dementia Platform UK (DPUK). The NIHR HIC Acute Coronary Symptoms dataset contains data from the NIHR HIC partners and is stored at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust's research warehouse. It is an anonymised dataset derived from routinely collected NHS patient data (250K patients). These are secondary care- local deep episodic patient-level data including: A&E records; surgical); imaging; transfusion. Translational and innovation capabilities Industry links ICL's Confidence in Concept initiative encourages pull-through of new diagnostics, devices and interventions, including support for development through Imperial Innovations, and through industrial partnership facilitating external funding. In 2014/15, Imperial won the highest volume of industry research funding of all UK universities (\u00a346M). Industrial partners through the MRC UK MEDBIO Medical Bioinformatics award include: Waters Corp., Bruker Biospin, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Thomson Reuter, Astra Zeneca.England - London78 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationNHS links NIHR Biomedical Research Centre The NIHR Imperial BRC (\u00a390M; Director: Jonathan Weber ) is a partnership between Imperial College and the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. This BRC has a cross-cutting theme in Informatics and Biobanking, which builds on major strengths in informatics, analytics and data linkage, patient and population cohorts and tissue biobanking, with aim of providing the resources and infrastructure to carry out experimental medicine studies, prognostic research and biomarker discovery, validation and qualification across the BRC. Furthermore, Imperial College in collaboration with the NHS Trust is setting up a new and exciting project - the Universal Consent project - across the Trust to obtain consent for research, linkage of health data and biological samples from patients attending the Trust. These data will feed into the Imperial BioResource. The project roll out across the Trust was planned for 2017 and will include ISO27001 Information Security Management Accreditation and ongoing compliance at IG standards, level 3. It also builds on existing BRC-BRC informatics-omics collaborations nationally, including the NIHR HIC and the NIHR Bioresource . The Imperial BRC has been leading on the acute coronary syndrome theme (Mayet ) responsible for the collection, storage and analysis of this large dataset (>250K patients). Together with researchers from Imperial's Data Science Institute, they have been using mathematical modelling for prediction or arrhythmia or vulnerable atherosclerotic lesions, and mapping generic abnormalities to hear morphology/function. Academic Health Sciences Centre The Imperial College Academic Health Sciences Centre (AHSC) (Executive Director: Professor Jonathan Weber ) is a partnership between Imperial College and three NHS Trusts: 1. Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust 2. Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust 3. Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust which is creating a critical mass of 21,500 clinicians and other NHS staff, researchers and academics to drive innovation and improved care for the direct benefit of over 1.1 M patients each year in West London. The AHSC themes are aligned with domains that reflect the translational pipeline of the NIHR Imperial BRC . Academic Health Sciences Network The Imperial College AHSC is nested within Imperial College Health Partners (ICHP) Academic Health Science Network (AHSN ). The strategic visions of both the Imperial College AHSC and AHSN have been aligned to support the progression of research from discovery to implementation and dissemination, with an emphasis on training and informatics. The Imperial AHSC, with Med City and the other AHSCs and AHSNs in London are also part of the DigitalHealth.London initiative , launched in Feb 2016. Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North West London and the Department of Computing at Imperial have designed a bespoke web application, the Web Improvement Support for Healthcare (WISH). This is an online framework that enables data capture and live reporting for quality improvement projects. The platform has been used by over 70 improvement projects in London hospitals over the past seven years.England - London79 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation79 NHS 100,00 genomes project | Genomics England Ltd The ICHT is the lead delivery partner for the West London NHS Genomic Medicine Centre , working in partnership with the Royal Marsden, Royal Brompton and Chelsea & Westminster NHS Trusts, and the AHSN. The project is supported by the AHSC informatics platforms. Opportunities Trusted Research Environment Imperial College and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust have developed a joint secure infrastructure/environment for analysis and storage of sensitive health data for research (established through the NIHR HIC) with appropriate anonymisation/pseudonymisation and IG processes to provide ready access to bona fide researchers. The data are legally stored and used in a federated secure environment, allowing linkage between data captured routinely in the NHS, NIHR HIC data, Dr Foster data and other clinical and research datasets, to provide a richer, precision medicine focussed resource. The platform is planned to receive NHS Digital IG Toolkit Level 3 during 2017. Building on the NIHR HIC project, Imperial plans to develop a research engine to extract data from Cerner and other databases and link to the patient record. They also had discussions with Google DeepMind about potential to work collaboratively toward this. This infrastructure is being developed in parallel to a Trust-led initiative to develop a single EHR for NW London . In aligning these initiatives, the AHSC aims to create a uniquely comprehensive, rich population data set for research, housed in a secure, managed-access infrastructure. Consent via NHS records There are ca. 1 M patient contacts per year at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, but currently the research potential of this massive clinical resource is largely untapped. Through, the NIHR Imperial BRC, they will be rolling out the DISCOVER programme (Elliott ), which seeks consent for research follow-up via NHS records; and linkage to biological samples for patients attending the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (over 1 M patient visits p.a.). This will open the avenue to more phenotypic-rich data to be used for research. This initiative complements the NIHR BioResource of which Imperial is a partner. Furthermore, in collaboration with Oxford AHSC, a common universal consent process is also being piloted across both AHSCs. Potential gaps From the body of evidence collected so far for the purposes of this report, it seems that Imperial College has just started to expand its research on citizen-driven/digital health, while they seem to have the resource and expertise to delve even deeper into learning health systems research.England - London80 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationOther relevant capabilities Research themes Imperial has substantial investments from basic science to point-of-care that include: Discovery science The MRC London Institute of Medical Science is performing pioneering work on fundamental epigenetic mechanisms of disease.

It is also linked to the Clinical Phenome Centre (a core facility of the Imperial College BRC) for experimental/stratified medicine research. EPSRC Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare (\u00a32M; Barahona, Guo, Rueckert, Darzi ) brings together researchers from across Imperial to develop and apply next generation tools, encompassing graph theory, dynamical systems, stochastic processes, statistical learning and optimization, to extract meaning from complex medical data. The STELAR (Study Team for Early Life Asthma Research) consortium ( Custovic ) aims to identify novel endo-types of childhood asthma using machine learning approaches. Population and Public health MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health (Elliott ) was formed in June 2009 as a partnership between Imperial College (lead institution) and King's College London, funded by the MRC and Health Protection Agency (now PHE). The Centre incorporates the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) at Imperial College, the Environmental Research Group (ERG) at King's College London, in addition to bringing together leading researchers from four (of six) departments of the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College, and researchers at King's College, St George's University of London and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The Centre forms a multi-disciplinary research cluster, covering a wide range of techniques and approaches; using advanced geographical information systems and statistical modelling techniques, combined with experimental data, biomarker and mechanistic studies, and analyses of large population cohorts to explore environmental health problems of key public health and scientific importance. The UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) at Imperial College is a nationally and internationally recognised institution for research into environment and health. SAHSU's work includes substantive epidemiological enquiries of environmental health problems and methodological research. SAHSU studies may involve (as necessary) environmental modelling and monitoring as well as biomarkers (of exposure, effects and genetic susceptibility) in addition to the analysis of r outine health statistics, to aid interpretation of causal inference. The Unit now forms a core part of the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health held jointly between Imperial College London and King's College London set up in 2010. The Dr Foster Unit (\u00a31.5M; Aylin) was established in 2002, as a partnership with Dr Foster, and it sits within the Department of Primary Care and Public Health in the School of Public Health at Imperial College. Its research is funded through a variety of grants, with a key source of funding coming from Dr Foster - a wholly owned subsidiary of Telstra. The Unit also receives NIHR funding for its work with the Patient Safety Translational Research Centre (PSTRC) and the Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance (NIHR HPRU HCAI and AMR) and to investigate readmissions in heart failure and chronic lung disease. NIHR has also funded projects involving the mortality alerts the Unit sends out each month and obstetric care.England - London81 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation81 Citizen-driven/Digital health The Adaptive, Real-time, Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care (ARISES) research project (\u00a31.3M; EPSRC) aims a system that will run on a smart phone locally and collect data from multiple sources to deliver an intervention to the patient that allows self-management of chronic disease. The Novel Wearable Technology for Early Detection of Exacerbations in COPD research project (\u00a30.9M; EPSRC) aims to create a novel wearable wireless technology- compose of a sensing unit of approximately the size of a pound coin to be worn by the patient in the neck, and a mobile phone application- that will be able to monitor COPD patients continuously, and automatically provide early detection of potential exacerbations, in order to inform patients and/or their doctors, so that these can be treated promptly to minimise their likelihood of progression to higher levels of severity. Disease areas Imperial's research focuses on several disease areas including: cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. Analytics In addition to the Imperial Data Science Institute and the EPSRC Centre for Mathematics of Precision Medicine, other investments and activities in health data analytics at Imperial College include: The Dr Foster Unit has expertise in managing and analysing 2.8 billion health records, including: NHS hospital, GP consultations, cancer registry and international health data. Their work forms the basis of the near Real-Time Monitoring System , currently used by 70% of English NHS Acute Trusts to monitor case-mix adjusted health outcomes at individual patient level. The Big Data Analytics Unit in the Centre for Health Policy ( Darzi ) provides high powered analytic capability for data integration, linkage and analysis, including of sensitive NHS data. The MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling (\u00a32.7M) ( Ferguson, Ghani ) analyses worldwide data on emerging or newly resurgent infectious disease threats (e.g. SARS, H5N1 avian influenza, Ebola) and endemic infections of major global health significance (e.g. malaria, TB, HIV). The EPSRC Smartheart programme (\u00a35.1M; Rueckert, Guo ) is applying artificial intelligence and machine learning for computer-aided detection and diagnosis of fetal abnormalities and cardiovascular disease. e-Infrastructure Compute There is a substantial supercomputing resource, with (currently) up to 4PB of data storage hosted in Imperial's Data Centres, and a commitment to further significant investment over the coming years to continuously develop their HPC hardware.

In addition, they have experience in developing and operating platforms to support research such data. KCL's is working very closely with its partner NHS Trusts and its key health and biomedical informatics research activity is being delivered jointly mainly through NIHR support. For example, the Clinical Record Interactive Search (NIHR CRIS) system is the UK's largest and most extensive electronic clinical informatics database for mental health, was developed at the NIHR Maudsley BRC. Futhermore, KCL's partner NHS Trusts have over 4 M patient contacts/year, with EHR data suitable for informatics approaches. Their ability to provide leadership in clinical informatics - including health records, genomics and medical imaging - is supported by the two NIHR BRCs. The Maudsley BRC has produced ground-breaking research using EHR and mhealth, while the Guy's & St Thomas' BRC has world-leading medical imaging informatics and excellent genomics, well-connected to national efforts such as the NHS 100k Genomes Project delivered by Genomics England. Also through the Guy's & St Thomas' BRC, they are involved in the NIHR HIC programme. KCL's research is supported by a new \u00a33.6M investment in an HPC system (Rosalind); and they also have access to a trusted research environment that allows secure data linkage. KCL is one of the few UK research organisation which has substantial activity and is leading international efforts in mobile/digital health (e.g. RADAR-CNS programme) to deliver clinically useful data from smartphones and wearables. As one of the UK's leading AHSC, King's Health Partners (KHP) AHSC aims to become an international leader in the field of optimised clinical and research informatics. The AHSC is nested within an AHSN: Health Innovation Network (South London). KCL was not involved in the establishment on the Farr Institute but has developed connections with the Farr mainly through their collaboration on the MRC eMedLab Medical Bioinformatics award. They also make significant contributions to the ATI (e.g. contributing to an ATI report on big data in imaging; and an ATI-Intel programme on mHealth). KCL is a core member of the Crick Institute.England - London86 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationStrengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments KCL's key biomedical informatics research is being delivered jointly with their NHS Trust partners mainly through major NIHR BRC investments ( see also section further down on links' ). for Translational Informatics has been established to create connections between the NHS IT and academic health informatics and acts as a catalyst for the industry and academic partnerships, delivering a clear pathway for informatics-based interventions into routine practice. For example, the Centre aims to drive digital innovation in mental health, finding new ways of improving healthcare using digital technologies and accelerating their delivery to patients. It is led jointly by South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King's College London. - The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) (Lead: Professor Robert Stuart ) is the UK's largest and most extensive electronic health record data resource developed with support by the NIHR Maudsley BRC (currently >270k records, >70 publications).

It is now a clinical service at KCH; The IMPARTS (Integrating Mental & Physical Healthcare) programme has created an informatics system to facilitate routine collection of patient-reported outcomes, with real-time feedback to guide clinical care. The Weston Programme for Family-Led Research (Garfield Weston Foundation, \u00a31M) programme aims to allow parents of sick children to define and carry out research, e.g. led to recently published study of environmental influences on new mothers using geo- locating smart-phone apps and walking diaries. Public and Population Health The Stroke and Air Pollution (STAR) informatics aims to link stroke, air pollution and primary care data for research.England - London91 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation91 The eLIXIR (MRC partnership grant \u00a31m) is a project linking routine clinical records and patient samples to improve UK research capability in following life course of physical and mental health disorders, initially deployed across KHP Hospitals before national expansion. Learning health systems TRANSFoRM is a 21 partner FP7 project led by KCL, which has developed a LHS infrastructure for phenotype-genotype studies, efficient trials and diagnostic decision support. H2020 KConnect is developing semantic search technologies for medical information. The Children and Young People's Health Partnership (GSTT, \u00a36m) is developing a paediatric care system linking hospital and primary care in South London for collecting and analysing data on process and health care implementation. Disease areas King's College's research focuses on several disease areas and in especially on: mental health, immunology and cardiovascular disease. Analytics KCL investigators have developed state of the art tools for ingestion of NHS structured and unstructured data, which include optional de-identification, natural language processing (NLP) and semantic annotation; as well as methods to model treatment response and disease trajectories from EHR and population data; and use EHR data for efficient trials. They are also developing AI approaches applied to medical imaging , such as new algorithms for image analysis, multi-modal image fusion, imaging genetics and motion correction. CogStack : is an open-source information retrieval toolkit developed at Maudsley BRC and KCH to facilitate searches, NLP (using ElasticSearch), analytics and visualisation of EHR data. CogStack has been deployed at KCH to provide clinical alerting and query access to free text and structured information from its EHR (9m documents, ~250m structured data items and ~20m patient transactions) in near real-time. De-identification functionality allows the platform to be used for r esearch as well as in the clinic. CogStack is deployed outside KHP at UCLH and being extended to SLaM. KHP have developed an award winning Local Care Record platform , which links primary and secondary care systems for clinical care and is now being extended into social and community care and across the South East London providing a platform to deploy decision support applications. e-Infrastructure Compute The Rosalind HPC infrastructure has a total of 3,912 compute cores connected to a 600 TB lustre high performance file system and a 2 PB Ceph distributed object store via infiniband and 10GbE networking. The compute cluster has a mixture of high and low memory nodes ranging from 2Gb-20Gb/core (average 11Gb/core). 3,016 cores operate as a bare-metal HPC cluster using the open grid scheduler.

KCL has access to the MRC eMedLab private cloud compute and data storage cluster as a consortium partner. The compute cluster has 6,000 cores and 4.3PB bulk storage that can be configured as bespoke virtual servers to process large bioinformatics datasets.England - London92 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationTrusted Research Environments The Safe Haven Clinical Data Linkage Service (CDLS) provides a trusted environment to link EHR records with other clinical data sources to generate integrated views of patient journeys for research analysis. Multiple linked datasets that have been generated include these between Lambeth DataNet and CRIS; and between CPRD and HES. Data Platforms The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system is the UK's largest and most extensive electronic clinical informatics database for mental health (also mentioned previously in this section). Applications to access CRIS and the analyses carried out using CRIS are closely reviewed, monitored and audited by a CRIS Oversight Committee, which carries representation from the SLaM Cauldicott Guardian and is chaired by a service user. The CRIS Oversight Committee is responsible for ensuring all research applications comply with ethical and legal guidelines. As part of the NIHR-HIC partnership, GSTT has developed a data mart platform in tranSMART which contains data from the five participating BRCs for the 'transplantation' theme that it leads. The Lambeth DataNet is an anonymised primary care database for 380,000 registered Lambeth patients hosted at GSTT. A toolkit is being developed to allow it to be integrated with distributed heterogeneous data sources for phenotype-genotype studies, real-time safety monitoring, prescribing, cancer screening and service use. This includes effective methods for trial recruitment, novel trial designs, diagnostic decision support (building on participation in EU FP7 TRANSFoRM project), and Patient-reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and remote monitoring. The KHP Diabetes and Obesity Data Warehouse was created within CDLS integrating data from GSTT, KCH, 15 GPs in South East London and elsewhere as part of the KHP Diabetes Modernisation Initiative (DMI). The warehouse design allows testing of data analytics to drive clinical transformation, performance and better co-ordination of care. CDLS will also be used to integrate physical and mental health EHR data to create a KHP-wide implementation of CogStack. Healthlocker is a patient health record platform which provides: patient access to components of their EHR (e.g. careplans, correspondence, medication, appointments); an interface for patient reported outcomes via smartphone apps, wearable devices; delivery of information and e-health interventions.

The collective informatics research talent possessed by the partnership ranging from computational science, computational modelling, handling and interrogation of large cohort data sets, bioinformatics, decision support tools, m- and e-health, preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic initiatives has a physical focus in the Farr Institute @ London. Academic Health Sciences Network UCL is also part of the UCL Partners Academic Health Science Network . Informatics activities are supported by a single UCLP informatics strategy (2014-2017) across all Partners; and a single Informatics Board with an Independent Chair ( Professor Andrew Morris ) and a small Informatics Programme Executive Team, who will be predominantly embedded in local health economies and will act in an enabling capacity to support delivery of the Strategy. The UCLP AHSC, with Med City and the other AHSCs and AHSNs in London are also part of the DigitalHealth.London initiative. Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Through partnership with the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North Thames , they are involved in the evaluation of innovations that include novel digital tech and determinants of their implementation. NHS 100,00 genomes project | Genomics England Ltd UCL contributes to one of the largest Genomics England Genomics Medicine Centres and lead on the rare diseases theme. Led by GOSH, six NHS trusts in north London have formed the North Thames Genomics Medicine Centre .England - London106 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationOpportunities With the NHS and other key delivery partners UCL plans to establish a trusted research environment , based on UCL Partners population as part of the UK federated data ecosystem. This will deliver data integration across primary, secondary and social care (building on existing London examples in mental health) and across data types including health records, imaging, genomics, and mobile and wider societal data. This safe and secure environment will allow investigation with: identifiable data of data driven solutions, including real time decision support, to immediate NHS problems (e.g. cause specific readmission); and with pseudonymised data used by researchers to deliver theme research priorities and by innovation partners to grow the economy. Plans to create a new 25 FTE Clinical Research Informatics Department with UCLH as part of the NIHR BRC Health Informatics theme (\u00a37.5M) building on their HIC project. UCLH has just bought Epic and NHS is offering a \u00a320M incentive to collaborate with University of Cambridge that was the first Trust to use it and develop a research gateway for this resource. Potential gaps UCL is not leading on any of the MRC Stratified Medicine Consortia and does not appear to be involved in any other stratified medicine initiatives. Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery science UCL has strengths in using data science approaches to redefine diseases in mechanistic, treatment- relevant taxonomies. Examples include: - the ICONIC project (funded by DH and the Wellcome Trust and UCL-led) has developed sustainable next generation technology for the viral full-length genome sequencing using residual diagnostic samples within the diagnostic value chain. ICONIC processes and assembles de novo the virus genomes using high performance computation available in 'cloud resources' bypassing the need for embedding complex computer technology in the NHS and specialist staff. Precision medicine UCL's and eMedLab have contributed integrating infrastructure to some of the MRC Stratified Medicine Consortia They have established an interdisciplinary Precision Medicine Accelerator for nurturing start-ups. Population and Public health One of UCL's major focus is on trials embedded in clinical practice and in particular, the use of data science approaches for the development of novel adaptive designs and identification of novel patient groups Using the CALIBER platform, UCL researchers have linked primary and secondary care data on approximately 2M people aged more than 30 year, and free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, to understand cardiovascular outcomes and presentations. A similar approach has been taken for other diseases, including diabetes and cancer. Farr@London investigators ( Hemingway, Denaxas, Dobson ) are leading the EU IMI BigData@Heart consortium (\u20ac20M). This research programme will integrate healthcare data, wearables, genetic profiles, information about patients' lifestyles and health and their own reporting of symptoms, to better understand causes of different CVD conditions and improve patient care. England - London107 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation107 Citizen-driven/digital health Through the NIHR TB Reach programme , UCL researchers are leading the world's first randomised controlled trial of Video Observed Therapy (VOT) to support patients to complete tuberculosis treatment in the UK using a smartphone app developed by the University of San Diego. Learning Health Systems The ICONIC project (also mentioned above) links virus genetics and diagnostic information to hospital based clinical information and generates the appropriate clinical reporting tools. This method allows researchers to identify links between cases that would otherwise have been missed, target infection control processes to specific wards and determine whether sudden surges in case numbers reflect several smaller clusters of infection or a single uncontrolled outbreak. Hospital teams across the UK are piloting these methods and evaluating how hospital flu can be better managed to improve patient outcomes and save costs. Disease areas UCL has research programmes in a number of disease areas, and in particular: cancer, cardiovascular, neuro-degeneration and mother and child health. Analytics CALIBER has become a leading research platform for the understanding of health progression, from onset of early stages to the development of significant functional impairment. The platform links electr onic health records from primary care, coded hospital records on diagnoses and operations, social deprivation information and cause-specific mortality data in England for roughly 10M adults. An online Data Portal contains disease and risk factor phenotyping algorithms for the wider scientific community to use. In collaboration with the ADRC-England , Farr@London investigators have developed methods for mother-child linkage of 10M deliveries in England and are working with Public Health England and the Ministry of Justice to apply new linkage methods to government-held data. Farr@London investigators are developing decision support tools for a variety of settings and clinical conditions, including tools to: investigate variations in tonsillectomy rates and recurrent sore throat infection for patients undergoing the procedure; and to predict risk of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis based on epidemiological and clinical data linked to notification and lab data; identify tuber culosis from serial chest radiographs. Google DeepMind Health has partnered with the UCL (Rees) and the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust on their Streams app to support clinical decisions for prevention of acute kidney injury. They are also working with Google and Microsoft Research to investigate the use of search engine logs and twitter to monitor influenza occurrence and secondary household transmission rates validating methodology against FluWatch community cohort. e-Infrastructure Compute Access to 8 PB storage and 24,000 cores. There is also access to up to 2 PB high performance tiered storage with a 10GBps connection to Legion compute cluster (Farr-funded total cluster size 10,000 cores). UCL has access to the MRC eMedLab private cloud compute and data storage cluster as a consortium partner. The compute cluster has 6,000 cores and 4.3PB bulk storage that can be configured as bespoke virtual servers to process large bioinformatics datasets.England - London108 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationTrusted Research Environment UCL has established an ISO27001 Data Safe Haven and associated IG framework in 2012 which was further enhanced through the Farr Capital funding. It currently supports a total of 322 projects with 765 users. There is an associate 70 TB tiered storage. Training UCL has developed a significant programme of training and capacity building to create future health care data science leaders, including an innovative mini-MD clinical immersion course that delivers intensive exposure of non-clinicians to all elements of a patient pathway used successfully in medical imaging and cancer. Ten MSc programmes provide core disciplinary expertise totalling 366 students in 2016/17. UCL Computer Science Partners with Google DeepMind to deliver an industrial partnership PhD programme in Machine Learning . Currently developing an intercalated BSc Big Data for Health for medical students, an MSc in Data Analytics and NIHR Clinician Coders NHS trainees). UCL has been hosting a number public involvement/engagement activities related to health data science. For example, workshops for researchers and lay members of the public to deepen understanding of the reasons for, and impact of, missing information in EHR from patient and researcher perspectives. Also, it has been leading on scientific engagement with schools, pr omoting the idea that students benefit from performing real science using real data in the classroom. Findings from Decipher mydata!Flu! based on data from 27 schools show that school sickness absence data are correlated with influenza surveillance data and may provide a good warning system for spotting flu outbreaks.

University of Leeds 2. University of Liverpool 3. University of Manchester 4. University of Newcastle 5. University of Sheffield Due to time/resource constraints, this report contains information on ROs which submitted SoIs for HDR UK Substantive Sites only. The University of Lancaster and the University of York, which are based in this geographic region, had also submitted SoIs to become a Partner HDR UK but this report doesn't contain any information on their informatics/health data research investments. Cross-region Strategic Activities It is noteworthy that all of the ROs already mentioned in this geographic cluster, as well as the University of Durham, constitute what is known as the N8 Research Partnership . This is a collaboration of the eight most research intensive Universities in the North of England that supports the establishment of multi- partner bio-economy and preclinical research programmes. Region-wide health and biomedical informatics activities The N8 HPC is an EPSRC-funded project to provide Tier2 HPC facility to the N8 Research Partnership (with a total of 332 compute nodes (5,312 cores); and 174 TBytes Lustre v2 parallel file system for storage. The ESRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Data Analytics and Society (\u00a36M) is led by the University of Leeds in collaboration with the Universities of Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield. This investment is intended to pump prime the development of training in new, and emerging areas, and will focus on: real-time data analysis; data linkage; and interoperability of data from different sources. The substantive focus is on 'new forms of data' , in a broad sense, and on the opportunities provided by these data to study social processes as they unfold. Funding is for three cohorts of at least 10 students per year. The CDT will start taking students in October 2017. Other region-wide healthcare research related activities The N8 Universities are also members of the North Health Science Alliance (NHSA) that supports the establishment of multi-centre clinical research and development projects. Since its formation in 2011, the NHSA has worked to be a voice for the North's health science community joining together, at-scale and at-pace, capabilities and resources across eight University Medical Schools, eight research intensive NHS Trusts and four Academic Health Science Networks across North England (15M population). GEOGRAPHIC REGION:England - North 111 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation 111 Its aim is to enable companies to grow and create jobs by helping the NHS and industry engage more productively, focused on proven innovations that meet defined local needs. So far, NHSA has: brought in \u00a360M worth of contracts to the North; acted as a collaborative voice for the North's \u00a310.8bn health science economy; worked with international commercial companies; and led successful collaborations to attract health science investment. One such investment is the world-leading Health North: Connected Health Cities programme funded by the Department of Health and Social Care (\u00a320M) in 2015. Health North is operating across North England to generate innovations that can deliver more effective and efficient health and social care. Its foundations are to: - establish a social contract with citizens that gives license to use health data for public good; - produce timely and actionable information from patient and population data; - use new intelligence sources to understand pathways of care across different provider organisations and to target resources to needs in much more agile and specific ways than at present; and - accelerate business growth in the digital health sector in North England. In its first phase, Connected Health Cities initiative will be piloted in four city regions (1. Greater Manchester; 2. Yorkshire; 3. North West Coast; and 4. North East & North Cumbria), with the common principles of: - engaging and involving the public to build public trust and civic partnerships; - working with data custodians and existing infrastructure at local, regional and national level to create linked-data critical masses for deeper understanding of health in defined populations; - developing at the heart of each city region an Ark - a secure, combinatorial data analytics facility, with state-of-the-art data management and analysis tools, underpinned by research, education and training; - bringing people from academia, NHS and industry into deep collaboration in the Ark, working in partnership to create new knowledge that will inform decision-making at levels. The aim is to pilot data-intensive health service optimisation methodology and understand how it can work efficiently in city regions, then to network those regions so they can 'borrow strength'. The Newcastle University-hosted GCHQ Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research is the founding member of CyberNorth , an initiative to improve cyber security practices in the North of England and to create entrepreneurial and other activities in cyber security that benefits the economy of the region. England - North112 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationUniversity of Leeds Top-level insights The University of Leeds strengths in health and biomedical informatics build on the MRC Medical Bioinformatics award, which supported the establishment Leeds Medical Bioinformatics Centre. This award has been pivotal in the founding of the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics (LIDA), which also works in combination with the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) to provide a network for data analytics in the University. LIDA itself provides a unique collaborative working environment currently hosting colleagues from several private and public sector organisations, including Leeds City Council, the three Clinical Commissioning Groups within Leeds, Call Credit and Quintiles IMS. This model of collaboration through co-location has proven to be an effective means of directing research capability towards external need, thereby driving socio-economic impact. Furthermore, strong local partnerships between the University of Leeds and health and social care providers (including the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, NHS Digital, TTP and EMIS) has enabled the development of the Leeds Care Record, an EPR system that spans primary, secondary and social care. Health and biomedical data science training across the career pathway from undergraduate to early career researchers and clinical academics. They are also using their interdisciplinary structure and approach to improve cross-departmental transition of quantitative researchers through mechanisms like the Data Science Interns and Associate Fellows programmes. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments The Leeds Medical Bioinformatics Centre (Director: Professor Sir Alex Markham ) was established through an MRC Medical Bioinformatics award in 2013 ( \u00a37M; see also section 2.1.2 ). The Centre combines methodological strengths in bioinformatics, statistical epidemiology and health data analytics with a multi-disciplinary approach to applied health informatics, consumer data and social data analytics. The Leeds Institute of Data Analytics (LIDA ; Director: Professor Mark Birkin ) was established through \u00a340M matched MRC and ESRC funding, with an additional \u00a38M of University spending, to provide a flagship environment for health and biomedical informatics research. It has the capability to link 'omics, phenotypic, imaging and clinical data in a fully accredited and secure environment with the ambition to develop as a centre for personalised medicine and health. Subsequent alignment with associated projects from 34 Schools in the UoLeeds provides leveraged funding of \u00a345M in LIDA. The National Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC ; Co-Director: Professor Mark Birkin ) (ESRC-funded investment) - CDRC holds extensive data sets on diet, health and mobile monitoring and active travel The EPSRC-funded QuantiCode project aims to deliver an infrastructure that provides far more powerful analytical tools than those available today for public and private sector organisations to transform their abilities to analyse quantitative and coded longitudinal data. It will do this through: understanding data workflows and addressing the barriers of knowledge extraction; leadership in data governance; efficient heterogeneous data fusion; robust and scalable data mining/machine learning tools; data visualization/mining of abstraction models.England - North113 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation113 Knowledge/Expertise University of Leeds has a long track record in clinical trials and applied health research with expertise in developing new methodologies for data linkage, patient selection and consent. This is in combination with data science expertise in mathematics and computing plus diverse inputs from social and environmental science, humanities and business. Enhancing interdisciplinary research is a key aim of the University of Leeds with an \u00a31M in salaries and infrastructure invested per annum to support grand challenge-led inter-disciplinary research themes in Health, Water, Food, Energy, Culture, Cities and High Value Engineering. Data University of Leeds has access to large complex datasets from patients and populations that includes rich clinical phenotypic data from EPR. Data from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust is now available for research purposes across all of the Trust's systems. For example, data from over 70 clinical and administrative systems, including the patient administration system, the oncology EPR, theatre management, prescribing, A&E, pathology and radiology, have been pulled together and linked in a data warehouse. Data is also available from disease-specific national datasets and clinical trial datasets (including tens of thousands of patients and multiple conditions). Also, access to a unique combination of datasets relating to: Consumers (ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre) generated by retailers and other service organisations as part of their business process, and licenced for academic use through the CDRC; Environment (NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science); and Security (N8 Policing Research Partnership). This is in addition to imaging, structural biology, NGS, and digital pathology data generated from the University of Leeds's high throughput research facilities. Compute In addition to access to the EPSRC N8 HPC, University of Leeds has supercomputer infrastructure dedicated to LIDA-based researchers (MARC1) and additional resources for the rest of the researchers at the University (ARC1/2). The University of Leeds Integrated Research Campus is a secure, IG-compliant data platform that provides access to isolated virtual research environments, which enable data analysis through remote access, rather than data being released. Translational and innovation capabilities Links with industry University of Leeds has collaborations with a number of external partners including industry. For example, LIDA's Intern Programme for ten postgraduate data scientists annually has specifically been open to external partners such as Rolls Royce, Leeds City Council and Morrisons. Commercial collaboration has been supported through a variety of co -funding models including a number of KTP programmes funded by Innovate UK. Co-location with the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre has led to new collaborations, sharing data with Sainsbury's, AQL and Consumer Data.England - North114 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationLinks with NHS Local partnerships reflect University of Leeds's close relationship with health and social care providers in the Leeds area. Interactions between University, NHS Trust, CCGs, Community Health and Social Care are moderated through a coordinated Leeds Academic Health Partnership . Furthermore, geographic co-location facilitates strong partnerships with the two major suppliers of primary care IT systems (TPP and EMIS); and NHS Digital . These collaborations have supported the development of electronic patient records (e.g.PPM+) in the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust; and the Leeds Care Record , which is a very large (2.9M patients) and detailed integrated clinical record combining data from all primary care, secondary/tertiary hospital care, mental health, social and community care across Leeds. As a partnership between Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of Leeds, the NIHR Leeds BRC is a renowned centre for translational research into individually targeted, patient focussed therapies across musculoskeletal diseases. Opportunities The University of Leeds's exceptional relationships with health data providers (e.g. NHS Digital, TTP and EMIS), manufacturers, retail organisations, government, policy- makers and patient groups provide an important collaborative infrastructure which spans the full range of interest groups in health and biomedical bioinformatics.

Through its collaborations with the Farr@ HeRC (Manchester) and the North Health Science Alliance (NHSA), it aspires to deliver a learning health system that will improve patient care and public health. There are strong partnerships with local NHS Trusts, four of which have been awarded NHS England Global Digital Exemplar status, will provide opportunities to align its joint applied research programmes and answer important clinical and public health questions using new informatics and technological methods. The Liverpool City Region has an array of nationally and internationally significant digital and creative assets. Foremost among these is the STFC Hartree Centre at Daresbury, which houses the most powerful supercomputer in the UK dedicated to industrial R&D. The University has a strategic partnership with the Centre, enabling staff to access its computing facilities. In 2015, a new \u00a3113M UK government investment in the Hartree Centre was announced, plus \u00a3200M from IBM, involving the deployment of its Watson cognitive computing platform. The University of Liverpool is located within the Knowledge Quarter, where \u00a31B of investment is creating one of the largest health campuses in Europe. Furthermore, the digital space in Liverpool currently employs 13,600 people, valued at \u00a3985M GVA 2015, and is the second fastest growing technology cluster in the UK (TechNation 2015). Liverpool is one of only three Internet of Things (IoT) technology clusters in the UK (Sir Mark Walport's 2014 review). Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments The University of Liverpool Healthcare Data Laboratory , established as part of the Connected Health Cities programme, links the University's critical mass of analytical expertise with a programme of engagement of front-line clinicians across the North-West Coast region, supporting iterative co-production of clinically- validated analytics and data visualizations for defined patient pathways with NHS staff and stakeholders. University of Liverpool is also a partner in the ESRC-funded Consumer Data Research Centre (Deputy Director: Singleton ), which is based in Leeds. University of Liverpool hosts the Liverpool Centre for Mathematics in Healthcare (\u00a32.5M; EPSRC), which is one of only five such Centres nationwide. Researchers in the Centre ( Chen ) are developing novel mathematical tools that address serious healthcare challenges, carrying out multi-disciplinary research to explore how mathematics and statistics can deliver more refined and accurate predictive models, and tools, for personalised healthcare delivery. For example, they are developing novel 3D variational segmentation models for medical imaging, incorporating incomplete and partially segmented information, in collaboration with an industrial partner. The University of Liverpool investigators ( Williamson, Capewell ) have been collaborators on the Farr@HeRC in Manchester award from its inception. England - North119 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation119 Knowledge/Expertise University of Liverpool researchers have experience in extracting, managing and linking data from diverse datasets for policy-relevant analytics, including consumer, finance and welfare datasets not routinely used in applied public health research; as well as stratified medicine, including 'omics and clinical data. One of their key strengths is expertise in clinical trials methodology including the development of analytics, methods and standards. For example, they lead the COMET Initiative (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) (Williamson) , which brings together people interested in the development and application of agreed standardised sets of outcomes, known as 'core outcome sets'. Data With Liverpool CCG, Liverpool City Council and Alder Hey Children's Hospital University of Liverpool (Taylor-Robinson ) is establishing an anonymised population-level child health and development dataset for all children in Liverpool, nested around the universal health check data, linked to birth records, data on use of local health and social care services, educational outcomes, and National Child Monitoring Programme data. This will form the basis of an electronic population cohort to allow epidemiological assessment of the early origins of health inequalities in Liverpool. Through a collaboration between the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North West Coast , the ESRC-funded Consumer Research Data Centre and 10 local authorities across the North West, University of Liverpool researchers ( Barr) have established an Integrated Longitudinal Research Resource of linked neighbourhood datasets, enabling the tracking of the determinants of health and health outcomes within neighbourhoods along with novel neighbourhood-level contextual indicators of networked distances to health care facilities, health-related commercial outlets (fast food, alcohol) and health assets (leisure facilities, green spaces). Compute University of Liverpool has invested in HPC capability, and also has collaborations with the Hartree Centre . Current capabilities include: (i) BlueGene/Q, which (131,072 cores), and is currently being replaced with even greater computing capacity; (ii) Blue Wonder (11,520 cores); and (iii) 8PB storage; and additional platforms for big data analytics. Translational and innovation capabilities Links with industry Also, located within Liverpool is AIMES , a commercial data centre service provider, which provides N3 secure data storage at Wavertree Technology Campus. In addition, within Connected Health Cities, AIMES hold identifiable data in one secure set of servers, and has created a discrete and 'ring-fenced' store for anonymised data with secure on-site computers hosting the relevant statistical software. Aggregated outputs can be generated and 'published' from this system, with appropriate controls and permissions.England - North120 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationLinks with NHS University of Liverpool works closely with NHS Digital and have obtained approval for access to Liverpool CCG data stored in a scalable system developed by AIMES (work in progress). University of Liverpool partnerships with local NHS Trusts, four of which (Alder Hey Children's Hospital, the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust and Wirral University Teaching Hospital Foundation Trust) have been awarded NHS England Global Digital Exemplar status, will provide opportunities to align their joint applied research programmes and answer important clinical and public health questions using new informatics and technological methods. Innovative approaches introduced include digital dictation and transcription for electronic patient reported outcomes (RLUH), 'Person Held Record' test system with NHS England, NHS Digital and the Government Digital Service (RLUH), HealtheIntent platform combining hospital and GP data into the shared health record for chronic diseases including asthma, diabetes and COPD (WUTH), structured clinical terminology based data capture (AHCH, LHCH), improving the patient experience using IBM Watson technology (AHCH), co-production of digital technology services (Mersey Care), collaboration with Stanford to develop a suicide prevention app to help reduce death by self-harm (Mersey Care), NHS England national PROMs pilot (LHCH). Through Liverpool Health Partners , the University links to six additional NHS Trusts and the NIHR CLAHRC North West Coast (Director: Gabbay ) cements further relationships with eight local authorities, six CCGs and 17 NHS Trusts. Opportunities University of Liverpool is developing knowledge, guidance and platforms for efficient trials that can be shared across research groups/programmes. Potential gaps Currently, the University of Liverpool has not got any significant research activities in citizen-driven/digital health but it has plans to expand on this area. Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery Science Infectious Disease is one of three University of Liverpool's research themes recognised for its research excellence. An interdisciplinary approach brings together medical and veterinary science to focus on diverse challenges like new medicines for children and tackling HIV disease, through to developing diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for both humans and animals. Major programmes in health and biomedical informatics include: 1. the \"Integrate\" programme ( O'Brien ; Wellcome Trust/DH-funded) to accelerate recognition, investigation and control of gastroenteritis outbreaks within the NHS by analysing together real- time regional and national syndromic data from human and animal surveillance systems in combination with rapid molecular diagnostics and next-generation sequence bioinformatics data on pathogens causing diarrhoea; 2. the Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network (Radford ), a unique research and syndromic surveillance system for companion animals established in collaboration with the British Small Animal Veterinary Association and essential for understanding national human risk for zoonotic pathogens, including antimicrobial resistance; England - North121 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation121 3. vaccines programmes ( French ) aimed at developing efficient methods for evaluating new vaccines; and 4. methods development to model spread and evolution of infectious diseases in collaboration with the Liverpool Centre for Mathematics in Healthcare ( Sharkey, O'Brien ). The Centre for Genomic Research (Hertz-Fowler ) includes a dedicated team of 15 experienced bioinformaticians and software engineers working in conjunction with laboratory specialists ensuring that large and complex genomic data sets can be analysed efficiently and effectively . Precision medicine The Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine and the MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science combine expertise in clinical pharmacology with 'omics technologies to identify biomarkers which allow for: disease stratification; identification of responders and non-responders to medicines; and development of algorithms (combining clinical and genomic information, together with PK/PD and PBPK modelling) to individualise dosing (precision dosing). This has already led to the development of genotype-guided dosing for warfarin (being implemented in primary care), the use of HLA-genotyping to prevent serious adverse drug reactions (e.g. HLA-B*57:01 in abacavir hypersensitivity) and the development of multi-biomarker protein and miRNA panels which can identify patients at risk of serious drug-induced liver injury which outperform conventional transaminase measurements. Professor Pirmohamed formed and leads the UK Pharmacogenetics and Stratified Medicine Network . Population and Public health University of Liverpool hosts the MRC North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research (Director: Williamson) , which undertakes evaluation of approaches to e-recruitment and data sharing; whilst the Clinical Trials Research Centre is delivering a number of NIHR-funded e-trials including ISDR, CF START, REACT and OVERT, which are using informatics in a way similar to the GSK Salford Lung Study; and developing web- and app-based solutions to collect patient reported outcome data. For example, the NIHR-funded ISDR study uses informatics similarly to the GSK Salford Lung Study, randomising 4,500 patients from the cohort of 25,000 individuals in the NHS diabetic eye screening programme within Liverpool. Data are predominantly obtained from routine care, both primary and secondary care. CF START is an NIHR-funded trial, delivered through the UK CF Registry, recruiting through all CF Centres using data currently collected by the registry. The NIHR-funded REACT trial recruits, consents, collects all data and provides the intervention entirely online. The NIHR-funded OVERT trial makes use of an eDiary (available over the web, with an \"app\" in development) to collect patient reported outcome data. Citizen-driven/Digital health University of Liverpool researchers are developing deep learning methodologies using EPRs to develop personalised renal function monitoring protocols, which will be linked to non-invasive renal function assessment using sensor technology and feedback of results to patients and their clinicians using mHealth platforms. Learning health systems The Department of Biostatistics hosts the University's Connected Health Cities Healthcare Data Laboratory (Bodger ), linking its critical mass of analytical expertise with a programme of engagement of front-line clinicians across the NW Coast, supporting co-production of clinically-validated analytics and data visualizations for defined patient pathways. England - North122 Key informatics investments by Research Organisation University of Liverpool researchers have mapped 'hot spots' of emergency admissions for alcohol- related conditions at small area level, overlaying aggregated data on benefits, crime, housing, markers of deprivation, location of GP surgeries and off license premises. Building on this concept of small area mapping to promote local engagement, knowledge of an individual's place of residence could facilitate improved access to specific services, e.g. physical location of a community clinic, allowing healthcare teams and others to individualise care plans. In the \"Integrate\" programme , University of Liverpool researchers analyse on a daily basis national syndromic surveillance data from NHS111 in conjunction with data from SAVSNET and laboratory results to detect geospatial anomalies that might indicate the emergence of an outbreak and deliver results every morning to the Consultants in Health Protection on the front-line, in time for them to respond quickly. Disease areas University of Liverpool has expertise in disease areas that include: infectious diseases, child health, musculoskeletal, CVD and gastrointestinal. Analytics The Departments of Biostatistics is undertaking research in areas such as joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data, multivariate data analysis, multi-source evidence synthesis, and statistical genetics and pharmacogenetics. Combined with a strong group of geographers with expertise in spatial statistical analysis ( Singleton, Lloyd ) and a cross-Faculty Analytics Special Interest Group (Maskell ), this offers analytical support and innovative methods development. University of Liverpool researchers are developing analytics to identify and improve the health inequalities impact of public policies. For example, development of alternative rigorous epidemiological methods to the classical RCT to demonstrate the health inequalities effects of public policy decisions. This includes applying innovative modelling and simulation techniques ( O'Flaherty ) to investigate the impact of structural policies to improve diets on disease burden and equity. Also, they are applying modern methods for causal mediation analysis in longitudinal data tracing social pathways to and from health inequalities in children and identifying effective interventions and policies to reduce health inequalities ( Taylor-Robinson ). e-Infrastructure University of Liverpool's facilities consist of an HPC cluster with 2,000 cores of freely accessible compute cores and a Condor pool with approximately 1,400 cores to support analytical workflows involving large numbers of independent and relatively short runs. The cluster includes a large memory server with 2TB of memory. All of the cluster's servers are connected via a high-performance interconnect and have shared access to approximately 200TB of storage. Plans are underway to double the capacity of this cluster by mid-2017 with a further doubling in capacity scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2018 once a planned new data centre is completed. Separate to the centrally managed HPC, the Institute for Integrative Biology recently purchased servers and storage for general research support. This includes twelve high-specification compute nodes: ten with 64 cores, 512GB RAM and 2TB SSD-based scratch space; and two with 96 cores, 1TB RAM and 2TB SSD-based scratch space. There is also 1.8PB storage capacity accessed by all compute nodes, connected via 10Gb Ethernet, with 40Gb Ethernet bridging to off-site backup storage.England - North123 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation123 Training University of Liverpool offers MSc programmes in: Computer Science; Geographic Data Science; Big Data Management; and Public Health.

University of Oxford 2. University of Bristol 3. University of Southampton 4. University of Surrey Due to time/resource constraints, this report contains information only on ROs which expressed interests in becoming HDR UK Substantive Sites. The University of Portsmouth and the University of Sussex , which are based in this geographic region, had also submitted SoIs to become a Partner HDR UK but this report doesn't contain any information on their informatics/health data research activities. Cross-region Strategic Activities The NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) is in the process of joining the NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) programme ( see section 2.2.2 ), which is led by the University of Oxford and the Oxford BRC.GEOGRAPHIC REGION:England - South148 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationUniversity of Oxford Top-level insights The University of Oxford has an international reputation for generating, curating, analysing and sharing very large clinical and genomic datasets and population cohorts, working in partnership with academic, health and commercial organizations across the UK and internationally. Examples include the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium, the Million Women Study, and a series of landmark clinical trials. Over recent years, Oxford researchers have been at the heart of major national projects, including UK Biobank, the 100,000 Genomes Project and the NIHR HIC. The University of Oxford SoI focuses on the Big Data Institute (BDI) (housed in a \u00a347M building opened in May 2017, including contribution from an MRC Medical Bioinformatics award), which lies at the heart of Oxford's ambitions in health data science. In addition to this MRC award, BDI has received funding from other diverse sources including the UK Government: UK Research Infrastructure Investment Partnership (\u00a310M); (\u00a320M fellowships). BDI is a multi-disciplinary endeavour that brings together researchers from across the breadth of biomedical sciences and co-locates them with quantitative scientists from the Departments of Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering and the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities. Further staff recruitment has been underway over the past year. BDI is already acting as a central catalyst for large-scale medical research. There is an opportunity to closely align with HDR UK's vision and strategy especially in the areas of clinical informatics for biomedical research, clinical trials and cohort studies, health data analytics, and training. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments University of Oxford's major research investments in biomedical informatics include: the MRC Medical Bioinformatics award provided \u00a36M capital funding towards the building of the Big Data Institute (BDI; Director: Professor Gil McVean and Deputy Director: Professor Martin Landray ). In addition, the University has invested substantial funds in this endeavour, matching \u00a323M of government, charity and philanthropic funding with \u00a324M from its own capital fund. Generous donations from the Li Ka Shing and Robertson Foundations have provided \u00a325M for senior academic staff and post-doctoral fellowships. The NIHR Oxford BRC is not only one of the NIHR HIC (see section 2.2.2 ) sites, but it is also where the HIC coordinating team is based (see also section on 'NHS links' below ). The University of Oxford is a founding partner of the Alan Turing Institute (ATI). Areas of data science research at Oxford at the ATI range from machine learning and computability theory to ethics and the social implications of new computational technologies.England - South 149 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation 149Knowledge/Expertise The BDI comprise research groups drawn from a wide range of UoO departments (e.g. statistics, computer science, engineering and social sciences). This provides a strong skills-base in the governance, acquisition, processing and analysis of large, complex, heterogeneous biomedical and health datasets for research but also in related ethical and legal issues. BDI researchers have experience of collaborations on national flagship programmes including: - UK Biobank - provided the UK Biobank health informatics hub and data repository since its inception; developing systems for recruitments, clinic assessments, multi-modal imaging and linkage to routine data) - NIHR HIC - developed a secure, data sharing framework, spanning multiple therapeutic areas across the current network of five BRCs. The HIC approach is metadata-driven (catalogue available via the NIHR Health Data Finder , which Oxford also developed, enabling researchers to more easily compare data across HIC centres. - 100,000 Genomes project - the BRC Clinical Informatics team developed, designed, and oversaw the implementation of a comprehensive clinical information infrastructure for this project. - the Alan Turing Institute (Holmes is a faculty member), with interests in information security, machine learning, and high-dimensional analysis. Data BDI has access to large rich datasets through its connections with the University of Oxford and other national and international collaborations. For example: - Hosting the health informatics hub and primary data repository for UK Biobank (0.5M people; 5 years' follow-up; extensive genetic, environmental, functional and health outcomes data). - NIHR HIC viral hepatitis dataset : anonymised data from patients (currently 1,200 patients) with a diagnosis of hepatitis B, C, D, E or autoimmune hepatitis, collected from the collaborating sites since 2013, primarily from hospital outpatient clinics. These are secondary care - local deep episodic (per consultant episode) data including admission, treatment, follow up, treatment outcome data. - China Kadoorie Biobank (0.5M people; 10 years' follow-up; registries; 300 candidate genotypes; genotyping on 100K ongoing). - Million Women Study (1.3M women; 15 years' follow-up; linked to death, cancer, hospital registries and CPRD; genotyping in 50K). - Mexico City Prospective Cohort Study (150K people; 15 years' follow-up; linked to death records; blood and genetic material stored; survey and linkage to hospital records planned). - A series of large clinical trial datasets , with clinical data (e.g. 100,000 with cardiovascular disease; 10,000 with renal disease; 20,000 maternal health). - Local and national hospitalization, birth and death records for Oxfordshire (4M people since 1963) and all-England (50M people unlinked 1968-1985, since 1998, 7M - South150 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationTranslational and innovation capabilities Industry links BDI have collaborative research programmes with several major pharmaceutical companies (e.g. GSK, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer) and the technology sector (e.g. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Proteus Digital health and Philips). NHS links NIHR Biomedical Research Centre The NIHR Oxford BRC (\u00a3113.7M; Director: Professor Keith Channon ) is a partnership between the University and the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Its overarching aims are to enable large-scale data analysis in genomics, imaging and infection, leveraging the statistical, computational and analytical platforms of the BDI and to link with NHS clinical data via the NIHR HIC. The BRC aims to establish clinical informatics systems, information governance framework, computational infrastructure, and data discovery tools to enable analytical researchers to develop and apply algorithms to selected BRC datasets (e.g. cancer, gastroenterology & mucosal immunity). In the longer-term, there are plans to roll-out clinical informatics and information governance tools across the AHSN and other BRCs; develop a framework for benchmarking and validating digital phenotyping algorithms; extend analytic approaches with other themes. The BRC informatics team is housed in the BDI. Academic Health Science Centre University of Oxford is also a partner of the Oxford AHSC together with Oxford Brookes University, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trusts. Informatics activities within the AHSC are aligned with BDI, and Professor Martin Landray (BDI's Deputy Director) chairs the Oxford AHSC Big Data and Clinical Informatics Committee, which provides scientific coordination of activities across all partners, including the BRC. Examples include the development of an integrated, longitudinal research record and data warehousing infrastructure for cancer and microbiology translational research; the delivery of the Oxford NHS Genomic Medicine Centre and of software infrastructure to support large scale clinical genomic research including linkage to national datasets for Project. NHS 100,00 genomes project | Genomics England Ltd The Oxford team provided informatics support for the Oxford NHS Molecular Diagnostics Centre (MDC) and related activities, including a HICF-funded project on the translation of whole genome sequencing (WGS) into clinical practice and the NHS-funded Oxford Genomic Medicine Centre (GMC). These have informed the design and facilitated the delivery of the 100,000 Genomes Project. The team developed data capture and integrated reporting solutions to support the deployment of a 46-gene panel for cancer as an NHS service, providing valuable, timely results on 1406 patients to date. The Oxford GMC was the first centre to offer patients WGS across the full range of eligible cancers, and remains the leading GMC for cancer participation, contributing 35% of the samples to date ( please also see section below on Learning Health Systems ). NHS Global Digital Exemplar The Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust recently secured \u00a310M from NHS England as a Global Digital Exemplar with plans to collaborate with neighbouring regions and with Cerner sites across the UK. Plans for integration of local primary care (EMIS) and secondary care data (Cerner) are at an advanced stage. England - South151 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation151 Opportunities BDI research themes are in line with HDR UK priorities. BDI are enthusiastic about extending the training opportunities through collaboration across the HDR UK. Bringing together experts from quantitative, computational, biological and clinical backgrounds, the BDI is well placed to train the founder generation of biomedical data scientists. Furthermore, the training will benefit from the excellence of established programmes in medicine, statistics, computer science and engineering. For example: - BDI can provide space, access to data and compute resource, mentorship and collaborative opportunities for post-doctoral fellows. They are particularly keen to host and develop fellows with unconventional academic careers (e.g. extensive time spent in industry). - They also plan to establish a 4 year PhD programme in Biomedical Data Science, largely recruiting students with mathematical and computational backgrounds. This builds on the MRC/EPSRC Oxford-Warwick Statistics Programme (OxW aSP), a 1 plus3 year scheme in the theory, methods and applications of Statistical Science for data-intensive environments and large-scale models. - Opportunities for placements in industry or the health sector will be provided. Potential gaps Although BDI has strong analytical expertise in genomics, cohort and clinical trial data, they do not seem to have significant activity on methodological research for the development of learning health systems. BDI's e-infrastructure seems to be at the planning stage and there does not seem to be dedicated Data Centre in place yet. Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery Science BDI ( McVean, Holmes, Kong, Lindgren, Wedge ) capitalises on advances in genomics, immune profile, digital pathology and other laboratory measurements through its connections with the University of Oxford's: Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics; Ludwig Institute and Kennedy Institute; and beyond (Broad Institute, Sanger Institute, EMBL-EBI) to investigate the molecular basis of complex traits, cancer and rare diseases that will lead to new disease pathways and potential treatment targets. In collaboration with the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Oxford Centre for Magnetic Resonance and FMRIB, the BDI ( Noble, Smith ) develops automated quantitative methods for extracting imaging phenotypes from raw medical imaging data, including MRI of the brain in the 100,000 person UK Biobank imaging study. Precision medicine Oxford has an interest in this area and building on their current experience in hepatitis C, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma. For example, current activity includes: STOP-HCV - Stratified Medicine to Optimise Treatment for Hepatitis C Virus Infection (MRC Stratified Medicine Consortium \u00a34.1M; Professor Ellie Barnes) : integrating host and viral genetics to determine why, in an era of new and highly effective (but expensive) drug therapies, some Hepatitis C infected individuals still fail to respond to treatment England - South152 Key informatics investments by Research Organisation S-CORT - COloRectal cancer (MRC c. \u00a32.5M; CRUK c. \u00a32.5M, Professor Tim Maughan ): aims to develop a clinical test(s) that could be given to all colorectal cancer patients upon diagnosis to allow them to have a tailor-made treatment plan, which is guided by their individual biological makeup. Professor Chris Holmes provides key expertise in statistical analysis of data generated by the stratified medicine consortia. Population and Public health Working in collaboration with UK Biobank (including Edinburgh and Cambridge Universities and the Farr Institute) and with Oxford's large clinical trials, BDI ( Allen, Davies, Lay ) have developed an extensible approach that enables secure transfer and integrated management of data from routine national sources (e.g. HES, cancer, primary care systems) for research cohorts. MRC Hubs for Trials Methodology Research, BDI researchers have developed efficient systems for recruitment, data collection, management, quality assurance (including statistical monitoring), and analysis of very large clinical trials, including SHARP and REVEAL. These systems have been used for trials totalling over 65,000 participants and have been inspected by regulatory authorities including FDA, EMA, MHRA. Learning Health Systems The UK Biobank and the Million Women Study are examples of cohort studies linked to routinely collected EHR data (diagnoses, interventions, mortality, disease registries, primary care). Oxford has the longest population-based record linkage dataset in the country, linking birth, hospitalization, and death records for Oxfordshire (4M people since 1963) and all-England (50M people unlinked 1968-1985, linked since 1998, 7M mother-child pairs) enabling disease-association studies and analyses of long-term trends in clinical outcomes (e.g. a recent study of dialysis-associated mortality over the past 5 decades) Other work that combines routine EHR data with other data sources to improve health includes: - the Modernising Medical Microbiology programme (funded by NIHR and Wellcome Trust) is supervising the redesign of the processing pipeline for whole genome sequence (WGS) data; establishing data standards and tools for the acquisition of clinical and laboratory information from across a network of centres; providing enabling technology for reporting and surveillance activities. It is envisaged that this will result in an estimated 30% cost reduction with significant greater savings to be realised with further advances in sequencing technology. A national implementation is being piloted for the Public Health England (PHE) mycobacteriology diagnostic service; WGS has been adopted for surveilance and outbreak management for C. difficile; and the Oxford BRC team are working with the Stop-HCV consortium to deliver a stratified approach to the treatment of viral hepatitis using new antiviral therapies. This work has been informed by that of the NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative, where the Oxford team have gathered data on cases from across the five comprehensive BRCs, and the development of a national surveillance system for Hepatitis-C with PHE. - Molecular Diagnostics: Embedding genomic medicine within routine care offers significant patient benefit, particularly for patients with cancer or rare, inherited disorders. The Oxford BRC team ( see also links with the NHS section above ) provided informatics support to the Oxford NHS Molecular Diagnostics Centre and the NHS-funded Oxford Genomic Medicine Centre (GMC). For example, the team developed data capture and integrated reporting solutions to support the deployment of a 46-gene panel for cancer as an NHS service, providing valuable, timely results on 1406 patients to date. The Oxford GMC was the first centre to offer patients WGS across the full range of eligible cancers, and remains the leading GMC for cancer participation, contributing 35% of the samples to England - South153 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation153 date. The team have designed and developed support for multi-disciplinary team (MDT) working in clinical genetics: the Oxford Genomic Medicine MDT has been considered a model for embedding genomic medicine in NHS clinical practice. Since its implementation, referrals have increased 300%, with 30% of the new referrals coming from departments outside clinical genetics. >500 individuals have been offered and have accepted WGS. Based upon the pilot programme experience, 25% of these may expect a new, validated diagnosis. The team have also developed the data specifications and the software for data acquisition and management used in the 100,000 Genomes Project. - The Oxford BRC Clinical Informatics team provides supports work on a diversity of research themes and disease areas that seek to: recruit patients for particular studies; assess changes in health and disease over time; evaluate the impact of new diagnostics or interventions; or develop new approaches to disease management. The BRC Clinical Informatics team provides a scalable, configurable, multi- directional information flow across organizations (including primary and secondary care) and between patients, healthcare professionals and researchers. This work builds on existing strong collaborations with our Digital Health and Imaging programmes . Examples include: u digital health approaches to management of chronic disease using EHR, smartphone-enabled sensors/cameras, EHR and machine learning u development of clinically applicable algorithms for patient stratification in inflammatory bowel disease u assessing the impact of (often silent) atrial fibrillation on cardiovascular, stroke, and vascular dementia diseases u using combined clinical and genomic data to identify emergence of infection threats Randomized controlled trials: Oxford scientists have worked on a number of practice-changing clinical trials including for example, the 3C randomized trial of immunosuppressive strategies following renal transplantation depending entirely on routinely collected EHR data to determine efficacy and safety of the different interventions over the medium-longterm. Citizen-driven/Digital health The BDI together with the Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Statistics apply machine learning approaches to signal processing and data fusion in order to interpret data from mobile sensors. Examples include: quantifying and characterising activity patterns from 7-day accelerometer data in 100,000 UK Biobank participants; and web-cam based assessment of oxygen saturation and vital signs for continuous physiological monitoring. BDI ( Hinds, Young ) in Department of Psychiatry ( Gallacher, Lovestone ) are able to assess cognitive and mental health through web- and smartphone-based technologies, including the Healthy Minds assessment of cognitive function in 140,000 UK Biobank participants; and the TrueColours system for self-monitoring of mood disorders in bipolar disorder. Disease areas University of Oxford has research programmes on a number of disease areas with particular focus on complex disorders (e.g. obesity, diabetes, CVD), cancer and infection.England - South154 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationAnalytics BDI engineers ( Fraser, Gething, Holmes, McVean, Rittscher ) are engaged in the development of statistical and machine learning methods to gain new insights from multi-modal, biomedical and healthcare data, including: Clinical phenotyping: Use of (semi-)automated approaches (including regression models and machine- learning) to derive clinical phenotypes, distinguish disease subtypes, and identify common features across multiple diseases. Longitudinal analysis of patient data: Development of statistical methods to derive information on response to treatment, progression, relapse or paroxysmal changes in disease state from routine healthcare data. Analysis and integration of high-dimensional, heterogeneous biomedical data: New approaches that combine biological knowledge with unsupervised machine learning to assess relationships between diverse data sources (e.g. combined genomic, imaging, and clinical data). Epidemiology: Reliable analytic approaches to genetic epidemiology, prospective cohort studies, large randomized trials and meta-analyses. Geo-spatial and temporal analyses: Mapping and modelling infectious disease and drug-resistant infection. The Oxford BRC Big Data analytics sub-theme allows researchers from across the BRC to apply HPC to patient-derived research data efficiently and at large scale. Using exemplars from other BRC themes, the team is developing analytical methods for large, heterogeneous datasets that can be applied to similar scientific problems both locally and nationally. Methods (including Bayesian and machine learning approaches) will be developed to support analysis of high-dimensional biomarkers (immune profiling, functional genomics, imaging) in areas such as Cancer, Gastroenterology and Mucosal Immunity, Molecular Diagnostics, Genomics, Imaging . Methods to characterise clinical phenotype - including disease subtypes or commonality between conventionally \"different\" diseases - and the influence of treatment or other external triggers on their severity over time - will benefit proposed translational medicine projects within Diabetes, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Stroke and Vascular Dementia, Multi-morbidity and Long-term Conditions, Musculoskeletal, Gastroenterology and Cancer, Resistance and Modernising Microbiology . e-Infrastructure Compute The BDI currently has provision for 32 racks with cooling and 320kW of power, sufficient for around 60PB of storage and over 8,000 cores. The relative allocation to storage and compute will be determined through more detailed planning. The initial facility (~\u00a31.5M of hardware) will be expanded to reach capacity over the coming 18-36 months. Over the next 1-2 years, the BDI will define and implement a strategy for development of off-site HPC capability. Training Oxford has a number of taught Masters programmes , including short courses in software engineering which can be combined to obtain an MSc in Software & Systems Security (accredited by GCHQ). England - South155 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation155 In collaboration with the University of Warwick, it has MRC/EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Next Generation Statistical Science Programme (OxWaSP) . The Programme aims to train graduate statisticians in the theory, methods and applications of statistical science for data-intensive environments and large-scale models.

Developing infrastructure to curate and share these data and address problems of cost efficient follow-up and participation bias in exemplar projects are the focus of their contribution to Farr@CIPHER. A key strength of the University of Bristol is in Digital Health with expertise not only in the acquisition and interpretation of health data from personal devices but also pioneering the use of Internet of Things for health research with several studies deploying wirelessly networked devices in local homes. Over the next 3-5 years the University of Bristol plans to create a physical hub for digital health research, part of a \u00a3300M investment in a second campus. Bristol is Europe's most advanced smart city with sensors across the city to track energy usage, air quality and traffic flows, informing an innovative operating system to monitor and deliver the city's needs. The University Hospital Bristol Foundation Trust has earned a Global Digital Exemplar status. The newly-funded NIHR Bristol BRC has a theme on 'Biostatistics, Evidence Synthesis and Informatics' aiming to use cutting-edge approaches to organise and analyse different information types to inform clinical decisions. The University of Bristol Advanced Computing Research Centre is one of the country's leading centres for HPC. BlueCrystal, the University's flagship HPC supercomputer, is the second most powerful of any UK University and ranked 301st in the world in 2016. As part of the GW4 Alliance, the University of Bristol works closely with its partners: Cardiff, Bath and Exeter Universities. Other collaborations include a recently awarded BRC with a foundation in population health and a focus on scientific discovery through analyses of large and complex datasets. Their assets represent over \u00a3100M external investment matched to a high degree by institutional support. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments High-level institutional commitment in data science research, which is demonstrated by investments such as: - the Jean Golding Institute for Data-Intensive Research , which brings together research in data analytics and analysis methods, data infrastructure and applications across all UoB Faculties; - the joint Wellcome/ University of Bristol -funded E lizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research , which fosters collaborations between world-leading researchers who work on data-intensive research in statistical bioinformatics; clinical, translational, and infrastructural epidemiology; and computational genomics; - the Brigstow Institute , which brings researchers from different disciplines together with a range of partners to experiment in new ways of living and being. Living well with technologies is a key theme. England - South157 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation157 Other informatics related investments include the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (\u00a323M funded by MRC and University of Bristol), which is linking 'omics, population health and environmental data to investigate the underlying causes of disease, and with a strong cross-cutting theme in bioinformatics and data mining developing novel methodology and tools. Knowledge/Expertise Since 2016, the University of Bristol has appointed four new Chairs in Data Science ( Bullock, Salas, Dowsey and Wood ) alongside new lecturers in Human Computer Interaction for Health and in Computational Health Behaviour Analysis. Expertise in acquisition and interpretation of health data from personal devices is a key strength. The University of Bristol has developed key competences in machine learning from these sources of time-series data, tools to conduct large scale digital health trials, related research ethics processes, participatory design and public engagement. Data Some of the many data assets within the University of Bristol include: The world's most data-rich pregnancy cohort (currently supported by an MRC/Wellcome strategic award (2014-19)). The \u00a31.8M Wellcome-funded Project to Enhance ALSPAC through Record Linkage (PEARL) gained permissions to link to routine health and social data on >90% of original ALSPAC participants (98% for health data). Around 80% of participants have linkage to primary care records. The University of Bristol co-leads the Born in Bradford (BiB) pregnancy cohort (funded by MRC, ESRC, Wellcome and British Heart Foundation), a two-generational deeply phenotyped pregnancy cohort, which has genome-wide genetic and DNA methylation data and NMR metabolomics data on both parents and children. The BiB biobank is located in Bristol. The Bristol-based UK Renal Registry is linked to local EHRs and laboratory data, which are captured in real-time and made available online to patients across the UK via PatientView . This infrastructure is being used to support five data efficient trials of interventions in renal patients. The University of Bristol has a high-quality database of genome-wide association study results (containing results of ~4billion genetic association analyses from >1,000 datasets, to be substantially expanded with UK Biobank data. The University of Bristol is leading on creation of a Digital Health Asset Register of all available data sources held within organisations across the Bristol, North Somerset, and South Gloucestershire region, with support from the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute and Bristol Health Partners. This includes data held by UoB, the University of the West of England, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust, North Bristol NHS Trust, Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Care Trust, the CCGs and Commissioning Support Units and Bristol City Council. Compute The University of Bristol Advanced Computing Research Centre is one of the country's leading centres for HPC. BlueCrystal , the University's flagship HPC supercomputer (\u00a33M) provides access to 16,000 cores, whist the Research Data Storage Facility provides 2.5PB of storage (soon to be 12PB).England - South158 Key informatics investments by Research Organisation The GW4 Alliance , brings together four of universities in the south west of the UK; the universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter. Together with Cray Inc. and the Met Office, GW4 Alliance has been awarded \u00a33M by EPSRC to be installed in 2017 and deliver a new Tier 2 HPC service for UK-based scientists. The system will be one of the world's first to be based on Broadcom's Vulcan server-class chip. Details of this device are still under NDA, but the Vulcan CPU is generating excitement because it trades off much greater provision of memory bandwidth for less emphasis on peak FLOP/s, the former being more important for most scientific codes. Providing access to such a machine as a national service should therefore enable the UK's HPC community to quantify the benefit of memory bandwidth focused CPUs, thus informing future system procurements from Tier 1 to Tier 3. Translational and innovation capabilities Links with industry Partnerships include pharmaceutical companies such as GSK, Biogen, Merck, Sanoffi and Ferrring. There are also collaborations in place with Roche Diagnostics and Medtronic who access the University's informatics capabilities (e.g.MR-Base) to complement their drug discovery and biomarker platforms and programmes. Links with NHS The newly-funded NIHR Bristol BRC (\u00a321M) is a partnership between University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Bristol. This BRC aims to catalyse development of new diagnostics, treatments based around population health. The cross-cutting \"Translational Population Science\" theme analyses contributions of the genome, epigenome and micr obiome to disease risk, to inform prevention and treatment. The also cross-cutting \"Biostatistics, Evidence Synthesis and Informatics\" theme uses cutting-edge approaches to organise and analyse different information types. A key aim, particularly in the Cardiovascular Disease and Perinatal and Reproductive Health research themes is to harness routine clinical measures to inform clinician/patient discussions around treatment decisions. Bristol is in the process of joining the NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) programme, and will therefore lead a new project analyzing routine health care data combined across the six participating acute NHS Trusts. University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust has NHS Global Digital Exemplar status (\u00a310M) which provides the opportunity to increasingly link to more diverse datasets and work with industry. The University of Bristol works with the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) West and the West of England AHSN . Opportunities The University of Bristol has recently approved a Digital Health Strategy, the implementation of which will be led by Ian Craddock and which will involve investments in additional new posts. Its expertise and investment can help catalyse HDR UK research activities in this area. The University of Bristol plans to capitalise on the emergence of high-throughput and large-scale 'omics profiling to spearhead molecular phenotyping at scale. A multi-platform molecular phenotyping pipeline, data bank and bioinformatics resource will be established for the Manchester's Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre (\u00a318M) clinical proteomics facility with University of Bristol's established Brainshake NMR metabolomics acquisition and analysis platform that includes complementary mass spectrometry metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics data from their large-scale cohort studies. The proposed system will realise statistical analyses and mechanistic discovery at unparalleled scale in the 'omics field.England - South159 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation159 There are exciting plans to create an Avon-wide Digital Population Laboratory including links to Connecting Care , the regional initiative to digitally link social and health care data. This will be a data intensive research resource to support the application of large-scale 'omics and other analyses to the discovery of causes, testing of hypotheses and development of mor e effective prevention and treatment. It will be distinguished from other such initiatives by the integration of ALSPAC and other cohorts: a relatively stable population with unusually high coverage of linkage to routine data; our expertise in establishing and using data linkage pipelines, sharing linked data and developing and deploying cutting edge sensor technology; and access to a city-wide interactive network provided by Bristol is Open , and with the aim of extending coverage of linkage to the full Connecting Care databank. Potential gaps The University of Bristol is not leading on any of the MRC Stratified Medicine Consortia; and it does not appear to be involved in any other stratified /precision medicine initiatives. Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery Science Brainshake is an automated high-throughput serum NMR metabolomics platform that was developed by Professor Mika Ala-Korpela and his Computational Medicine team at the University. It provides quantitative molecular information for 233 metabolic measures. Analyses with this platform are commercially available via Nightingale Health Ltd. Precision medicine Precision medicine is prominent in the Bristol NIHR BRC led across several work-streams by Professor George Davey Smith and his colleagues in the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit. Precision medicine initiatives have been further developed by work also involving Professor Davey Smith based on the Bristol- based UK Renal Registry - for example: the NURTuRE project (MRC \u00a33.1M; Professor Moin Saleem ) will use the valuable samples and clinical data collected in the NURTuRE-NS (NephroS) and NURTuRE-CKD registry, and generate new data and methods that will allow us to redefine the diagnostic categories of nephrotic syndrome and CKD. This will help to provide individualised diagnostic tests and new therapies and will be based on deep analysis of patient DNA, blood and biopsy samples provided within this study. The four-year project is boosted by in-kind industry partner contributions and the continued involvement of Kidney Research UK and the UK Renal Registry. Other Bristol BRC-led projects in this area include: The BRC Reproductive and Perinatal Health Research Theme conducts translational research, covering women's reproductive life from fertility through pregnancy to the menopause, that supports appropriate precision prevention and stratified medicine to improve women's and their children's health. In particular, they are determining optimal IVF treatment strategies to increase livebirth rate and maximise short- to long-term health of mothers and infants, and will be testing the feasibility and acceptability of stratified medicine approaches to IVF treatment. The BRC Mental Health Research Theme is identifying personality traits contributing to treatment response in psychological therapies for depression, establishing biomarker profiles to improve prediction and risk stratification of psychotic experiences, and identifying biomarkers pr edicting response to psychological therapies for depression.England - South160 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationPopulation and Public health The PEARL project: (i) demonstrated that linkage to routine health and social care data can add substantial value to population-based research; (ii) established data pipelines to capture routine health and social data at scale; and (iii) developed associated governance structures and informatics tools. Building on the PEARL project by extending linkage to new data, including the 1M local citizens whose records contribute to Connecting Care . UoB researchers are exploring governance and data sharing structures to allow secondary research use of these data through the Reach West initiative, following the successful Scottish Go-share model. Their ambition is to incorporate 'omic analyses based on residual routine samples into an Avon-wide Digital Population Laboratory , and enhancement through the use of sensor technologies. Citizen-driven/Digital health The Digital Health Engineering research group particularly focusses on chronic health conditions, for which there is a clear imperative to develop non-intrusive technologies for capturing data on causes, symptoms and exacerbations over long periods of time, in large populations and outside clinical environments. Moving beyond the use of smartphones, they are pioneering use of Internet of Things (IoT) for health research with several studies deploying wirelessly networked devices in local homes. Exemplar projects include: - the SPHERE project has developed machine learning capability to process time-series data from off the shelf and bespoke devices, wearables, depth cameras and home appliances into health behaviour data. This capability is already the backbone of a number of Bristol-based digital trials including an initial \"100 Home\" deployment of the SPHERE sensor system. Applications will include: characterisation of the recovery of orthopaedic patients at home; and the MRC-funded CUBOiD project that is using IoT devices to examine behavioural biomarkers for disease progression related to dementia. - the EPSRC Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in a Residential Environment (SPHERE) project (\u00a315M) involving clinicians, engineers, designers, and social care professionals in developing remote sensors situated in domestic environments. - the EurValve project (\u00a34M; H2020) is using sensors to characterise outcomes of heart valve replacement. - the development and validation of an online tool that is available and as a smartphone app to predict live-birth success per treatment cycle, and determined the impact of transferring 1, 2 or 3 embryos on live births and perinatal outcomes.

Key strategic interconnections with health data research and innovation related investments at a glance: Research Councils and other ROs EPSRC; Innovate UK NHS and other government organisations England Industry Pharma: Merck, GSK, Research OrganisationGEOGRAPHIC REGION: NORTHERN IRELAND Queen's University Belfast submitted the only Statement of Interest (SoI) to become a Substantive HDR UK Site from Northern Ireland (NI) . Cross-region Strategic Activities Northern Ireland has integrated health and social care within the NHS since 1974. This provides access to a rich source of well characterised data assets that can be effectively collated and mined. A crucial component of this data ecosystem has been the successful establishment and deployment of a fully implemented Electronic Care Record (ECR). With a stable population of 1.8M, this integration makes NI a fertile environment to perform health and biomedical informatics research at the population level. The recent eHealth and Care Strategy for NI builds on the ECR's success and envisages the delivery of a fully integrated Electronic Health and Care Record system across the health and social care, providing complete and integrated patient information at point-of-care. The NI Department of Health and Social Care has a Connected Health and Prosperity Agreement with the Department for the Economy, underpinning a data-driven evidence-based strategy to enhance health and well-being of citizens through improved disease prevention and care, while also driving economic growth by enhancing competitiveness of NI industry. A Connected Health Ecosystem of healthcare, academic and business sectors has been established, focussed on addressing health and social care needs of the population. Northern Ireland 177 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation 177Queen's University Belfast Top-level insights Queen's University Belfast (QUB) capitalises on the advantage of Northern Ireland (NI) over other parts of the UK to have integrated health and social care within the NI NHS and a fully implemented Electronic Care Record (ECR). With a stable population of 1.8M, this integration makes NI a fertile environment to perform health and biomedical informatics research at the population level. In tandem, the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, located on the QUB campus, was one of the first fully digital cancer registries in the world and crucially has 100% compliance in its capture of cancer incidence and mortality data. QUB researchers undertake nationally leading and internationally competitive research in digital pathology and image analysis, and have established industry partnerships in this area. QUB has internationally-leading expertise in data security and in the design and implementation of systems for large-scale data processing and retrieval supported with an HPC environment. QUB was not part of the Farr Institute but it has an ESRC Administrative Data Research Centre (ADRC-NI). Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments and Expertise The QUB Bioinformatics Hub and the Informatics Core Technical Unit provide academic leadership and core technical support to health informatics and bioinformatics related research. QUB's Centre for Data Science and Scalable Computing (DSSC) ( Nikolopoulos ) has research expertise in the design and implementation of software and system infrastructure for large-scale data processing and retrieval (with particular expertise in programming models, large-scale distributed data retrieval software and hardware technologies) to accelerate genome mapping, sequencing analysis, and processing of mass spectrometry metabolomics data. DSSC and the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT ; \u00a330M - EPSRC, IUK and NI), which is one of UK's lead university centre for cyber security research, are building together on their world- leading expertise in data security to develop solutions employing robust cryptographic algorithms that cannot be compromised by any future computing system, including Quantum computers. The recent award of a Regius Professorship, a rare and extremely prestigious award by her Majesty the Queen, highlights QUB's international reputation in this field (see more under 'Translational and innovation capabilities'.)Northern Ireland178 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationData The Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR), located within QUB, collects, analyses and stores incidence and mortality data for all cancer patients in NI. The ESRC Administrative Data Research Centre (ADRC-NI) ( Director: Professor Dermot O'Reilly ) brings together QUB and Ulster University to provide access to de-identified administrative data routinely collected by government departments, and facilitate access to this data. Data includes: 100% census records, social security benefits data, screening, and health- related and environmental datasets. The Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) involves the tracking of 8,500 subjects (>50 years), over a 10-year period, generating a comprehensive series of datasets that capture the dynamic social and economic relationships that shape health, social and personal wellbeing and economic position as people move into and progress beyond retirement. Translational and innovation capabilities QUB's Centre for Secure Information Technologies (funded by EPSRC, Innovate UK and Invest Northern Ireland) is one of only seven UK Innovation and Knowledge Centres . These Centres are a key component of the UK's approach to the commercialisation of emerging technologies creating early stage critical mass in an area of disruptive technology. More specifically, the QUB Centre creates the security infrastructure needed to safeguard the trustworthiness of information stored electronically. As well as developing licensing deals and spin-out companies, it works closely with the entrepreneurial community to facilitate an environment that will foster innovation and entrepreneurship and ensure wider economic benefit. Industry links QUB has a \u00a33M programme with Almac Diagnostics that involves converting discovery science outputs into new biomarkers for clinical evaluation. Prognostic and predictive markers in colorectal and prostate cancer have been developed, permitting molecular stratification and development of new Pr ecision Medicine trials in Oncology. There is significant collaboration between the Bioinformatics programme within Almac Diagnostics. QUB - PHILIPS: Digital Pathology Partnership . This partnership was born out of PHILIPS's acquisition of QUB spin out PathXL and the establishment of the PHILIPS Belfast Innovation Hub. The partnership focuses around Digital Pathology for molecular diagnostic workflow and tissue analytics, but will expand to develop an open ecosystem for Digital Pathology to drive transformation of tissue imaging and diagnostics. Partnerships have been established with major hardware providers (Intel, ARM, NVIDIA, Xilinx, Micron, IBM, Seagate) mainly through EPSRC, and Horizon2020, grants exploring innovative approaches to design, implementation and programming of micro-servers and storage systems for real-time data analytics at scale. Opportunities QUB's world-leading expertise in data security to develop solutions employing robust cryptographic algorithms, and digital pathology and image analysis and integration with other data types can help catalyse HDR UK activates in these areas. The development of a fully integrated Electronic Health and Care Record system across the health and social care, providing complete and integrated patient information at point-of-care for a population of 1.8M will open a wealth of research opportunities.Northern Ireland179 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation179 The recent Strategic Review of NI-NHS ( Bengoa Report ) and the subsequent Ministerial blueprint both focus on the need for a more stratified and person-centred approach to health. QUB is working in tandem with DoH-NI to support the establishment of the Improvement Institute flagged in the Minister's report, which places enhanced data analytics at the heart of efforts to impr ove health care delivery/public health and reduce health inequalities. An identified priority in the Ministerial blueprint is improving care for people with dementia . In this regard, a recent \u00a37.4M award ( McGuinness ) will enhance data analytics infrastructure using the ECR for both discovery science and health care research for this disease. QUB's Institute for Global Food Security has a significant focus on nutrition and health. The Knowledge and Innovation Community award (\u00a3400M), secured through the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, with IGFS as a major partner, will generate an abundance of data that needs to be effectively mined in order to contribute to tackling the global challenge of nutrition, health and the feeding of the growing world population. Potential gaps QUB does not seem to have significant research activity in citizen-driven/digital health and learning health systems. Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery science QUB ( Salto-Tellez; Hamilton; James, McArt ) undertakes nationally leading and internationally competitive research in digital pathology and image analysis through the UK Digital Pathology Network (CR-UK Accelerator award \u00a33.7M), this research, brings together academic and industry partners to drive a high- throughput, biomarker discovery and validation programme. Precision Medicine QUB leads or is a major partner in two MRC Stratified Medicine Consortia : RASP-UK - Refractory Asthma Stratification Programme (\u00a34.8M; Heaney ): assessing treatment adherence using remote monitoring technologies and employing biological markers to stratify asthma patients for therapeutic intervention. S:CORT - Stratification in COloRectal Cancer Programme (\u00a35M; Lawler, Johnston, Kennedy, Salto- Tellez ): this award, which is led by the University of Oxford ( Professor Tim Maughan ), aims to develop a clinical test(s) that could be given to all colorectal cancer patients upon diagnosis to enable tailor-made treatment plans, which is guided by their individual biological make-up. In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), an innovative Science Foundation Ireland-DfE funded project (McKnight, Maxwell ) is integrating clinical, molecular and epidemiological data from >700,000 individuals to facilitate stratified medicine for CKD and deliver outcomes with economic and social impact. Additional partnerships in the precision medicine space (Waugh, Gonzalez de Castro), in particular with Almac Diagnostics ( Kennedy, Harkin ), contributing to the recent award of the Precision Medicine Catapult to Belfast as one of five UK Centres of Excellence.Northern Ireland180 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationPopulation and Public health The Centre of Excellence for Public Health (Kee) is one of five UKCRC-funded Centres in the UK. It builds on a platform of excellence in key programmatic areas including exploitation of existing health and social data, social determinants of health and disease and behaviours to promote and preserve healthy living. It hosts the Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA), which underpins a cross-disciplinary research programme and allows detailed data comparative analysis with the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and TILDA (The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing). Citizen-driven/Digital health The COMET initiative is linking Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) to the comprehensive clinical trial, epidemiological, and 'omics datasets. Disease areas QUB has research programmes on a number of disease areas with particular focus on cancer, kidney disease and asthma. Analytics A key biomedical informatics output has been PICan (Pathology Integromics in Cancer) , a data analytics platform that captures diverse information sources (epidemiological, clinical, 'omics, images (TMAs, whole tissue sections, MRI), etc.) for rapid and accurate data mining and integration. The CR-UK Accelerator award has also led to the development and release of QuPath , a key open- source framework for performing digital imaging analysis. TissueMarkTM, a software product for automated identification/annotation of tumor tissue, developed in partnership with QUB spin-out company PathXL ( Hamilton ) received the Frost and Sullivan European New Product Innovation Award for Digital Pathology. Data scientists working with ADRC-NI have advanced novel linkage methodologies to preserve privacy and confidentiality of personal information. e-Infrastructure Compute QUB have established an HPC environment ( Kelvin ; \u00a32M). The HPC cluster comprises 45 compute nodes running Linux and connected together with an InfiniBand fabric. Compute nodes range fr om 128GB to 1TB and are powered by Intel Haswell generation processors. Coupled to the HPC cluster is a 2PB usable multi-tier storage system, delivering a blend of scalable, high-performance, POSIX compatible file storage with a self-replicating object based filesystem. Kelvin currently has over 200 software applications available to users via a module files system. Training QUB offers an MSc in Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics (Blayney, MSc in Data Analytics (Marshall ), which is a new University initiative targeted specifically at building capacity in data science. A novel interdisciplinary Doctoral Training Programme (the \u00a31M Leverhulme Interdisciplinary Network on Cyber Security and Society ) supports pioneering research at the interface between social sciences, electronic engineering and computer science.Northern Ireland181 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation181 Public Involvement/Engagement The Northern Ireland Cancer Research Consumer Forum drives an agenda that emphasises the role of patients/citizens in research design and its implementation, both within NI and nationally. This Forum is embedded within S:CORT, contributing to the writing of the original grant submission, and bringing a PPI perspective to the research effort. Other activities in this space include partnerships between QUB (Lawler): - Welcome Trust Sanger Centre ( Middleton ) on the \"your-dna-your-say\" , a project exploring global attitudes around sharing genomic and clinical data) - Bonnie J Addario Foundation citizen-driven genomic data sharing project to accelerate precision healthcare.

University of Edinburgh 2. University of Glasgow 3. University of Dundee Due to time/resource constraints, this report contains information only on ROs which expressed interests in becoming HDR UK Substantive Sites. The Universities of Aberdeen, St Andrews and Strathclyde , which are based in this geographic region, had also submitted SoIs to become a Partner HDR UK but this report does not contain any information on their informatics/health data research activities. Cross-region Strategic Activities The Scottish Universities have a sustained track record of partnership working in health and biomedical informatics research. This is in collaboration with the Scottish Government and the NHS Scotland Territorial and National Boards including NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) that hosts the national datasets for 5.2M residents, dating back to 1980. Examples of large collaborative research investments in this area include: - Farr@Scotland (\u00a313.5M) - please note that all six Scottish Universities that have submitted SoIs were part of the Farr Institute in Scotland. - ADRC Scotland (\u00a38M) - This is led by the University of Edinburgh in partnership with most universities in Scotland. The Centre is co-located with Farr@Scotland , and has developed the technical and physical infrastructure including safe settings in close collaboration with Farr. - Generation Scotland (\u00a315M) is a record-linked bioresource is a unique partnership between the Scottish University Medical Schools, the NHS in Scotland and the people of Scotland, funded by the Scottish Government since 2003. Over 30,000 people from across Scotland have helped Generation Scotland create a world class biomedical resource for research into a wide variety of diseases. They did this by participating in a research study and contributing biological samples, clinical measurements and information about their health and lifestyle. Importantly, the majority have also given their permission to link to information from their medical records and to be re-contacted about participation in further research. - SHARE is a register of people (designed and hosted by the University of Dundee) interested in participating in health research and who agree to allow SHARE to use their various NHS EHR data to check whether they might be suitable for health research studies. SHARE is part of the NHS in Scotland and works in close partnership with researchers across Scotland. It currently has 147,000 (and rising) people consented for linkage of the NHS data to support direct recruitment, and includes consent to use spare blood from routine NHS testing. Scotland 183 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation 183- Innovation Centres (\u00a3120M) were launched in 2012 supported through the Scottish Funding Council and Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Of these, four are related more or less closely to Big Data: Digital Health Institute (based in Edinburgh and Glasgow); Stratified Medicine Scotland Innovation Centre (SMS-IC) (with headquarters in Glasgow); CENSIS - Sensors and Imaging Systems (based in Glasgow); and DataLab (based in Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen). The Innovation Centres have backing from industry and draw on all of Scotland's research expertise in the relevant sector to work on problems and opportunities identified by industry. They will add value through secondments, industrial studentships, spaces for collaborative work and shared access to equipment. The Centres will also support skills and training to develop the next generation of researchers and knowledge exchange practitioners through masters and post-doctoral level provision. These investments have helped create a Scottish health informatics ecosystem that is underpinned by: - a federated network of regional Trusted Research Environments (TREs)/Safe Havens located within Aberdeen (DaSH), Dundee (HIC), Edinburgh (HSRU) and Glasgow (NHS R&D); and - a national Safe Haven at National Services Scotland (eDRIS). These TREs/Safe Havens operate independently to provide advice, support and a secure environment for access to a wide range of datasets (including national datasets through to specialised local datasets, see next bullet point) but also as a federated network across Scotland working to common principles and standards whilst common processes enable the safe and secure flow of data between them. Scotland has access to a wealth of national routinely collected health data and rich longitudinal cohorts, including but not limited to the ones presented in the diagram below: Furthermore, Scotland has a 30 year track record of nationwide record linkage research, using the Community Health Index (CHI) number for a population of ~5.2M, linked to a single health system for the entire country. This unique patient identifier is the key to linking health data for research purposes from all primary health care activities, and hospital-based clinical information systems in Scotland.Death Late Life Adulthood Childhood Early Life Birth Conception Parents1939 register - occupation Neo-natal & Maternal DatabankPre & neo-natal examsHealth Visitor EducationScottish Mental Survey 1932 & 1947 - IQ Multiple sclerosis Asthma Chronic kidney disease Parkinsons Arthritis Diabetes Census - employment, household, chronic illness etc Education Hospital episodes Vital events - births, deaths and marriages Hospital Primary care Laboratory Imaging Prescribing Registration of death Social Care Data for older people Growing Up In Scotland Scottish Longitudinal StudyHealth Care DataExisting collectionsPotential data for linkage Disease Registries for:Scotland184 Key informatics investments by Research Organisation Linked data includes: nationwide prescriptions (600M since 2009); the Scottish cancer registry (1.2M records since 1958); the Scottish Morbidity Record (52.5M hospital admissions since 1980); nationwide medical imaging data (21M examinations; 2009-2017); and a deeply phenotyped national diabetes dataset (4M patient years). In 2009, Health Science Scotland was formed to facilitate collaboration and promote excellence in the field of clinical and translational medicine. This Academic Health Science Collaboration involved four medical universities -Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow- and their associated NHS Health Boards. From 2015, Health Science Scotland is part of NHS Research Scotland and brings together Government, Academia and the National Health Service, providing an operating structure that reaches across a wide range of disciplines, has access to all tiers of care, and can address virtually all of the chronic diseases that afflict developed countries. This close tripartite collaboration (Universities, NHS and Government) has spearheaded the development of health data policy, streamlining the information governance practices (single sign-off for Scottish projects; median 38 days). The Scottish Government and NHS Scotland have a national eHealth Strategy in place to support key health policy aims such as improving the quality of care, enabling shared decision-making with patients and integrating health and social care. Their vision for 2017 and beyond is person-centred and set out in the current eHealth Strategy 2014-2017 . The strategy has a significant focus on healthcare and the needs of NHS Scotland. However, it is important to note that the strategic direction in Scotland is towards the provision of integrated health and social care, and this will be reflected in the future development of eHealth. Associated with this will be a further shift in focus from the internal needs of NHS Scotland towards joint requirements with local government and third sector partners, and, in particular, the expectations and requirements of citizens and patients for electronic information and digital services. In November 2016, they also announced the development of a new, integrated Digital Health and Social Care Strategy (2017-22) . A draft of this is currently under consultation.Scotland185 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation185 University of Dundee Top-level insights The University of Dundee has a long track record in health informatics research and has spearheaded developments in this area such as the Community Health Index now used as the unique patient identifier across NHS Scotland. It hosts a wealth of health data on over 1M individuals including one of the most comprehensive longitudinal dispensed prescribing datasets in the world, and 17% of the local population is consented into a bioresource. It also drives forward national initiatives such as SHARE, which has 200,057 recruited (and rising) people consented for linkage of their NHS data to support direct recruitment and for use of residual blood samples from routine NHS testing. It also offers the ideal platform for patient engagement, including capturing patient-reported outcomes and behaviour. The University of Dundee's ambition is to support SHARE implementation widely, and they are already deploying a local version in London. The University of Dundee has developed robust systems to provide tailored and rapid data linkage and data provision in their ISO27001 and nationally accredited Safe Haven. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments The Health Informatics Centre (part of the Farr@Scotland) is a University of Dundee research support unit, within the Tayside Medical Science Centre, and works in collaboration with NHS Tayside and NHS Fife. It has over 35 staff and 15 years' experience in the secure hosting and handling of sensitive data and software development to support secure data collection. The iCIGHT Centre (informatics, Clinical Imaging, Genomics and Healthcare Technologies) is an interdisciplinary imaging research centre across four Schools (Medicine, Science and Engineering, Life Sciences, Nursing and Health Sciences) aimed to improve healthcare through computational and data analysis research. Knowledge/Expertise The University of Dundee Health Informatics Centre is recognised as a leader in health data management and linkage underpinned by secure dataflows. Managing and analysing different types of imaging data at scale is an area of particular strength. It has also substantive expertise in developing patient recruitment services such as providing aggregate figures of study feasibility and potential study recruitment from various data sources. It also has extensive knowledge in the development and evaluation of decision support tools in clinical informatics systems and their implementation within the NHS as well as a track record of development of complex interventions to improve prescribing quality and safety. Scotland186 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationData The University of Dundee hosts linked datasets for ~1M people. Its record-linked bioresource includes more than 70,000 individuals (15% of Tayside population). As part of the EMBARC project , the University of Dundee currently runs large bronchiectasis registries for multiple countries, providing both independent national registries and the ability to securely analyse the federated dataset. The University of Dundee designed and hosts the SHARE research register which has 147,000 (and rising) people consented for linkage of their NHS data to support direct contact by researchers for recruitment, and includes consent to have spare blood from routine NHS testing. The University of Dundee Health Informatics Centre is currently implementing the SHARE system on behalf of a major partner in NW London. Translational and innovation capabilities Links with industry The University of Dundee has a growing relationship with NVIDIA and plans to collaboratively deploy advanced data analytics (deep learning) within its Safe Haven. Other major industry collaborations include the Astra Zeneca Global Genomics Initiative together with other Scottish Universities and NHS trusts. Links with NHS As well as supporting interdisciplinary research within the University, the University of Dundee encourages collaboration between academics, industry and the NHS, for example through the establishment of the Academic Health Science Partnership in Tayside (AHSP) in 2014. Centred on a tripartite mission to deliver high quality clinical care, innovative healthcare education and training, and leading research and informatics, a core AHSP activity has been the development of informatics for research and innovation to drive care transformation. Opportunities The University of Dundee's vision is to further develop the SHARE research register to create a shared bioresource of between 500K and 1M Scots linked to their EHRs. The SHARE infrastructure/approach, with population consent and engagement, and consent for collection of residual blood samples, could be potentially applied across HDR UK. Potential gaps Currently, the activities of the Health Informatics Centre are not supported by substantial HPC resource to support deep-learning style big data analytics enabling discovery on large-scale data sets. However, they are trying to address this in collaboration with NVIDIA. The Centre is in the process of significantly upgrading their HPC resource over doubling the compute power, adding GPUs and storage capacity to support deep-learning style big data analytics enabling discovery on large-scale data sets. The University of Dundee does not seem to have significant activity in the area of digital health research.Scotland187 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation187 Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery Science The Computer Vision and Image Processing Group (Trucco, McKenna ), based in the Computing, School of Science & Engineering, has developed cutting-edge image analysis solutions for biomedical and assistive applications, including: histopathology, retinal imaging, MRI/CT, and video colonoscopy. The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) in the School of Life Sciences is a multi-site, collaborative effort involving both academia and industry which builds and provides open source interoperability tools for biological image data. OME applications were running in 4,603 locations and started 499,975 times in 2016. The PepTracker - Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics Database & Computational Infrastructure - provides a free to access, searchable, online database of large-scale, multi-dimensional proteomics data integrated with other large-scale 'omics and genetic data sets. Dundee maintains two Elixir-UK Resources (Jalview, and the Dundee Resource for Protein Structure Prediction and Sequence Analysis) as part of the European research infrastructure in Bioinformatics University of Dundee researchers are involved in multiple genetics consortia including DIAGRAM, MAGIC, and GLC. In addition, the Genomics Resources Consortium has selected SHARE as one of its 11 international biobanks and is working with Dundee to pilot exemplar projects. Precision medicine The University of Dundee leads the: IMI-DIRECT (DIabetes REsearCh on patient straTification) project (\u20ac46M) which aims to identify biomarkers that address current bottlenecks in diabetes drug development and develop a stratified medicines approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes; data analytical strand of the MRC Stratified Medicine Consortium MASTERMIND (\u00a36M); H2020 PREDICTION-ADR project (\u20ac6M) which aims to develop genetic risk assessment and diagnostic tools for the prediction of adverse drug reactions in two commonly prescribed drug classes that are used to manage cardiovascular risk, namely statins and ACE inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers; bioinformatics analysis in the H2020 ENSAT project (\u20ac8.4M) which aims to develop and evaluate an 'omics-based stratified health promotion programme for patients with endocrine forms of hypertension. Dundee leads the \u00a37M NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Diabetes Outcomes Research focusing on stratification and risk prediction in Diabetes in India and Scotland EPSRC project (\u00a31.1M) on identifying multi-modal retinal biomarkers for vascular dementia Population and Public health The University of Dundee has an active programme of randomized trials of different recruitment strategies embedded in the studies it supports. The Medicines Monitoring Unit (MEMO) runs large, pragmatic, randomised trials using routinely collected data for follow-up to maximise efficiency and reduce costs of clinical trials compared with traditional industry-led studies. Currently, there are ~31,000 subjects randomised in MEMO studies.Scotland188 Key informatics investments by Research Organisation The University of Dundee also manages initial recruitment from primary care and other routine data of participants in research studies (for example, recruiting ~12,000 participants in 18 months to a recent cancer screening trial). Citizen-driven/Digital health University of Dundee researchers have already created an app for SHARE participants where electronic and manually entered data is automatically integrated with data from health records, and will extend the scope of data collected in this way to include personal characteristics known to influence health, r ecovery and outcome. Learning health systems University of Dundee works on the development and evaluation of informatics and routine data-driven interventions to improve healthcare quality and safety and has multiple completed, and in progress, prescribing improvement trials involving ~60% of Scottish general practices and every community dental practice in Scotland. The University of Dundee also works closely with the NHS to co-create novel informatics tools, for example providing clinical leadership to the Infection Intelligence Platform which provides integrated information on infection across Scotland by combining risk factor, demography, healthcare activity, medicines usage and clinical data. Other collaborative work with the NHS includes implementing decision support tools within national EHR systems such as SCI-Diabetes which is a good example of system support for long term conditions. This system is used by all diabetes services across Scotland and many general practices. It provides highly specialised functionality for the care of this specific condition, and is integrated into the wider eHealth infrastructure for information exchange. The My Diabetes My Way portal extends access to patients who sign in via myaccount, and a clinical decision support rules system is integrated to provide additional intelligence. Other work in this area includes the development and evaluation of system-wide informatics interventions to improve prescribing safety and to optimise medicines use in vulnerable people with polypharmacy. Disease areas University of Dundee has research programmes in a number of disease areas with particular focus on: CVD and diabetes. Analytics University of Dundee investigators have developed techniques for the computational analysis of biological sequences and three-dimensional structures. For example, Jalview is used by >70,000 sites each year to provide easy access to data on known DNA variants with genomic DNA, RNA and protein sequences and their three-dimensional structures in an evolutionary context. The Computer Vision and Image Processing Group works closely with the University of Dundee Health Informatics Centre and its VAMPIRE retinal image analysis software was the first home-grown image analysis package to run in the Centre's Safe Haven. The Group is partnering with NVIDIA to set up large- scale, deep-learning image and data analytics in the Safe Haven.Scotland189 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation189 e-Infrastructure Compute Underpinning the Health Informatics Centre services is a HPC virtual infrastructure running on both the NHS and the University networks with 812 cores, 6.44TB memory, 895TB storage, and 201 VMs. Trusted Research Environment In the last five years, University of Dundee has invested more than \u00a31M in the Centre to develop a state of the art software suite, the Research Data Management Platform (RDMP), for the management, curation, anonymisation and rapid provision of research-ready data. The RDMP allows near real-time data provision to researchers from multiple linked data sources in an ISO27001 safe-haven environment, balancing strong information governance with rapid and efficient data provision. In the last 4 years the RDMP has been used to support over 500 projects, generating over 1300 data extracts of mainly phenotypic text based data for epidemiological research projects and clinical trials. It was the first Centre in Scotland to offer a Safe Haven, which is now Nationally Accredited. Training University of Dundee hosts the MRC DTP in Quantitative and Interdisciplinary approaches to biomedical science ( QIBIOMED ), which has Big Data as one of its four focus areas. Also, it hosts a Health Foundation Improvement Science PhD programme in evaluation of NHS improvement using longitudinal data. The UoD Masters in Public Health programme includes modules on routine health data analysis and data visualization and a module in data analytics. In 2019, the University of Dundee will introduce an MSc in Big Data and Precision Medicine . Public Involvement/Engagement In 2008, the University of Dundee developed MyDiabetesMyWay which gives patients access to their NHS health records integrated with home-recorded electronic and manually entered data such as home blood glucose measures, and uses sophisticated algorithms and data linkage to drive highly tailored self- management advice and reports. Through SHARE , the University of Dundee also provides a community platform for researchers to engage with patients and the public in research study design and service assessment, and have developed a SHARE mobile App to provide a secure and easy to use portal for participant recording of health and lifestyle data.Scotland190 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationPartnerships Key strategic interconnections with health data research and innovation related investments at a glance: Research Councils and other ROs Farr@Scotland partners include the Universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews, Strathclyde and Leicester EMBL-EBI NHS and other government organisations NHS Research Scotland Academic Health Science Partnership in Tayside General Medical Council Data providers Scottish Primary Care Research Network NHS National Services Scotland NHS Tayside, NHS Fife Industry Pharma: AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Novo Nordisk Tech: NVIDIA.

For this reason its SoI to become a substantive site of HDR UK builds upon a considerable number of health and biomedical informatics research resources already established through a number of investments including: the University of Edinburgh Medical Informatics Centre; University of Edinburgh School of Informatics; the Farr Institute; and the Administrative Data Research Centre in Scotland. These investments are underpinned by the Edinburgh Data Science, a 1,000-researcher network, spanning the University maximizing the impact of the University's compute, data and analytics environment to forge new connections between disciplines, to deepen connections with the NHS and the public sector and to accelerate industry engagement. The Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC) hosts and manages: the UK's Supercomputer ARCHER; the DiRAC Blue Gene/Q numerous smaller systems, including the EPCC Tier2 HPC, and the Edinburgh Compute Data Facility which also provides private cloud capability. Supercomputer services are available to both academic and industrial researchers. In addition to the significant HPC capability, other unique assets include a national federated network of trusted research environments (TREs) harbouring large structured and unstructured datasets of a population of 5.2M. These are supported by the development of a proportionate legal and governance framework for data sharing, embedded in health policy, allowing single ethics and privacy sign-off for Scotland. The University of Edinburgh hosts the Asthma Research UK Research Centre), which is the leading example of a disease-specific learning health system across the UK and provides a proven model to create disease-specific UK networks of multi-disciplinary research expertise. The University of Edinburgh has deep strategic partnerships with major data science technology providers and its computer science department has generated a number of start-ups/spin-outs (e.g. Edinburgh Molecular Imaging, Fios Genomics). It also has one of the largest research programmes in telehealth in the world (Telescot). This SoI has a major focus on opportunities in diverse areas of health and biomedical informatics research such as genome and imaging informatics, precision medicine, clinical trials and public engagement that could be capitalised by strengthening existing research capability and building on a wealth of existing assets available to the University of Edinburgh.

It has three core centres in: Global Health Research; Medical Informatics ; and Population Health Sciences. It also hosts: the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit ; the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy; the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships; and the Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research . The Usher Institute also includes affiliated colleagues from the NHS as well as Scottish Government, with staff based within the Farr Institute (Farr@Scotland), ADRC-Scotland, and Edinburgh Data Science . The Centre for Medical Informatics is newly established within the Usher Institute. The Centre has a unique joint leadership team which unites the fields of population health ( Sheikh ), data-intensive medicine ( Morris ) and computer science ( Robertson ). The mission of the Centre is to accelerate research into creating learning health systems and developing next-generation medicine through data-intensive informatics. The University of Edinburgh hosts Farr@Scotland (Director: Morris ) together with Dundee University. This built upon a sustained track record of partnership working and trust in health and biomedical informatics research between the Universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Strathclyde and St Andrews. The Farr@Scotland is collocated with one of the four UK-based, ESRC-funded Administrative Data Research Centres (ADRC-Scotland) , which were established to make routinely collected administrative data, including social security, tax and education records, accessible for research. In Scotland, Farr and ADRC have integrated their governance and e-infrastructure to improve efficiency (thus achieving economies of scale, avoiding duplication) and now support over 300 academic, NHS and industry projects. The University of Edinburgh is a founding partner of the Alan Turing Institute (\u00a380M; EPSRC) with Warwick, UCL, Oxford and Cambridge. In 2014 the University's priority was to establish the Edinburgh Data Science (EDS; convened by Seckl, Robertson and Morris ). This cross-campus initiative brings together the Schools of Informatics, Mathematics, and Research Institutes and Centres to create a co-ordinated 1,000 researcher network of excellence that spans across the University from health and molecular biology, to science, engineering, social sciences, ethics and law. A key strength of the University of Edinburgh is its School of Informatics (Moore ) with over 500 researchers. Other Institutes relevant to health data research include these in: Adaptive and Neural Computation; Computing Systems Architecture; Language, Cognition and Computation; and Perception, Action and Behaviour alongside the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science and Centre for Intelligent Systems & their Applications have created a powerhouse with extensive application to medicine. The Edinburgh Robotarium (centre for robotics and autonomous system facilities) is affiliated to the Usher Institute. This gives the University of Edinburgh a UK-leading capacity in robotic systems for use in hospital applications (e.g. prosthetics) or home settings (e.g. empathic systems for support of the elderly). This is complemented by the Design Informatics Centre which is a conduit to engagement with human factors specialists and product design specialists.Scotland193 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation193 The Digital Curation Centre , operated by the University of Edinburgh, is an internationally-recognised centre of expertise with a focus on building consultancy, capability, platforms, tools and skills for research data management.

Currently, it has 3,500 users accessing 118,080 cores and 28PB storage. EPCC works with the Farr Institute and the JISC Safeshare project to create a harmonised federated network of e-Infrastructure. Likewise, EPCC hosts the Scottish data platform for the Scottish hub of the ARDC. The Farr@Scotland at Edinburgh also hosts the Scottish National Safe Haven and eData Research and Innovation Service , which provides a single point of contact to assist in the completion of applications to the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel and assists researchers in study design, approvals and data access in a secure environment. Data Data assets curated at scale and managed locally include the Scottish national PACS system (image data across Scotland at petabyte scale). In addition to the Scottish national datasets mentioned previously ( see also Geographic cluster: Scotland ), the University of Edinburgh also has an agreement with NHS Lothian to host regional and operational health and social care datasets for a population of 550,000 residents for research purposes. Furthermore, the University of Edinburgh has performed WGS on 3,500 people, permitting links to the longitudinal health informatics data held in Scotland, and other consented bioresources of >150,000 individuals including the Cohort ( cancer (e.g. ovarian ), colon (Dunlop)), ( in Orkney and Shetland ( Wilson ). The University of Edinburgh generates genomics data at scale. For example, the Edinburgh Genomics facility currently sequences ~200 whole human and animal genomes per week.Scotland194 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationTranslational and innovation capabilities Links with industry The University of Edinburgh has established (MRC Proximity to Discovery; since 2014) an innovation programme in data- intensive healthcare, which placed them top in the UK for number of start-ups/spin- outs generated by a computer science department (according to SpinoutsUK). Spin-outs have included Edinburgh Molecular Imaging and Fios Genomics; and fostered two \"unicorn\" companies (exceeding $1bn value). In addition, the University of Edinburgh has deep strategic partnerships with major data science technology providers (e.g., ARM, Google, IBM, Intel, Silicon Graphics, Microsoft, Selex) and consumers (e.g., Dixons Carphone, Genus, NHS Scotland, Pfizer, RBS, Aridhia, Standard Life Investments, Thermofisher, Zoetis); and relationships with a further 120 companies. The University of Edinburgh ( Morris ) led the Scotland/AZ collaboration including: the WGS and analysis of over 800 patients with ovarian cancer ( Gourley ); and the Biogen collaboration on MS ( Chandran ), both co-ordinated through the Stratified Medicines Scotland Innovation Centre. Links with NHS The University of Edinburgh works in close partnership with NHS Scotland as evidenced by the large number of joint research programmes mentioned throughout this and other sections in this report. It is also a member of the Academic Health Science Collaboration together with three other Scottish medical universities: University of Aberdeen, University of Dundee and University Glasgow; and their associated NHS Health Boards. Opportunities By strengthening existing research capability and building on a wealth of existing assets, the University of Edinburgh has the potential to capitalise on opportunities that include: Exploiting advances in sequencing technology hosted by Edinburgh Genomics, including the Illumina X-10, Oxford Nanopore portable sequencing and the Illumina NovaSeq architecture, anticipated to enable the $100-genome, to initiate a step change in the linkage of genomic/biological information and clinical data to develop medically relevant data infrastructures. Building on the nationwide diabetes programme ( Colhoun, Morris ), to create national deeply phenotyped cohorts and to expand to other chronic diseases. In cancer for example, work bring different stakeholders together with the Innovative Healthcare Delivery programme (\u00a33M; Keel, Cameron, Morris ) to develop a Cancer Intelligence Framework for the 220K people estimated to be living with cancer in Scotland providing near real-time tracking of every cancer case in Scotland from referral to assessment, molecular diagnosis and outcome. The same approach could be rolled out to other disease areas. Working on the challenging problems from health systems together with NHS Scotland and NHS Lothian to reconstruct consistent patient records across multiple media using machine learning, NLP and cognitive computing from actionable medical data in patient records that has little/no formal structure and is a mixture of text and images Creating a nationwide analytical platform for pharmacovigillence and phase IV \"real world evidence\" studies through the existing Scotland-wide partnerships.Scotland195 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation195 Addressing intelligent management, annotation and interpretation of biomedical images and applying their expertise in machine learning to provide a comprehensive and integrative approach to associate imaging data with other molecular and clinical data types. For example, develop deep learning platforms for automatically analysing large radiological imaging archives such as the 21M examination Scottish radiology archive. This would define and validate imaging biomarkers for cerebrovascular disease, dementia and other chronic diseases ( Wardlaw, Salman, Laurie ) or the >178,000 serial annual retinal images from people with diabetes to optimise the retinal screening programme and for predicting other vascular outcomes ( Colhoun, McKeigue, Storkey ). Building on the work of the Farr Institute to scale the proportionate governance and multi-strand public engagement work across the four nations and developing a viable social contract ( Laurie, Cunningham-Burley ). Working with the Alan Turing Institute, and other niche expertise in academia, NHS and industry to address key research challenges that mitigate against large-scale \"big data\" health research, challenges such as: automate data sharing; large scale social computation systems; real-time query language for exascale, federated genotype/phenotype data Potential gaps The University of Edinburgh has limited research activity in citizen-driven/digital health except for telehealth. Other relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery Science Edinburgh Genomics (Aitman ) is a world leading genomics and bioinformatics facility delivering high volume genomics data and cutting-edge analyses to a large community of collaborators and customers across academia, government, and industry.

In clinical imaging the Edinburgh Imaging consortium provides an umbrella for a broad range of activities (Brain Research Imaging Centre, Clinical Research Imaging Centre, retinal imaging and pre-clinical imaging facilities).Scotland196 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationPrecision medicine The Scottish Genome Partnership programme (\u00a36M; MRC/CSO) is a major Scotland-wide research programme between the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen, NHS Scotland and NHS Lothian, & Clyde, NHS Tayside and NHS Grampian. The research, which includes collaboration with Genomics England. The Edinburgh-St Andrews Molecular Pathology Node (Aitman ) (\u00a32M; MRC-EPSRC) will bring molecular diagnostics into mainstream medicine by use of modern genome technologies and information across a range of diseases. The consortium will integrate state-of-the-art genomic and epigenomic methods for diagnosis of acutely ill children and will develop 'liquid biopsies' for managing cancer through analysis of circulating tumour DNA. Population and Public health The Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit embraces data science to transform the approach to Phase 2-4 clinical trials by supporting the design of intelligent trials using EHRs, by consolidating activities that use routinely collected data for RCTs, including cluster RCTs, and drug safety. Citizen-driven/Digital health The University of Edinburgh has one of the largest research programmes in telehealth in the world (McKinstry ). The Telescot programme (\u00a314.6M since 2008) has conducted several large influential RCTs and many descriptive and qualitative studies in this area. These studies include telemonitoring of chronic obstructive airways disease, heart failure, high blood pressure and diabetes. Other studies of interest include: satellite location for wandering people with dementia, the use of gamification to encourage children and adolescents to adopt healthier lifestyles, developing artificially intelligent avatar based systems for monitoring depression, robotic dispensing and remote measurement of cough and respiratory rate. Its current research efforts focus on the use of machine learning on patient accrued data to develop improved telemonitoring algorithms, video-consulting and the large-scale implementation of telehealth with Scale-Up BP . This project is set to change how general practitioners deliver blood pressure management thousands of people in Scotland. The University of Edinburgh has engaged in all the relevant Scottish Innovation Centres (DataLab, Stratified Medicine, Digital Healthcare, Sensors). Learning health systems The University of Edinburgh hosts the Asthma Research UK Research Centre (\u00a35M; Sheikh; Griffiths QMUL ), which is the leading example of a disease-specific learning health system across the UK.

In addition to precision medicine, the University of Glasgow researchers have a long track record in the development of innovative methodology for clinical trials and in particular, changing the approach to clinical trial/study participant follow-up. Data The Glasgow Safe Haven currently contains 40 datasets with more planned. Around half are national datasets and half are specific to the West of Scotland including deeply phenotyped disease registries (rheumatology, Parkinson's, psychosis and cancer); intervention databases (weight management programmes and cardiovascular primary prevention programmes); and social care data on vulnerable groups. A full list of data resources available to UoG is provided in their SoI's Annex C. The Glasgow Biorepository is a joint academic-NHS venture. The NHS obtains electronic consent from patients for the storage of surplus clinical (blood and tissue samples). These are linked to phenotypic data in the Glasgow Safe Haven enabling selection of appropriate samples for research.Scotland200 Key informatics investments by Research Organisation The Scottish Veteran Cohort Study is a virtual cohort derived entirely from routinely collected health data. Primary care records were used to identify every Scottish resident who had entered and left military service. The 57,000 veterans, and a matched comparison group of 171,000 non-veterans, were linked to their acute and psychiatric hospital admissions, cancer registrations and death records to provide comprehensive follow-up data. Glasgow local authority partners have contributed several social care databases in the Glasgow Safe Haven for linkage to health datasets. Through a partnership with the Department of Education they have achieved the first Scotland-wide linkage of health and education data. The Centre for Research on Environment Society and Health is a virtual centre across Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities. The Centre uses linkage of health, environmental and social data to identify harmful and positive influences on health, with a particular focus on the natural and built envir onment. It has access to the Urban Big Data Centre that brings together urban social scientists, data scientists and statisticians to undertake cutting-edge research using data on the urban environment whilst the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit is currently developing a longitudinal environmental dataset that can be linked to existing longitudinal health data.

Cross-region Strategic Activities The Government's agenda for this region The UK and Welsh Government are investing over \u00a32B in two City-region deals in Swansea and Cardiff, that over the next 20 years, and will see the generation over 35,000 new jobs. The Cardiff Capital Region Deal brings \u00a31.2B and will see \u00a3495M invested including the creation of an \"innovation district\", as well as supporting projects around data innovation, software development and cyber security. The biggest ever UK and Welsh Government investment for south west Wales (\u00a31.3B) has been secured following the approval of the Swansea Bay City Deal that will transform the economic landscape of the area, boost the local economy by \u00a31.8B, and generate almost 10,000 new jobs over the next 15 years. Eleven major projects will get underway, delivering world-class facilities in the fields of energy, smart manufacturing, innovation and life science, with major investment in the region's digital infrastructure and workforce skills and talent underpinning each. Region-wide health and biomedical informatics activities In their Informed Health and Care Strategy the Welsh Government sets out its desire for health and care workers to have the digital tools and access to information they need to coordinate and deliver care, and for individuals to be empowered to play an active role in decisions about their own health and wellbeing through access to their own health and care information. The Taking Wales Forward , the Welsh Government's 2016-2021 strategy places a focus on putting health at the heart of everything they do and includes their ambition to exploit digital technologies to help speed up the diagnosis of illness. This includes making better use of data including improving data collection and quality; developing a more transparent framework for how it is managed and shared; and developing the skills and resources to realise its full value. As part of the Government's Swansea Bay City Deal, the ARCH consortium (a Regional Collaboration for Health ) plans to enable an enhanced multi-sectoral data linkage on a population of 1M in South West Wales. This will drive the case for change in modernising health services, including the development and evaluation of a Wellbeing Programme. The ARCH partners are working together to further enhance the reputation of South West Wales, and indeed the whole of Wales, as a centre of excellence in service delivery, research, education and innovation in terms of healthcare and life sciences. Wales 205 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation 205 The 'Shaping our future wellbeing strategy 2015-2025' which is Cardiff and Vale University Health Board's vision of care over 10 years. The health board is working in partnership with Cardiff University, the City of Cardiff Council and the Vale of Glamorgan Council as the Health Enterprise Alliance for Regional Transformation (HEART), creating an ambitious vision for innovation, integration and citizen focused health and wellbeing in the region. Both the University of Cardiff and Swansea have access to considerable e-infrastructure spanning HPC and cloud computing through their membership in two consortia: Supercomputing Wales (SPW) and MRC Medical Bioinformatics CLIMB that provide researchers from across UK academia with access to computational infrastructure. All systems are co-located in the Redwood Data Center, and processes and policies are either already in place or in development for data transfer between systems. With regards to SPW and CLIMB, Cardiff provide the technical leadership for both projects, and is also the regional lead for CLIMB. The Supercomputing Wales (SPW) consortium is five-year programme (2017-2022) is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (\u00a39M) through the Welsh Government. This pan-Wales distributed supercomputing network is one of the largest in the UK - with eight sites across the country based on a hub and spoke model with hubs in Swansea and Cardiff - and allows companies and academics to access its 17,000 processor cores remotely. With the support of peak processing performance of almost 320 TFlops, businesses and academics can use the technology to power breakthroughs in product, process or service development; strengthening their market position. The project has been designed to support the public and private sector to deliver world-class projects in collaboration, removing the barriers to innovation and delivering sustainable economic growth and job creation. The All Wales Medical Genetics Service (AWMGS) is Wales' nationwide service for providing specialist genetic services for rare genetic conditions and cancers. It provides consultant led clinics for rare inherited disorders in hospitals in all health boards and also provides specialist and multidisciplinary clinics at University Hospitals, including for specific disorders/groups of disorders in which Welsh researchers have major interests. Specialising in healthcare service delivery, AWMGS also works closely with academic preclinical research through partnership with Wales Gene Park with which it shares next generation sequencing facilities. As part of Welsh Government's Genomics for Precision Medicine Strategy (>\u00a36 million) AWMGS is currently expanding its laboratory and bioinformatics workforce, sequencing and IT infrastructure, the latter through collaboration with Wales Gene Park, Cardiff University, and Supercomputing Wales. The Welsh Government 'Genomics for Precision Medicine strategy' was launched in July 2017, which saw the formation of two dedicated units - the Pathogen Genomics Unit within Public Health Wales NHS Trust and The All Wales Genetics Service within Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust - which will provide clinical genomics services for the whole of Wales. These activities are overseen by a national Genomics Taskforce, and underpinned by multi-million pound investment by Welsh Government. Both of these units are closely coupled to Cardiff University, and are principally based at the University Hospital of Wales site, alongside Cardiff University's School of Medicine. In both cases, the genomics work undertaken within the NHS is increasingly underpinned by computational resources at Cardiff University, to provide value for money and create opportunities for NHS data sharing and reuse. Wales206 Key informatics investments by Research Organisation Wales Genomics Medicine Centre (GMC) - The Wales Genomics Medicine Centre (GMC) is Wales contribution to Genomics England's 100,000 Genomes Project.

The Wales GMC is being delivered by the All Wales Medical Genetics Services (AWMGS, hosted by Cardiff & Vale UHB), and financially supported by Cardiff University, through MRC funding, in collaboration with the Wales Gene Park and the Welsh Government. The partnership is an important opportunity for patients to access potential clinical benefits via the 100,000 Genomes Project, and for Wales to contribute to the Project's research and other aims around health system transformation. As part of the MRC award, the Genetic Data Integration (GeDI) scoping study has been established by the Wales GMC with partners, the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) Databank, to study the data governance issues around integrating genetic data with health-related records for research. Wales207 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation207 Cardiff University Top-level insights Cardiff University's strengths in health data science focus on genetics/genomics and population research, but currently its activities in this area have expanded to include imaging and metabolomics/ lipidomics. Its strong partnerships with NHS across Wales (population of 3.5M) and other government departments has enabled Cardiff University to link: research data to routinely collected health and social care data creating unique data assets; and provide a test-bed for the delivery of informatics-driven improvements to clinical services and public health interventions. Its research strengths are underpinned by investments over the past 10 years in HPC facilities, with further multi-million pound investments due to come during 2017-18 as part of Supercomputing Wales and GW4 Tier-2 HPC Centre developments. Cardiff University is one of the Farr@CIPHER partners with main contributions on the analysis of the social, environmental and biological determinants of health, development and education outcomes during childhood, and epidemiology of infections. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments Cardiff University's Data Innovation Research Institute (\u00a32M; University investment) has been set up to conduct fundamental research into the aspects of managing, analysing and interpreting massive volumes of textual and numerical information. In the biological and life sciences, the Institute's research predominantly focuses on tackling some key challenges including: extracting information from data sets without compromising privacy and confidentiality; interpreting large data sets into reliable and understandable mathematical models; genome mapping; MRI scanning; drug trialling; maintaining public health records; and modelling protein structures. As part of the MRC Medical Bioinformatics investment into the Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB; \u00a38.5M), Cardiff is one of four distributed sites (Warwick, Birmingham, Swansea and Cardiff) and has provided the technical leadership for the national system, as well as acting as the regional lead for CLIMB in Wales. CLIMB provides infrastructure based on OpenStack, with a variety of virtual server infrastructure provided to the research community. In addition to providing traditional data storage and compute infrastructure, this provides a large geo-replicated object store both to support longer-term storage and to underpin collaboration. The project is working on the automated provisioning of genomic software and pipelines to assist the microbial genomics community. CLIMB currently supports over 1,000 microbiological researchers across the UK (see also section 2.1.2) . Cardiff University has announced the establishment of a Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Analytics that will be located at the School of Computer Science and Informatics and will be the first centre of its kind in Europe. Together with experts from Airbus, researchers will carry out world-leading studies into machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence for cyber-attack detection. This research will aim to protect corporate IT networks, intellectual property, and critical national infrastructure and attempt to fill the skills gap that currently exists in the field.Wales208 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationKnowledge/Expertise Cardiff University has long-standing know-how in large-scale epidemiological studies using record-linked health and education data underpinned by appropriate data governance frameworks. There are also data governance and cybersecurity expertise within Computer Science and the School of Law including over a decade of experience of working with the NHS to enable data sharing between the NHS and University (including the provision of physical infrastructure for secure data transfer, systems design to enable data to be moved in/out of the NHS network, and policy development to support these activities and ensure they meet NHS governance requirements). Cardiff University has expertise gained in designing and providing the technical leadership of national e-infrastructures (Supercomputing Wales and (MRC CLIMB)); and for analysing biological data using cloud computing. Data Cardiff is leading HealthWise Wales , Health and Care Research Wales' flagship national population cohort study that will provide the platform for precision medicine research via a well-characterised study population with longitudinal follow-up data and record-linkage to routinely available healthcare data. This project is on track to recruit 260,000 adults age 16 years or above by 2020, with planned enhancements for bio- sampling, cognitive assessments and recruitment of children and families, that will enable the investigation and follow-up of younger cohorts (not currently available through other population cohorts such as UK Biobank/Million Women Study) to inform strategies for the prevention of non-communicable diseases. The Centre for Trials Research has established frameworks for linking trial datasets with routine data held by NHS, Departments of Health (e.g. abortions data) and Education (e.g. National Pupil Database. Furthermore, it has over 75 current active studies that include more than 20 thousand people with associated clinical samples deposited into Biobank Wales . The Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC) is amongst the largest in Europe and hosts the National Facility for Microstructural Imaging. In addition, it collects medical imaging data and linked to genetic data. The MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics has access to very large genomic datasets of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (over 70,000 exome sequences, along with genome-wide association data on over 100,000 individuals) together with detailed phenotypic data. The National Centre for Mental Health is a Wales-wide initiative linking genetic and detailed phenotypic data from individuals with mental health disorders with routinely collected health data via the SAIL Databank, with the potential to yield genetically and clinically meaningful categorisations that go beyond traditional diagnostic criteria. The ERC/Wellcome Trust funded Cardiff Lipidomic Group hosts LIPID MAPS (\u00a31.4M), a global online database with lipidomics/metabolomics mass spectrometry data.Wales209 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation209 Compute Cardiff University has considerable e-infrastructure spanning HPC and cloud computing. In addition to local infrastructure, CU is a member of three consortia: MRC CLIMB; Supercomputing Wales, and GW4 Tier-2 HPC Centre that provide researchers from across UK academia with access to computational infrastructure hosted at Cardiff. All systems are co-located in the Redwood Datacenter, and processes and policies are either already in place or in development for data transfer between systems. The GW4 Alliance , brings together four of universities in the south west of the UK; the universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter. Together with Cray Inc. and the Met Office, GW4 Alliance has been awarded \u00a33M by EPSRC to be installed in 2017 and deliver a new Tier 2 HPC service for UK-based scientists. The system will be one of the world's first to be based on Broadcom's Vulcan server-class chip. Details of this device are still under NDA, but the Vulcan CPU is generating excitement because it trades off much greater provision of memory bandwidth for less emphasis on peak FLOP/s, the former being more important for most scientific codes. Providing access to such a machine as a national service should therefore enable the UK's HPC community to quantify the benefit of memory bandwidth focused CPUs, thus informing future system procurements from Tier 1 to Tier 3. Translational and innovation capabilities Links with NHS Cardiff is leading on the newly established Wales Genomic Medicine Centre (a collaboration between Cardiff University, NHS Trusts, and SAIL Databank (\u00a31M MRC) to work with Genomics England. The Cardiff and Vale University Health Board hosts the NHS All Wales Medical Genetics service and benefits from a close liaison with medical genetics research laboratories at Cardiff University due to co- location with the Welsh Government funded Wales Gene Park Genomic Facility . Cardiff University provides the bioinformatics leadership for the newly established Pathogen Genomics Unit within Public Health Wales NHS Trust (with \u00a31.2M Welsh Government funding), which will be providing Pathogen genomics diagnostics and epidemiological surveillance for the whole of Wales. Opportunities The combination of CU's health data assets and strong computational infrastructure together with the opportunities offered by the NHS in Wales to deploy approaches across a healthcare system at a national scale provides a great opportunity to utilise Wales' population of 3.5M and devolved healthcare system as test-bed for health data research. Potential gaps Cardiff University does not seem to be leading on any important research programmes in citizen-driven/ digital health and learning health systems. It also does not seem to have strong collaborations with the health data/technology industry.Wales210 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationOther relevant capabilities Research themes Discovery Science The Cardiff University-led Wales Gene Park (\u00a32.5M Welsh Government) takes advantage of the available HPC facilities to advance its cutting-edge research that provides understanding, diagnosis and treatment of a wide-range of inherited diseases and cancer. Furthermore, it has independent computational resources along with sequencing capacity, and is aligned with the NHS All Wales Medical Genetics Service . The Cardiff Lipidomic Group uses mass spectrometry to discover new lipid mediators of innate immunity and inflammation. In addition, they have also received European Research Council funding (\u20ac2.9M, 2014-2019) for developing a high-resolution method termed LipidArrays that will enable the diversity and number of lipids in biological samples to be characterized. They are particularly focusing on cell development, cardiovascular disease and dementia in this study. Precision medicine In neuroscience and mental health, Cardiff University researchers are integrating genetic data with 'omics data (expression, protein, epigenetic, regulatory) in an efficient manner to uncover the biological pathways underlying phenotypically complex disorders. They are also linking detailed phenotypic data to genomics data in order to identify novel, genetically homogeneous patient strata (cutting across diagnostic criteria), and to discover how the relevant biological pathways interact with environmental factors (diet, smoking etc.) in these strata to influence health, thereby leading to drugs and/or interventions. Large projects at planning stage include analysis of samples from the paediatric neonatal MRC RHiNO cohort and HealthWise Wales , to address the role of metabolites and lipids in causing or contributing to disease processes, how to use their detailed profile, e.g. measuring thousands simultaneously in plasma or tissue (which will change dynamically unlike our genome) for diagnosis and patient stratification, for monitoring treatment success and outcome, and how much of our metabolome/lipidome is heritable vs environmentally controlled. Population and Public health The Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement (DECIPHer ) is a UKCRC Public Health Research Centre of Excellence. It is a Cardiff University-led (Professor Simon Murphy) strategic partnership with the University of Bristol (Professor Rona Campbell) and Swansea University (Professor Ronan Lyons). DECIPHer includes research programmes on data linkage and natural experiments which are led by Professor Ronan Lyons at Swansea University, and works closely with the Farr@CIPHER. The Centre for Trials Research (also mentioned in a previous section) designs and delivers multi centre studies across the UK and beyond. Disease areas Cardiff University's research mainly focuses on: mental health; neuroscience; infection, immunity and inflammation; cancer; and population health. Wales211 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation211 Analytics Cardiff University researchers have developed methods to: - integrate genetic data with multiple 'omics data across neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders; - analyse bacterial genomic data, risk models for population health risk factors, and informatics approaches to enable data and software sharing, standardisation and reuse through MRC CLIMB; and - process massive lipidomic/metabolomics datasets. Collectively these activities are focused on delivering tools that can be accredited and adopted into NHS service. Within the Division of Population Medicine , biostatistics methodology is focussed on the highly- interconnected areas of longitudinal data analysis, missing data and causal inference for a fuller, deeper and more insightful assessment of the assumptions underlying the most commonly used biostatistical techniques, as applied to the epidemiological analysis of large-scale record-linked health and education datasets. e-Infrastructure Compute Cardiff University has a computational infrastructure that comprises over 16,000 processing cores, more than 77TB of total RAM and over 3PB of total data storage. They are currently in the process of procuring >\u00a33M of hardware to update and renew their HPC systems, to carry them through into the 2020s. Cardiff University researchers have access to the Supercomputing Wales infrastructure, which provides around 17,000 cores across eight sites based on a hub and spoke model with hubs in Swansea and Cardiff. The Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB) includes a distributed four-site computing system capable of supporting over 1,000 virtual bioinformatics servers. This system consists of hardware with 7,680 cores, 2,304 TB of cross-site replicated storage and 78TB of RAM. Through its GW4 Alliance membership, CU will have access to a new (to be installed in 2017) Tier 2 HPC service for UK-based scientists. The system will be one of the world' s first to be based on Broadcom's Vulcan server-class chip. Training Opportunities for skill development are available through Cardiff University's existing and planned training programmes including: undergraduate and postgraduate teaching modules covering bioinformatics, statistics and programming; a research methods consultancy service for the NHS and social care in SE Wales; training in the use of the supercomputing facility; and MSc in Bioinformatics ; and MSc in Bioinformatics and Genetic Epidemiology . Furthermore, curriculums have been designed to enable the teaching of module elements to meet continuing professional development and training needs.Wales212 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationPublic Involvement/Engagement The Centre for Trials research is experienced in undertaking public involvement and engagement activities relating to the retention and use of data. Partnerships Key strategic interconnections with health data research and innovation related investments at a glance: Research Councils and other ROs Farr@CIPHER (led and based in Swansea University) - award partners include the Universities of: Cardiff, Bristol, Brighton, Oxford, Exeter and Surrey, Western Australia, Monash, Ottawa; and the Welsh Government; and the Finnish National Public Health. Supercomputing Wales consortium (hubs at Cardiff and Swansea Universities) GW4 Alliance University partners: Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter MRC Medical Bioinformatics CLIMB - encompasses the following partners - University of Warwick, Cardiff University, Swansea University, University of Birmingham, University of Bath, University of Leicester and The Quadram Institute (a BBSRC research institute) UK Biobank collaboration NHS and other government organisations Genomics England - leading on the Wales Genomic Medicine Centre Public Health Wales; Cardiff and Vale NHS trust and other NHS Trusts across Wales.Wales213 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation213 Swansea University Top-level insights Swansea University has an established international reputation as a leading centre in the field of health informatics, built upon substantial developments over a long period of time and a large network of collaborations. It is this track record that Swansea University's SoI is based on; including, the activities of the Farr@CIPHER (Swansea) and those of other aligned investments in Wales including: the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank; the UK Secure e-Research Platform (UKSeRP) and its sister technology National Research Data Appliance; ADRC-Wales and the MQ Adolescent Mental Health/ MRC Mental Health Data Pathfinder initiatives. Its main strengths are in: 1. combining health and administrative data at scale and from a variety of sources to increase understanding of population health and social well-being that will have an impact on policy and practice; 2. creating innovative solutions to problems in accessing data, privacy protection, linkage, analysis, interoperability and researcher access; 3. developing data sharing and analysis platforms. Swansea University's considerable expertise in handling and using routine data comes through 10 years' experience in the development of the SAIL Databank and its expansion to support multiple national initiatives, mainly through the UKSeRP . UKSeRP is a modularised platform able to provide anything from a desktop environment to full supercomputing facilities with a wide range of analytical tools on board. Hence, it has brought scalability and reduced the complexity and risks of providing IT infrastructure and analytical support for a number of national research initiatives, achieved through using spare capacity of established proven systems. Swansea University has strong links and data sharing agreements for access to anonymised person- based health and social care data for research with multiple ministries in the Welsh Government; all ten health boards and trusts; 80% of general practices; plus a growing number of third sector organisations. The SAIL Databank provides secure access to billions of this data about the population of Wales. This has positioned Wales as amongst the deepest phenotyped nations, supporting some of the largest scale UK observational and interventional research in this field. Swansea University training courses in informatics include: the first MSc in Health Data Science; and the sole internationally respected Introduction/ Advanced Analysis of Linked Health Data courses in the UK. Strengths, Capabilities and Opportunities Strengths Informatics Investments Swansea University has a long track record of investments in health informatics that include the development of: the Welsh Health Information Research Unit in 2006; and the subsequent creation of the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank , which in turn underpinned the successful awards in the Farr@CIPHER (Director: Professor Ronan Lyons ); and ADRC-Wales (Director: Professor David Ford ). These investments, together with closely associated research groups, the NHS and industry, are housed at the Data Science Building - a six floor 3,000 m2 purposely designed secure data facility, funded by an \u00a38M investment from MRC, ESRC and the Welsh Government - which opened in 2016 with a lifespan of at least 25 years. Wales214 Key informatics investments by Research Organisation The SAIL Databank is managed by the Health Informatics Group, which is part of the Patient and Population Health Informatics research theme of the Institute of Life Sciences, Swansea University Medical School. SAIL is a valuable and unique National Data Repository which already supports a wide variety of e-health research and evaluation projects, and which is increasingly becoming recognised as a valuable resource for healthcare policy making, service planning and evaluation ( see also data section ). Backed and endorsed by the Welsh Government, the SAIL Databank receives core funding from the Welsh Government's Health and Care Research Wales. The current SAIL has secured renewal funding to 2020. As part of the MRC Medical Bioinformatics investment into the Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB; \u00a38.5M), Swansea is one of four distributed sites (Warwick, Birmingham, Swansea and Cardiff). It provides infrastructure based on OpenStack, with a variety of virtual server infrastructure provided to the research community. In addition to providing traditional data storage and compute infrastructure, this provides a large geo-replicated object store both to support longer-term storage and to underpin collaboration. The project is working on the automated provisioning of genomic software and pipelines to assist the microbial genomics community. CLIMB currently supports over 1,000 microbiological researchers across the UK ( see also section 2.1.2 ) Swansea University has a strategy of continuing investments in internationally-leading interdisciplinary research that include: the new Computational Foundry (\u00a331M - opening in 2018); the Academy for Advanced Computing ; and investments in medical engineering through the Zienkiewicz Centre for Computational Engineering and the joint Engineering/Medicine Centre for NanoHealth . Knowledge/Expertise There is a variety of backgrounds and expertise, including: epidemiology, statistics, health service research, public health science, clinicians (multiple specialties), geography, demography, social science, economics, law, information governance, public engagement, genetics, bioscience, computer science, mathematics, and physics. With ten years' experience operating the SAIL Databank, SU researchers have developed an extensive knowledge on how to build, implement and operate industrially-scaled socio- technical data platforms. The Swansea University-led ( Jones ) Information Governance projects are: - the GeDI project - on incorporating genetic data into data safe havens; - the MORPHeD project - on the use of integrated smartphone and health data; and - the ACoRN project - on scoping barriers and drivers to cross-centre research. Data Backed and endorsed by the Welsh Government, the SAIL Databank receives core funding from the Welsh Government's Health and Care Research Wales. Currently, there are 50 (if include the GP practices) routine and 115 project-specific data flows involving all data modalities, with over 19B recordings on 5.1M living and dead individuals, making Wales among the most deeply phenotyped regions of the UK. SAIL Databank is increasing its holdings in health determinants and outcomes data with sharing agreements in place with organisations such as South Wales Police, the National Offenders Management Service, local government social services and housing departments and many more. The Wales Electronic Cohort for Children (WECC) ( Lyons lead investigator) is the first and largest (>1,000,000) complete child cohort in the UK, aimed at investigating the widest possible range of social and environmental determinants of child health and social outcomes by exploiting the potential of routinely collected datasets.Wales215 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation215 Compute The Academy for Advanced Computing supports researchers across the University in exploiting HPC technology available through the HPC Wales supercomputing infrastructure. Translational and innovation capabilities Links with NHS The Prudent Healthcare Intelligence Hub , based at SU but working across the whole of the Welsh NHS, delivers analytical services to support the direct needs of healthcare organisations and policymakers by undertaking high impact analyses and evaluations. With involvement of staff from across the Welsh NHS, this cooperative model, underpinned by Farr Institute infrastructure and SAIL Databank data, is proving a highly efficient means of gaining real impacts into society, as well as building capacity and capability in the NHS. In the first year of operation, nine projects have been developed with Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Aneurin Bevan, Hywel Dda and Cwm Taf University Health Boards, the Welsh Ambulance Service and Public Health Wales NHS Trusts. These projects cover a wide range of activities and diseases areas including physical activity, injuries, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. Opportunities There is enthusiasm for engagement in citizen-driven health research from each of the applied clinical research groups. For example, the Asthma UK CAR team is particularly interested in capturing data from smart inhalers, wearables (including biological sensors) and mobile apps. The UK MS Register web portal collects PROMs data from 15,000 participants and plans to add complete actigraph data dumps from mobile phones to assess utility. Swansea/Wales is an attractive test-bed site, as wearable technology develops, given the available operational data sharing platforms. Furthermore, the Chancellor supported the Swansea Bay City Regional Deal (\u00a31.3B) in the 2016 Budget. This envisages the development of 'The Internet Coast' with a new transatlantic fibre-optic cable from New York to Oxwich (Swansea) and next generation wireless (5G) supporting the 'Internet of Energy (Tidal Lagoon) and 'The Internet of Health and Wellbeing' , providing a major boost for data intensive research opportunities. Swansea University is a core member of the ARCH partnership ( a Regional Collaboration for Health ) to enable an enhanced multi-sectoral data linkage on a population of 1M in South West Wales being used to drive the case for change in modernising health services, including the development and evaluation of a Wellbeing Programme. These unique ambitions will be enhanced by a coherent, investor-attractive digital economy developed through the Swansea Bay City Deal programme. Building on these developments, SU has plans for collaboration with Manchester and other universities on the Connected Health Cities and regions agenda. Potential gaps Swansea University has modest expertise in advanced health data analytics; and has started to form links with health data/technology industry.Wales216 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationOther relevant capabilities Research themes Swansea University has niche, but growing, focused areas of expertise in discovery science and precision medicine with Swansea University researchers involved in several multi-national multi-omics data linkage studies. Discovery Science Swansea University is involved in active collaborations focussed on epi-genome association studies including: - asthma and allergy with Imperial - epilepsy and brain disorders with the NIH Epi4K Exome Consortium - NIH Epi25 Consortium with the Broad Institute - Wellcome Trust Synapotopathy Consortium with UCL - BioJume Consortium with KCL - the EpiGen Global Consortia with Oxford, Dublin and UCL. Precision medicine In the Centre for NanoHealth investigators are engaged in research involving semi-conductor processing, biosensor technologies, microfluidics and microneedles. This includes the development of generic epitaxial graphene biosensors for ultrasensitive detection of cancer risk biomarkers, point of care testing for oxidative stress, cardiac markers and hormones using packaged silicon devices and electrochemical chip designs. Researchers from the Zienkiewicz Centre for Computational Engineering are involved in a broad range of medical research focussing on cardiovascular and respiratory flow modelling and the development of pulse wave screening devices for aortic aneurysms in collaboration with a major automotive engineering company. Population and Public health Patient & Population Health and Informatics is one of four main research themes in Swansea University Medical School. Furthermore, it links Farr@CIPHER, ADRC-Wales and National Centre for Population Health and Wellbeing Research (NCPHWR) structures and personnel and embeds methodological developments in accessing, interpreting and analysing data around focussed health questions. Research spans the entire range of study designs from the creation of population based cohorts (focussed on demographic subgroups, diseases and injuries, and settings, such as children, housing, schools, or criminal justice), hybrid cohorts (embedded traditional cohorts within larger population e-cohorts), exploiting the UK's rich cohorts, measurement of population burden of disorders, evaluations of natural experiments and routine data enhanced individual/cluster randomised controlled trials. Swansea University has developed a clinical trials module (RITREVA) which swiftly and reliably produces ranked lists of patients eligible for trials, massively speeding up recruitment processes. Welsh Government is currently considering a proposal to rollout this proven prototype across Wales to produce a national trial recruitment platform. Disease areas Swansea University has research programmes on a number of disease areas with particular focus on: injury, environmental exposures, substance use, mental health, infection and child health, as well as the traditional major chronic diseases.Wales217 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation217 Analytics There are active collaborations with several consortia on remote access to multi-modal data and development of new analytical methods, e.g. time-varying confounding in longitudinally linked data (UCL), multi- omics/phenome analyses (Imperial, Cambridge) and image analysis (Oxfor d, UCL). Leading edge probabilistic and deterministic linkage allows multiple data sources to be linked together, and the process to be tailored based on the quality of achievable linkage. Swansea University has growing capability in natural language processing (NLP). As well as supporting and making available leading open-source tools, Swansea University has invested in three main products: - IBM Content Analytics / IBM WATSON - a large scale data centre infrastructural deployment bringing in IBM latest content management systems to feed the WATSON Content Analytics system. This system provides an end-to-end ingestion and analysis platform for performing analysis on unstructured information. - Free-text to SNOWMED-CT3 engine - embedded in a number of NRDA systems this engine will allow for the conversion of text, office documents and PDFs into HL7 messages to ingest, convert and annotate source documents with SNOWMED-CT3 terms. The system also then has the ability to query this dataset and, using a rules-based engine, derive new variables which can form a traditional dataset for onward transmission. - GATE has been installed in version 2 of the National Research Data Appliances to create a pipeline for derived deep phenotypic data from NHS text based source documents to be added to SAIL Oxford University has located the DPUK central processing hub for image analysis with Swansea University to provide common shared infrastructure connecting multiple imaging centres and supporting cross-centre collaboration. This is based on geo-replicated OpenStack computer clusters and storage subsystems. Swansea University also offers access to centralised systems and a wide variety of software stacks to support the needs of a variety of national programmes and projects, e.g: Transmart, LabKey, MACRO 4, RedCap, XNat, JIRA. researchers have access to the HPC Wales supercomputing infrastructure, which provides around 17,000 cores across eight sites based on a hub and spoke model with hubs in Swansea and Cardiff. The Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB) includes a distributed four-site computing system capable of supporting over 1,000 virtual bioinformatics servers. This system consists of hardware with 7,680 cores, 2,304 TB of cross-site replicated storage and 78TB of RAM. Through this infrastructure, Swansea University has access to: 2,000 cores, 500TB storage, 40TB memory and 1PB object storage. Swansea has invested in a range of systems underpinning UKSeRP and SAIL offering unique capabilities selected to best fit the needs of individual projects and users, including IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, Postgres, HADOOP , Elastic Search, and OpenStack/Linux with IBM Watson/Content Analytics, CliniThink and GATE supporting NLP . Across all warehouses, databases, VM/VDi, imaging and genomics infrastructure components researchers have access to 2,328 cores, 35 TB of memory and 3.4 PB of storage.Wales218 Key informatics investments by Research OrganisationPlatforms MRC Farr Institute capital funding enabled Swansea University to decouple platform components, making them available as \"white label\" technologies to support others in their pursuit of establishing r obust and acceptable data sharing environments in different jurisdictions or across multiple research partners. Notable amongst these are Swansea University's National Research Data Appliances (NRDA), a sophisticated, standalone \"SAIL Databank in a box\" scalable technology set, designed to manage multiple datasets within a complex data holding organisation (e.g. NHS Trust or a Local Authority) and create research ready lined datasets. By automating the production of data quality reports and standardised metadata, probabilistic demographic linkage, the NRDAs make simple the task of managing complex data for data owning organisations, benefiting them and those that have agr eed data sharing arrangements in place. NRDAs are currently in use in Wales and are being considered by several other parts of the world. Modular in design, the NRDAs can be supplied with on-board national language processing facilities, allowing data owners to continuously \"read in\" their free text documentation (such as letters and summaries) and create SNOMED CT codes for analysis and sharing. Trusted Research Environments MRC investment in UKSeRP extended NRDA functionality to include federation of NRDAs and the operation of a cloud-like ISO2001 accredited data sharing platform service to research programmes, with tailored governance models and devolved management controls removing the need for capital investment and development time. Requirements of ARDC-Wales have led to an instance of UKSeRP with enhanced security controls to meet the expectations of UK Government departments. UKSeRP is now used by 40+ cohorts in DPUK, UK Biobank, ALSPAC, East London Genes for Health and the UK MS Register. The technology is being shared with a number of international partners to support global research initiatives. Swansea University is also part of the JISC SafeShare initiative to provide higher assurance connectivity between institutions and safe settings and has both Farr and ADRC connections to relevant secure networks to facilitate secure cross-centre access and collaboration. Training Swansea University is a long-term provider of high quality education, training and CPD activities in the field and is the sole UK provider of the internationally respected Introduction/Advanced Analysis of Linked Health Data courses , originated by Prof D'Arcy Holman of UWA, now delivered as SU/UWA collaboration. Courses are available as a standalone basis, or part of an MSc in Health Informatics . NHS and industry internships form part of the dissertation and work-based project of this course. In partnership with the NHS Wales Informatics Services and Health Boards in Wales, this course is able to offer NHS research opportunities within the NHS Wales Informatics Research Laboratories based at Swansea University. Over 100 students have now registered for the MSc/MRes and 238 professionals have completed individual modules as part of their continuous professional development. Swansea University also offers UK's first MSc in Health Data Science . An extensive programme of other research- relevant short courses, including Open University modules in Health Informatics, is provided each year to students from across the world. Swansea University makes major contributions to the Farr Institute 's PhD and ECR symposia.Wales219 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation219 Public Involvement/Engagement The Farr@CIPHER, ADRC-Wales and SAIL have a joint active Public Engagement programme, involving consumers fully in all relevant stages of their work by: - facilitating the operation of a strong and inclusive Consumer Panel for Data Linkage Research, to advise, support and advocate their work; - involving patients, service users, carers and the general public in their research; - building and maintaining a web-based public information resource that showcases the benefits of data linkage research; - hosting and participating in, regular events designed to be of interest to members of the public.

this report: 1. Business and Local Government Data Research Centres Since January 2014, ESRC have been investing in Business and Local Government Data Research Centres. These Data Research Centres make data, routinely collected by business and local government organisations, accessible for academics in order to undertake research in the social sciences of mutual benefit to data owners and in ways that safeguard individuals' identities. The Centres, along with the ADRN, will make a significant contribution towards ensuring the future sustainability of the UK research competitiveness, supporting the UK in maximising its innovation potential and driving economic growth. The Centres are funded until December 2019. The Directors of these Centres are: Urban Big Data Centre: Professor Piyushimita (Vonu) Thakuriah at the University of Glasgow ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre: Professor Vania Sena at University of Essex Consumer Data Research Centre : Professor Mark Birkin at University of Leeds and Professor Paul Longley at University College London 2. RCUK Digital Economy Hubs To maintain momentum in the new and emerging forms of data area the ESRC awarded \u00a31.4M of funding to the RCUK Digital Economy Hubs in 2014. This funding was to build on and/or enhance work they have been carrying out which is closely aligned to this agenda, as well as to conduct complementary activities which will contribute to the development of infrastructure for research using social media data. This work was funded for a period of 18 months running from February 2014 to August 2015. 3. Civil Society Data partnership Projects In 2014 the ESRC commissioned four Civil Society Data Partnership Projects, aimed at establishing or building on relationships between academic researchers and civil society organisations to demonstrate the value of improved data infrastructure, enabling collection and analysis of data which is of interest to civil society organisations and through enabling the sector to better utilise its own data. 4 projects were funded: Utilising Big Data in the Practice of Torture Survivors' Rehabilitation. A Profiler for Crime, Criminal Justice and Social Harm Data Resource Construction: Open Data, Grantmaking Data, and the Organisational and Financial Base of the Third Sector Developing the Use of Administrative Data on Scotland's Civil Society227 Mapping the Landscape of UK Health Data Research & Innovation4. Centre for Doctoral Training in New Forms of Data In 2016 ESRC commissioned a Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in new forms of data to be developed in collaboration with non-academic partners and will focus on real-time data analysis, data linkage and interoperability of data from different sources. The substantive focus is on 'new forms of data' in a broad sense and on the opportunities provided by these data to study social processes as they unfold. This CDT was awarded to the Data Analytics and Society CDT led by the University of Leeds in partnership with the Universities of Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool. The Centre will focus on Promoting the creation and analysis of new longitudinal and streamed data resources for socio-economic investigations. Creating new methods (e.g. scaling up existing methods for real time big data analytics), Investigating social processes (e.g. virtualisation of retailing; data-driven decision making and social behaviours) Facilitating interventions (e.g. resource targeting, network planning, social media apps for diet, travel, lifestyle planning). The CDT will support minimum of 10 students per year for three years with the first cohort starting in October 2017. 5. New and Emerging Forms of Data Policy Demonstrator Projects In January 2017 ESRC commissioned policy demonstrator projects to showcase the potential value of new and emerging forms of data for policymakers. 8 projects were funded as part of this call running from February 2017 for up to a year. The projects funded in the call are listed below. Social sensing of health and wellbeing impacts from pollen and air pollution HABITS: improved policy to mitigate pollutant and inactivity related health burdens through new big data Data Awareness for Sending Help (DASH) The food sentiment observatory: exploiting new forms of data to help inform policy on food safety and food crime risks Population247NRT: near real-time spatiotemporal population estimates for health, emergency response and national security Inclusive and healthy mobility: understanding trends in concessionary travel in the West Midlands New and emerging forms of violence data for crisis response: a comparative analysis in Kenya Centre for cyberhate research and policy: real-time scalable methods and infrastructure for modelling the spread of cyberhate on social media 228 AnnexesANNEX 3 List of abbreviations ADRC Administrative Data Research Centre ADRN Administrative Data Research Network AHSC Academic Health Science Centre AHSN Academic Health Science Network AMR Antimicrobial resistance ATI Alan Turing Institute BBSRC Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council BRC Biomedical Research Centre CCG Clinical Commissioning Group CPRD Clinical Practice Research Datalink CPU Central Processing Unit CR UK Cancer Research UK DHSC Department of Health and Social Care DPUK Dementia Platform UK DRI Dementia Research Institute EMBL European Molecular Biology Laboratory EHR ElectronicHealth Record EPR Electronic Patient Record EPSRC Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ESRC Economic and Social Research Council EU European Union GB Gibabyte GeL Genomic England Ltd HIC Health Informatics Collaborative HPC High Performance Computing ICT Information and Communications Technology IG Information Governance IMI Innovative Medicines Innitiative MRC Medical Research Council NHS National Health System NICE The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) NIH National Insitutes of Health (USA) NIHR National Institute for Health Research (UK) ONS Office for National Statistics (UK) OS Opertating System PB Petabyte PHE Public Health England PI Principal investigator TB TerabyteMedical Research Council (Swindon office) 2nd Floor David Phillips Building Polaris House North Star Avenue Swindon SN2 1FL Medical Research Council (London office) 14th Floor Street London WC2B 4AN Phone (+44) (0)1793 416200 mrc.ukri.org The Medical Research Council is part of UK Research and Innovation "}
