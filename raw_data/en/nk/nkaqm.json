Green tea Elizabeth Kaegi, MB, ChB, MSc, on behalf of the Task Force on Alternative Therapies of the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative This article continues the series that reviews the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of 6 unconventional therapies commonly used byCanadian cancer patients: Essiac, green tea, Iscador, hydrazine sulfate, vitamins A, C and E, and 714-X. Part 1 ( CMAJ 1998[7]:897-902) describes the methodology used to obtain and evaluate the available information on theproducts and provides a summary of the findings on Essiac. Subsequent articleswill cover the other products. Annotated bibliographies that provide more detailed references for the in- formation summarized in this series of articles are available in print from theCanadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative (CBCRI; address appears at end ofarticle). The reference lists and the lay summaries of the findings (published in1997) can be found on the CBCRI's Web site ( www.breast.cancer.ca ). The following summary of the information on green tea adapts the lay sum- maries for clinicians and provides references for the key findings. [Copies ofthis and other articles in the series will be available on CMAJ 's Web site (www.cma.ca/cmaj/series/therapy.htm ).] Green tea What is it? Each year about 2.5 million tons of tea are manufactured from the dried leaves and leaf buds of the shrub Camellia sinensis . Black tea accounts for about 78% of production and is prepared by drying and fermenting the leaves. This tea is mostwidely drunk in Europe, India and North America. Oolong tea, a specialty tea ac-counting for 2% of production, is only partly fermented and is popular in south-eastern China and Japan. Green tea, which is not fermented, is made by steamingor pan-frying tea leaves and then drying them. It accounts for about 20% ofworld production and is mostly consumed in China and Japan, where it has beenused medicinally as a stimulant and digestive remedy for about 5000 years. 1 When green tea is taken for medicinal purposes, 5-10 mL of the dried herb is steeped in a cup of boiling water for about 15 minutes. The usual amounttaken is 1-3 cups daily, without the addition of milk or sugar. More recently,green tea capsules have been developed for the market, but the clinical benefitsof these are unknown. Safety No adverse effects have been reported in association with the medicinal use of green tea. However, a cup of tea, black or green, contains 10-80 mg of caf-feine depending on the methods used in its production, storage and prepara-tion. Because excess caffeine can cause nervousness, insomnia and irregularitiesin heart rate, pregnant women, nursing mothers and patients with cardiacproblems are usually advised to limit their intake to 2 cups daily. 1,2Education \u00c9ducation Dr. Kaegi was Director of Medical Affairs and CancerControl of the NationalCancer Institute of Canadaand the Canadian CancerSociety, Toronto, Ont., from1993 to 1996. The Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative does not endorse the use of any particular unconventional therapy. It urgespatients to evaluate all evidencecarefully and to consult their caregiver in order to make thoughtful and fully informedpersonal decisions. This article has been peer reviewed.

There has beenfar less research into its role in the treatment of cancer. With respect to prevention, a number of epidemiologic studies have suggested that the regular consumption oftea, particularly green tea, moderately decreases the riskof cancer, especially cancers of the upper digestive tract. 8-10 There has been some laboratory research into the pos- sible role of green tea in the treatment of cancer. However,no human studies and only limited data from animal stud-ies were identified. In assay systems, the effects of greentea have been contradictory and inconclusive, showingboth mutagenic and antimutagenic effects. 4,11-13However, several murine studies have demonstrated anticarcinogeniceffects. For example, extracts of green tea applied to mouseskin have been found to inhibit the development of skincancer in response to known skin carcinogens. 14Green tea and green tea extracts given orally or intraperitoneallyhave been shown to inhibit the growth of transplanted tu-mours 14-16and to reduce the incidence of tumours in ani- mals exposed to carcinogenic agents.11 A few studies have reported that green tea and green tea extracts reduce the metastatic potential of cancercells in some animal systems. 17,18These findings, to- gether with the evidence that green tea extracts suppresschromosomal abnormalities induced by carcinogens, 12 have generated some interest because they suggest thatgreen tea plays a role in delaying the cumulative geneticdamage necessary for a cell to evolve from normalcy toone with aggressive metastatic capabilities. Constituents of green tea Dried tea leaves are composed mainly of phytochemi- cals known (including fluoride and aluminum) and fibre.Like most herbs, the precise composition of green teavaries with the geographic origin of the leaf, the time ofharvest and the manufacturing process. The constituentsof black tea differ from those of green tea: oxidation andfermentation of black tea alter the catechins and lower the concentration of polyphenols. Research suggests that it is the polyphenols in green tea that are responsible for its chemopreventive ef-fect. 19-21Some animal studies have also shown that ex- tracts of tea catechins injected intraperitoneally causeimplanted breast and prostatic tumours 22With respect to anticarcinogenic activity, the cate- chin in green tea that has generated the most interest isa potent, naturally occuring antioxidant, epigallocate-chin gallate (EGCG). The mechanism of action ofEGCG and other similar substances is uncertain, butthey may function in several ways: by acting as antioxi- dants, by inhibiting enzymes involved in cell replicationand DNA synthesis, by interfering with cell-to-cell ad-hesion, or by inhibiting some of the intracellular com-munication pathways required for cell division. 16,20,21,23-28 Conclusion Moderate consumption of green tea appears safe. There is some evidence that green tea may prevent theoccurrence of some forms of cancer, but the mechanismsof action of its specific constituents are poorly under-stood. Preliminary evidence exists of the potential effec-tiveness of green tea as a treatment of cancer. Furtherresearch into the effects of green tea and some of itsconstituents would be worthwhile. This article reports some of the work carried out by the Task Force on Alternative Therapies of the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative (CBCRI). The CBCRI is the main funder of breast cancer research in Canada and was established in 1993as a consortium of the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS), the Na-tional Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) \u2014 which also servesas the administrative home of the CBCRI \u2014 and the federal government (through the participation of the Medical Research Council of Canada and the National Health Research and De-velopment Programme). In addition to the author, a number ofother CBCRI staff worked on the project, including Dr. CarmenTamayo (research associate), Ms. Rebecca McDonald and Ms. Jess Merber. Others contributed to the reviews of specific agents. The task force was chaired by Ms. Donna Cappon. Dr.Kaegi was the Director of Medical Affairs and Cancer Controlfor the CCS and the NCIC and staff partner with the task force. References 1. Chow K, Kramer I. All the tea in China .
