The Arkansas Medicaid population has a low rate of COVID-19 vaccinations. We need your help to change that. This toolkit is designed for Arkansas Medicaid providers, including hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and clinicians. Arkansas Medicaid is asking all Medicaid providers to talk with their clients and patients about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Arkansas Medicaid providers will get an enhanced rate for administering COVID-19 vaccines through the end of the federal Public Health Emergency. During this time, for each first- or second-round dose of COVID-19 vaccine that Arkansas Medicaid providers administer, Medicaid will pay $100 rather than the usual $40 vaccine administration rate. That means that providers who administer both the first and second doses of the Pfizer or Moderna to a client will be paid $200 ($100 for each dose). What is the purpose of this toolkit? This toolkit is designed to help you promote and talk about the available vaccines to your patients. People who are hesitant to get vaccinated are more likely to trust vaccine information from providers they know and already have a relationship with. That means you can have a big impact on protecting Arkansans from this virus. In this toolkit you will find: - A draft electronic message that you can email to patients and clients or send to their patient portal accounts. It can be tailored to meet your needs. - Fliers you can post in your offices. - Social media graphics and messages that you can share on your business social media channels. - Important factual information you and your staff could share with clients when calling to encourage them to get vaccinated.

You have strong relationships with your patients and clients. They trust you with their health and health care so you are in a unique position to help them make the decision to get vaccinated. Here are some simple and easy ways you can reach out: - Make asking whether people are vaccinated - or would like to get vaccinated - part of every conversation you have with patients you see in person or in a telehealth visit. - Get your staff to help by calling patients you know may be high-risk. A personal call from someone they know and trust can go a long way toward convincing people to get vaccinated. - Post fliers in your office about getting vaccinated. - Share social media posts about the importance of getting vaccinated on your business social media channels. There are also lots of news stories that you can share right now about people who got sick and are now encouraging others to get vaccinated. - Send an email or electronic message through your patient portal to all your patients. - Send handouts home with people who are hesitant to get vaccinated. - Have your staff wear buttons or stickers that say, \" [I'm vaccinated. Ask me why!](https://humanservices.arkansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/Im-vaccinated.-Ask-me-why-1.pdf)\" [ [Download Ways to Encourage Medicaid Clients to Get Vaccinated as PDF](https://humanservices.arkansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/Ways_to_Encourage_Medicaid_Clients_to_Get_Vaccinated.pdf)] Fact-based talking points - Medicaid clients: Did you know that... - You can get FREE vaccines for COVID-19? - You can get FREE transportation to get vaccinated? - The quick vaccine visit will not count against the 12 office visits you get each year? - Why is this so important? We want to keep you and others safe! - The Delta variant is putting younger and healthy people in the hospital. - Almost all the people hospitalized in Arkansas right now with COVID-19 are unvaccinated. - Getting vaccinated is easy! - You can come to my office today and get vaccinated without an appointment. - You can get vaccinated any day of the week, and even in the evenings from others your trust, like your pharmacist. - Anyone 5 or older can get a vaccine...AT NO COST! - Go to [www.vaccinefinder.org](http://www.vaccinefinder.org)to find a place to get vaccinated near you. - We know you're concerned about your personal safety and possible side effects. - All the vaccines available right now are safe and will give you strong protection against the virus, even the more contagious Delta variant. - Yes, you can still catch COVID-19 if you are vaccinated, but the vaccine is keeping most people from getting seriously ill. - Most people who take the vaccine do not have any serious side effects. - And vaccine side effects are temporary and do not mean you are sick. - Mild side effects mean your body is reacting to the vaccine just like it's supposed to! - If you are pregnant or hoping to become pregnant, the vaccine is safe for you! - Public health officials and doctors right here in Arkansas are now encouraging pregnant women to get vaccinated to protect themselves. - Don't wait to vaccinate! - Waiting too long allows COVID-19 to continue spreading and changing. - We all want things to go back to normal. Getting vaccinated is the best way to help make that happen. - Severe COVID-19 can be very dangerous: The sooner you get vaccinated, the sooner you are protected. "}
