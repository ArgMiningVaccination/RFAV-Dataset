For over 238 years, our brave Sailors and Marines have deployed in times of peace and war to protect our national interests, deter our potential enemies and reassure our allies and partners. As the most formidable expeditionary fighting force the world has ever known, our uniformed and civilian Sailors and Marines provide unsurpassed military capability and compassionate humanitarian aid wherever catastrophe strikes. Time and again, our people, our greatest military advantage, have risen to the occasion, providing the presence that enables us to be in the right place, not just at the right time, but all the time. It is truly an honor to work with such an outstanding team of men and women who sacrifice so much to protect our great nation and democratic ideals. During 2013, the DON remained vigilant in addressing actions associated with the end of Iraqi operations and in preparing for the 2014 drawdown in Afghanistan, while carrying out current missions in dangerous environments. We successfully navigated the challenges of sequestration in 2013 and are positioning ourselves for reduced budgets, as we transition from a period of war spending to prepare to meet future threats. Our focus has been on what we call the \"Four P's\"\u2014 People: taking care of those who sacrifice so much for our country, such as our wounded warriors; Platforms: continuing efforts to build ships, aircraft, submarines, unmanned vehicles, and hardware needed to combat future threats; Power: pursuing energy efficiencies and alternative energy sources to reduce our use of fossil fuels and build a green fleet; and Partnerships : improving relations throughout the world through collaboration. We continue to strengthen our financial and business operations and to enhance the quality of underlying financial and performance information. The importance of sound financial management is magnified in times of reduced budgets. Our commitment to efficient, accountable, and transparent financial processes has the strong support of our senior military and civilian leaders. The DON's Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report, Protecting Freedom Under Extraordinary Circumstances, highlights our mission, goals, and accomplishments. It demonstrates our commitment as fiscal stewards to spend funds entrusted to us wisely - for the right reasons, at the right time, to meet our highest priorities - with full accountability and transparency for results in accomplishing our mission to protect the United States and make the world a safer place. The significant accomplishments of the DON during fiscal year 2013 are a testament to our people. We are proud to serve our country and commit to the American public continued unparalleled power at sea through a strong, flexible, and efficient fighting force. Ray Mabus 3 MessagesTHE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY (FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND COMPTROLLER) 1000 NAVY PENTAGON WASHINGTON, DC 20350-1000 November 2013 Navy and Marine Corps financial managers continue to provide exceptional support to the world's finest expeditionary force as it carries out the Department of the Navy's mission around the globe in defense of our nation. We are proud to contribute to the effective and efficient deployment of resources across the DON, while ensuring public confidence that the Department is spending its dollars wisely to meet its highest mission priorities and can provide a full accounting for its costs and results. This year introduced a new set of financial challenges as the DON operated for six months under a continuing resolution and absorbed $4.3 billion in sequestration reductions to its operations and maintenance funding. These reductions were effectively managed through aggressive initiatives to reduce costs while protecting essential mission funding directly supporting warfighter readiness. The Department was forced to cancel surface ship and aircraft maintenance periods for the last six months of the fiscal year; delay maintenance of runways, roads, and buildings; reduce steaming and flying hours; and unfortunately, furlough civilian employees. Costs associated with travel, training, major acquisitions and base maintenance were reduced through improvements to business operations such as the increased use of electronic commerce and learning. While near term readiness and warfighting needs were met, the longer term impact of programmatic reductions has yet to be fully felt and assessed. The Department remains mindful of fiscal challenges as we move into 2014 and remains committed to the ongoing transformation of our financial enterprise. Audit readiness remains a top priority as we work to strengthen and streamline financial management operations, systems and internal controls; expand the use of data analytic tools; promote standardization; and enhance our financial workforce through the Department of Defense financial management certification program. The civilian and military leaders in the Department are committed to effectively and efficiently managing the resources entrusted to us with the highest degree of integrity and dedication on behalf of the American people we are so honored to serve. The DON's Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report, Protecting Freedom Under Extraordinary Circumstances, recognizes our significant efforts to continue improving financial management, performance, accountability and transparency. S.J. Rabern 4 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report Protecting Freedom Under Extraordinary Circumstances5 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysis Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report Management's Discussion and Analysis 6 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report oveRview The Department of Defense includes three military departments (Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force); however, there are four separate service branches (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force). Since 1834, the Navy and Marine Corps have been housed together under the Department of the Navy. The United States Navy was founded on 13 October 1775, and the Department of the Navy (DON) was established on 30 April 1798. The Department of the Navy has three principal components: the Navy Department, consisting of executive offices mostly in Washington, D.C.; the operating forces, including the Marine Corps, the reserve components, and, in time of war, the U.S. Coast Guard (in peace, a component of the Department of Homeland Security); and the shore establishment. The Department of the Navy consists of two uniformed Services: the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. The United States Marine Corps was founded by an act of the Second Continental Congress on 10 November 1775. As the nation's Expeditionary Force in Readiness, the Marine Corps provides power projected from the sea, utilizing the mobility of the U.S. Navy to rapidly deliver combined-arms task forces in coastal regions or emergent global crises. The Marine Corps has evolved into a balanced air-ground task force with significant logistical capabilities in forward deployed and forward engaged areas shaping, training, deterring, and responding to all manner of crises and contingencies. During Fiscal Year 2013 we were reminded of the enduring service, sacrifice, and dedication of our Sailors, Marines, and civilians as they protect our freedom under extraordinary circumstances. Afloat and in the field, our Sailors and Marines contributed to overseas contingency operations in Afghanistan, a successful conclusion of the war in Iraq, and a wide range of operations including maritime security, stabilization, homeland security, counterterrorism, and disaster relief. At home, the Navy family was shaken by a senseless act of violence at the Washington Navy Yard that cost the lives of twelve Naval Sea Systems Command civilians who loved their country, loved their Navy, and loved the fleet that they helped build and sustain. Their contributions and memory will endure in the hearts of our nation and the Navy family. In the wake of the devastating events at the Navy Yard, the Navy has rallied together in support of all who were affected by this shocking tragedy. This event has also caused the Department to reassess security around all naval bases and installations. The Navy established the Emergency Family Support Task Force for people and organizations interested in providing support for families of the victims involved in the Washington Navy Yard shooting.

(U .S . Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Brian Jeffries/Released)7 MaNageMeNt's DiscussioN aND aNalysis The DON continues to operate forward across the globe, providing the nation offshore options to deter and defeat aggression today and in the future. The Navy and Marine Corps team provides unique capabilities that will prove crucial as our Nation's strategic focus shifts to the Asia-Pacific region. The mobilization of warships will be accompanied by an increase in the number of military exercises conducted by the Pentagon in the region, involving air, sea, and land forces. Most will be carried out in conjunction with countries that are openly or tacitly allied with the U.S., including Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines. Essential to the National Defense strategy are the DON's efforts to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region to advance a common security vision for the future. The DON plans to develop military to military relations by creating teams to work on difficult issues such as cyber threats. The DON has employed strategic partnerships to combat today's extraordinary challenges, showcasing our commitment to improving relations throughout the world and protecting our independence. The Navy and Marine Corps have conducted integrated operations in an effort to address the needs in the Mediterranean and Middle East. As the war in Afghanistan nears its end and demands for naval crisis response grow , working together is the only way to protect freedom. The DON will continue its investment in critical alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The DON will face additional challenges in meeting its mission, as budget constraints have led to a leaner workforce. In order to prioritize resources, the DON has instituted the 21st Century Sailor and Marine initiative. This initiative defines a set of objectives and policies around a broad definition of wellness to maximize every Sailor and Marine's personal readiness to contribute to the DON's mission. In the second year of implementation, the program has maximized Sailor and Marine personal readiness and built resiliency to improve the most combat-effective force in the history of the Navy and Marine Corps. In an era of budget cuts, the DON has remained focused on maintaining U.S. maritime dominance by having Sailors and Marines continue to promote security, stability, and trust around the world. T ogether, the DON has provided a persistent forward presence, power projection abroad, and protection of the world's sea lanes. Although this is an era of reduced budgets and The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates a reduction of Federal spending, the DON will continue to operate as it does. As such, the DON is dedicated to cutting costs in the coming years by reducing the cost of doing business, promoting acquisition excellence, driving innovative transformation, and leading the nation in sustainable energy. While the DON maintains a healthy industrial base Checking bearings in the pilot house of a guided-missile frigate as the ship prepares to enter the Panama Canal . (U .S . Navy photo by Lt . Cmdr . Corey Barker/Released)8 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report to ensure future innovation and technological advances, the DON remains focused on identifying efficiencies to tighten budget execution while better aligning weapon system procurements with future mission requirements. As such, the DON has decreased the construction of new ships, terminated the procurement of the ocean surveillance ship and reduced and/or delayed the procurement of various other projects. Readily available energy is essential for deploying our Sailors and Marines around the globe in support of our nation's interests. Since our operational flexibility and sustainability are directly linked to our energy supplies, energy reliability is a strategic concern for our forces. The potential vulnerability of energy supplies could threaten our ability to perform on the battlefield, and energy costs siphon resources from war fighting requirements. Therefore, the DON is working to develop greater energy independence and conservation ashore and afloat. Energy reform improves the capability and efficiency of ships, aircraft and weapon systems, and ultimately makes us better warfighters and ensures the safety of our Sailors and Marines. In the fall of 2009, Secretary Mabus set an ambitious energy goal for the Navy and Marine Corps that, by no later than 2020, at least half of all the energy used by the two services, both afloat and ashore, will come from non-fossil fuel sources. At the same time, at least half of all bases will be net-zero in terms of consumption, and in many cases returning power to the grid rather than pulling from it. The Navy and Marine Corps continued to make significant progress toward reaching the Secretary's energy goals in 2013. The Navy is also working to improve the efficiency of bases by monitoring electricity usage in buildings, signing contracts for larger uses of solar power, and is considering geothermal, hydrothermal, wave, solar, and wind. This commitment to changing the way energy is used and produced will help the Navy in preserving the environment and planning for and mitigating the harmful effects of climate change. The Navy's priorities include developing clear goals and performance assessments that will help to transform the entire department. The Navy continues to focus on sustainable energy by offering military contract opportunities to small businesses with sustainable energy programs, pilots, and initiatives. The Navy's efforts to support a clean energy economy will make Americans better stewards of our planet. The DON recognizes the value of investing in audit readiness as part of the Department of Defense (DoD) mission. The path to auditability will result in improved stewardship, reduced cost of business operations, A marine breaks during a patrol with the Afghan National Civil Order of Policemen in Afghanistan .

In FY 2013, the U.S. Marine Corps continued the Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) audit. Concurrently, the DoD Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) team is preparing the rest of the Department for SBR audit readiness, with focused efforts to ready people, processes, and business systems for a financial audit. The DON understands fundamental improvements that establish tighter internal controls and more standardized processes are needed within its operations. T o standardize and enforce uniform business processes, especially within disparate commands, the DON is in the process of fully implementing the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system across all Commands. The DON has employed control gap analysis to identify when a command's process and/or controls differ significantly from suggested controls, allowing the DON to track and address significant deviations. The DON continues to demonstrate its commitment to effectively managing and mitigating risks while making progress toward desired mission outcomes by establishing objectives for FY 2014 and beyond. Given the current climate of budgetary restrictions and uncertainty, it is critical that the DON tracks progress and monitors change pertaining to the following high priority objectives: n Take Care of Our People n Maintain Warfighter Readiness in an Era of Reduced Budgets n Lead the Nation in Sustainable Energy n Promote Acquisition Excellence and Integrity n Dominate in Unmanned Systems n Drive Innovative Enterprise TransformationPacific Partnership 2013 personnel man the rails on the amphibious dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor .

At any given time, approximately 30,000 Marines are forward deployed in operations supporting our nation's defense or Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW). HQMC consists of the Commandant of the Marine Corps and those staff agencies that advise and assist him in discharging his responsibilities prescribed by law and higher authority. This includes the administration, discipline, internal organization, training, requirements, efficiency, and readiness of the service. The Marine Corps Headquarters is spread throughout the Washington, D.C. metro area, including the Pentagon, Marine Barracks, Quantico, and the Washington Navy Yard. The Operating Forces are subdivided into four categories: Marine Corps Forces, including all Marine ground, aviation, and combat logistics; Marine Corps Reserves, Marines who support the Active Component by fielding deployable units; Security Forces, which protect key installations, vessels, units, and assets of the United States Government; and Special Activity Forces, who guard US embassies and foreign service posts. The Supporting Establishment includes all bases, air stations, and installations. They assist in training, sustainment, equipping, and embarkation of deploying Marine Forces.17 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysisHeadquarters, U. S. Marine Corps (HQMC) Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps (HQMC) consists of the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) and those staff agencies that advise and assist him in discharging his responsibilities prescribed by law . The Commandant is directly responsible to the Secretary of the Navy for the overall performance of the Marine Corps. This includes the administration, discipline, internal organization, training, requirements, efficiency, and readiness of the service. Also, as the Commandant is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, HQMC supports him in his interaction with the Joint Staff. The Commandant also is responsible for the operation of the Marine Corps material support system. Marine Corps Forces Command (MARFORCOM) Located in Norfolk, Virginia, the Commander, MARFORCOM is tasked with: commanding Active Component (AC), Marine Corps-retained operating forces; executing force sourcing and synchronization to provide joint commanders with the Marine Corps forces they require; Directing deployment planning and the execution of Marine Corps-retained operating forces in support of combatant commander and service requirements; serving as Commanding General, Fleet Marine Forces Atlantic (CG FMFLANT) and commanding embarked Marine Corps forces; coordinating Marine Corps-Navy integration of operational initiatives and advising the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (USFF) on Navy support to Marine Corps forces assigned to naval ships, bases, and installations; serving as Commander, Marine Forces Europe; serving as Commander, Marine Corps Bases Atlantic; and conducting service-directed operational tasks as required. U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific (MARFORPAC) MARFORPAC has three command roles and responsibilities. The command serves as U.S. Marine Corps component to U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), U.S. Marine Corps component to U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), and Fleet Marine Forces Commander to Pacific Fleet. In addition to its service component responsibilities, MARFORPAC could be tasked to act as a joint task force command element.With its headquarters located aboard Camp H. M. Smith, HI, MARFORPAC is the largest field command in the Marine Corps, having control of two-thirds of Marine Corps operational forces. Commander, MARFORPAC commands all U.S. Marine Corps forces assigned to USPACOM operating in a diverse geographic area stretching from Yuma, Arizona to Goa, India. U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Special Operations Command (MARSOC) MARSOC was formally established February 24, 2006 and is the Marine Corps component of USSOCOM. Headquartered at Camp Lejeune, NC, MARSOC trains, organizes, equips, and, when directed by the Commander USSOCOM, deploys task organized, scalable and responsive Marine Corps special operations forces (SOF) worldwide in support of combatant commanders and other agencies. MARSOC includes three subordinate commands: the Marine Special Operations Regiment (MSOR); the Marine Special Operations Support Group (MSOSG); and the Marine Special Operations School (MSOS) at Camp Lejeune, NC. Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES) Headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, MARFORRES is responsible for providing trained units and qualified individuals for active-duty service in times of war, national emergency, or in support of contingency operations. Marine Corps force expansion is made possible by activation of the Marine Corps Reserve. As an operational reserve, MARFORRES provides personnel and operational tempo relief for active component forces during times of peace. Like the active component, MARFORRES is a combined-arms force with balanced ground, aviation, and logistics combat support units. MARFORRES capabilities are managed through MARFORCOM as part of its global force management responsibilities for the Commandant. Commander, MARFORRES is also Commander, Marine Forces Northern Command (MARFORNORTH) and serves as the Marine component of NORTHCOM. 18 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportU.S. Marine Corps Forces, Cyberspace Command (MARFORCYBER) Recognizing the significance of the cyberspace domain to national security, the Secretary of Defense directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) as a sub-unified command under the U.S. Strategic Command. The primary objective of CYBERCOM is to integrate the computer network operations capabilities of the services and agencies in support of the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace (NSSC).In response, the Marine Corps established U.S. Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command (MARFORCYBER) in October 2009. (This was complemented by the standing up of the Navy's U.S. T enth Fleet/Fleet Cyber Command in January 2010.) MARFORCYBER's mission is to plan, coordinate, integrate, synchronize, and direct full spectrum Marine Corps cyberspace operations. Marine Corps Installations Command (MCICOM) Marine Corps Installations Command (MCICOM) has 24 active installations and 11 airfields, which are divided into three regions: Marine Corps Installations Pacific (MCIPAC), Marine Corps Installations East (MCIEAST), and Marine Corps Installations West (MCIWEST). The forces assigned to MCICOM provide timely support to the Marines, Sailors and families from the operating forces and maintenance depots. MCICOM directly supports Marine Corps Operating Forces, individual Marines, and family members. They are essential components in the foundation of national defense as they are the force projection platforms that support training, sustainment, mobilization, deployment, embarkation, redeployment, reconstitution, and force protection. Marine Corps Logistics Command (MCLC) Headquartered in Albany, Georgia, MCLC provides worldwide, integrated logistics, supply chain, and distribution management; maintenance management; and strategic prepositioning capability in support of the operating forces and other supported units. The services and support provided by MCLC maximize supported unit readiness, synchronize distribution processes, and support Marine Corps enterprise and program-level total life cycle management.

The cooperative strategy, guided by the objectives articulated in the National Strategy for Maritime Security, National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and National Military Strategy, was developed to be a unified and enduring approach that will apply maritime power to the crucial responsibility of protecting vital U.S. interests in an increasingly interconnected and uncertain world. It binds the three maritime services\u2014U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard (during wartime)\u2014closer together than ever before in a mission to more fully safeguard maritime interests at home and abroad.Our six priority objectives support the U.S. maritime strategy by focusing on key efforts that will increase our effectiveness and improve the lives of our Sailors, Marines, and their families, which results in greater security for our nation and U.S. global interests. A summary of key accomplishments by objective begins below . Objective 1: Take Care of Our People Our Sailors, Marines, and civilians are all critical components of the U.S. maritime strategy, and we must ensure that we provide them with adequate compensation, medical care, and career training opportunities. These are key factors in attracting and retaining highly motivated and qualified military and civilian personnel. We remain committed to providing a competitive pay and benefits package to aid in recruitment and retention. The package includes basic pay, housing allowances, and incentives for critical specialties in health care, explosive ordnance disposal, and nuclear propulsion. 20 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report Capt .

(Photo by Vicki Cronis-Nohe, The Virginian- Pilot) DON personnel heroically strive to protect freedom for the nation as they face extraordinary circumstances each and every day. The Department is therefore fully committed to promote the physical and mental wellness of Sailors and Marines who have dedicated their lives to serve their families, communities, and our great Nation. In one initiative, the Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center (NMCPHC) developed a web-based immersive experience tool that will assist service members in achieving a better psychological and physical state. This online application provides different relaxation techniques for users to practice including breathing exercises, muscle relaxation activities, meditation, and other practices that are designed to help improve mood and performance while simultaneously managing stress. The NMCPHC is part of the Navy Medicine team, a global health care network of 63,000 Navy medical personnel around the world who provide high-quality health care to over one million eligible beneficiaries. The Navy is proud to uphold the standards of equality, freedom, and opportunity, and has made great progress as an organization. For the first time in the Navy's history, the role of women in the armed forces has been expanded such that every facet of military employment is available to them. On January 24, 2013, the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff overturned the 1994 Ground Combat Definition and Assignment Rule. This directive allowed for the integration of women into previously-closed occupational specialties and has increased assignment opportunity for women in the Navy. T oday, over 67,000 women serve in the Navy in the active and Reserve components, comprising 18 percent of the total force. Brave servicemen and women from all walks of life are the cornerstone of the armed forces. The Navy has fostered an environment rich in equality and opportunity where individuals are safe from prejudice. The Gay, Lesbian, and Supporting Sailors (GLASS) organization is a group for lesbian, gay and bisexual Sailors and supportive members that was created in order to increase awareness among Sailors regarding the gay community. This year Sailors from guided-missile destroyer USS Shoup (DDG 86) established a branch of the GLASS organization aboard their U.S. Navy vessel. The growth of the GLASS organization across the Navy is yet another example of the substantial progress the Navy has made in creating a military environment that is free from prejudice, bigotry, harassment, and violence. Sailors participating in the Riverine Combat Skills course prepare for a field training exercise at Camp Lejeune, N.C. This class was the first training group composed of Coastal Riverine Force Sailors and the first to incorporate women into the course . (U .S . Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Heather M . Paape/Released)21 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysisu.s. Navy The Navy continues to resize and reshape its forces to meet its mission requirements more efficiently and effectively. This is especially important in an environment of limited budgetary resources and rising personnel costs. Over the last five years, the Navy has resized its active and reserve components by 2 percent and 6 percent, respectively. The Navy has been able to accomplish all assigned missions at this level because of force structure changes, efficiencies gained through technology, modifications in workforce mix, and new manning practices. 329,304 328,303 66,474 65,006 Fiscal Year Ending September 30 2009 2010 2011 2012 20130100000200000300000400000 Active ReserveU.S. Navy End Strength 325,123 64,792318,40 6 64,715323,951 62,444 u.s.

These demands include support for security, stabilization, transition and reconstruction operations, support for homeland security, and continued preparedness for contingency operations. The evolving dynamics of the 21st century security environment require our forces to be ready to deploy globally. Although we are in an era of reduced budgets, the DON will maintain strong, agile and capable military forces. Operational readiness is the catalyst that brings naval power to bear whenever it is needed. Our budget supports requirements for our Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs), Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESGs), and Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs) to execute the National Military Strategy and respond to persistent as well as emerging threats. Our Navy-Marine Corps 23 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysisteam has become an integral part of continuing overseas contingency operations. We continue funding the necessary requirements to ensure our ability to protect vital U.S. interests and assist our allies in crisis situations. The DON's top readiness priority is ensuring that forces are fully supported while deployed. In order to do so, the DON requires a highly educated and trained, highly skilled and disciplined force. Using advanced technologies, we have shifted training from the traditional classroom to the use of simulators, trainers, computer-based interactive curricula, and other media-based approaches. This initiative provides our naval workforce with appropriate training in a more efficient manner and prepares them to better perform mission-critical tasks. The fleet must be ready to protect freedom while meeting today's extraordinary challenges, today. Consequently, decisions must be centered on what Sailors and Marines need to perform their jobs effectively and efficiently. The Department has acquired and continues to invest in proven technology that Sailors can use and depend on at sea and ashore. Leadership has used empirical data, such as Board of Inspection and Survey report statistics, to shape decision making that ensures fleet readiness despite reduced funding. cost savings through innovative technology The Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored a web-based military transportation tool which will enable the Navy to move people and equipment more efficiently and affordably. The Transportation Exploitation T ool (TET) allows planners to identify available space aboard thousands of military and commercial flights, as well as ship movements that occur throughout the day in order to know the best route to send mission-critical supplies. Before TET , planners needed to search multiple databases to access all the military and civilian space, which took hours and in some cases days. This system has already saved naval services over $30 million in transportation costs, with an estimated savings of $200 million over 10 years when it is fully implemented. The naval services continue to work on new technologies that save money while improving methods to provide our Sailors and Marines with the tools they need to be ready. Maritime security operations The Navy continues to safeguard and protect the Nation's interests by conducting operations to provide maritime security across the globe. Sailors conduct firefighting training on an airfield using a Mobile Aircraft Firefighting Training Device, which can simulate 13 different aircraft fire situations . (U .S .

This warship worked closely with a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion long-range patrol aircraft operating in the region to initially detect and intercept the fishing vessel suspected of smuggling narcotics in international waters. This collaboration enabled the seamen abroad the frigate to discover and confiscate the large reserve of cocaine. Objective 3: Lead the Nation in Sustainable Energy The Navy is committed to improving energy security and environmental stewardship by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The Navy is actively developing and participating in energy, environmental and climate change initiatives that will increase use of alternative energy and help conserve the world's resources for future generations. Goddard Power Plant, the last coal-fired power facility operated by the Navy , will be demolished and replaced by a natural-gas cogeneration facility and infrastructure that will provide steam critical to energetic mission activities as well as 3 .5 megawatts of electricity . (U .S . Navy photo by Gary Wagner/Released) Reducing our naval forces' reliance on fossil fuels is critical to our national security, environment, and naval capabilities. Our nation and naval forces rely heavily on a finite source of fuel from volatile global regions. T o a certain extent, we have ceded this strategic resource to other nations, creating an obvious vulnerability to our national security. In addition, our reliance on fossil fuels affects our naval forces' operational independence, both in terms of the resources required to obtain fuel and to transport it to the ships, aircraft, and equipment, and the Sailors and Marines whose duty it is to protect the ships and convoys moving the fuel. With these risks in mind, we have taken a bolder, more aggressive stance toward energy reform by committing to five energy goals (see chart on next page). These goals require adoption of new fuels and development of new systems and energy efficient practices and techniques over the next 10 years. The DON's strategy in achieving these goals is centered on energy security, energy efficiency, and sustainability while remaining the preeminent global maritime power. efforts to reduce Marine corps energy consumption in theater Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Panama City Division engineers are working to reduce the energy consumption of Marine Corps combat operations centers in theater. The NSWC engineers studied the operations centers and noted that almost 70 percent of total energy consumed was used to heat and cool shelters. They worked with engineers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado to develop a model that accurately predicted shelter heat transfer and resulting effects on energy consumption. The computerized model predicts energy consumption requirements given various factors such as: shelter material, colors, radiant barriers, air vents, shades, and air infiltration rates. The model also has the ability to incorporate localized weather data and will allow field units to more accurately predict energy supply requirements for shelter heating and cooling during and prior to deployment. These and other energy efficiency technologies can improve field tactics while also providing maritime warriors with greater tactical flexibility. the Navy's last coal-Fired p ower plant The Navy has a $62 million construction project to demolish the last remaining coal-fired power plant operated by the Navy. A new facility will be constructed for Naval Support Facility (NSF) Indian Head, MD that will provide the installation with decentralized steam and a 3.5 megawatt co-generation facility for electricity and steam. The project will modernize utility services for the installation and improve combat and war fighting 25 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysiscapabilities by reducing the vulnerabilities that were associated with having a coal fired facility. A combination natural gas turbine and heat recovery steam generator will replace the installation's Goddard Power Plant that was constructed in 1957. The new system will cut energy use by 50 percent, water consumption by 75 percent and steam requirements by 80 percent, resulting in approximately $7.5 million savings each year. In addition, an estimated 50 billion pounds of carbon emissions will be reduced each year. Natural gas, a cleaner and more efficient fuel source, will serve as the primary fuel for the new steam- and power-generation facilities. The project also includes the construction of a new natural gas transmission line from Bryans Road to NSF Indian Head. The Navy is excited to replace the last standing coal-fired facility with a more efficient and environmentally friendly structure. Objective 4: Promote Acquisition Excellence and Integrity T o protect U.S. national interests and achieve the objectives of the 2010 National Security Strategy in this environment, the Navy will need to recalibrate its capabilities and make selective additional investments to succeed in its missions. Despite the fact that The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates the reduction of federal spending, the Navy fleet will be no smaller in the future than it is today. Therefore, as replacement costs of our aging ships, aircrafts, and weapon systems continue to rise faster than our procurement budget's top-line; the Navy must reduce the cost of doing business. This entails improving program execution, rebuilding the acquisition workforce, leveraging strategic sourcing and promoting competition, all while protecting a healthy industrial base. During FY 2013, the DON continued to follow the DoD's Better Buying Power 2.0 (BBP 2.0) initiative. The initiative strives to implement best practices throughout DoD acquisition services to strengthen the buying power, improve industry productivity, and provide an affordable, value-added military capability to the Warfighter. The overall goal of the program is to create a set of fundamental acquisition principles to achieve greater efficiencies through affordability, cost control, elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy, and promotion of competition. The Navy has followed the BBP 2.0 guidelines in its goal of promoting acquisition excellence. Purchases of large, multi-year, procurements have been planned out in advance using a competitive allocation strategy. For example, three ships at Bath Iron Works (BIW) and Huntington Ingalls Incorporated (HII) saved 12 percent in basic construction costs and an overall savings of $298 million to the government. Objective 5: Dominate in Unmanned Systems Unmanned systems expand our naval capabilities in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and reduce the exposure of our naval forces to unnecessary threats. The DON's vision is to achieve an integrated, hybrid force of manned and unmanned systems with the ability to sense, comprehend, predict, communicate, plan, make decisions, and take appropriate actions to achieve its DepARTMeNT oF The NA vY eNeRgY goAls ENERGY EFFICIENT ACqUISITION: Evaluation of energy factors will be mandatory when awarding contracts for systems and buildings .

(U .S . Navy photo/Released)26 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Reportgoals. The employment of these systems will reduce risk for Sailors and Marines and increase capability. The DON Office of Naval Research (ONR) developed a Common Control System (CCS), which enables different Defense military branches to work together on unmanned systems and services. This new update allows military branches to simplify unmanned systems, rely less on custom-built components/systems, and in turn, reduce costs to the different branches in DoD. Historically, unmanned systems were developed and fielded as individual items built by different vendors. This has led to increased spending, from $284 million to over $3 billion in the last eight years. Each system is uniquely controlled by proprietary software created by various vendors, and the data provided is sent out in unique formats, making it impossible to control various systems with one master control or to uniformly examine the data being transmitted. The common controller solves this problem, will help to reduce costs, and allows the systems to work together. Additionally, all of the data captured by the systems is saved in a cloud environment that is transparent across the military and easily accessible to and quickly navigable by all service members. ONR worked with the OSD's Office of Strategic and Tactical Systems, Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Program Executive Office (PEO) Integrated Warfare Systems and PEO Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons on this software. ONR validated that Unmanned Control Systems (UCS) can be used to develop common control services that provide total functionality for a particular Common Control System, the Bi-Directional Remote Video T erminal (BDRVT). ONR was able to provide OSD with a blueprint for all military services to be able to build a BDRVT using UCS developed common control services. Objective 6: Drive Innovative Enterprise Transformation During FY 2013 the Navy partnered on a variety of research projects. A partnership between the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and an oceanographer has launched a 24-hour website called \"Exploration Now .\" The site operates similarly to a newsroom, tracking scientists' activity aboard research ships and in the field and broadcasting their findings to students and teachers around the world in real time. The Exploration Now initiative provides students, educators and others with live-stream video of research activities and opportunities to interact directly with scientists aboard different vessels. This initiative was designed to inspire students to pursue careers in the Science T echnology Engineering Math (STEM) fields, and will provide unprecedented access to deep-sea explorations. The program will commence with the Exploration Vessel Nautilus' six-month expedition in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, where researchers will investigate active undersea volcanoes and study the impact of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Navy continues to invest in the future of today's youth. The Department of the Navy and City of Chicago started the Critical MASS (Midwest Association for Science and Service) program to provide high school and community college students an intense, hands-on experience in (STEM) education. This five-year, $2 million campaign will bring enrichment programs to seven Chicago high schools driven by STEM courses. Business transformation The DON is committed to transforming the way it does business by using our people, processes, and systems more effectively. The DON FIAR plan is the integrating financial element of the DON's business transformation strategy and a supporting initiative of the DoD FIAR plan, which organizes and prioritizes the audit readiness and financial improvement efforts of DoD Components. Audit readiness is a goal of business transformation and a key metric for measuring its success and progress. Navy ERP is the key system driver of our business transformation and a key enabler of the DoD Enterprise Transition Plan which organizes and prioritizes efforts to modernize DoD business and financial systems. Continuous Process Improvement/Lean Six Sigma (CPI/LSS) initiatives, part of the DoD-wide CPI/LSS program, enable more effective and efficient operations across the DON enterprise. the DoN Financial improvement and audit readiness (Fiar) program The DON Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Program and the Marine Corps Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Initiative are multi- year, Department-wide efforts to modernize Navy-Marine Corps financial processes and systems to better serve worldwide operations. The goal of our financial improvement and audit readiness efforts is to produce more timely financial management information with greater accuracy, reliability, and accessibility. With improved information, we can allocate the DON 27 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysisresources in a more precise way and move closer to producing auditable DON-wide financial statements. Our FIAR efforts align with the new priorities and associated strategy established by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) for bringing DoD into a state of financial audit readiness and in compliance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (as amended). These priorities focus on improving processes, controls, and systems that support information most often used and relied upon by both civilian and military leaders in daily business operations\u2014budgetary information, as reported on the Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR), and mission critical asset information, such as military equipment and real property, as reported on the Balance Sheet. These priorities demonstrate the value of these financial statements to our daily business operations, particularly for funds control and resource utilization. The DON has asserted that the Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), the Department of the Navy (DON) Transportation of People (TOP), Civilian Pay (CIVPAY), Reimbursable Work Orders Grantor and Performer (R WO G/P), Military Pay, and Funds Balance with Treasury (FBWT) segments are audit ready. For FY 2014 the Navy Office of Financial Operations (FMO) is on target to assert Contract Vendor Pay (CVP), Financial Statement Compilation and Reporting (FSCR), and MILSTRIPs. For the DON's Existence and Completeness (E&C) efforts, we received unqualified opinions on our ships, submarines, intercontinental ballistic missiles, satellites, and aircraft in FY 2012. The DON reasserted ordnance and asserted Navy Small Boats in FY 2013. The DON expects to assert Uninstalled Aircraft Engines (UAE), Equipment, and Inventory in FY 2014. Validation for UAE is expected to be completed in FY 2014, with the remaining assertions validated in FY 2015. audit response and evaluation T o continue and sustain successes in audit readiness, the DON has created and staffed the Audit Response and Evaluation Division. Building on the DON's success of the Audit Response Center (ARC), and decentralizing Budget Submitting Office support to regional offices, the Audit Response and Evaluation effort ensures continued emphasis on the gains achieved in preparing the DON for full SBR audit. Combining the near term responsibilities for audit readiness with long-term evaluations and audit sustainment, this the DON function coordinates and oversees enterprise-wide audit sustainment activities through the development and management of a comprehensive evaluation program that supports future audits and examination efforts. Marines fire a shoulder-launched, multipurpose assault weapon as part of a movement-to-contact training evolution . (Photo by Sgt . Sarah Fiocco) Marine corps Financial improvement and audit readiness initiative By means of an independent study, the DON analyzed the value of the Marine Corps effort to pursue financial audit readiness in terms of the bottom line impact for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their financial processes and controls. This impact was measured in terms of the direct return for every dollar appropriated by Congress. The results of this analysis showed that for every dollar invested, nearly three dollars in value were created and that the resulting economies translated directly into the Marine Corps having the capability to purchase more mission supportive weapons for the same amount of appropriated resources. In the future, the DON will use this return on investment metric as a guide as it implements the substantial lessons learned from the ongoing Marine Corps audit experience to the Navy. Navy enterprise resource planning Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (Navy ERP) is an integrated business management system that unifies, standardizes, and streamlines Navy business operations. It has replaced multiple older, more costly information systems, with data managed in a single system, providing financial transparency to just over half of the Navy's T otal Obligational Authority. Commands that implemented Navy ERP have realized measurable improvements in accuracy, timeliness, and accessibility of information and 28 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Reportefficiencies in business and reporting processes. Navy ERP continues to drive enterprise-wide business process efficiencies and provides financial transparency and total asset visibility through business process and data standardization efforts; it will be a major positive force contributing toward Navy's financial audit readiness. The Navy ERP system Acquisition and Financial Management functionality has been operational since October 2007, and today includes the following commands, serving over 71,000 users: Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Supply Systems Command, Naval Sea Systems Command (Department of the Navy and Navy Working Capital Fund operations), Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, Office of Naval Research and Strategic Systems Programs. The Navy deployed the Single Supply Solution, which consolidates wholesale and retail supply functions. This functionality is directly benefiting the Navy warfighter through improved inventory management, with the ability to quickly locate parts anywhere in the world and get them to the warfighter in record time. With inventory enterprise visibility, the Navy is achieving significant savings through more effective use of existing global inventory. This year the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) business process financial information team from Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems received the Admiral Stanley R. Arthur Award for logistics excellence as the Acquisition Logistics T eam of the Year. This Navy ERP team was recognized for innovation and leadership in standardizing Navy business processes, made major contributions to enterprise financial audit readiness, and successfully supported and materially advanced the Navy's logistics mission. The team worked to materially improve end-to-end business processes and overall financial audit readiness, by providing visibility of inventory and the financial audit trail. Transparency in financial accounting allows the Navy to make information-based decisions, more effectively and efficiently plan and execute missions, and to meet statutory audit readiness requirements. Navy ERP is the first Navy financial system to undergo a Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) review in support of financial improvement audit readiness. More information on Navy ERP is available at http://www.erp.navy.mil. continuous process improvement Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) is a primary enabler for managing the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in support of the warfighter and business operations, and a critical path toward financial audit readiness. CPI provides our workforce with proven performance improvement tools, such as Lean/Six Sigma and Audit Readiness Training Symposiums, to build a strong warfighter support foundation for improving cycle time and reliability, aligning the work of subordinate organizations to enterprise-wide goals, and optimizing costs. Under the purview of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Navy for Business Operations and Transformation, we are bringing together processes and organizations for the accomplishment of strategic and corporate business objectives. During fiscal year 2013, Sailors and Marines looking for answers on the deployment of continuous process improvement (CPI) in the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) received a one-stop resource. The NAE CPI Guidebook describes and clarifies roles, responsibilities, standards, and proven methods that aid the NAE to assess and improve the performance of its organizations. It also provides standard, solution-oriented, problem-solving methods and concepts that enable personnel to continuously improve performance, maximize the effective use of resources, and move organizations toward the achievement of the strategic goals of the NAE. sYsTeMs, CoNTRols AND legAl CoMpliANCe Commanders and managers throughout the DON must ensure the integrity of their programs and operations. Part of this responsibility entails compliance with Federal requirements for financial reporting, financial management systems, and internal controls, such as the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA). These requirements promote the production of more timely, reliable, and accessible financial information, supported by the development and implementation of more effective internal controls. More useful financial information and effective controls save money and improve efficiency, thereby enhancing public confidence in our stewardship of public resources, which is critical for the protection and sustainment of our nation and vital U.S. interests. Included in this section is the management assurance letter which provides management's assessment of 29 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysisthe effectiveness of the DON's internal controls in conjunction with FFMIA and FMFIA. This section also provides the DON's detailed assessment of the DON's internal controls over non-financial operations, financial reporting, acquisition and financial systems. Management assurances The objectives of the systems of internal accounting and administrative control of the DON are to provide reasonable assurance that: n Obligations and costs are in compliance with applicable laws; n Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and n Applicable revenues and expenditures are properly recorded and accounted for, to permit the preparation of reliable accounting, financial and statistical reports and to maintain accountability over the assets. internal control over Non-Financial operations The DON Managers' Internal Control (MIC) Program is the administrative vehicle for monitoring the Department's systems of internal control by evaluating and maintaining sufficient documentation to support its evaluation and level of assurance. The MIC Program is decentralized and encompasses both shore Commands and afloat forces. The evaluation of internal control extends to every responsibility and activity undertaken by the DON and applies to program, administrative, and operational controls. Primary responsibility for program execution and reporting resides within a network of 19 Major Assessable Units (MAUs), which include the Assistant Secretaries of the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), Secretariat Staff Offices and other entities that report directly to the SECNAV or UNSECNAV . The DON MAUs receive internal control certification statements from their subordinate units, and in turn provide the UNSECNAV with their annual FMFIA Certification Statements. The signed certification statements are used as the primary source documents for the SECNAV's determination of reasonable assurance over the effectiveness of the Department's system of internal control. Complementing the self-reporting of control deficiencies, the DON's Auditor General, in collaboration with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Financial Operations (DASN (FO)), reviews audit reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Department of Defense (DoD) Inspector General and the Naval Audit Service (NAVAUDSVC). This review helps identify control deficiencies and utilizes a systematic methodology to determine materiality. The high degree of collaboration and communication between the DASN (FO) Manager's Internal Control Program (MICP) administrators and the NAVAUDSVC has resulted in a consistent and comprehensive perspective on the DON's internal control posture. oUTsTANDiNg MATeRiAl weAkNess FY 2013 iNTeRNAl CoNTRol RepoRTiNg CATegoRY MATeRiAl weAkNessTARgeT CoRReCTioN YeAR Contract Administration Service Contracts FY 2015 Acquisition Attenuating Hazardous Noise in Acquisition & Weapon System Design FY 2015 Communications/ Intelligence/Security Management of Communications Security (COMSEC) Safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) FY 2014 Procurement/ Contract Administration Effective Use of Earned Value Management (EVM) Across Shipbuilding ProgramsFY 2014 In addition to the operational assessments described above, the DON MIC program includes a separate assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) and Internal Control over Financial Systems (ICOFS). internal control over Financial reporting (icoFr) The DON continues to implement processes to reach a status of full compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix A in conjunction with overall Navy and Marine Corps audit readiness efforts under the DoD FIAR. The DON's current focus is on achieving the FIAR objectives relative to budgetary information and mission critical asset information priorities. Through the DON FIAR discovery process, the DON continues to work closely with participating Commands and service providers, such as the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), to identify, 30 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Reportevaluate and document the risks and internal controls associated with the end-to-end business processes underlying the financial statements. Attention is focused on remediating material weaknesses that will allow for overall achievement of the DON's assertion goals. Through the DON FIAR discovery process, documentation efforts continue as the DON moves toward its objective of asserting audit readiness over all financial reporting segments. In FY 2013, we identified: n 18 material weaknesses in Existence and Completeness, Reimbursable Work Orders - Grantor and Performer, Contract Vendor Pay, Financial Statement Compilation and Reporting, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures, and Transportation of Things. n 1 Nonconformance with Financial Systems. n 3 Corrected Material Weaknesses/Nonconformances, including Fund Balance with Treasury, Reimbursable Work Orders - Grantor and Performer (with the exception of the following processes: Post Collection and Post Disbursement Validation, Year-End Accrual, Triennial Review , and Trading Partner Number Reconciliation), and Transportation of People.

Sarah Fiocco)In FY 2014, FMO plans further discovery and development of corrective actions plans with executable tasks to mitigate the material weaknesses. The Marine Corps continued improving the documentation of specified business processes to assist stakeholders and auditors in obtaining an understanding of financial processes used by the Marine Corps. Revised descriptions are used to identify controls and key controls to test. The Marine Corps ICOFR program aims to support the DON FIAR objectives by targeting specific evaluations that strengthen the integrated objectives of the DON SBR assertion. For FY 2013, the Marine Corps reported material weaknesses in Military Equipment, Real Property, and Contracts. Efforts are underway to address these material weaknesses via formal corrective action plans pending additional analyses and concurrence by the Marine Corps Senior Assessment T eam. internal control over Financial systems (icoFs) The DON understands ICOFS plays a key role in the generation of the DON financial statements. The DON implemented a strategy for identifying and prioritizing assessment of financial and mixed systems. Over two hundred systems are utilized to support Navy's complete set of financial statements. Once a system was identified as audit relevant or critical to the segment assertion package, the DON worked with the segment managers to collect additional data points that would affect the assessment scope, approach, and timeline. The DON conducted FISCAM assessments on select information technology systems and coordinated with service providers such as DFAS, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) to identify and prioritize feeder system assessments. The DON refined its strategy for assessing Legacy and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system controls. The DON prioritized IT controls based on FISCAM and FIAR guidance to ensure financial data integrity and reliability. For FY 2013, the DON tracked, updated, and managed identified systems to support the Office of Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller (OUSD (C)) FIAR identified business segments and financial reporting framework. Below is the management assurance letter for FY 2013.31 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysis 32 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportFiNANCiAl CoNDiTioN AND ResUlTs oF opeRATioNs The accompanying financial statements and related disclosures represent our enduring commitment to fiscal accountability and transparency. Through our FIAR plan and related business transformation initiatives discussed earlier, we have made significant progress toward improving the quality and timeliness of our financial information. However, we are currently unable to fully implement all elements of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and OMB Circular A-136, \"Financial Reporting Requirements,\" due to limitations of our financial and non-financial management processes and systems feeding into the financial statements. Because of these limitations, the DoD, Office of Inspector General, was unable to express an opinion on our FY 2013 financial statements. It should be noted that these limitations exist primarily in our proprietary accounting processes and less so in the budgetary accounting performed to manage and report on the application of budget authority to the purposes and programs approved in appropriations acts. In fact, the U.S. Marine Corps achieved full audit readiness for its SBR and the DON revised its strategy to place first priority on its SBR as well. Despite documented material weaknesses we believe the budgetary information used for decision-making is accurate and reliable because of compensating measures and close oversight. For financial reporting purposes, we are organized into two reporting entities: The DON and Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF), which include financial information for both the U.S. Navy and the USMC. Each reporting entity has a separate set of financial statements and related disclosures. the DoN The DON supports overall Departmental operations. Enacted appropriations comprise the majority of the account structure, which includes five major appropriation groups: n Operation and Maintenance n Military Personnel n Procurement n Research, Development, T est, and Evaluation n Military Construction Enacted appropriations flow through OMB and the Office of the Secretary of Defense to the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, where they are allocated to administering offices and commands. The administering offices and commands, which in turn obligate the appropriations to fund operational expenses and capital investments, are required to exercise a system of effective control over financial operations. results of operations The Combined SBR presents total budgetary resources of $211.7 billion that were available to the DON during FY 2013 and the status of those resources at fiscal year- end. T otal budgetary resources were down $15.1 billion, a 7.1 percent decrease in FY 2013 compared to FY 2012. The enacted appropriations of $161.8 billion represent 76.5 percent of total budgetary resources and decreased $11.6 billion compared to FY 2012. The majority of this decrease was with respect to military construction. Additionally, the decrease in total budgetary resources is attributable to the $32.5 billion unobligated balance brought forward from the prior year, which comprised 14.3 percent of total budgetary resources and decreased $656.2 million compared to FY 2012. The majority of the decrease in unobligated balance brought forward was in the Procurement appropriation accounts. The DON obligated $178.3 billion of the $211.7 billion total resources in FY 2013, which is a decrease of $15.8 billion or 8.1% compared to FY 2012. The Consolidated Statement of Net Cost presents net cost of operations of $145.6 billion during FY 2013. Net cost of operations represents gross costs incurred by the DON less earned revenue. Net cost of operations decreased $24.1 billion, which represents a 16.5 percent decrease over FY 2012.

Net position is the difference between total assets and total liabilities. As of 30 September 2013, net position totaled $504.4 billion, which represents a $51.3 billion or 11.3 percent increase from FY 2012.

Under the revolving fund concept, an appropriation or a transfer of funds finances initial NWCF operations. General or appropriated fund payments from customers for goods delivered or services performed subsequently replenish this initial working capital investment and sustain a continuous cycle of operations, minimizing the need for additional annual appropriations by Congress. The goal of NWCF is to break even over time by matching revenues earned to costs incurred. Achievement of this goal is occasionally complicated by the requirement that NWCF business areas maintain stable budget-driven prices for goods and services, to protect customers from unforeseen price fluctuations.34 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Reportresults of operations The Combined SBR presents total budgetary resources of $32.5 billion that were available to NWCF during FY 2013 and the status of those resources at fiscal year-end. T otal budgetary resources decreased $1.7 billion, which was a 4.9% decrease over FY 2012. NWCF budget authority is comprised of contract authority and spending authority from offsetting collections of which the latter accounts for 61.9% of total budgetary resources. The majority of the decrease in overall budget authority is due to a $1.6 billion decrease in Spending Authority from Offsetting Collections in FY 2013. NWCF business activities obligated $28.9 billion of the $32.5 billion total resources in FY 2013 which represents a decrease of $1.6 billion or 5.2% over FY 2012. The Consolidated Statement of Net Cost presents net cost of operations of $2.4 billion during FY 2013. Net cost of operations represents gross costs incurred by NWCF less earned revenue. Sources of earned revenue include the DON; Army and Air Force General Funds; Defense Working Capital Funds; other Navy and DoD appropriations; and non-DoD fund sources. The Navy had an increase of $0.3 billion in net costs in FY 2013 over FY 2012, which results in a positive net cost of operations.

Webb/Released)37 ManageMent's Discussion anD analysislookiNg FoRwARD The DON's achievements during FY 2013 established a firm foundation that will assure future success in executing the mission of the Navy and Marine Corps, and building a sound business operating environment. In FY 2014, the Navy will focus on achieving the DON's objectives outlined in the Strategic Management section. Of those objectives, the priority is to preserve pay and benefits for Sailors, Marines, and their families, train the workforce, maintain equipment, and help build fleet forces for the future. operating in a Fiscally-Driven Frontier The Fiscal Year 2014 President's Budget reflects a strategic direction grounded in the reality of the nation's fiscal challenges. These decisions encompass the extraordinary circumstances the Navy is faced with daily as result of constrained resources. The Navy must continue to invest in future weapons systems, vehicles, and infrastructure, and scrutinize every option to provide for the most affordable and effective solution. The FY 2014 Budget provides for construction of forty-one new vessels over the Future Years Defense Program. The Navy and Marine Corps are agile and flexible expeditionary forces engaged in a full range of operations around the world. T oday over 42,000 Navy personnel, 20,000 Marines, and 121 ships are underway or deployed worldwide creating a safer, more stable, and more prosperous world for the American people, the nation's allies, and its partners. The Department's global security effort maintains a balance of presence between the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions. Allies such as the United Kingdom and Germany will remain some of the Navy's principal partners in seeking global and economic security for the foreseeable future. Building partnerships elsewhere is also important to protect freedom of access throughout the world. Through partnerships with a growing number of nations, including those in Africa and Latin America, the Navy strives for a common vision of freedom, stability, and prosperity. This focused balance of global efforts using innovative, lower cost and smaller footprint approaches with partners and allies can be attributed to the extraordinary service and sacrifice of our Sailors and Marines. Through their efforts, the Navy-Marine Corps team has helped to end the war in Iraq, put al-Qa'ida on the path to defeat, and has made significant progress in stabilizing Afghanistan, affording the opportunity to begin the transition of forces out of Afghanistan. The Navy continues to impose local sea control, sustain power ashore and play a major strategic role in the Persian Gulf, Horn of Africa and Afghanistan by providing critical force protection requirements, training, equipment, and assistance to the Navy's coalition partners. taking care of our p eople The Department of the Navy is committed to maintaining the finest, highest quality naval force that supports the new strategic guidance for DoD. Its people are a critical component of the Department's Maritime Strategy. America's naval forces are and will remain combat-ready because of the dedication and motivation of Sailors, Marines, and the civilian workforce. The development and retention of quality personnel are vital to meeting the defense strategy goal to be a smaller, leaner, more agile, flexible, ready, and technologically-advanced all-volunteer force. The DON will take care of the total volunteer force by sustaining quality of service/quality of life programs, including training, promotion opportunities, health care, housing, and reasonable operational and personnel tempo. Maintaining Warfighter readiness in an era of reduced Budgets The Department will maintain strong, agile and capable military forces. The security environment today has created new challenges for naval forces, including support demands for security, stabilization, transition and reconstruction operations, support for homeland security, and continued preparedness for contingency operations. The evolving dynamics of the 21st-century security environment require our forces to be ready to deploy globally. The top readiness priority is ensuring that forces are fully trained, ready to deploy, and fully supported while deployed. The budget reflects the best balance of resources to achieve this priority. The Navy will closely manage the readiness accounts to ensure we can fulfill all existing, enduring, and emerging warfighting requirements. investing toward the Joint Force of 2020 The Department of the Navy is dedicated to procuring a naval force that is both affordable and meets the priorities of our nation. The Navy's forces will remain sea based, 38 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Reportwith global speed and persistence provided by forward deployed forces and supplemented by rapidly deployable forces. The Navy will further provide both actionable intelligence and the ability to take action where and when the threat is identified in today's unstable environment. revitalizing the Force ashore Providing Sailors, Marines, and the Department's civilians with high quality facilities, information technology, and an environment to achieve their goals is fundamental to mission accomplishment. The ability to project power through forward deployed naval forces relies heavily on a strong and efficient shore infrastructure. Driving innovative enterprise transformation The Department of the Navy continues its commitment to building a performance based culture and has actively developed process improvements to improve and measure performance. Working in cooperation with the DoD enterprise, the Navy will continue to improve performance measurement and budget reporting and to strengthen links between performance and budget. The DON continues to develop its vision for Business Transformation. Because of the size and complexity of the DON's business operations it is imperative that the Navy-Marine Corps team continues to change its business practices to be more agile, efficient, and increasingly responsive to the warfighter. In these times of fiscal constraint, the DON is challenged to make necessary investments in future capabilities while sustaining current warfighting effectiveness. The DON business process improvement involves executing, aligning and integrating a series of enterprise- wide initiatives which will dramatically transform our ability to execute programs and support our mission. The result will be improved efficiency, better decision-making, and an organizational culture that is performance-based. Collectively, these initiatives will create an environment that produces more accurate and timely business information and will, over time, be endorsed by a favorable third party financial audit. The Department of the Navy continues to look at ways that will best position itself to be prepared to defend the country and complete its mission despite domestic budget shortages and international unrest. liMiTATioNs To The FiNANCiAl sTATeMeNTs The principal financial statements have been prepared to report the financial position and results of operations of the entity, pursuant to the requirements of 31 United States Code 3515 (b).

Basis of Presentation These financial statements have been prepared to report the financial position and results of operations of the Department of the Navy (DON), as required by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and other appropriate legislation. The financial statements have been prepared from the books and records of the DON in accordance with, and to the extent possible, U .S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (USGAAP) promulgated by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB); the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements; and the Department of Defense (DoD), Financial Management Regulation (FMR). The accompanying financial statements account for all resources for which the DON is responsible unless otherwise noted. Information relative to classified assets, programs, and operations is excluded from the statements or otherwise aggregated and reported in such a manner that it is not discernible. The DON financial statements include information from both financial systems and nonfinancial feeder systems. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Cleveland (DFAS-CL) collects information from the financial system and incorporates it into the financial statements for the DON. The DON collects financial information from nonfinancial feeder systems through a data call process and submits it to DFAS-CL for incorporation into the financial statements. On behalf of the DON, DFAS-CL also collects information from multiple sources, such as intragovernmental data from the DON's trading partners, which is incorporated into the financial statements. The Defense Departmental Reporting System Data Collection Module (DDRS DCM) captures certain required financial information from non-integrated systems for the DON financial statements. The DDRS DCM identifies the information requirements to the source provider, and integrates data into the financial statement preparation process. The DON is unable to fully implement all elements of USGAAP and the OMB Circular No. A-136 due to limitations of its financial and nonfinancial management processes and systems that support the financial statements. The DON derives reported values and information for major asset and liability categories largely from nonfinancial systems. These systems were designed to support reporting requirements for maintaining accountability over assets and reporting the status of federal appropriations rather than preparing financial statements in accordance with USGAAP . The DON continues to implement process and system improvements addressing these limitations. The DON is currently converting legacy systems to Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and developing plans to ensure accurate and complete financial records. The Department of Defense Inspector General (DoDIG) issued an audit report identifying 11 financial statement material weaknesses: (1) Financial Management Systems; (2) Fund Balance With Treasury; (3) Problem Disbursements; (4) Unobligated Balances; (5) Financial Reporting of Plan to Perform/Order to Cash; (6) Financial Reporting of Operating Materials and Supplies; (7) Financial Reporting of General Equipment, Real Property, and Military Equipment; (8) Accounts Payable; (9) Other Assets; (10) Statement of Changes in Net Position; (11) Statement of Net Cost. The FY 2012 financial statements were reclassified to conform to the FY 2013 financial statement presentation requirements. Changes to the presentation of the Combined and Combining Statements of Budgetary Resources were made, in accordance with guidance provided in OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements, and as such, activity and balances reported on the FY 2012 Combined and Combining Statement of Budgetary Resources have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current year. Certain other prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no material effect on total assets, liabilities, net position, change in net position, or budgetary resources as previously reported. Subsequent events and transactions occurring after September 30, 2013 through the date of the auditors' opinion should be evaluated for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. However, the DON is not yet able to implement this requirement. The date of the auditors' opinion also represents the date that the financial statements were available to be issued. 1 .B . Mission of the Reporting Entity The DON was created on April 30, 1798 by an act of Congress (I Stat. 533; 5 U .S .C . 411-12) . The overall mission of the DON is to maintain, train, and equip combat-ready Navy and Marine Corps forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression, and maintaining freedom of the seas.65 Department of the na vy1 .C . Appropriations and Funds The DON receives appropriations and funds as general, working capital (revolving), trust, special, and deposit funds. The DON uses these appropriations and funds (excluding deposit funds) to execute its missions and subsequently report on resource usage. General funds are used for financial transactions funded by congressional appropriations, including personnel, operation and maintenance, research and development, procurement, and family housing and military construction. These general funds also include supplemental funds enacted by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) of 2009. The National Defense Sealift Fund is the DON's only revolving fund. Revolving funds are generally established for carrying out specific activities. Revolving funds are financed through an appropriation or a transfer to establish a corpus and are replenished through charges made for goods or services without fiscal year limitations. The National Defense Sealift Fund receives an annual appropriation and has no corpus. Trust funds contain receipts and expenditures of funds held in trust by the government for use in carrying out specific purposes or programs in accordance with the terms of the donor, trust agreement, or statute. Special fund accounts are used to record government receipts reserved for a specific purpose. Certain trust and special funds may be designated as funds from dedicated collections. Funds from dedicated collections are financed by specifically identified revenues, required by statute to be used for designated activities, benefits or purposes, and remain available over time. The DON is required to separately account for and report on the receipt, use and retention of revenues and other financing sources for funds from dedicated collections. Deposit funds are used to record amounts held temporarily until paid to the appropriate government or public entity. They are not the DON funds, and as such, are not available for the DON's operations. The DON is acting as an agent or a custodian for funds awaiting distribution. The DON is a party to allocation transfers with other federal agencies as a transferring (parent) entity or receiving (child) entity. An allocation transfer is an entity's legal delegation of authority to obligate budget authority and outlay funds on its behalf. Generally, all financial activity related to allocation transfers (e.g. budget authority, obligations, outlays) is reported in the financial statements of the parent entity. Exceptions to this general rule apply to specific funds for which OMB has directed that all activity be reported in the financial statements of the child entity. These exceptions include U.S. Treasury-Managed Trust Funds, Executive Office of the President (EOP), and all other funds specifically designated by OMB. Additionally, the DON receives allocation transfers from the EOP for the Foreign Military Financing Program (meeting the OMB exception), the International Military Education and Training Program, U.S. Forest Service, and the Federal Highway Administration. The activities for these funds are reported separately from the DoD financial statements and reported to the parent. The DON receives allocation transfers for the Security Assistance programs that meet the OMB exception for EOP funds. These funds are reported separately from the DoD financial statements based on an agreement with OMB. 1 .D . Basis of Accounting The DON's financial management systems are unable to meet all full accrual accounting requirements. Many of the DON's financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes were designed and implemented prior to the issuance of USGAAP . These systems were not designed to collect and record financial information on the full accrual accounting basis as required by USGAAP . Most of the DON's financial and nonfinancial legacy systems were designed to record information on a budgetary basis. Although the DON has not fully implemented accrual accounting, under the accrual basis, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged. Under the budgetary basis, however, funds availability is recorded based upon legal considerations and constraints. As a result, certain line items on the proprietary financial statements may not equal similar line items on the budgetary financial statements.66 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportThe DON financial statements and supporting trial balances are compiled from the underlying financial data and trial balances of the DON's sub-entities. The underlying data is largely derived from budgetary transactions (obligations, disbursements, and collections), from nonfinancial feeder systems, and accruals made for major items such as payroll expenses, accounts payable, environmental liabilities, and Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) liabilities. Some of the sub-entity level trial balances may reflect known abnormal balances resulting largely from business and system processes. At the consolidated DON level these abnormal balances may not be evident. Disclosures of abnormal balances are made in the applicable footnotes, but only to the extent that the abnormal balances are evident at the consolidated level. The DoD is determining the actions required to bring its financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes into compliance with USGAAP . One such action is the conversion of the DON's legacy systems to ERP which is designed to modernize and standardize Navy's business practices. Navy ERP was developed utilizing the USSGL account structure to better comply with applicable financial management requirements. Until all the DON financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes are updated to collect and report financial information as required by USGAAP , financial data will be derived from proprietary transactions, data from nonfinancial feeder systems, and accruals. The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 1 .E . Revenues and Other Financing Sources The DON receives congressional appropriations as financing sources for the DON that expire annually, on a multi-year basis, or do not expire. When authorized by legislation, these appropriations are supplemented by revenues generated by sales of goods or services. The DON recognizes revenue as a result of costs incurred for goods and services provided to other federal agencies and the public. Full-cost pricing is the DON's standard policy for services provided as required by OMB Circular A-25, User Charges. The DON recognizes revenue when earned within the constraints of its current system capabilities. The DON does not include nonmonetary support provided by U.S. allies for common defense and mutual security in amounts reported in the Statement of Net Cost. The U.S. has cost sharing agreements with countries having a mutual or reciprocal defense agreement, where U.S. troops are stationed, or where the U.S. Fleet is in a port. 1.F. Recognition of Expenses For financial reporting purposes, DoD policy requires the recognition of operating expenses in the period incurred. However, current financial and nonfinancial feeder systems were not designed to collect and record financial information on the full accrual accounting basis. Estimates are made for major items such as payroll expenses, accounts payable, environmental liabilities, and FECA liabilities. In the case of Operating Materials & Supplies (OM&S), operating expenses are generally recognized when the items are purchased. Efforts are underway to transition to the consumption method for recognizing OM&S expenses. Under the consumption method, OM&S would be expensed when consumed. Due to system limitations, in some instances expenditures for capital and other long-term assets may be recognized as operating expenses. The DON continues to implement process and system improvements to address these limitations. 1 .G . Accounting for Intragovernmental Activities Accounting standards require that an entity eliminates intra-entity activity and balances from consolidated financial statements in order to prevent overstatement for business with itself. However, the DON cannot accurately identify intragovernmental transactions by customer because the DON's systems do not track buyer and seller data at the transaction level. Generally, seller entities within the DoD provide summary seller-side balances for revenue, accounts receivable, and unearned revenue to the buyer-side internal accounting offices. In most cases, the buyer-side records are adjusted to agree with DoD seller-side balances and are then eliminated. The DoD is implementing replacement systems and a standard financial information structure that will incorporate the necessary elements that will enable DoD to correctly report, reconcile, and eliminate intragovernmental balances. Treasury Financial Manual Part 2 - Chapter 4700, \"Agency Reporting Requirements for the Financial Report of the United States Government\" provides guidance for reporting and reconciling intragovernmental balances. While the DON is unable to fully reconcile intragovernmental transactions with all federal agencies, the DON is able to reconcile balances pertaining to investments in federal securities, borrowings from the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Financing 67 Department of the na vyBank, FECA transactions with the U.S. Department of Labor, and benefit program transactions with the Office of Personnel Management. The DoD's proportionate share of public debt and related expenses of the Federal Government is not included. The Federal Government does not apportion debt and its related costs to federal agencies. The DoD's financial statements do not report any public debt, interest, or source of public financing, whether from issuance of debt or tax revenues. Generally, financing for the construction of DoD facilities is obtained through appropriations. T o the extent this financing ultimately may have been obtained through the issuance of public debt, interest costs have not been capitalized since the U.S. Treasury does not allocate such costs to DoD. 1 .H . Transactions with Foreign Governments and International Organizations Each year, the DON sells defense articles and services to foreign governments and international organizations under the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. Under the provisions of the Act, DoD has authority to sell defense articles and services to foreign countries and international organizations generally at no profit or loss to the Federal Government. Payment in U.S. dollars is required in advance. 1 .I . Funds with the U .S . Treasury The DON's monetary resources are maintained in U.S. Treasury accounts. The disbursing offices of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), the Military Departments, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Department of State's financial service centers process the majority of the DON's cash collections, disbursements, and adjustments worldwide. Each disbursing station prepares monthly reports to the U.S. Treasury on checks issued, electronic fund transfers, interagency transfers, and deposits. In addition, DFAS sites and USACE Finance Center submit reports to the U.S. Treasury by appropriation on interagency transfers, collections received, and disbursements issued. The U.S. Treasury records these transactions to the applicable Fund Balance with Treasury (FBWT) account. On a monthly basis DFAS performs a reconciliation between the DON's FBWT and the U.S. Treasury. 1 .J . Cash and Other Monetary Assets Cash is the total of cash resources under the control of DoD which includes coin, paper currency, negotiable instruments, and amounts held for deposit in banks and other financial institutions. Foreign currency consists of the total U.S. dollar equivalent of both purchased and nonpurchased foreign currencies held in foreign currency fund accounts. Foreign currency is valued using the U.S. Treasury prevailing rate of exchange. The majority of cash and all foreign currency is classified as \"nonentity\" and is restricted. Amounts reported consist primarily of cash and foreign currency held by disbursing officers to carry out their paying, collecting, and foreign currency accommodation exchange missions. The DON conducts a significant portion of operations overseas. Congress established a special account to handle the gains and losses from foreign currency transactions for five DON appropriations: (1) operations and maintenance; (2) military personnel; (3) military construction; (4) family housing operation and maintenance; and (5) family housing construction. The gains and losses are calculated as the variance between the exchange rate current at the date of payment and a budget rate established at the beginning of each fiscal year. Foreign currency fluctuations related to other appropriations require adjustments to the original obligation amount at the time of payment. The DON does not separately identify currency fluctuation transactions. 1 .K . Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable from other federal entities or the public include: accounts receivable, claims receivable, and refunds receivable. In accordance with SFFAS No. 1, Accounting for Selected Assets and Liabilities, the methodology for losses due to uncollectable amounts are based on an individual account analysis and/or group analysis. The analysis is based on three years of receivable data. This data is used to determine the historical percentage of collections in each age category of receivables. The DON does not recognize an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts from other federal agencies. Claims against other federal agencies are to be resolved between the agencies in accordance with dispute 68 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Reportresolution procedures defined in the Treasury Financial Manual Part 2, Chapter 4700, Appendix 10, \"Intragovernmental Business Rules\". 1 .L . Inventories and Related Property The DON manages only military or government-specific materiel under normal conditions. Materiel is a unique term that relates to military force management, and includes items such as ships, tanks, self-propelled weapons, aircraft, support equipment, etc. As it relates to the DON, OM&S includes the related spares and repair parts for materiel. Items commonly used in and available from the commercial sector are not managed in the DON's materiel management activities. The DON holds materiel based on military need and support for contingencies. The DON uses both the consumption method and the purchase method of accounting for OM&S. The DON OM&S is categorized as operating materials and supplies held for use, operating materials and supplies held in reserve for future use (held for repair) (including munitions not held for sale) and excess, obsolete and unserviceable operating material and supplies. Items that are centrally managed and stored, such as ammunition and engines, are generally recorded using the consumption method and are reported on the Balance Sheet as OM&S. When current systems cannot fully support the consumption method, the DON uses the purchase method. Under this method, materials and supplies are expensed when purchased. During FY 2013 and 2012, the DON expensed significant amounts using the purchase method because the systems could not support the consumption method or management deemed that the item was in the hands of the end user. This is a material weakness for the DoD and long-term system corrections are in process. Once the proper systems are in place, these items will be accounted for under the consumption method of accounting. The DON OM&S assets held for use and held for repair use three cost valuation methods: Standard Price (SP), Latest Acquisition Cost (LAC), and Moving Average Cost (MAC). Excess, obsolete, and unserviceable OM&S are cost valued using Net Realizable Value pending development of an effective means of valuing such material. The LAC method is used because legacy logistics systems were designed for material management rather than accounting purposes. Although these systems provide visibility and accountability over inventory and related property items, they do not maintain historical cost data necessary to comply with SFFAS No. 3. Additionally, these legacy inventory systems cannot produce financial transactions using the USSGL, as required by the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). The DON is continuing to transition OM&S to the MAC method. Most transitioned balances, however, were not baselined to auditable historical cost, and remain noncompliant with SFFAS No. 3. The DON determined that the recurring high dollar value of OM&S in need of repair is material to the financial statements and requires a separate reporting category. Many high dollar items, such as aircraft engines, are categorized as OM&S rather than military equipment. 1 .M . Investments in U .S . Treasury Securities The DON reports investments in accordance with SFFAS No. 1, Accounting for Selected Assets and Liabilities. The DON reports U.S. Treasury securities at cost, net of amortized premiums or discounts. Premiums or discounts are amortized over the term of the investments using the effective interest rate method or another method obtaining similar results. The DON's intent is to hold investments to maturity, unless they are needed to finance claims or otherwise sustain operations. Consequently, a provision is not made for unrealized gains or losses on these securities. The DON invests in nonmarketable market-based U.S. Treasury securities, which are issued to federal agencies by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt. They are not traded on any securities exchange but mirror the prices of particular U.S. Treasury securities traded in the government securities market. 1 .N . General Property, Plant and Equipment General Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) assets are capitalized in accordance with SFFAS No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment, as amended by SFFAS Nos. 10, 23, and 35, when an asset has a useful life of two or more years and when the acquisition cost equals or exceeds DoD's capitalization threshold. The DoD also requires the capitalization of improvements to existing General PP&E assets if the improvements equal or exceed the capitalization threshold and extend the useful life or increase the size, efficiency, or capacity of the asset. The DON depreciates all General PP&E, other than land and Military Equipment (ME) classified as aircraft, on a straight-line basis in accordance with FMR Volume 4 Chapter 6. The DoD's General PP&E capitalization threshold is $100 thousand except for real property, which is $20 thousand.69 Department of the na vyThe DON uses a combination of actual expenditure data and program funding to calculate the value for ME in accordance with SFFAS No. 35. The DON is developing a process to track and record actual ME costs. The ME value is updated using expenditure, acquisition, and disposal information. When it is in the best interest of the government, the DON provides government property to contractors to complete contract work. The DON either owns or leases such property, or it is purchased directly by the contractor for the government based on contract terms. When the value of contractor-procured General PP&E meets or exceeds the DoD capitalization threshold, federal accounting standards require that it be reported on the DON's Balance Sheet. The DoD developed policy and a reporting process for contractors with government furnished equipment that provides appropriate General PP&E information for financial statement reporting in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The DoD requires the DON to maintain, in their property systems, information on all property furnished to contractors. These actions are structured to capture and report the information necessary for compliance with federal accounting standards. The DON has not fully implemented this policy primarily due to system limitations. 1 .O . Advances and Prepayments When advances are permitted by law , legislative action, or presidential authorization, DoD's policy as prescribed in SFFAS No. 1, Accounting for Selected Assets and Liabilities is to record advances or prepayments in accordance with USGAAP . As such, payments made prior to the receipt of goods and services should be reported as an asset on the Balance Sheet. The DoD's policy is to expense and/or properly classify assets when the related goods and services are received. The DON has not implemented this policy primarily due to system limitations. Due to inconsistencies in the posting logic for Nonfederal Advances and Prepayments, the DON is noncompliant with the FFMIA, which requires agencies to comply with the Federal financial management systems requirements, standards promulgated by the FASAB, and the USSGL at the transaction level. 1 .P . Leases In accordance with SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, lease payments for the rental of equipment and operating facilities are classified as either capital or operating leases. When a lease is essentially equivalent to an installment purchase of property (a capital lease), and the value equals or exceeds the current capitalization threshold, the DON records the applicable asset as though purchased, with an offsetting liability, and depreciates it. The DON records the asset and the liability at the lesser of the present value of the rental and other lease payments during the lease term (excluding portions representing executory costs paid to the lessor) or the asset's fair market value. The discount rate for the present value calculation is either the lessor's implicit interest rate or the government's incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the lease. The DON, as the lessee, receives the use and possession of leased property, for example real estate or equipment, from a lessor in exchange for a payment of funds. An operating lease does not substantially transfer all the benefits and risk of ownership. Payments for operating leases are expensed over the lease term as they become payable. Office space leases entered into by the DON are the largest component of operating leases and are based on costs gathered from existing leases, General Services Administration bills, and interservice support agreements. Future year projections use the Consumer Price Index. 1 .q . Other Assets Other assets include those assets, such as military and civil service employee pay advances and certain contract financing payments that are not reported elsewhere on the DON's Balance Sheet. The DON maintains this classification in accordance with SFFAS No. 1. Advances are cash outlays made by the DON to its employees, contractors, or others to cover a part or all of the recipients' anticipated expenses. Military pay advances are advance payments authorized for purposes intended to ease hardships imposed by the lack of regular payments when a military member is mobilized, ordered to duty at distant stations, or deployed aboard ships for more than 30 days. Civilian pay advances are payments advanced to full time the DON civilians intended to finance unusual employee expenses associated with oversea assignments that are not otherwise reimbursed and to aid foreign assignment recruitment and retention. Travel advances are disbursed to employees prior to business trips. Travel advances are subsequently reduced when travel expenses are actually incurred.70 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportThe DON conducts business with commercial contractors under two primary types of contracts: fixed price and cost reimbursable. T o alleviate the potential financial burden on the contractor that long-term contracts can cause, the DON may provide financing payments. Contract financing payments are defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 32, as authorized disbursements to a contractor prior to acceptance of supplies or services by the Government. It is DoD policy to record certain contract financing payments as other assets. The DON has not fully implemented this policy primarily due to system limitations. 1 .R . Contingencies and Other Liabilities The DON is party to various administrative proceedings, legal actions, and claims. Under SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, as amended by SFFAS No. 12, Recognition of Contingent Liabilities Arising from Litigation, the Balance Sheet should include estimated liabilities for these items when an adverse decision is probable, reasonably possible, and estimable. When the amount of the potential loss cannot be estimated or the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is remote, the contingency is not disclosed. Financial statement reporting is limited to disclosure when conditions for liability recognition do not exist but there is at least a reasonable possibility of incurring a loss or additional losses. The DON's risk of loss and resultant contingent liabilities arise from pending or threatened litigation or claims and assessments due to events such as aircraft, ship, and vehicle accidents; medical malpractice; property or environmental damages; and contract disputes. Other liabilities also arise as a result of anticipated disposal costs for the DON's assets. Consistent with SFFAS No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment, recognition of an anticipated environmental disposal liability begins when the asset is placed into service. The DON adheres to the DoD's policy, which is consistent with SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of Federal Government, and states that nonenvironmental disposal liabilities are recognized when management decides to dispose of an asset. The DoD recognizes nonenvironmental disposal liabilities for military equipment nuclear-powered assets when placed into service. These amounts are not easily distinguishable and are developed in conjunction with environmental disposal costs. 1 .S . Accrued Leave Military leave, compensatory and annual leave earned by civilians, but not yet used, is reported as accrued liabilities. The accrued balance is adjusted annually to reflect current pay rates. Any portions of the accrued leave, for which funding is not available, are recorded as an unfunded liability. Sick leave for civilians is expensed as taken. 1 .T . Net Position Net Position consists of unexpended appropriations and cumulative results of operations. Unexpended Appropriations represent the amounts of budget authority that are unobligated and have not been rescinded or withdrawn. Unexpended appropriations also represent amounts obligated for which legal liabilities for payments have not been incurred. Cumulative Results of Operations represent the net difference between expenses and losses, and financing sources (including appropriations, revenue, and gains), since inception. The cumulative results of operations also include donations and transfers in and out of assets that were not reimbursed. 1 .U . Treaties for Use of Foreign Bases The DoD has the use of land, buildings, and other overseas facilities that are obtained through various international treaties and agreements negotiated by the Department of State. The DON purchases capital assets overseas with appropriated funds; however, the host country retains title to the land and capital improvements. Treaty terms generally allow the DON continued use of these properties until the treaties expire. In the event treaties or other agreements are terminated, use of the foreign bases is prohibited and losses are recorded for the value of any nonretrievable capital assets. The settlement due to the U.S. or host nation is negotiated and takes into account the value of capital investments and may be offset by the cost of environmental cleanup. 1 .V . Undistributed Disbursements and Collections Undistributed disbursements and collections represent the difference between disbursements and collections matched at the transaction level to specific obligations, payables, or receivables in the source systems and those reported by the U.S. 71 Department of the na vyTreasury. Supported disbursements and collections may be evidenced by the availability of corroborating documentation that would generally support the summary-level adjustments made to accounts payable and receivable. Both supported and unsupported adjustments may have been made to the DON's Accounts Payable and Receivable trial balances prior to validating that the underlying transactions required to establish the Accounts Payable/Receivable were previously made. As a result, misstatements of reported Accounts Payable and Receivables are likely present in the DON's financial statements. Due to noted material weaknesses in current accounting and financial feeder systems, the DoD is generally unable to determine whether undistributed disbursements and collections should be applied to federal or nonfederal accounts payable/receivable at the time accounting reports are prepared. Accordingly, the DoD policy is to allocate supported undistributed disbursements and collections between federal and nonfederal categories based on the percentage of distributed federal and nonfederal accounts payable and accounts receivable. Both supported and unsupported undistributed disbursements and collections are then applied to reduce accounts payable and receivable accordingly. 1 .W . Fiduciary Activities Fiduciary cash and other assets are not assets of the DON and are not recognized on the balance sheet. Fiduciary activities are reported on the financial statement note schedules in accordance with SFFAS No. 31, Accounting for Fiduciary Activities. 1.X. Federal Employee and Veteran Benefits For financial reporting purposes, the DON's actuarial liability for workers' compensation benefits is developed by the Department of Labor and provided to the DON at the end of each fiscal year. Military retirement is accounted for in the audited financial statements of the Military Retirement fund; as such, the DON does not record any liabilities or obligations for pensions or healthcare retirement benefits.

It primarily consists of unobligated and obligated balances. The balances reflect the budgetary authority remaining for disbursement against current or future obligations. Unobligated Balance is classified as available or unavailable and represents the cumulative amount of budgetary authority that has not been set aside to cover outstanding obligations. The unavailable balance consists primarily of funds invested in U.S. Treasury securities that are temporarily precluded from obligation by law . Certain unobligated balances are restricted for future use and are not apportioned for current use. Unobligated balances for trust fund accounts are restricted for use by the public law that established the funds. Obligated Balance not yet Disbursed represents funds that have been obligated for goods and services not received, and those received but not paid. Non-budgetary FBWT includes accounts that do not have budgetary authority, such as deposit funds, unavailable receipt accounts, clearing accounts and nonentity FBWT .

Claims with other federal agencies are resolved in accordance with the Intragovernmental Business Rules. Refer to Note 2, Nonentity Assets for additional information on non-Federal Accounts Receivable. Since the DON is at risk of not collecting on these public accounts receivable, the DON is recognizing an allowance for uncollectible amounts. The methodology used in determining the allowance amount is discussed in Note 1.K. The DON is currently working on an effort to drive compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, Section 20.4(b)(4). Non-compliance results in unsupported departmental level adjustments which negatively impacts achievement of the DON's audit readiness goals for its Statement of Budgetary Resources. The DON is partnering with the DFAS to clarify guidance, resolve funding issues and standardize business practices. In addition, the DON and DFAS are aggressively pursuing collection mechanisms for amounts currently due from the public.

Nonfederal other assets - outstanding contract Financing p ayments (ocFp) Contract terms and conditions for certain types of contract financing payments conveying certain rights to the Government that protect the contract work from state or local taxation, liens or attachment by the contractor's creditors, transfer of property, or disposition in bankruptcy. However, these rights should not be misconstrued to mean that ownership of the contractor's work has transferred to the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not have the right to take the work, except as provided in contract clauses related to termination or acceptance, and the DON is not obligated to make payment to the contractor until delivery and acceptance. Some of the amounts reported as OCFP may be progress payments based on percentage or stage of completion. However, the DON is unable to identify these due to system limitations and all amounts are reported as OCFP . The balance of OCFP includes $49.1 billion in contract financing payments and an additional $1.3 billion in estimated future payments to contractors upon delivery and government acceptance of a satisfactory product.

OM&S Held for Use includes spare and repair parts, clothing and textiles, and petroleum products. OM&S Held for Repair consists of damaged material held as inventory that is more economical to repair than to dispose. The DON is currently using the allowance method of accounting for repairables in the legacy accounting system and the direct method of accounting for repairables in Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). Excess, Obsolete, and Unserviceable OM&S consists of scrap material or items that cannot be economically repaired and are awaiting disposal. The consumption method shall be applied when accounting for OM&S and valued at moving average cost using historical cost or any method approximating historical cost (e.g., standard cost or latest acquisition cost). Exceptions to the consumption method are provided when (1) the OM&S are not significant amounts, (2) they are in the hands of the end user for use in normal operations, or (3) it is not cost beneficial to apply the consumption method. In any of these events, the purchase method is allowed. Legacy accounting systems cannot support the consumption method of accounting, thus the various reporting activities are currently using the purchase method. As financial reporting entities begin to purchase material in Navy ERP , the consumption method will be properly applied. OM&S includes spare and repair parts, ammunition, conventional missiles, torpedoes, aircraft configuration pods, and centrally managed aircraft engines. The Moving Average Cost valuation method is used for a majority of the OM&S categories; however Actual Cost and Latest Acquisition Cost are also valuation methods applied depending on the legacy inventory system used to forecast OM&S cost. Ammunition and Munitions are maintained in the DON Ordnance Information System and valued at latest acquisition cost. Principal End and Secondary Items include OM&S such as shipboard hull, mechanical and electronic equipment, and uninstalled aircraft engines. They are items of such importance that central inventory control is required to provide the readiness of the material for the Fleet. These items possess one of the following characteristics: essential for combat or training; high dollar value; difficult to procure or produce; or critical basic material or component parts. Principal End and Secondary Items are valued at Moving Average Cost. Other OM&S consists primarily of Fleet Hospitals held by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery and War Reserve material in possession of the U.S. Coast Guard. 77 Department of the na vyNoTe 9. geNeRAl pp&e, NeT As of September 30 (Amounts in thousands) 2013 Depreciation/ Amortization Method service life Acquisition v alueAccumulated Depreciation/ Amortization Net book v alue Major Asset Classes Land N/A N/A $ 659,876 $ N/A $ 659,876 Buildings, or 507,075,925 $ (237,123,939) $ 269,951,986 As of September 30 (Amounts in thousands) 2012 Depreciation/ Amortization Method service life Acquisition v alueAccumulated Depreciation/ Amortization Net book v alue Major Asset Classes Land N/A N/A $ 612,657 $ N/A $ 612,657 Buildings, or 228,851,453 for v aluation Methods: S/L = Straight Line N/A = Not Applicable The DON has the use of land, buildings, and other overseas facilities that are obtained through various international treaties and agreements negotiated by the Department of State.

Other General PP&E consists of Real Property held in Caretaker Status. Caretaker is defined as those properties that Navy still owns, but which are being held awaiting further disposal action to another entity, such as Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) property awaiting sale or transfer to another Federal agency. As of September 30, 2013, the accumulated depreciation related to these assets in Caretaker status are currently included in the total accumulated depreciation of Buildings Structures and Facilities still in service and is unknown at this time.

The DON's policy is to preserve its heritage assets, which are items of historical, cultural, educational, or artistic importance. Heritage assets within the DON consist of buildings and structures, archeological sites, and museum collections. The DON defines these as follows: Buildings and Structures . Buildings and structures that are listed on, or eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places, including Multi-Use Heritage Assets. Archeological Sites . Sites that have been identified, evaluated, and determined to be eligible for or are listed on the National Historical Places in accordance with Section 110 National Historical Preservation Act. Museum Collection Items . Items that are unique for one or more of the following reasons: historical or natural significance; cultural, educational, or artistic importance; or significant technical or architectural characteristics.The DON's stewardship land consists mainly of mission essential land acquired by donation or devise. The DON held the above acres of land as of September 30, 2013. The Marine Corps continues to make updates to their beginning balances as a result of audit findings.The overall mission of the DON is to control and maintain freedom of the seas, project power beyond the sea, and influence events and advance U.S. interests across the full spectrum of military operations. As this mission has been executed, the DON has become a large-scale owner of historic buildings, structures, districts, archeological sites and artifacts, ships, aircraft, other cultural resources, and several hundred installations to include stewardship land. Protection of these components of the nation's heritage assets and stewardship land is an essential part of the DON's mission; the DON is committed to responsible cultural resources stewardship.79 Department of the na vyNoTe 10. liAbiliTies NoT CoveReD bY bUDgeTARY ResoURCes As of September 30 (Amounts in thousands) 2013 2012 intragovernmental other liabilities $ 476,783 $ 519,939 Accounts payable $ 4,725 $ 20,837 Federal Employee and Veteran Benefits 1,718,646 1,670,271 environmental and Disposal liabilities 21,663,602 21,599,934 other liabilities 4,501,869 4,924,700 Total liabilities Not Covered by budgetary Resources $ 28,365,625 $ 28,735,681 Total liabilities Covered by budgetary Resources $ 10,402,265 $ 8,913,483 Total liabilities $ 38,767,890 $ 37,649,164 Liabilities Not Covered by Budgetary Resources includes liabilities for which congressional action is needed before budgetary resources can be provided.

Environmental restoration activities may be conducted at operating installations under the Installation Restoration Program (IRP) and at Closed, Transferred, and Transferring Munitions Ranges under the MilitaryMunitions Response Program (MMRP). Determining total environmental cleanup cost considers, on a current cost basis, the anticipated actions required to complete the cleanup, as well as applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements. Program management and support costs are also included in the estimates. The estimate produced is based on site-specific information and use of cost models. The cost estimates are developed and maintained in the DON's Normalization of Data System (NORM) database. Such cost estimates are based on the current technology available. MMRP liabilities are specific to the identification, investigation, removal, and remedial actions to address environmental contamination at ranges that were closed prior to September 30, 2002. The contamination may include munitions, chemical residues from military munitions and munitions scrap at ranges on active installations that pose a threat to human health or the environment. Cost to Complete (CTC) is not estimated until there is sufficient site-specific data available to estimate the total CTC. However, the DON uses the cost of the study as the estimate until the study is completed. The Accrued environmental restoration costs do not include the costs of environmental compliance, pollution prevention, conservation activities, contamination, or spills associated with current operations or treaty obligations, all of which are accounted for as part of ongoing operations. Environmental Disposal for Weapons Systems Programs : This area represents environmental liabilities associated with the Nuclear Powered Aircraft Carriers and Submarines, Other Nuclear Powered Ships, Conventional Ships, and Spent Nuclear Fuel. During FY 2006, under the DON Financial Improvement Program (FIP), the DON completed a review of the estimating methodology for determining the cost for disposal of ships and submarines. This review resulted in an environmental and non-environmental liability estimate that more accurately reflects the true costs of disposal. The estimating methodology is based on average cost per class of ship rather than an average applied to all ships regardless of class. Description of the types of environmental liabilities and Disposal liabilities Accrued Environmental Restoration Liabilities The DON environmental cleanup cost estimate was based on 3,919 IRP and 365 MMRP sites at 207 active installations. As of September 30, 2013, the DON estimated and reported $4.7 billion for environmental restoration liabilities. This amount is comprised of $2.7 billion in Active Installations-IRP liabilities and $2.0 billion in Active Installations-MMRP liabilities. Other Accrued Environmental Liabilities - Non-BRAC The DON defines Non-BRAC environmental units as those sites associated with on-going operations such as solid waste management unit cleanup, landfill closure, permitted facilities, removal, replacement, retro fill, and/or disposal of PCB transformers, underground storage tank remedial investigation and closure. Base Realignment and Closure Installations BRAC environmental sites are environmental sites at the DON installations that are or will be closed under the congressionally mandated BRAC process. As of September 30, 2013, the DON has estimated and reported $1.51 billion for BRAC funded environmental liabilities. This amount includes $1.4 billion for IRP , $0.1 billion for MMRP , and 82 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report$0.01 billion for environmental corrective action and closure requirements. MMRP includes military munitions, chemical residues from military munitions, and munitions scrap at locations on a BRAC installation. Environmental Disposal for Military Equipment / Weapons Programs Environmental Disposal for Weapons Systems are those estimates associated with the environmental disposal costs for the DON Nuclear Weapons Programs that include Nuclear Powered Aircraft Carriers and Submarines and Other Nuclear Powered Ships, Conventional Ships, and Spent Nuclear Fuel. Nature of Estimates and the Disclosure of Information Regarding Possible Changes due to Inflation, Deflation, T echnology, or Applicable Laws and Regulations Estimated environmental liabilities are adjusted for price growth (inflation) and increases in labor rates and materials. Currently, there are no indications that any of the environmental liabilities for any category will be adjusted due to deflation. As of September 30, 2013, there are no changes to the environmental liability estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, and agreements with regulatory agencies. The DON does not have any estimates that were changed due to advances in technology. Description of the Level of Uncertainty Regarding the Accounting Estimates used to calculate the Reported Environmental Liabilities The environmental liabilities for the DON are based on accounting estimates, which require certain judgments and assumptions that are reasonable based upon information available at the time the estimates are calculated. The actual results may materially vary from the accounting estimates if agreements with regulatory agencies require remediation to a different degree than when calculating the estimates. Liabilities can be further affected if investigation of the environmental sites reveals contamination levels that differ from the estimate parameters.

Contingent Liabilities includes $1.3 billion related to contracts authorizing progress payments based on cost as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). In accordance with contract terms, specific rights to the contractors' work vests with the Federal Government when a specific type of contract financing payment is made. This action protects taxpayer funds in the event of contract nonperformance. It is DoD policy that these rights should not be misconstrued as rights of ownership. The DON is under no obligation to pay contractors for amounts greater than the amounts of progress payments authorized in contracts until delivery and government acceptance. Due to the probability the contractors will complete their efforts and deliver satisfactory products, and because the amount of contractor costs incurred but not yet paid are estimable, the DON has recognized a contingent liability for the estimated unpaid costs that are considered conditional for payment pending delivery and government acceptance. The estimate of total contingent liabilities for progress payments are based on cost that represent the difference between the estimated costs incurred to date by contractors and amounts authorized to be paid under progress payments based on cost provisions within the FAR. Estimated contractor-incurred costs are calculated by dividing the cumulative unliquidated progress payments based on cost by the contract-authorized progress payment rate. The balance of unliquidated progress payments based on cost is deducted from the estimated total contractor-incurred costs to determine the contingency amount. The abnormal balance in non-Federal Other Liabilities is under investigation. It is likely related to ongoing general ledger posting issues to be addressed through audit readiness efforts. NoTe 14. CoMMiTMeNTs AND CoNTiNgeNCies The DON is a party in various administrative proceedings and legal actions related to claims for environmental damage, equal opportunity matters, and contractual bid protests, which may ultimately result in settlements or decisions adverse to the Federal Government. These proceedings and actions arise in the normal course of operations and their ultimate disposition is unknown. The DON has accrued contingent liabilities for legal actions where the Office of General 84 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportCounsel (OGC) considers an adverse decision probable and the amount of the loss is measurable. In the event of an adverse judgment against the Government, some of the liabilities may be payable from the U.S. Treasury Judgment Fund. The DON records contingent liabilities in Note 13, Other Liabilities. For FY 2013, the DON materiality threshold for reporting litigation, claims, or assessments is $52.1 million. The DON OGC conducts a review of litigation and claims threatened or asserted involving the DON to which the OGC attorneys devoted substantial attention in the form of legal consultation or representation. The DON currently has 16 cases that meet the existing FY 2013 materiality threshold. The DON legal counsel was unable to express an opinion concerning the likely outcome on 13 of 16 cases. The DON is a party in numerous individual contracts that contain clauses, such as price escalation, award fee payments, or dispute resolution, that may result in a future outflow of expenditures. Currently, the DON has limited automated system processes by which it captures or assesses these potential liabilities; therefore, the amounts reported may not fairly present the DON's contingent liabilities.

FECA provides Federal employees injured in the performance of duty with workers' compensation benefits, which include wage-loss benefits for total or partial disability, monetary benefits for permanent loss of use of a schedule member, medical benefits, and vocational rehabilitation. FECA also provides survivor benefits to eligible dependents if the injury causes the employee's death. FECA is administered by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. The obligations and liabilities for military pensions, military retirement health benefits, military Medicare-eligible retiree benefits, the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program, and the DoD Education Benefits Fund are reported at the Department level. actuarial cost Method used and assumptions: The DON's actuarial liability for workers' compensation benefits is developed by the Department of Labor and provided to the DON only at the end of each fiscal year.85 Department of the na vyThe estimate for future workers' compensation benefits includes the expected liability for death, disability, medical, and miscellaneous costs for approved compensation cases, plus a component for incurred but not reported claims.

The intent of the SNC is to provide gross and net cost information related to the amount of output or outcome for a given program or organization administered by a responsible reporting entity. The Department of Defense's (DoD) current processes and systems do not capture and report accumulated costs for major programs based upon the performance measures as required by the Government Performance and Results Act. The DoD is in the process of reviewing available data and developing a cost reporting methodology as required by the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 4,\"Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government,\" as amended by SFFAS No. 30, \"Inter-entity Cost Implementation.\"Intragovernmental costs and revenue represent transactions made between two reporting entities within the Federal Government. Public costs and revenues are exchange transactions made between the reporting entity and a nonfederal entity. The DON's financial management systems are unable to meet all of the requirements for full accrual accounting. Many of the DON's financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes were designed and implemented prior to the issuance of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for federal agencies. Most of the DON's legacy systems were designed to record information on a budgetary basis and do not track intragovernmental transactions by customer at the transaction level. Considering these systems limitations, the DON is unable to accurately compare its intragovernmental costs and revenues with the corresponding balances of its intragovernmental trading partners. Buyer-side accounts payable and expenses were adjusted to match seller-side accounts receivable and revenues. This is accomplished by reclassifying amounts between federal and public cost categories, and accruing additional costs when necessary. Intradepartmental revenues and expenses are then eliminated. In conjunction with the DoD, the DON has undertaken efforts to determine the actions required to bring its financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes into compliance with all elements of USGAAP . One such action is the revision of its accounting systems to record transactions based on the U.S. Standard General Ledger. Until such time as all of the DON's financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes are updated to collect and report financial information as required by USGAAP , the DON's financial data will be largely based on budgetary transactions (obligations, disbursements, and collections), transactions from nonfinancial feeder systems, and adjustments for known accruals of major items such as payroll expenses, accounts payable, and environmental liabilities. The DON's accounting systems generally do not capture information relative to Heritage Assets separately and distinctly from normal operations.86 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportNoTe 17.

Outlays are used because current the DON systems are unable to fully capture and summarize costs in accordance with USGAAP . R&D programs are classified as Basic Research, Applied Research, and Development. The definition of each R&D category and subcategory is explained below . Basic research Basic research is the systematic study to gain knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications, processes, or products in mind. Basic Research involves the gathering of a fuller knowledge or understanding of the subject under study. Major outputs are scientific studies and research papers. Basic research examples: arctic and global prediction: The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Arctic & Global Prediction Program supports basic research focused on expanding the fundamental understanding of key processes of the Arctic environment, the development of new technologies to improve Arctic observational capabilities, and the construction of numerical Arctic System Models that can be used for enhanced understanding and prediction. Significant sea ice changes that have occurred in recent years in the Arctic Ocean, which has implications for the safety of future U.S. Navy Arctic operations. Consequently, the over-arching goal of the program is to improve coupled Arctic System Models and sea ice prediction at a variety of space and time scales. Three main areas of research are: Observing Capabilities: The Arctic is a data-sparse region where there remains a need for sensors and sensor systems to operate for extended periods of time in the challenging Arctic environment. The development of new in situ and remote sensing systems will contribute to an Arctic Observing Network that will provide long-term observational data sets that are both useful for the fundamental understanding of Arctic processes and essential for assimilation into and validation of predictive Arctic models. Fundamental Understanding of Key Physical Processes : The significant retreat of sea ice during recent summers has led to the emergence of new processes in the Arctic. Understanding this \"new\" environment and the processes governing the retreat and advance of the ice cover is essential. Areas of research include: ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions in the marginal ice zone (MIZ); sea state and boundary layer physics in the emerging Arctic Ocean; wave and swell penetration into the Arctic ice field; sea ice dynamics and mass balance; changes in ocean salinity, temperature and heat storage; atmospheric temperature profiles and cloud properties; and sea spray and icing. Environmental and Predictive Modeling: The development of improved fully coupled, ocean-wave-ice-atmosphere Arctic system models is a key element in an improved predictive capability. The models must have sufficient resolution 93 Department of the na vyto represent the important processes and to support the assimilation of high resolution in situ and remotely-sensed observations. Improved skill in forecasting the Arctic operational environment is desired, particularly of key variables such as the location of the sea ice edge, the concentration, floe size and thickness of the ice cover, and vertical structure throughout the boundary layer. Coupling of Arctic System Models to Global Earth System Models will be required to capture the physical interactions between the Arctic and lower latitudes. What this research will accomplish: n Provides the necessary S&T to enable safe and effective Naval mission planning and execution in the rapidly changing Arctic n Enhanced Arctic domain awareness and prediction structural Metals:The Structural Metals program emphasizes developing the fundamental understanding needed to design and produce high-strength structural metals. It also establishes the technical feasibility of the technologies to enable platforms and systems with increased performance, reduced weight and reduced cost. Most recently, this program was responsible for the identification, development and processing qualification of HSLA- 65. This high-strength steel alloy has reduced significantly the structural weight of aircraft carriers currently under construction. This program also has enabled certification of aluminum-scandium alloys, developed for high-performance sporting goods, for applications in reconfigurable interior structures in surface combatants. This further reduces ship weight and enables faster maintenance and overhaul. The Structural Metals program's current focus is on basic and applied research in the areas of advanced naval steel design and production, affordable titanium alloy design and production, and robust, affordable processing and joining technology. The intent of these investments is to: n Establish an understanding and quantitative description of the mechanisms that define the evolution of a material's structure as a function of composition and processing n Provide an understanding of the complex and dynamic interactions that modify materials structure and behavior as a function of operational demands and loading events n Develop characterization and modeling tools, at appropriate length and time scales, to enable the advancement of materials science, including design and predictive capabilities n Develop technologically feasible transition paths for advanced structural materials and processing and the knowledge needed for the confident design and life prediction of components and systems What this research will accomplish: n Provide the warfighter with enhanced structural materials that improve platform survivability, reduce platform weight and improve platform efficiency at reduced life cycle costs. n Enable affordable, qualified high-performance structural metals and the necessary processing techniques to support their production and fabrication. applied researchApplied research is the systematic study to gain knowledge or understanding necessary for determining the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met. It is the practical application of such knowledge or understanding for the purpose of meeting the recognized need. This research points toward specific military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicability of proposed solutions and defining their parameters. Major outputs are scientific studies, investigations and research papers, hardware components, software codes, and limit construction of, or part of, a weapon system to include non-system-specific development efforts. applied research examples: graphene and Future Nanoelectronics: Graphene is a single atomic layer of carbon arranged into a hexagonal crystal lattice, first isolated (by splitting graphite) and characterized in 2004 by Professors Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov of the U.K. 's University of Manchester, earning them the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. 94 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportMoore's Law predicts that transistors will no longer shrink as quickly beginning in 2020. As a result, ONR is confronted with technical challenges at several levels: materials synthesis and characterization, novel nanodevices circuits, new computing architectures and nanofabrication. The ONR nanoelectronics program thrusts are specifically designed to address each of those challenges. Since 2005, ONR has been supporting various aspects of graphene research in order to use it as a material platform for future nanoelectronic devices, circuits and systems. For example, one of the key technical issues for graphene-based electronic devices, despite its record mobility, is the lack of an electronic bandgap in bulk graphene (e.g., lateral size of graphene sheet exceeding 1 micron). Early investment in ONR's program focused on various ways to open a bandgap in graphene, such as using graphene nanoribbons or multi-layer graphene. More recently ONR turned its attention to atomic scale molecular engineering of graphene nanostructures using chemical synthesis techniques. This latter approach, while technically more challenging, holds great potential to change the entire landscape of nanoelectronics beyond the transistor era. What this research will accomplish: n Personal electronic aids for individual warfighters that are flexible and lightweight, with extremely low power consumption to enhance battlefield situational awareness n Electronic components that meet and exceed the size weight and power (SWaP) requirements for real-time information processing onboard small unmanned air vehicles (UAV), thereby unleashing their power in aerial reconnaissance and surveillance missions n The combination of graphene's superior electronic properties with the other, equally unique, properties in optical (THz to UV), thermal and mechanical domains could lead to completely new and hitherto unforeseen capabilities for both military and civilian applications. Battlefield Medicine: advanced Microscopy, cytometry and sensing platforms Office of Naval Research (ONR) focuses on support of science and technology to enable new biomedical capabilities for use in austere settings. Rugged, miniaturized tools for far-forward diagnosis of infections, or contaminated food and water may save lives in both battlefield and humanitarian aid/disaster relief (HADR) scenarios. Wide-field Fluorescent Imaging On a Cell Phone: By adding a compact attachment to the existing camera unit of a cellphone, a 20-fold larger field of view (relative to a conventional microscope) can be imaged in fluorescent mode. Fluorescent tagging agents are added to the sample if the specimen is not naturally fluorescent. The images to the right shows a parasite (Giardia lamblia) often found in contaminated water, and labeled white blood cells. The cell-phone images compare well with conventional microscopy images. Holographic Imaging of Dense Samples (e.g., tissue): Densely packed or 'connected' cells present special challenges for imaging. The solution has been to acquire holographic images from various heights with respect to the sample, in reflection mode. A holographic imaging 'tower' has been design to attach to a cell-phone, enabling high resolution of features in dense samples. New data analysis and processing algorithms allow image reconstruction which is comparable to that obtained with a conventional microscope, as shown with skin samples to the left. These advances may allow remote diagnosis of diseases, infections of food contamination. Digital Holographic Imaging offers a new , compact and rugged method for analyzing biomedical and other samples in remote locations which compares will with fragile, lens-based microscopies. Integration with a cell-phone platform allows transmission of images to experts located elsewhere for analysis. The impact of this technology is expected to be dramatic, especially in third-world countries where access to sophisticated medical facilities is limited. What this research will accomplish: n Provide new capabilities to rapidly conduct various biomedical tests, e.g., blood analysis in the field (including differential cell counts and platelet counts) n Screen for various pathogens/bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium) in bodily fluids, food or water using compact, light-weight and cost-effective designs.95 Department of the na vyDevelopment Developmental research takes what has been discovered or learned from basic and applied research and uses it to establish technological feasibility, assessment of operability, and production capability. Developmental research examples: Directed energy: The Solid State and Fiber laser technology are delivering mature high-energy laser technologies into a prototypical weapon system for use and installation on the Navy's surface combatants and aircraft. Solid State Laser technology with weapons-level effects has been maturing rapidly, In fact, the Chief of Naval Operations announced the deployment of a SSL laser onboard USS Ponce (AFSB 15) in FY 2014 comes as ONR continues to make significant progress on directed energy weapons, allowing the service to deploy a laser weapon on a ship two years ahead of schedule. The at-sea demonstration in FY 2014 is part of a wider portfolio of near-term Navy directed energy programs that promise rapid fielding, demonstration and prototyping efforts for shipboard, airborne and ground systems. Directed energy initiatives, and specifically the solid-state laser, are among the highest priority science and technology programs. The solid-state laser program is central to the commitment to quickly deliver advanced capabilities to forward-deployed forces. This capability provides a tremendously affordable answer to the costly problem of defending against asymmetric threats. The solid-state laser is a revolutionary technology that gives the Navy an extremely affordable, multi-mission weapon with a deep magazine and unmatched precision, targeting and control functions. Because lasers run on electricity, they can be fired as long as there is power and provide a measure of safety as they don't require carrying propellants and explosives aboard ships. Lasers complement kinetic weapons to create a layered ship defense capability, providing improved protection against swarming small boats and unmanned aircraft at a fraction of the cost of traditional weapons. The advancing technology gives sailors a variety of options they never had before, including the ability to control a laser weapon's output and perform actions ranging from non-lethal disabling and deterrence all the way up to destruction. Video of the demonstration of the high-energy laser aboard a moving surface combatant ship and against remotely piloted aircraft can be seen here: http://youtu.be/OmoldX1wKYQ What this research will accomplish: n Produce a prototypical weapon system for use on surface Navy combatants. Lasers have the capability for speed- of-light engagements, with very precise, real-time targeting and battle damage assessments n Other directed energy programs include Fiber Lasers and Free Electron Lasers electromagnetic railgun and Hypervelocity projectile:The Electromagnetic Railgun launcher is a long-range weapon that fires projectiles using electricity instead of chemical propellants. Magnetic fields created by high electrical currents accelerate a sliding metal conductor, or armature, between two rails to launch projectiles at 4,500 mph to 5,600 mph. The Electromagnetic Railgun was initiated in 2005 as Innovative Naval Prototype. The Department of the Navy's science and technology corporate board chartered the Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) construct to foster game-changing and disruptive technologies ahead of the normal requirements process. The program is in Phase II, which started in 2012, and will advance the technology for transition to an acquisition program. Phase II technology efforts will concentrate on demonstrating a rep-rate fire capability up to 10 rounds per minute. Thermal management techniques required for sustained firing rates will be developed for both the launcher system and the pulsed power system. Railgun will fire a Hypervelocity Projectile. The HVP is a next-generation, common, low-drag, guided projectile capable of completing multiple missions for gun systems such as the Navy 5-inch, 155 mm and future railguns. Types of missions performed will depend on the gun system and platform. The program goal is to address mission requirements 96 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Reportin the areas of naval surface fire support, cruise missile defense, anti-surface warfare and other future naval mission areas. Mission performance will vary from gun system, launcher or ship. The HVP's low-drag, aerodynamic design enables high velocity, maneuverability and decreased time to target. These attributes, coupled with accurate guidance electronics, provide low-cost mission effectiveness against current threats and the ability to adapt to future air and surface threats. The high-velocity, compact design relieves the need for a rocket motor to extend gun range. Firing smaller, more accurate rounds improves danger close and collateral damage requirements and provides potential for deeper magazines and improved shipboard safety. Responsive wide-area coverage can be achieved using HVP from conventional gun systems and future railgun systems. The HVP's modular design will allow it to be configured for multiple gun systems and to address different missions. It is being designed to provide lethality and performance enhancements to current and future gun systems. A hypervelocity projectile for multiple systems will allow for future technology growth while reducing development, production and total ownership costs. What this research will accomplish: n With its increased velocity and extended range, the EM Railgun will give Sailors a multi-mission capability, allowing them to conduct precise naval surface fire support, or land strikes; cruise missile and ballistic missile defense; and surface warfare to deter enemy vessels. n The HVP will provide the Navy with the capability to address a variety of current and future naval threats in the mission areas of naval surface fire support, ship defense and anti-surface warfare using current and future gun systems Marine corps examples: precision universal Mortar attack: Warfighters capable of being employed in small, distributed units will locate and decisively engage larger enemy forces by applying timely, reliable, precise and accurate fires (kinetic and non-kinetic) from a myriad of platforms. Tactical units will be able to operate well beyond conventional parameters of direct-fire mutual support. Warfighters will use integrated, lightweight optics and sensors to see through all battlefield conditions (day, night, low light and obscuration), and they will use lightweight, organic, manned and unmanned platforms and advanced weapons for the rapid, accurate, effective application of firepower across the full range of military operations. They also will apply non-organic and joint fires optimally. Increased intelligence capabilities delivered by company intelligence cells will generate more potential targets in the future. The Precision Universal Mortar Attack (PUMA) Future Naval Capability program is currently the lead program in the Advanced Weapons T echnology Investment Area portfolio. PUMA will develop and demonstrate (FY 2014) a Global Positioning System guidance kit for mid-range 120 mm mortar ammunition to provide an addition to the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) Family of Munitions (FoM). The PUMA Flight Controlled Mortar munitions will provide a precision capability between the upper end of the M1101 HE round range and the lower end of the Precision Extended Range Munition round range. This will enable the EFSS FoM to have a less than 20-meter circular error probability of 50 percent over the entire range of all the system's munitions. What this research will accomplish: n Automatic target detection, recognition, identification, tracking and handoff capability at standoff distances in dismounted targeting systems n Affordable fires accuracy and lethality against small tactical platforms from small manned tactical platforms n Reduce weight and Improve life cycle performance (reduced barrel erosion, improved operational performance) n Precision fires for companies97 Department of the na vycounter ieD Dog program: The Naval Expeditionary Dog Program (NEDP) is a holistic science and technology based program investigating ways to optimize the utility of working dogs in current and future operating environments. Better understanding of the complex relationships between nutrition, hydration, physical conditioning, olfaction, training and cognition will allow us to field a dog that can consistently function as trained even in the challenging environments encountered in war. The objective of the Physical and Cognitive Optimization T echnology Investment Area is to investigate underlying features of canine physiology and cognition to deliver knowledge products supporting targeted improvements to canine performance. NEDP maintains the scientific expertise and relationships with universities that supports rapid, thoughtful answers to urgent questions from the warfighter and the opportunity to test new ideas in limited objective experiments. What this research will accomplish: n Ability to predict, monitor and mitigate effects of canine stress on operational performance n Canines that can maintain operational tempo in high- and low heat-stress environments and at high altitudes n Understanding how dogs cognitively process complex odors such as those of homemade explosives n Better understanding of learning plasticity and stimulus generalization in dogs98 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report Protecting Freedom Under Extraordinary Circumstances99 Department of the na vy Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report Required Supplementary Information 100 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportDepartment of the Navy general property, plant, and equipment Real property Deferred Maintenance and Repair For Fiscal Year ended september 30, 2013 ($ in Thousands) property Type1 .

The method used to assess facilities condition is a combination of commercial Infrastructure Condition Assessment Program (ICAP) software and facilities inspection. The Navy's Quality rating (Q-rating) is calculated using the below formula: Q = 1 - (requirements ) X 100 prv The Navy models the \"Requirements\" value from the condition rating and configuration rating. The method used to assess facilities conditions is two-fold. All buildings, paving and rail assets are inspection using the Sustainment Management Systems (SMS) methodology developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers Civil Engineering (USACOE) Research Laboratory (CERL) which provides a facilities condition index (FCI) for these assets. Other assets are accessed via facilities inspection, which categorizes buildings as Adequate, Substandard, or Inadequate. Assets inspected using the SMS methodology takes the FCI to determine the asset's Q-rating. Those assets without a direct FCI ratings, the Marine Corps converts the Adequate Substandard and Inadequate ratings to Quality ratings (Q-ratings) of 100%-90% 60% Q4 by assessing facilities that are rated as Adequate and less than 25 years old as Q1; facilities that are over 25 years old and rated as Adequate as Q2; facilities rated as Substandard as Q3; and Inadequate facilities as Q4. 2. The condition rating is a measure (0 -100) of an asset's physical condition at a particular point in time. The Navy uses condition modeling software to capture condition assessment data to model system/component condition ratings. The condition assessment data is supplemented by eyes-on condition assessments that capture accurate facility components and confirm as-built condition. In FY12, the condition assessment program was expanded to include utility systems. Updated condition ratings for utility systems have caused an increase in deferred maintenance and repair backlog. 3. The configuration rating is a measure (0 - 100) of the asset's capability to support the current occupant or mission with respect to functionality. The Configuration Rating is calculated in the internet Navy Facility Assets Data Store 101 Department of the na vy(iNFADS) from an algorithm that weights configuration deficiency codes (code compliance, functional/space criteria, location/siting criteria or inadequate capacity/coverage) collected during Asset Evaluations. Deficiency codes identify impacts to the suitability of spaces for their intended use, including obsolescence of facility components that do not meet new standards. 4. The DON's Q-rating is The FY 2012 target Q-rating value representing full investment requirement for the Navy is Q1. The Department of the Navy (DON) follows the Office of the Secretary of Defense installation strategic plan goal of having facilities at a Q2 level on average as an acceptable rating. This represents an average level of 15% of Plant Replacement Value (PRV) as an acceptable level of deferred maintenance. The table above shows that deferred maintenance for the Navy is valued at 28.68%, 45.26% and 0% of PRV for categories 1 through 3, respectively. The deferred maintenance and repair estimates are based on the facility Q-ratings found in the Navy's real property inventory. The table above shows that deferred maintenance for Marine Corps is valued at approximately 2.26% of PRV for categories 1 and 3. Category 2 is zero because we do not hold deferred maintenance backlogs on facilities to be demolished. The USMC follows the Office of the Secretary of Defense Installation Strategic Plan goal of having facilities at a Q2 level on average as an acceptable rating. This represents an average level of 15% of Plant Replacement Value (PRV) as an acceptable level of deferred maintenance. The table above shows that deferred maintenance is valued at approximately 10.64% of PRV for categories 1 and 3. Category 2 is zero because we do not hold deferred maintenance backlogs on facilities to be demolished. 6. The Facility Readiness Evaluation System (FRES) application was used to generate the Deferred Maintenance and Repair Report. FRES is updated with iNFADS data on a weekly basis and at the end of the fiscal year. The PRV and deferred maintenance and repair estimates for all three categories are reported for CNIC installations only, and only the Maintenance Fund Sources listed below are included. Facilities maintained by BUMED, defense agencies and Family Housing, Navy are excluded from the estimates. n Operation and Maintenance, Navy n Operation and Maintenance, Navy Reserve n Research, Development, T est, and Evaluation n Navy Working Capital Fund 7. Category 1 excludes facilities identified in Categories 2 and 3. The Navy currently identifies Category 2 facilities as follows: facilities assigned a RPA Operational Status Code of excess or surplus and RPA Interest Type Code Fee, ONST , ONFG, or Lease. Excess is defined as \"property under the control of a Federal agency that the head of the agency determines is not required to meet the agency's needs or responsibilities.\" The source for this definition is CFT Title 40 USC 102. Category 3 includes facilities that are single-use Heritage Assets. iNFADS does not identify any Navy facilities as single-use Heritage Assets; therefore, the amounts recorded for this category are zero. 102 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportMilitary equipment Deferred Maintenance For Fiscal Year ended september 30, 2013 ($ in Thousands) Major Category op30 Amounts Adjustments Totals 1 .

Material amounts of deferred maintenance beyond the scope of the OP-30 Budget Exhibit, that warrant reporting are in the \"Adjustments\" column. aircraft Deferred Maintenance Four sub-categories comprise aircraft deferred maintenance: airframe rework and maintenance (active and reserve), engine rework and maintenance (active and reserve), component repair, and software maintenance. The airframe rework deferred maintenance calculation reflects unfunded requirements, which represent aircraft that have reached their Fixed Induction Date (FID) or that have failed an Aircraft Service Period Adjustment (ASPA) inspection at year-end. The engine rework deferred maintenance calculation reflects year-end actual requirements minus actual funded units. Component repair deferred maintenance represents the difference between the validated requirements minus corresponding funding. Airframe rework and maintenance (active and reserve) is currently performed under the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) program. The IMC concept uses Planned Maintenance Intervals (PMI), performing more frequent depot maintenance, but with smaller work packages, thereby reducing out-of-service time. The goal of this program is to improve readiness while reducing operating and support costs. The Naval Air Systems Command's (NAVAIR) Industrial Strategy is to maintain the minimum level of organic capacity consistent with force levels that is necessary to sustain peacetime readiness and maintain fighting surge capability. NAVAIR works in partnership with private industry to make maximum use of industry's production capabilities and for non-core related aviation depot maintenance. combat vehicles Deferred Maintenance The combat vehicles category refers to deferred vehicle maintenance for the active and reserve Marine Corps assets. The combat vehicle category consists of weapons systems such as the M1A1 Tank, the Amphibious Assault Vehicle, the Hercules Recovery Vehicle, and the Light Armored Vehicle. The total requirement is the planned quantity of combat vehicles that require depot level maintenance in a year as determined by program managers and the operating forces with requirements validated by a modeling process. The deferred maintenance is the difference between the validated requirements and funding received for that fiscal year. Missiles Deferred Maintenance Four categories are used to determine missile maintenance: missiles, tactical missiles, software maintenance, and other. Deferred maintenance is defined as the difference between the total weapon maintenance requirement as determined by requirements modeling processes and the weapon maintenance that is funded in accordance with the annual budget controls for the missile maintenance program. The maintenance requirements model projects the quantity of missiles and missile components per weapon system that are required to be maintained or reworked annually. ships Deferred Maintenance Fleet Type Commanders provide deferred ship maintenance data. Data is collected from the Current Ships' Maintenance Plan (CSMP) database, which captures maintenance actions at all levels (organizational, intermediate, depot) for active and reserve ships. Only depot level deferred maintenance is provided in the calculation of ship deferred maintenance. This includes maintenance actions deferred from actual depot maintenance work-packages as well as maintenance deferred before inclusion in a work package due to fiscal, operational, or capacity constraints. Although there are some 103 Department of the na vydeferred maintenance actions, no ships fall into the category of \"unacceptable operating condition.\" Any ship that would be at risk of being in unacceptable operating condition would receive priority for maintenance funding to maintain acceptable operating condition. ordnance Weapons and Munitions Deferred Maintenance Ordnance weapons and munitions are part of a broader category, Other Weapons Systems. This category is comprised of ordnance, end item maintenance for support equipment, camera equipment, landing aids, calibration equipment, air traffic control equipment, target systems, expeditionary airfield equipment, special weapons, target maintenance, and repair of repairable components. Three categories define ordnance maintenance: ordnance maintenance, software maintenance, and other. Although the various programs vary in the methodology in defining requirements, all programs define deferred maintenance as the difference between validated requirements and funding. electronics and communications systems The electronics and communications systems category refers to deferred systems maintenance for active and reserve Navy and Marine Corps assets. This category consists of maintenance performed on a variety of radar, radio, and wire and communications equipment. In part, the systems include or are associated with the Surveillance T owed-Array Sensor System (SURTASS), P-3 Beartrap, satellite subsystems, the Multi-Band Deployable Antenna, the Multi-Mode Inter/Intra T eam Radio, and a variety of radio and radar sets used within the Department of the Navy. The total requirement is the planned quantity of systems and their components that require depot level maintenance in a year as determined by program managers and the operating forces. The deferred maintenance is then the difference between the validated requirements and funding received for that fiscal year. construction equipment The construction equipment category refers to deferred equipment maintenance for active and reserve Marine Corps assets. This category consists of maintenance performed on a variety of tractors and earth moving equipment. In part, the equipment includes the Aardvark Tactical, the 277C Multi-T errain Loader, the Medium Crawler Tractor, the Armored Excavator with Brush Hog, and Bridge Erection equipment. The total requirement is the planned quantity of equipment that requires depot level maintenance in a year as determined by program managers and the operating forces. The deferred maintenance is the difference between the validated requirements and funding received for that fiscal year. Deferred Maintenance on all other items Not identified above This category comprises deferred maintenance for software, arrest gear, lighting and surfacing equipment, and EFTM (external fuel transfer module). The deferred maintenance is the difference between the validated requirements and funding received for that fiscal year.

Basis of Presentation These financial statements have been prepared to report the financial position and results of operations of the Department of the Navy (DON), Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF), as required by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and other appropriate legislation. The financial statements have been prepared from the books and records of the NWCF in accordance with, and to the extent possible, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (USGAAP) promulgated by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board; the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements; and the Department of Defense (DoD), Financial Management Regulation (FMR). The accompanying financial statements account for all resources for which the NWCF is responsible unless otherwise noted. The NWCF is unable to fully implement all elements of USGAAP and OMB Circular No. A-136, due to limitations of financial and nonfinancial management processes and systems that support the financial statements. The NWCF derives reported values and information for major asset and liability categories largely from nonfinancial systems, such as inventory and logistic systems. These systems were designed to support reporting requirements for maintaining accountability over assets and reporting the status of Federal appropriations rather than preparing financial statements in accordance with USGAAP . The NWCF continues to implement process and system improvements addressing these limitations. The DON is currently converting legacy systems to Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and developing plans to ensure accurate and complete financial records. As of the 4th quarter, fiscal year 2013 financial statements, the DoD identified 13 auditor identified material weaknesses, as follows: (1) Financial Management Systems; (2) Fund Balance With Treasury; (3) Financial Reporting of Plan to Perform/Order to Cash; (4) Financial Reporting of Inventory; (5) Financial Reporting of Operating Materials and Supplies; (6) Financial Reporting of Real Property and General Equipment; (7) Accounts Payable; (8) Other Liabilities; (9) Statement of Budgetary Resources; (10) Intragovernmental Eliminations; (11) Unsupported Accounting Entries; (12) Statement of Net Cost; (13) Reconciliation of Net Cost of Operations to Budget. The FY 2012 financial statements were reclassified to conform to the FY 2013 financial statement presentation requirements. Changes to the presentation of the Combined and Combining Statements of Budgetary Resources were made, in accordance with guidance provided in OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements, and as such, activity and balances reported on the FY 2012 Combined and Combining Statement of Budgetary Resources have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current year. Certain other prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no material effect on total assets, liabilities, net position, change in net position, or budgetary resources as previously reported. Subsequent events and transactions occurring after September 30, 2013 through the date of the auditors' opinion should be evaluated for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. However, the DON is not yet able to implement this requirement. The date of the auditors' opinion also represents the date that the financial statements were available to be issued. 1 .B . Mission of the Reporting Entity The DON was created on April 30, 1798 by an act of Congress (I Stat. 533; 5 U.S.C. 411-12). The overall mission of the DON is to maintain, train, and equip combat-ready Navy and Marine Corps forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression, and maintaining freedom of the seas. The NWCF provides goods, services, and infrastructure to the DON and other DoD customers to help ensure our military forces are mobile, ready, and have the most advanced technology. The NWCF is a revolving fund that finances the DON activities providing products and services on a reimbursable basis, based on a relationship between operating units and NWCF support organizations. Customers send funded orders to the NWCF providers who furnish the services or products, pay for incurred expenses, and bill the customers, who in turn authorize payment. NWCF activities strive to break even over the budget cycle. NWCF has five programs: Depot Maintenance, Supply Management, Research and Development, Base Support, and Transportation. 1 .C . Appropriations and Funds NWCF received funding to establish an initial corpus through an appropriation or a transfer of resources from existing appropriations or funds. The corpus finances operations which result in transactions that flow through the fund. The NWCF furnishes goods and services sold to customers on a reimbursable basis and maintains the corpus. Reimbursable receipts fund future operations and generally are available in their entirety for use without further congressional action. 120 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportAt various times, Congress provides additional appropriations to supplement the NWCF as an infusion of cash when revenues are inadequate to cover costs within the corpus. In FY 2013, the NWCF received appropriations for Hurricane Sandy-related expenses. 1 .D . Basis of Accounting The NWCF's financial management systems are unable to meet all full accrual accounting requirements. Many of the NWCF's financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes were designed and implemented prior to the issuance of USGAAP . These systems were not designed to collect and record financial information on the full accrual accounting basis as required by USGAAP . Most of NWCF's financial and nonfinancial legacy systems were designed to record information on a proprietary basis. Although the accrual basis of accounting is not fully implemented, under the accrual basis, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged. Under the budgetary basis, however, funds availability is recorded based upon legal considerations and constraints. As a result, certain line items on the proprietary financial statements may not equal similar line items on the budgetary financial statements. The NWCF financial statements and supporting trial balances are compiled from the underlying financial data and trial balances of the NWCF sub-entities. The underlying data is largely derived from proprietary transactions from nonfinancial feeder systems and accruals made for major items such as payroll expenses, accounts payable, Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) liabilities, and revenue. Some of the sub-entity level trial balances may reflect known abnormal balances resulting largely from business and system processes. At the consolidated NWCF level, these abnormal balances may not be evident. Disclosures of abnormal balances are made in the applicable footnotes, but only to the extent that the abnormal balances are evident at the consolidated level. The DoD is determining the actions required to bring its financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes into compliance with USGAAP . One such action is the conversion of the DON's legacy systems to Navy ERP which is designed to modernize and standardize Navy's business practices. Navy ERP was developed utilizing the USSGL account structure to better comply with applicable financial management requirements. Until all NWCF financial and nonfinancial feeder systems and processes are updated to collect and report financial information as required by USGAAP , financial data will be derived from proprietary transactions, data from nonfinancial feeder systems, and accruals. The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 1 .E . Revenues and Other Financing Sources Depot Maintenance NWCF activities recognize revenue according to the percentage of completion method. Supply Management NWCF activities recognize revenue from the sale of inventory items. Research and Development NWCF activities recognize revenue according to the percentage of completion method or as actual costs are incurred and billed. Base Support NWCF activities recognize revenue at the time service is rendered. Transportation NWCF activities recognize revenue on either a reimbursable or per diem basis. The majority of per diem projects are billed and collected in the month services are rendered. The remaining per diem projects accrue revenue in the month the services are rendered. For reimbursable projects, costs and revenue are recognized in the month services are rendered. The NWCF does not include nonmonetary support provided by U.S. allies for common defense and mutual security in the amount reported in the Statement of Net Cost. The U.S. has cost-sharing agreements with countries having a mutual or reciprocal defense agreement, where U.S. troops are stationed, or where the U.S. Fleet is in a port. 1.F. Recognition of Expenses For financial reporting purposes, DoD policy requires the recognition of operating expenses in the period incurred. Current financial and nonfinancial feeder systems were not designed to collect and record financial information on the full accrual accounting basis. Estimates are made for major items, such as payroll expenses, accounts payable, FECA liabilities, and revenue. OM&S, operating expenses are generally recognized when the items are purchased. Efforts are underway to transition to the consumption method for recognizing OM&S expenses. Under the consumption method, OM&S would be expensed when consumed. Due to system limitations, some expenditures for capital and other long-term assets may be recognized as operating expenses. The NWCF continues to implement process and system improvements to address these limitations.121 Na vy WorkiNg Capital FuNd1 .G . Accounting for Intragovernmental Activities Accounting standards require that an entity eliminates intraentity activity and balances from consolidated financial statements in order to prevent overstatement for business with itself. However, the NWCF cannot accurately identify intragovernmental transactions by customer because NWCF's systems do not track buyer and seller data at the transaction level. Generally, seller entities within the DoD provide summary seller-side balances for revenue, accounts receivable, and unearned revenue to the buyer-side internal accounting offices. In most cases, the buyer-side records are adjusted to agree with DoD seller-side balances and are then eliminated. The DoD is implementing replacement systems and a standard financial information structure that will incorporate the necessary elements that will enable DoD to correctly report, reconcile, and eliminate intragovernmental balances. The Treasury Financial Manual Part 2 - Chapter 4700, \"Agency Reporting Requirements for the Financial Report of the United States Government\", provide guidance for reporting and reconciling intragovernmental balances. While NWCF is unable to fully reconcile intragovernmental transactions with all Federal agencies, NWCF is able to reconcile balances pertaining to FECA transactions with the Department of Labor, and benefit program transactions with the Office of Personnel Management. The NWCF's proportionate share of public debt and related expenses of the Federal Government is not included. The Federal Government does not apportion debt and its related costs to Federal agencies. The NWCF's financial statements do not report any public debt, interest, or source of public financing, whether from issuance of debt or tax revenues. 1 .H . Transactions with Foreign Governments and International Organizations Each year, NWCF sells defense articles and services to foreign governments and international organizations under the provisions of the \"Arms Export Control Act of 1976.\" Under the provisions of the Act, DoD has authority to sell defense articles and services to foreign countries and international organizations generally at no profit or loss to the Federal Government. Payment in U.S. dollars is required in advance. 1 .I . Funds with the U .S . Treasury The NWCF's monetary resources are maintained in U.S. Treasury accounts. The disbursing offices of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), the Military Departments, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Department of State's financial service centers process the majority of the NWCF's cash collections, disbursements, and adjustments worldwide. Each disbursing station prepares monthly reports that provide information to the U.S. Treasury on checks issued, electronic fund transfers, interagency transfers, and deposits. In addition, DFAS sites and USACE Finance Center submit reports to the U.S. Treasury by appropriation on interagency transfers, collections received, and disbursements issued. The U.S. Treasury records these transactions to the applicable Fund Balance with Treasury (FBWT) account. On a monthly basis DFAS performs a reconciliation between NWCF's FBWT and the U.S. Treasury. 1 .J . Cash and Other Monetary Assets Cash is the total of cash resources under the control of NWCF which includes coin, paper currency, negotiable instruments, and amounts held for deposit in banks and other financial institutions. 1 .K . Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable from other Federal entities or the public include: accounts receivable, claims receivable, and refunds receivable. In accordance with SFFAS No. 1, Accounting for Selected Assets and Liabilities, the methodology for losses due to uncollectible amounts are based on an individual account analysis and/or group analysis. The analysis is based on three years of receivable data. This data is used to determine the historical percentage of collections in each age category of receivables. The NWCF does not recognize an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts from other federal agencies. Claims against other federal agencies are to be resolved between the agencies in accordance with dispute resolution procedures defined in the Intragovernmental Business Rules published in the Treasury Financial Manual Part 2, Chapter 4700, Appendix 10, \"Intragovernmental Business Rules\".122 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Report1 .L . Inventories and Related Property The NWCF values approximately 99% of its resale inventory using the Moving Average Cost (MAC) method. The NWCF reports the remaining 1% of resale inventories at an approximation of historical cost using Latest Acquisition Cost (LAC) adjusted for holding gains and losses. The LAC method is used because legacy inventory systems were designed for materiel management rather than accounting. Materiel is a unique term that relates to military force management, and includes items such as ships, tanks, self-propelled weapons, aircraft, etc., and related spares, repair parts, and support equipment. Although these systems provide visibility and accountability over inventory items, they do not maintain historical cost data necessary to comply with Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 3, Accounting for Inventory and Related Property. Additionally, these systems cannot produce financial transactions using the USSGL, as required by the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (P .L. 104-208). The NWCF is continuing to transition the balance of the inventories to the MAC method through the implementation of Navy ERP . Most transitioned balances, however, were not base-lined to auditable historical cost and remain noncompliant with SFFAS No. 3. The NWCF manages only military or government-specific materiel under normal conditions. Items commonly used in and available from the commercial sector are not managed in NWCF's materiel management activities. Operational cycles are irregular and the military risks associated with stock-out positions have no commercial parallel. The NWCF holds materiel based on military need and support for contingencies. The DoD is currently developing a methodology to be used to account for \"inventory held for sale\" and \"inventory held in reserve for future sale\" under the provisions of SFFAS No. 3, Accounting for Inventory and Related Property. Related property includes OM&S. NWCF OM&S is categorized as operating material and supplies held for use. The OM&S is valued at LAC. The NWCF uses both the consumption method and the purchase method of accounting for OM&S. Items that are centrally managed and stored, such as engines, are generally recorded using the consumption method and are reported on the Balance Sheet as OM&S. When current systems cannot fully support the consumption method, NWCF uses the purchase method. Under this method, material and supplies are expensed when purchased. During FY 2013 and FY 2012, NWCF expensed significant amounts using the purchase method because the systems could not support the consumption method or management deemed that the item was in the hands of the end user. This is a material weakness for the DoD and long-term system corrections are in process. Once the proper systems are in place, these items will be accounted for under the consumption method of accounting. The NWCF recognizes excess, obsolete, and unserviceable inventory and OM&S at a net realizable value of $0 pending development of an effective means of valuing such material. Inventory available and purchased for resale includes consumable spare and repair parts and repairable items owned and managed by NWCF. This inventory is retained to support military or national contingencies. Inventory held for repair is damaged inventory that requires repair to make it suitable for sale. Often, it is more economical to repair these items rather than to procure them. The NWCF often relies on weapon systems and machinery no longer in production and held for repair. As a result, NWCF supports a process that encourages the repair and rebuilding of weapon systems and machinery. This repair cycle is essential to maintaining a ready, mobile, and armed military force. Work in process balances include (1) costs related to the production or servicing of items, including direct material, labor, applied overhead; (2) the value of finished products or completed services that are yet to be placed in service; and (3) munitions in production and depot maintenance work with its associated costs incurred in the delivery of maintenance services. 1 .M . General Property, Plant and Equipment Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) consists of two categories: General PP&E, and Stewardship PP&E. Military Equipment (a classification of General PP&E), Heritage Assets and Stewardship Land (classifications of Stewardship PP&E) are reported on the financial statements of the DON. The NWCF classifies all PP&E assets in the General PP&E category. The DoD's General PP&E capitalization threshold is $100 thousand except for real property, which is $20 thousand. The NWCF has not fully implemented the threshold for real property: therefore, NWCF is primarily using the capitalization threshold of $100 thousand for General PP&E, and most real property. General PP&E assets are capitalized in accordance with SFFAS No. 6, as amended by SFFAS Nos. 10, 23, and 35 when an asset has a useful life of two or more years and when the acquisition cost equals or exceeds DoD's capitalization 123 Na vy WorkiNg Capital FuNdthreshold. SFFAS 35 amends SFFAS 6 permitting the use of estimated PP&E values when historical cost information is not available. The DoD also requires the capitalization of improvements to existing General PP&E assets if the improvements equal or exceed the capitalization threshold for General PP&E and extend the useful life or increase the size, efficiency, or capacity of the asset. The NWCF depreciates all General PP&E, other than land, on a straight-line basis. When it is in the best interest of the government, the NWCF provides government property to contractors to complete contract work. The NWCF either owns or leases such property, or it is purchased directly by the contractor for the government based on contract terms. When the value of contractor-procured General PP&E meets or exceeds the DoD capitalization threshold, Federal accounting standards require that it be reported on NWCF's Balance Sheet. The DoD developed policy and a reporting process for contractors with government furnished equipment that provides appropriate General PP&E information for financial statement reporting in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The DoD requires NWCF to maintain, in their property systems, information on all property furnished to contractors. These actions are structured to capture and report the information necessary for compliance with Federal accounting standards. The NWCF has not fully implemented this policy primarily due to system limitations. NWCF capitalizes all PP&E used in the performance of its mission. These assets are capitalized as General PP&E whether they meet the definition of any other PP&E category. 1 .N . Advances and Prepayments When advances are permitted by law , legislative action, or presidential authorization, DoD's policy as prescribed in SFFAS No. 1, Accounting for Selected Assets and Liabilities, is to record advances or prepayments in accordance with USGAAP . As such, payments made prior to the receipt of goods and services should be reported as an asset on the Balance Sheet. The DoD's policy is to expense and/or properly classify assets when the related goods and services are received. The NWCF has not implemented this policy primarily due to system limitations. 1 .O . Leases In accordance with SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, lease payments for the rental of equipment and operating facilities are classified as either capital or operating leases. When a lease is essentially equivalent to an installment purchase of property (a capital lease), and the value equals or exceeds the current capitalization threshold, NWCF records the applicable asset as though purchased, with an offsetting liability, and depreciates it. The NWCF records the asset and the liability at the lesser of the present value of the rental and other lease payments during the lease term (excluding portions representing executory costs paid to the lessor) or the asset's fair market value. The discount rate for the present value calculation is either the lessor's implicit interest rate or the government's incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the lease. The NWCF, as the lessee, receives the use and possession of leased property, for example real estate or equipment, from a lessor in exchange for a payment of funds. An operating lease does not substantially transfer all the benefits and risk of ownership. Payments for operating leases are expensed over the lease term as they become payable. Office space leases entered into by NWCF are the largest component of operating leases and are based on costs gathered from existing leases, General Services Administration (GSA) bills, and interservice support agreements. Future year projections use the Consumer Price Index. 1 .P . Other Assets Other assets include non-Federal advances and prepayments, military and civil service employee pay advances, travel advances, and certain contract financing payments that are not reported elsewhere on NWCF's Balance Sheet. Contract financing payments do not include invoice payments, payments for partial deliveries, lease and rental payments, or progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement authorizes progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion only for construction of real property, shipbuilding, and ship conversion, alteration, or repair. Progress payments based on percentage or stage of completion are reported as Construction in Progress. The NWCF conducts business with commercial contractors under two primary types of contracts: fixed price and cost reimbursable. T o alleviate the potential financial burden on the contractor that long-term contracts can cause, NWCF may provide financing payments. Contract financing payments are defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 32, as authorized disbursements to a contractor prior to acceptance of supplies or services by the Government. Contract financing payments clauses are incorporated in the contract terms 124 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial Reportand conditions and may include advance payments, performance-based payments, commercial advances and interim payments, progress payments based on cost, and interim payments under certain cost reimbursement contracts. It is DoD policy to record certain contract financing payments as other assets. The NWCF has not fully implemented this policy primarily due to system limitations. Due to inconsistencies in the posting logic for non-Federal Advances and Prepayments, NWCF is noncompliant with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA),which requires agencies to comply with the Federal financial management systems requirements, standards promulgated by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), and the USSGL at the transaction level. 1 .q . Contingencies and Other Liabilities The DON is party to various administrative proceedings, legal actions, and claims. Under SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, as amended by SFFAS No. 12, Recognition of Contingent Liabilities Arising from Litigation, the Balance Sheet should include estimated liabilities for these items, when an adverse decision is probable, reasonably possible, and estimable. When the amount of the potential loss cannot be estimated, or the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is remote, the contingency is not disclosed. Financial statement reporting is limited to disclosure when conditions for liability recognition do not exist but there is at least a reasonable possibility of incurring a loss or additional losses. The NWCF's risk of loss and resultant contingent liabilities arise from pending or threatened litigation or claims and assessments due to events such as aircraft, ship, and vehicle accidents; medical malpractice; property or environmental damages; and contract disputes. Other liabilities also arise as a result of anticipated disposal costs for the DON NWCF assets. Consistent with SFFAS No. 6, \"Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment\", recognition of an anticipated environmental liability begins when the asset is placed into service. The DON NWCF adheres to the DoD's policy, which is consistent with SFFAS No. 5 Accounting for Liabilities of Federal Government, and states that non-environmental disposal liabilities are recognized when management decides to dispose of an asset. The NWCF Environmental Liabilities are reported under the DON. 1 .R . Accrued Leave Military leave, compensatory and annual leave earned by civilians, but not yet used, is reported as accrued liabilities. The accrued balance is adjusted annually to reflect current pay rates. Any portions of the accrued leave, for which funding is not available, are recorded as an unfunded liability. Sick leave for civilians is expensed as taken. 1 .S . Net Position Net Position consists of unexpended appropriations and cumulative results of operations. Unexpended Appropriations represent the amounts of budget authority that are unobligated and have not been rescinded or withdrawn. Unexpended appropriations also represent amounts obligated for which legal liabilities for payments have not been incurred. Cumulative Results of Operations represent the net difference between expenses and losses, and financing sources (including appropriations, revenue, and gains), since inception. The cumulative results of operations also include donations and transfers in and out of assets that were not reimbursed. 1 .T . Undistributed Disbursements and Collections Undistributed disbursements and collections represent the difference between disbursements and collections matched at the transaction level to specific obligations, payables, or receivables in the source systems and those reported by the U.S. Treasury. Supported disbursements and collections may be evidenced by the availability of corroborating documentation that would generally support the summary level adjustments made to accounts payable and receivable. Both supported and unsupported adjustments may have been made to the NWCF Accounts Payable and Receivable trial balances prior to validating underlying transactions required to establish the Accounts Payable/Receivable. As a result, misstatements of reported Accounts Payable and Receivables are likely present in the NWCF financial statements.125 Na vy WorkiNg Capital FuNdDue to noted material weaknesses in current accounting and financial feeder systems, the DoD is generally unable to determine whether undistributed disbursements and collections should be applied to Federal or non-Federal accounts payables/receivables at the time accounting reports are prepared. Accordingly, the DoD policy is to allocate supported undistributed disbursements and collections between Federal and non-Federal categories based on the percentage of distributed federal and nonfederal accounts payable and accounts receivable. Both supported and unsupported undistributed disbursements and collections are then applied to reduce accounts payable and receivable accordingly. 1.U. Federal Employee and Veteran Benefits For financial reporting purposes, the DON's actuarial liability for workers' compensation benefits is developed by the Department of Labor and provided to the DON at the end of each fiscal year. Military retirement is accounted for in the audited financial statements of the Military Retirement fund; as such, NWCF does not record any liabilities or obligations for pensions or healthcare retirement benefits.

It primarily consists of unobligated and obligated balances. The balances reflect the budgetary authority remaining for disbursement against current and future obligations.126 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportUnobligated Balance is classified as available or unavailable and represents the cumulative amount of budgetary authority that has not been set aside to cover outstanding obligations. The unavailable amount primarily relates to Research and Development funding. Obligated Balance not yet disbursed represents funds that have been obligated for goods and services not received, and those received but not paid. Non-FBWT Budgetary Accounts reduces the Status of FBWT . This amount is comprised of contract authority, accounts receivable, and unfilled orders without advance from customers for the NWCF. Due to the DON systems inability to segregate Budgetary FBWT balances, Non-FBWT Budgetary Accounts are used to reconcile the Status of FBWT .

Intragovernmental Receivables primarily represents amounts due from other Federal agencies for reimbursable work performed pursuant to the Economy Act and other statutory authority. Claims with other Federal agencies are resolved in accordance with the Intragovernmental Business Rules. Non-Federal Accounts Receivable is mainly held with Naval Facilities Engineering Command and Naval Supply Systems Command. Since the DON is at risk of not collecting on these public accounts receivable, the DON is recognizing an allowance for uncollectible amounts. The methodology used in determining the allowance amount is discussed in Note 1.K. The DON is currently working on an effort to drive compliance with OMB Circular A-11, Section 20.4(b)(4). Non- compliance results in unsupported departmental level adjustments which negatively impacts achievement of the DON's audit readiness goals for its Statement of Budgetary Resources. The DON is partnering with DFAS to clarify guidance, resolve funding issues and standardize business practices. In addition, the DON and the DFAS are aggressively pursuing collection mechanisms for amounts currently due from the public. 127 Na vy WorkiNg Capital FuNdNoTe 5. oTheR AsseTs As of September 30 (Amounts in thousands) 2013 2012 intragovernmental other Assets Advances and Prepayments $ 46 $ 10 outstanding Contract Financing payments 627,322 521,037 Advances and prepayments 1,433,278 1,105,100 other Assets (w ith the public) 927 2,311 Total Nonfederal other Assets 2,061,527 1,628,448 Total $ 2,061,573 $ 1,628,458 Non-Federal Other Assets - Outstanding Contract Financing Payments consist of contract terms and conditions for certain types of contract financing payments conveying specific rights to the NWCF that protect the contract work from state or local taxation, liens or attachment by the contractor's creditors, transfer of property, or disposition in bankruptcy. However, these rights should not be misconstrued to mean that ownership of the contractor's work has transferred to the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not have the right to take the work, except as provided in contract clauses related to termination or acceptance, and NWCF is not obligated to make payment to the contractor until delivery and acceptance of a satisfactory product. As a result, cash outlays and payments are made by the NWCF to contractors, grantees, or others to cover the recipients' anticipated and periodic expenses before those expenses are incurred. Outstanding Contract Financing Payments are reduced when goods and services are received, contract terms are met, progress is made on a contract, or prepaid expenses expire. The balance of Outstanding Contract Financing Payments includes $584.2 million in contract financing payments and an additional $43.1 million in estimated future funded payments to contractors upon delivery and Government acceptance of a satisfactory product. See additional discussion in Note 13, Other Liabilities. Due to reclassification of intragovernmental activity and inaccurate posting logic, non-Federal Advances and Prepayments are recognized within the NWCF. Non-Federal Other Assets - Advances and Prepayments increased primarily due to Navy Supply Management reclassification of Federal Advances and Prepayments to non-Federal Advances and Prepayments in order to reconcile seller side trading partner data. The Navy ERP proprietary posting logic is not correctly relieving advances which caused the Federal advances account to be overstated due to the posting logic's noncompliance with USSGL. The issue has been logged in the Navy ERP PMO Quality Center and NWCF will continue to work on a resolution. Non-Federal Other Assets consists of prepayments made to vendors and travel advances made to employees. NoTe 6.

Inventory includes all material available for customer purchase. Inventory is assigned to categories based upon condition of the inventory items, or in the case of raw material and work-in-process based upon stage of fabrication. Inventory held for repair consists of damaged material that requires repair to make it usable. Excess inventory includes scrap materials or items that are uneconomical to repair and are awaiting disposal. Work in process includes costs related to the production or servicing of items, including direct material, direct labor, applied overhead, and other direct costs. Work in process also includes the value of finished products or completed services pending the submission of bills to the customer. Federal Accounting Standards require disclosure of the amount of Inventory Held for \"Future Use\". Beginning with Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 the NWCF will report this balance separate from Inventory Available and Purchased for Resale. The NWCF currently has $609.9 million and $0.5 million reported from 4th Quarter, FY 2013 and 2012, respectively in Inventory Held for Future Use, Net. inventory v aluation Navy's inventory is reported using two methods: the approximation of historical cost method and Moving Average Cost (MAC). The approximation of historical cost is calculated by using the Latest Acquisition Cost (LAC) less the allowance for holding gains and losses. MAC is calculated each time costs are incurred for a purchase or a repairable 129 Na vy WorkiNg Capital FuNditem is remanufactured by dividing the cost of total units available at the time. Legacy inventory systems are designed to capture materiel management information rather than accounting data. Although these systems provide visibility and accountability over inventory items, they do not maintain historical cost data necessary to comply with the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 3, Accounting for Inventory and Related Property. The OUSD (C) Cost of Goods Sold Model revalued inventory causing NWCF to be non-compliant with SFFAS No. 3. The Navy Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) values inventory at MAC in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (USGAAP). As of 4th Quarter, FY13, 99% of NWCF inventory was valued at MAC. For compliance, the revaluation of the inventory to MAC occurred in the field accounting system to be compliant with SFFAS No. 3. restrictions on use of inventory There are no restrictions on the use, sale, or disposition of inventory except in the following situations: 1) Distributions without reimbursement are made when authorized by Department of Defense (DoD) directives; 2) War reserve materiel in the amount of $54.2 million includes repair items that are considered restricted; and 3) Inventory, with the exception of safety stocks, may be sold to foreign, state, and local governments; private parties; and contractors in accordance with current policies and guidance or at the direction of the President.

As a result, in the intra-governmental eliminations process, buyer-side accounts payable are adjusted to agree with supportable intra-agency seller-side accounts receivable. This is accomplished by (1) reclassifying amounts between Federal and non-Federal cost categories, (2) accruing additional accounts payable and expenses, and (3) applying both supported and unsupported undistributed disbursements at the reporting entity level.132 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportNoTe 11. eNviRoNMeNTAl liAbiliTies AND DisposAl liAbiliTies The NWCF Environmental Liabilities are reported under the DON financial statements.

In accordance with contract terms, specific rights to the contractor's work vest with the Federal Government when a specific type of contract financing payment is made. This action protects taxpayer funds in the event of contract nonperformance. It is DoD policy that these rights should not be misconstrued as the rights of ownership. The NWCF is under no obligation to pay the contractor for amounts greater than the amounts of progress payments authorized in the contract until delivery and government acceptance. Due to the probability the contractors will complete their efforts and deliver satisfactory products, and because the amount of contractor costs incurred but yet unpaid are estimable, the NWCF has recognized a contingent liability for the estimated unpaid costs that are considered conditional for payment pending delivery and government acceptance. 133 Na vy WorkiNg Capital FuNdT otal contingent liabilities for progress payments based on cost represent the difference between the estimated costs incurred to date by contractors and amounts authorized to be paid under progress payments based on cost provisions within the FAR. Estimated contractor-incurred costs are calculated by dividing the cumulative unliquidated progress payments based on cost by the contract-authorized progress payment rate. The balance of unliquidated progress payments based on cost is deducted from the estimated total contractor-incurred costs to determine the contingency amount. The abnormal balance in non-Federal Other Liabilities is under investigation. It is likely related to ongoing general ledger posting issues to be addressed through audit readiness efforts. NoTe 13. CoMMiTMeNTs AND CoNTiNgeNCies The NWCF is a party in various administrative proceedings and legal actions related to claims for environmental damage, equal opportunity matters, and contractual bid protests, which may ultimately result in settlements or decisions adverse to the Federal Government. These proceedings and actions arise in the normal course of operations and their ultimate disposition is unknown. The NWCF has accrued contingent liabilities for legal actions where the Office of General Counsel (OGC) considers an adverse decision probable and the amount of the loss is measurable. In the event of an adverse judgment against the Government, some of the liabilities may be payable from the U.S. Treasury Judgment Fund. The NWCF records contingent liabilities in Note 12, Other Liabilities. For FY 2013, NWCF materiality threshold for reporting litigation, claims, or assessments is $3.7 million. The NWCF OGC conducts a review of litigation and claims threatened or asserted involving NWCF to which the OGC attorneys devoted substantial attention in the form of legal consultation or representation. The NWCF currently has 4 cases that meet the existing FY 2013 materiality threshold. NWCF legal counsel was unable to express an opinion concerning the likely outcome on 2 of 4 cases. The DON is a party in numerous individual contracts that contain clauses, such as price escalation, award fee payments, or dispute resolution, that may result in a future outflow of expenditures.

FECA provides Federal employees injured in the performance of duty with workers' compensation benefits, which include wage-loss benefits for total or partial disability, monetary benefits for permanent loss of use of a schedule member, medical benefits, and vocational rehabilitation. FECA also provides survivor benefits to eligible dependents if the injury causes the employee's death. FECA is administered by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs.134 Department of the Navy Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Financial ReportThe obligations and liabilities for military pensions, military retirement health benefits, military Medicare-eligible retiree benefits, the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program, and the DoD Education Benefits Fund are reported at the Department level. actuarial cost Method used The NWCF's actuarial liability for workers' compensation benefits is developed by the Department of Labor and provided to NWCF only at the end of each fiscal year. The estimate for future workers' compensation benefits includes the expected liability for death, disability, medical, and miscellaneous costs for approved compensation cases, plus a component for incurred but not reported claims. The liability is determined using a method that utilizes historical benefit payment patterns related to a specific incurred period to predict the ultimate payments related to that period. NoTe 15.

The intent of the SNC is to provide gross and net cost information related to the amount of output or outcome for a given program or organization administered by a responsible reporting entity. The Department of Defense's (DoD) current processes and systems do not capture and report accumulated cost for major programs based upon the performance measures as required by the Government Performance and Results Act. The DoD is in the process of reviewing available data and developing a cost reporting methodology as required by the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 4. \"Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government,\" as amended by SFFAS No. 30, \"Inter-entity Cost Implementation.\" Intragovernmental costs and revenue are related to transactions made between two reporting entities within the Federal Government. Public costs and revenues are exchange transactions made between the reporting entity and a non-Federal entity. Large balances in the Public costs and revenue lines are a result of the current process in Navy Enterprise Resource Planning. The process produces inflated gains and offsetting losses on separate financial statement and note schedule lines, however, the impact on Net Cost is reduced when the gains and losses are combined. The Navy is currently working to resolve the business process that results in daily postings to the gain and loss accounts for in-transit inventory. The NWCF's financial management systems do not track intragovernmental transactions by customer at the transactional level. Buyer-side expenses are adjusted to agree with internal seller-side revenues. Expenses are generally adjusted by reclassifying amounts between Federal and non-Federal expenses. Intradepartment revenues and expenses are then eliminated.135 Na vy WorkiNg Capital FuNdNoTe 16.
