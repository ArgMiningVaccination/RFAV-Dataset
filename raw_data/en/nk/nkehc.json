DISAPPROVED -- A c harge not covered by a third party payer. CP38 PROVIDER NAME -- In some instances, a provider may have more than one name. This question is asking if the paperwork (i.e., bill or statement) indicate s that the provider is listed under another name.

RE02 RE06 RESPONDENT RULES -- BEST/PREFERRED RESPONDENT: The best or preferr ed respondent for the interview is the person who is most know ledgeable about the family's health care and who is keeping records about health care use and expenses since January 1, 2003. For ROUND 1, this is likely to be the person who was the respondent for the NHIS interview and, in most cases, was the pers on contacted on the advance contact effort. For ROUNDS 2-5, the best respondent is the person who was respondent for the previous round's interview. SELECTING A NEW RU MEMBER AS RESPONDENT: If you need to select a new respondent for the RU, select an RU member who is at least 18 years old or older and knowledgeable about the family's health care use and expenses. Always encourage all adult RU members to assist with the interview, especially if there is a specific RU member for whom the selected respondent cannot provide all health information. Keep in mind that a new 77 Definitions of T erms Used in MEPS-HC Questionnaires August 24, 2004 respondent may also be a new member of the RU. Verify that the person is a member of the RU before selecting 'RU member' for respondent type. PROXY RESPONDENTS: In a small number of cases it may not be possible to conduct an interview with an RU member. Examples include: - A single person RU consisting of an elderly respondent with impaired memory or who is unable to focus on the interview. - An RU where all members have died and/or entered an ins titution on or after the first day of the reference period (for Round 1, this date is January 1, 2003; for Rounds 2-5, this date is the date of the previous round's interview). In cases where a pr oxy respondent is necessary, try to determine who outside the RU could provide information about the medical care and expenses for the RU member(s). The proxy respondent must be someone 18 years or older who can provide information about the RU member(s) health care use and expenses during the person's referenc e period. BEFORE YOU COMPLETE TH E INTERVIEW WITH A PROXY, YOU MUST OBTAIN APPRO VAL FROM YOUR SUPERVISOR. NOTE: If the only RU member died or entered an institution BEFORE January 1, 2003, DO NOT CONTINUE WITH THE INTERVIEW. Verify the date of death or institutionalization and close out the case. RE09 LOCATING ADDRESS -- The locating address is where the RU members actually live. This will not necessarily be the same as the address where their mail is received or as their legal or voting residence. It is the address you will use to locate the RU for the in-person interview. Try to obtain as co mplete an address as possible, verifying or obtaining house numbers and apartment numbers when necessary. If the locating address is a description (for example, brick house with green shutters and front porch), probe the respondent for the actual address, such as the one the post office uses to deliver mail to the home. Be sure to verify all parts of the address, including the zip code. If the respondent reports that there is a separate mailing address (for example, a post office box), tell the respondent that you will be asking for the mailing address at the end of the interview.

It is necessary to pr obe further when a person is reported as 'separated' -- if t he spouse is absent for reasons other than marital discord, the 'married' category applies. A person is considered N EVER MARRIED if s/he has never been LEGALLY married. If the person has had informal unions in the past but has never had a legal marriage, s/he is included in this category even 86 Definitions of T erms Used in MEPS-HC Questionnaires August 24, 2004 if s/he considered themselv es as living together as married partners. If the respondent asks what is meant by marriage, tell him or her that we are only interested in LEGAL married status for this question. However, accept what t he respondent tells you here without attempting to reconcile the response wi th information given previously concerning the marital status of the person. For example, if a respondent tells you here that he is married, but when you collected relationship information he told you that the woman he is living with is his 'partner', you would code him here as married and continue to the next person in the RU without questioning his response. An answer indicating that an RU member is 'single' or 'not married' should be probed to determine if s/he has been married in the FORCES) -- This includes: - Pers ons on full-time ac tive duty in the Army, Navy, Air Forc e, Marine Corps , or Coast Guard unit present ly activated as part of the regular Armed Forces. - Pers ons in the Res erve Forces on a six-month active service (in connection with t he provisions of the Reserve Force Act of 1955).

If the person attended school OUTSIDE OF THE 'REGULAR' SCHOOL SYSTEM, you will need to probe to determine if the schooling is applicable here. Use the following guidelines to determine if the schooling should be included at this question: Training Programs - Count training re ceived 'on the job', in the Armed Forces, or through correspondenc e school ONLY if it was credited toward a school diploma, high school equivalency (GED), or college degree.

If the pers on has not actually completed all four years of high 111Definitions of T erms Used in MEPS-HC Questionnaires August 24, 2004 school, but has acquired his/her GED (high school equivalency based on passing the GED exam), count this as you would a high school graduate and enter code '12'. Adult Educ ation - Adult education classes should NOT be included as regular school unless such schooling has been counted for credit in a regular school system. If a person has taken adult education classes but NOT FOR CREDIT, these classes should not be counted as regular school .

This means that for persons who skipped or repeated grades in elementary school, you will enter the highest grade completed REGARDLESS of the number of years they were in school. This rule is true for elementary school through high school and is especially relevant to college. For example, if the person you are aski ng about is reported as having a 'Bachelor's Degree', it should be coded as '16' (College - Fourth Year) regardless of how many years it took him/her to receive it. Code '17' (College - Five or More Years) should be entered only if the person has completed one or more years of graduate or professional school.

Exampl es include a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Doc tor of Laws (J.D.), Doc tor of Medic ine (M.D.), etc .

For example, if the 113Definitions of T erms Used in MEPS-HC Questionnaires August 24, 2004 pers on is in his /her last term towards earning a Bachelor's degree, code 'NO DEGREE'. OTHER -- If the person obtained an educational degree other than a Bachelor's, Master's , or Doctorate degree, code 'OTHER'.
