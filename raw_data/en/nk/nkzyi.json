This systematic review was conducted as part of the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project (P/B-24 Project) by USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR). The purpose of the P/B -24 Project was to conduct a series of systematic reviews on diet and health for women who are pregnant and for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age. This project was a joint initiati ve led by USDA and HHS, and USDA's NESR carried out all of the systematic reviews. A Federal Expert Group (FEG), a broadly representative group of Federal researchers and program leaders , also provided input throughout the P/B -24 Project. More information about the P/B -24 Project has been publishedii and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/project -specific - overview -pb-24-0 NESR, formerly the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL), specializes in conducting food - and nutrition -related systematic reviews using a rigorous , protocol -driven methodology . To conduct each P/B -24 systematic review, NESR's staff worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC) , which is a group of 7 -8 leading subject matter experts . NESR's systematic review methodology involves developing and prioritizing systematic review questions, searching for and selecting studies, extracting and assessing the risk of bias of data from each included study, synthesizing the evidence, developing a conclusion statement, grading the evidence underlying the conclusion statement, and recommen ding future research. A detailed description of the methodology used in conducting systematic reviews for the P/B -24 Project has been publishediii and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/pb -24-project -methodology -0. In addition, starting on page 19, this document includes details about the methodology as it was applied to the systematic review described herein. An analytic framework that illustrates the overall scope of the question, including the population, the interventions and/or exposures, c omparators, and outcomes of interest, is found on page 19.

The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between timing of introduction of complemen tary foods and beverages (CFB) and developmental milestones ? Complementary feeding is the process that starts when human milk or infant formula is complemented by other foods and beverages, beginning during infancy and typically continuing to 24 months of age. CFB were defined as foods and/or beverages other than human milk or infant formula ( liquids, semisolids, and solids) provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy. Conclusion Statement There was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the relationships betwee n timing of introduction of CFB and developmenta l milestones . Grade: Grade Not Assignable Methods This systematic review was conducted by a team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review in collaboration with a Technical Expert Collaborative. Literature search was conducted using 4 data bases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and CINAHL) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of timing of CFB introduction and the outcomes of developmental milestones. A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have b een included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by two analysts independently for inclusion based on pre -determined criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were check ed for accuracy. The body of evidence was qualitatively synthesized to inform development of a conclusion statement(s), and the strength of evidence was graded using pre -established criteria evaluating the body of evidence on risk of bias, adequacy, consis tency, impact, and generalizability. Summary of the Evidence Three articles (one RCT; two observational studies) met criteria for inclusion that examined timing of introduction of CFB and developmental milestones o The RCT found no associations between timing of CFB and receptive or expressive language or fine - or gross -motor milestones at 30 -35 months o One observational study reported that earlier CFB introduction at 4 months relative to at/after 6 months was associated wit h earlier gross - motor milestone achievement (e.g., crawling, cruising, and walking) via maternal report by 18 months of age 11 o The other observational study found no associations between timing of CFB introduction and reading or math skills at 4 years of age The relationship between timing of introduction of CFB and developmental milestones may be influenced by a number of related factors, such as birth weight, current weight, type of early feeding (breast, formula, or mixed feedings), types and/or amount of h uman milk and CFB consumed, and the interval between exposure and outcome assessment The ability to draw conclusions was restricted by an inadequate amount of or limited evidence with the potential for reverse causality, and wide variation in study design, type and age of outcome assessment, exposure assessment, and reported results. 12 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between the timing of introduction of complementary foods and beverages and developmental milestones ? Conclusion statement There is insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the relationship between the timing of introduction of complementa ry foods and beverages (CFB) and developmental milestones. Grade Grade Not Assignable Summary This review incl udes three studies published since 1980 that examined the relationship between the timing of introduction to c omplementary foods and beverages (CFB ) and developmental milestones during childhood through 18 years of age, including one randomized controlled trial (RCT) and two observational studies. o CFB were defined as foods and/or beverages other than human milk or infant formula (liquids, semisolids, and solids) provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy o Outcomes from birth to 4 y ears of age included: communication development (e.g., expressive language) cognitive development (e.g., math skills) motor development (e.g., age of crawling/walking) The relationship between the timing of introduction of CFB on developmental milestones remains unclear. This is due to a limited amount of evidence with wide variation in study design, especially the type and age of outcome assessment, as well as the potential for reverse causality. o The RCT found no associations between timing of CFB and rec eptive or expressive language or fine - or gross -motor milestones at 30 -35 months o One observational study reported that earlier CFB introduction at 4 months relative to at/after 6 months was associated with earlier gross - motor milestone achievement (e.g., c rawling, cruising, and walking) via maternal report by 18 months of age o The other observational study found no associations between timing of CFB introduction and reading or math skills at 4 years of age The relationship between timing of introduction of C FB and developmental milestones may be influenced by a number of related factors, such as birth weight, current weight, type of early feeding (breast, formula, or mixed feedings), types and/or amount of human milk and CFB consumed, and the interval between exposure and outcome assessment. The body of evidence highlights the importance of using validated, standardized tests as opposed to maternal recall to assess developmental outcomes. Description of the evidence 13 This systematic review three studies that examined the association betwee n the timing of introduction of CFB and developmental milestones, including one randomized controlled trial (RCT) (1) and two prospective cohort studies (2, 3) (Table 1). All studies analyzed age of CFB introduction categorically, though the categories varied, including before and after 4 mo, 20 wk, and 26 wk. Outcomes that were reported by these studies included developmental milestone achievement, sco res on developmental indices, and academic skills. These outcomes fit within one or more of the following domains of development (4): communication (1, 2) motor (1, 3) , and cognitive (2), and were assessed from birth -18 mo, at 30 -35 mo, or at 4 y of age. No studies were identified that examined executive function, social/emotional or neurologi cal development, or incidence and prevalence of anxiety or depression (see Figure 1). Developmental milestones were assessed using maternal recall/home observation by research staff (3), the Brigance Screens -II test at 30 -35 mo of age (1), and a questionnaire based on letter knowledge, word recognition, matching patterns, and counting (2). The studies wer e conducted in Iceland and the United States (U.S.), both of which are \"very high\" according to the Human Development Index (5). Evidence s ynthesis Timing of introduction of CFB and developmental milestones Timing of CFB & communication development Two studies reported outcomes related to co mmunication development (Table 1 ). In one RCT, Jonsdottir et al. (1) reported no differences between breastfed (BF) infants who were exclusively BF (EBF) until 6 mo compared to those who were assigned to receive CFB beginning at age 4 mo in receptive/expressive lang uage scores at age 30 -35 mo. In one prospective cohort study, Gibbs and Forste (2) reported no association between timing of introduction of CFB in infants (either BF, FF, or mixed -fed) and reading skills at age 4 y; the investigators did not account for potential confounders during the follow -up time period such as dietary intake between assessments. Therefore, a conclusion on the association between timing of introduction of CFB and communications development is difficult to determine due to the variance in type and age of o utcome assessment across studies. Timing of CFB & cognitive development One prospective cohort study (2) also examined co gnitive outcomes, reporting no association between timing of introduction of CFB and math skills at age 4 y (Table 1 ). Due to the observational nature of this study, the non -validated assessment of cognitive outcomes, lack of accounting for potential confo unding, and an overall inadequate number of studies, a conclusion on the association between timing of introduction of CFB and cognitive development is difficult to determine. Timing of CFB & motor development Two articles, from one RCT and one cohort stud y, reported results related to motor development. In the RCT, Jonsdottir et al. (1) reported no significant difference in gross - motor skills assessed by trained research nurses at 30 -35 mo, between BF infants who were EBF t o 6 mo relative to those who were randomly assigned at 4 mo to receive CFB (Table 1 ). In one observational study, Heinig et al. (3) reported that BF infants who were introduced to CFB before 26 wk compared to those introduced at or after 26 wk, reached the following milestones significantly earlier: rolls over back to front, creeping, crawling, sits from lying, pulls to stand, crui sing, st ands alone, and walking (Table 1 ). In addition, FF 14 infants who were introduced to CFB before 20 wk compared to at or after 20 wk, walked earlier. However, the result with FF infants should be interpreted with caution as there were fewer FF infants in the study and they were introduced to CFB earlier than BF infants. Reverse causation may explain these findings. That is, achievement of developmental milestones at an earlier age may influence the timing of introduction of CFB by caregivers, who may ba se their feeding decisions on perceived developmental readiness. Although outcomes were reported by mothers the week they occurred, trained research staff conducted home observations to verify milestone achievement. Due to an inadequate number of RCTs and variability across studies in type and age of outcome assessment, a conclusion about the relationship between timing of introduction of CFB and motor development is difficult to determine. 15 Table 1.

De 17 Discussion There was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the relationship between timing of introduction of CF B and developmental milestones . A grade could not be assigned due to the limited amount of evidence, which varied in study design, type/age of developmental milestone assessment, and potential for reverse causality. Limitations Only thr ee studies published since 1980, including one RCT and two observational studies, met criteria for inclusion. One of the studies (the RCT) may have been underpowered due to missing data/high attrition rate (1). One of the prospective cohort studies did not report a sample size/power calculation and is limited by a high attrition rate (>20%), although the analytic sample size was large (2). In all three studies, reported outcomes from birth to 4 y of age varied and included communica tion (e.g., expressive language), cognitive (e.g., math skills) , and motor (e.g., age of crawling/walking) development . The relationship between timing of introduction of CFB and developmental milestones may be influenced by a number of related factors, s uch as birth weight, current weight, type of early feeding (human milk, formula, and/or mixed feeding practices), types and/or amount of human milk and CFB consumed, and the interval between exposure and outcome assessment. One methodological limitation ac ross the two cohort studies includes the variability in controlling for confounding factors, such as feeding practices aside from complementary feeding. While the RCT included only EBF infants (1), the two cohort studies (2, 3) examined infants with variable feeding practices and eithe r adjusted for that in analyses or examined BF and FF infants separately. In addition, the cohort studies did not consistently describe the types and amounts of human milk and CFB consumed by infants. Across the body of evidence, the validity/reliability of outcome assessment measures varied. One study used a validated questionnaire and screening tests that have a wide range of normal values (1), one used maternal report of milestones in combination with observation of research staff at home visits (3), and one used a qu estionnaire that was not validated (2). Therefore, the body of evidence highlights the importance of using validated, standardized tests as opposed to maternal recall to assess developmental outcomes. 18 Research recommendations Additional research examining the relationship between the timing of introduction of CFB and developmental milestones would be useful with consideration to the following recommendations: 1. Use of validated, standardized developmental tests as opposed to maternal recall; 2. Consideration of whether assessment tests have predictability for longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes. It remains unclear whether earlier achievement of developmental milestones predicts enduring effects on developmental outcomes later in childhood. Included articles 1.

The results of an electronic database search were s creened independ ently by two NESR analysts by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full text articles to determine which articles met the criteria for inclusion. A manual search was done to ascertain articles not identified through the electronic database search. The systemat ic review on timing o f introduction of CFB included 3 articles, and the systematic review on types and amounts of CFB consumed included 8 articles. The literature search was conducted for multiple systematic reviews that addressed complementary feedi ng and various health outcomes. 31 Excluded articles The table below lists the excluded articles with at least one reason for exclusion, but may not reflect all possible reasons.
