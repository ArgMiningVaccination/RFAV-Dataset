Please describe how the needs and priorities identified in your most recent CHNA compare with those identified in your previous CHNA. The needs and priorities identified in UM Capital's most recent CHNA are significantly the same or similar to those identified in the previous CHNA. The most recent joint CHNA assessed and identified significant community health needs in the County. Input was solicited from County residents using key informants interviews and surveys. Through a prioritization process involving a variety of community stakeholders and community-based organizations, the following were identified as CHNA priority community health needs: Behavioral Health o Mental Health o Substance Abuse o Domestic Violence/Violence Metabolic Syndrome o Obesity o Diabetes o Heart Disease o Hypertension/Stroke Cancer The previous CHNA identified similar needs, specifically, barriers associated with the high cost of care/insurance and the need for affordable prescription drugs; the need for adequate preventive and basic care; high prevalence of behavioral health issues; high prevalence of chronic disease; and the need for greater health education and awareness.

(Optional) Please use the box below to provide any other information about your CHNA that you wish to share. In 2016, UM Capital Region Health completed a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for Fiscal Years 2017 - 2019 in collaboration with other area hospitals (Doctor's Community Hospital, Fort Washington Medical Center, MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center). The joint community health needs assessment process was led by the Prince George's County Health Department (\"Health Department\"). The objective of the joint effort was to design and produce the first County-wide community health needs assessment. The CHNA stakeholders engaged in a collaborative process to conduct a comprehensive community health needs assessment process in Prince George's County, Maryland that complies with the CHNA requirements as set forth by the Internal Revenue Code and Public Health Department certification requirements. The process involved the collection and analysis of valid data (quantitative and qualitative) to ascertain residents' health status, identify trends in health problems, as well as the social and economic determinants impacting the health of Prince George's County residents. A written report of the community health need assessment process and findings was prepared and presented to the Health Department and hospitals. The report included recommendations to address health need and other areas of concern to the Health Department and County-based hospitals, based on the CHNA findings. Recommendations include public health policy, processes, programs or interventions. - Behavioral Health o Mental Health o Substance Abuse o Domestic Violence/Violence - Metabolic Syndrome o Obesity o Diabetes o Heart Disease o Hypertension/Stroke - Cancer The most recent Community Health Needs Assessment (2017 - 2019) included the following findings: Over three-fourths of the population in Prince George's County is comprised of minorities, led by 62.1% Black, Non-Hispanic (NH) followed by the Hispanic population (16.9%). Between 2010 and 2014, the Hispanic population grew the fastest with an 18.3% increase. The Asian population grew by 13.6% and the Black or African American population grew by 2.3%. The White, Non-Hispanic population declined slightly, from 129,668 in 2010 to 128,234 in 2014. Overall, the demographics of Prince George's County differ from the state of Maryland. While Maryland has a majority White, Non-Hispanic (NH) population, Prince George's County has a majority Black, NH population. Prince George's County also has a higher proportion of Hispanics than the state. Prince George's County has a younger population compared to Maryland and the U.S. The median age in the county is 36.1 years, while the state is at 38.3 and the U.S. is at 37.7. A larger percent of the County's population is under 45 years of age. There are some variations by race and ethnicity, as demonstrated in Table 2, with the median age of the Hispanic population of 28.4, which is much younger compared to other residents. In contrast, the White, NH population is older, with a median age of 44.6. Foreign Born Residents. In Prince George's County, 1 out of every 5 residents (21.8%) is born outside the United States. The countries that contribute the most to the foreign-born population include El Salvador, Guatemala, Nigeria, Mexico, and Jamaica: these five countries account for nearly half of the total foreign-born population. Of the nearly 200,000 foreign born residents in the County, 40% are naturalized U.S. citizens with a median household income of $72,093, compared to $56,274 for the 60% who are not U.S. citizens. Approximately 7% of families in Prince George's County live in poverty, which is similar to Maryland at 7.1% and lower than the United States at 11.3%. Fewer married couple families experience poverty (3.4%), but 12.4% of families with a female head of household lived in poverty. This figure increases to 17.6% among single-mother households with children under 18 years of age. Family poverty by race and ethnicity shows a disparity with approximately two times the percent of Hispanic families lived in poverty across the different families types. Education. Approximately 85% of County residents age 25 years and older have at least a high school degree, which is lower than Maryland (90%) and the U.S. (87%) While Prince George's County is similar to the U.S. for those with Bachelor's Degrees and higher (31% and 30%), the County falls behind when compared to Maryland (38%). There is more of disparity when comparing the County to the neighboring jurisdiction of Washington, D.C., which has 55% of residents with a Bachelor's Degree or higher. There are noticeable differences within the County by race and ethnicity, with Asian residents having high educational attainment, followed by White, Non-Hispanic (NH) residents. Most Black residents do have a High School Degree, but fewer have a college degree compared to Asian and White, NH residents. The County's Hispanic residents have the most significant disparity, with over 50% lacking a High School Degree or equivalent, and less than 10% having a Bachelor's Degree or higher. In 2015, 127,576 County children and adolescents enrolled in public schools. While the overall graduation rate has increased since 2012, Hispanic students are still less likely to complete high school in the County. Overall, Prince George's County has a lower graduation rate (78.75%) compared to Maryland (86.98%) in 2015. Part of that difference may be due to the graduation rate for Hispanic students in Maryland being over 10 percent higher (76.89% compared to 67.37% for the County). Employment. In 2014, 9.1% of Prince George's County residents were unemployed, which is higher than both Maryland and the U.S. at 7.2%. The county unemployment rate varies by education, disability status, and by race and Hispanic ethnicity. Overall, one-third of residents age 16 and older living in poverty are unemployed. Unemployment can result in residents being unable to acquire basic resources such as healthy food, housing, transportation, and health care and medication. Income. The median household income in the County is $72,290 which is lower than Maryland ($73,971), but is higher than the U.S. When looking at income by groups, Maryland has more residents making below $25,000 compared to Prince George's County; however, Maryland also has more residents making above $150,000 compared to Prince George's County, which helps to explain the higher mean and median income for the state. Income by Race and Ethnicity in the County shows both that more White, Non-Hispanic (NH) and Asian households have an income over $100,000. The Hispanic population has an income disparity, with nearly half of the households with an income under $50,000, and only 3% of households earning over $150,000 compared to over 15% Black, Asian, and White, NH households. Challenges & Health Statistics The CHNA identified specific drivers of poor health outcomes that significantly impact County residents. They are: 1. Poor social determinants of health drive many of our health disparities. Poverty, food insecurity, access to healthy food, affordable housing, employment, lack of educational attainment, inadequate financial resources, and a disparate built environment result in poorer health outcomes for Prince George's county residents. Resources may be available in communities with greater needs, but are of poorer quality. For example, a recent study in access to healthy foods in an urban area of the county show that there are many grocery stores, but they lack quality healthy food options. 2. Access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act has not helped everyone. Many residents still lack health insurance (some have not enrolled, some are not eligible). In addition, many with health insurance cannot afford healthcare (co-pays). 3. Residents lack knowledge of or how to use available resources. The healthcare system is challenging to navigate, and providers and support services need more coordination. There are services available, but they are perceived as underutilized because residents do not know how to locate or use them. Low literacy and low health literacy contribute to poor outcomes. 4. The county does not have enough healthcare providers to serve the residents. There is a lack of behavioral health providers, dentists, specialists, and primary care providers (also noted in the 2015 Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan for the county). 5. Cancer. By cancer site, Black residents in the county had higher incidence and mortality rates for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. However, overall, White non-Hispanic residents had a higher cancer mortality rate (2014). 6. HIV. Prince George's County had the second highest rate of HIV diagnoses in the state in 2013, and had the highest number of actual cases in the state. 7. Asthma. For adults, Black county residents have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate due to asthma that is more than twice as high as White, non-Hispanic residents (2010-2012). Although the joint CHNA encompassed the needs of the County's hospitals as a whole it was not a series of hospital-specific needs assessments. The assessment utilized quantitative and qualitative data, as available. The joint County-wide CHNA provides required data and information for the hospitals to use. Each hospital used the data collected in the CHNA process to: 1) identify their own geographical priority issues; 2) develop and implement strategies and action plans for each priority issue, and 3) establish accountability to ensure measurable health improvement. It is believed the proposed community involvement in the County-wide CHNA process will meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for CHNA for the hospitals, including implementation plans that outline the hospitals' approaches to addressing the needs identified in the joint CHNA. The final County-wide CHNA was submitted to the hospitals in early June 2016. Each participating hospital then produced its Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP), which outlines the priorities for each hospital and initiatives it will implement to address the needs identified in the CHNA.Q60.Q60.

An adequate supply of primary care physicians can reduce rates of complications that can result in high cost ED visits and hospitalizations. In recent years, the per capita number of primary care physicians has declined in Prince George's County. Also, the per capita number of primary care physicians in Baltimore, Howard, and Montgomery counties, and the District of Columbia, exceeded that of Prince George's County by one and a half to two times. The Health Department prepared the 2016 Prince George's County Community Health Needs Assessment that includes a detailed description of the process and the major. The Health Department also produced a comprehensive inventory of community resources and assets and hospital specific profiles, including Prince George's Hospital Center Service Profile and Laurel Regional Hospital Center Service Profile. These documents are included as appendices to this report. The County-wide CHNA found that many of the health disparities in the County were driven by social determinants of health including poverty, food insecurity, lack of access to healthy food, affordable housing, low employment, lack of educational attainment, inadequate financial resources and disparate built environment. Findings also indicated that, while progress has been made with implementation of components of the primary healthcare strategic plan, the County continues to have a shortage of primary care providers, medical specialists, behavioral health providers, and dentists.Q144.Q144.

UMMS adopted the Medicaid expansion income eligibility limits (MD DHMH, Medicaid Planning Administration Income Eligibility Limits) that Maryland implemented, to close the gap between Medicaid income eligibility and our FA income eligibility. 2. UMMS changed the eligible household dependent age limit to from under 18 to 21 years old The following additional changes were also made to the hospital's financial assistance policy pursuant to the most recent 501(r) regulatory requirements: 1. LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS a. Requirement: The new 501(r) regulations lowered the language translation threshold for limited English proficient (LEP) populations to the lower of 5% of LEP individuals in the community served/1000-LEP individuals. University of Maryland Medical Center translated its financial assistance policy into the following languages: English, Spanish, French, and Chinese. 2. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY a. Requirement: The new 501(r) regulations require a plain language summary of the FAP that is clear, concise, and easy for a patient to understand. University of Maryland Medical Center created a new plain language summary of its financial assistance policy in addition to its already-existing patient information sheet. 3. PROVIDER LISTS a. Requirement: The new 501(r) regulations require each hospital to create and maintain a list of all health care providers (either attached to the FAP or maintained as a separate appendix) and identify which providers on that list are covered under the hospital's FAP and which providers are not.

Plans for a transformed new regional health care system that focuses on population health are under way through a unique partnership among the County, the state and academic and health care institutions. These plans come at a time of great momentum at the national, state and County levels to advance health care reform and eliminate health disparities. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and A ordable Care Act (ACA). Under the leadership of the O'Malley-Brown administration, the state of Maryland has created a Health Benet Exchange, designed to expand health care coverage and fulll the provisions of the ACA. The state also is proactively pursuing strategies to pro- mote health equity, as demonstrated by the passage of legislation creating \"health enterprise zones\" to expand and improve access to care in underserved areas. Prince George's County Execu- tive Rushern L. Baker, III has placed health as one of his administration's top priorities, and together with the County Council has taken deliberate steps to enhance the County's safety net system and to address social and environmental determinants of health. T o inform the design of this new system to improve health and health care in Prince George's County, the University of Maryland School of Public Health was commissioned to assess the proposed system's potential public health impact and to answer key questions. The study sponsors are Prince George's County, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), the University of Maryland Medical System and Dimensions Healthcare System. These parties, plus the University System of Maryland, signed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2011 to address long-standing challenges and gaps in the health care delivery system and achieve improved health for the County. The Public Health Impact Study of Prince George's County comes at an early stage in the development of a \"strategy to transform the system into an ecient, e ective and nancially viable health care delivery system with a regional medical center,\" a system that is \"supported by a comprehensive ambulatory care network, which will improve the health of residents of the County and Southern Maryland region by providing community-based access to high quality, cost-e ective medical care\" (from the July 2011 Memoran- dum of Understanding). An interdisciplinary team of senior School of Public Health researchers produced the Public Health Impact Study of Prince George's County by building upon existing relevant reports and studies, such as the 2009 Rand report, \"Assessing Health and Health Care in Prince George's County,\" and collecting and analyzing a wealth of new data. Representatives of the study sponsors served on the advisory com- mittee that helped guide the study. The study team learned from resident experiences; listened to policy-makers, County and state leaders and health care providers; and explored and documented best practices from com- parable health care systems. The study highlights policy-relevant opportunities, focuses on improving health outcomes, provides regional and sub-county mapping of all categories of primary care providers and assesses County PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY AT A GLANCE The nation's most a uent County with an African American majority Maryland's most diverse County: \"minority\" groups account for more than 80 percent of the population (blacks, whites and Hispanics made up 65 percent, 15 percent and 15 percent of the population in 2010, respectively) The second most populous County in the state of Maryland (after Montgomery County) Home to the University of Maryland, College Park; NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center; Joint Base Andrews (previously Andrews Air Force Base) and USDA's Beltsville Agricultural Research Center Bordered by Washington, D.C., and Montgomery, Howard, Anne Arundel, Calvert and Charles data. This study adds new information related to: \u0099\u0015how residents use and perceive health care and health issues in the County, \u0099\u0015what works in other model health care systems that can be applied in Prince George's County, \u0099\u0015how state and County leaders and stakeholders perceive what is needed for a new health care system to succeed, \u0099\u0015where there is an inadequate supply of primary care providers and resources, \u0099\u0015what exists in the public health and public sectors to complement the new system, and \u0099\u0015how residents with key chronic health conditions use hospitals in the County and region. A SNAPSHOT OF FINDINGS FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT STUDY COMPONENTS The study team used multiple novel and integrated approaches to answer the study's key framing questions and to inform the design of the new system. The Public Health Impact Study was guided by the need to: \u0099\u0015promote health, prevent disease and support wellness, health equity, health literacy and quality of life in the County, \u0099\u0015address population health broadly, not focus just on those seeking health care, and \u0099\u0015improve the capacity to deliver high-quality primary prevention and health and hospital care. In the snapshot of our results from each study component we highlight ndings that provide new informa- tion about health care in the County. /S.sc/u.sc/r.sc/v.sc/e.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /C.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/y.sc /R.sc/e.sc/s.sc/i.sc/d.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/s.sc We learned from the Random House- hold Survey of 1,001 County residents (referred to throughout as \"the survey\") about current use of and attitudes toward health care services and gained an understanding of the factors that drive residents' health care decisions. Key ndings include: \u0099\u0015While 75 percent of residents have a \"personal doctor,\" 10 percent of these residents go outside the County to see this provider. \u0099\u0015Of those who use a doctor outside the County, more than 7 percent indicated that their insurance required them to see a physician outside the County, and more than 7 percent reported being unable to get an appointment with a specialist inside the County. The frequency with which residents use hospitals outside the County remains an even greater issue, and is driven by insurance carriers, provider referrals, availability of specialty care and perceptions of the quality of care at local hospitals. Almost 31 percent of residents who reported using a hospital outside of the County did so because their physician referred them to do so, and 13 percent reported that their insurance coverage dictated their hos- pital selection. Addressing these issues will require a multi-pronged e ort aimed at County residents, health care providers and insurers. /I.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc/s.sc /w.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc /S.sc/t.sc/a.sc/t.sc/e.sc, /C.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/y.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /L.sc/o.sc/c.sc/a.sc/l.sc /S.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc The study team conducted 40 personal interviews with key stakeholders. They provided input regarding the current status of the County's health care and recommendations for the design of a new health care system. The lack of primary care resources and concerns about both the percep- tions of quality and the actual quality of the current health care and hos- pital system emerged as themes. As one stakeholder put it, \"Perception becomes reality unless otherwise challenged and the perception is that we don't have a good hospital system, and for some parts, they're right, but there are other parts of the hospital system that ought to be duplicated.\" Recommendations for the new system included the need for an academic university framework, culturally appro- priate health education and prevention, eective branding and centers of excel- lence among others.

We found that there are far fewer primary care providers for the population in Prince George's County compared to that in surrounding juris- dictions. Within the County, there is a need for additional providers within the Beltway and in the southern overview of pub- lic health and related facilities and programs that provide health and wellness services for County residents.

We reviewed hospitalizations for conditions that can ideally be managed more e ectively outside of a hospital setting. Using County data, we developed an econo- metric model and found an association between fewer hospitalizations and specic health care providers (those typically focused on care management). /L.sc/e.sc/s.sc/s.sc/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc /f.sc/r.sc/o.sc/m.sc /O.sc/t.sc/h.sc/e.sc/r.sc /H.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /C.sc/a.sc/r.sc/e.sc /S.sc/y.sc/s.sc/t.sc/e.sc/m.sc/s.sc We conducted interviews with leaders from 13 health care systems around the U.S. From these interviews, we identi- ed the following best practices aimed at achieving integrated, coordinated high-quality care that improves popula- tion health and reduces costs. These practices include: \u0099\u0015creating patient-centered, user- friendly and population-focused system goals and values, \u0099\u0015establishing clear and tested metrics for measuring progress and quality of care, \u0099\u0015using information technology systems that reinforce quality assurance and improvement, patient care coordination and use of evidence-based protocols of care, \u0099\u0015focusing on (and creating a culture of) health promotion, disease prevention and care management interventions that are culturally appropriate, enhance health literacy and build upon community-based partnerships with established community programs that educate about and reinforce healthy lifestyles, \u0099\u0015creating and supporting culturally sensitive, innovative, team-based and interprofessional care delivery, including embedding primary care providers in aftercare settings to prevent readmissions, \u0099\u0015investing in building care capacity of primary care physicians, such as strengthening their ability to address co-existing mental health conditions by adding behavioral health providers to the primary care physician teams, \u0099\u0015incorporating a mixture of entities to cover primary and tertiary care, such as community health centers, as well as hospitals, private and non-prot entities and mobile clinics (mix of public and private health systems), \u0099\u0015planning for care strategies to meet the needs of the uninsured and other vulnerable populations, such as the homeless and recent immigrants, \u0099\u0015providing incentives for health care teams to reduce disease rates, and \u0099\u0015developing their own and/ or negotiating insurance plan coverage for populations they serve. These snapshots summarize select ndings from our research. It is impera- tive to go beyond the statistics about gaps in the health care workforce and to understand the complex factors that aect health and health care in the County.

CATEGORIES OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS Policymakers, elected o cials and administratorsHealth practitioners Academic administrators Health system, insurance diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, asthma and cancer\u2014are the health conditions most amenable to improvement by a new health care system in Prince George's County. County residents experience a higher rate of these chronic diseases than those in most of the neighboring counties and in several cases, at a rate higher than the state average. Racial and ethnic differences reveal even greater disparities. These ve chronic conditions are prevalent in the County. Evidence- based interventions are available to prevent these conditions, and to manage them once they are diagnosed. Initiatives using these interventions are under way in the County and state, with a focus on promoting healthy lifestyles. In addition, primary care net- works, a component of the new system plans, are designed to coordinate care and manage such conditions. /R.sc/A.sc/T.sc/I.sc/O.sc/N.sc/A.sc/L.sc/E.sc Both the State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) and the County's Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) highlight these conditions as ones to be monitored closely. T able 1 provides health outcome rates for the selected chronic conditions. The rate of emer- gency department visits is used for FRAMING QUESTIONS TO INFORM THE PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION What are the key health outcomes in the County most amenable to improve-ment by a new health care system?What is the geographic distribution of health care resources and where are the areas of greatest need for primary care?What resources can be mobilized in the public health sector to comple-ment the impact of the health care system?What are the key issues to maximize uptake and achieve the potential of a health care system for public health? What elements of a health care system can a ect the key health outcomes and by how much?

Addition- ally, we examine death rates for two conditions, heart disease and cancer, which are leading causes of death in the County and state. While the overall health measures for several of these conditions appear to be better than that for the state as a whole, the rates for racial and ethnic County populations (see T able 2) provide the imperative for the new system. Rates for blacks exceed rates for whites for all conditions. Emergency department visits by blacks are more than three times higher for asthma and hypertension and nearly twice as high for diabetes than for whites. Address- ing the underlying causes for these and other di erences is needed to improve the County's health outcomes. County residents identied the ve key chronic conditions among those they viewed as the most critical ones to address. However, almost 16 percent of residents did not know which health conditions were urgent, indicating a need to inform residents of prevalent conditions and of how to prevent and manage them. The survey gathered more specic information about residents' experi- ences with chronic diseases. More than a third (37 percent) of the residents responded that their doctor or a health care professional had told them that they have a medical condition or chronic disease. When asked which conditions they were diagnosed with, residents noted the ve key health conditions among their top listed diag- noses (see T able 3). We were further interested in diag- noses of two key conditions that can contribute to signicant morbidity and mortality of these key health conditions if they are not addressed. When asked if they ever had been told by a doctor or other health care professional that they have pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes, 17 percent reported being diagnosed with pre-diabetes.

County residents are at greater risk for these chronic disease conditions due to contributing factors such as tobacco use and obesity. More than 11 percent reported daily use of cigarettes while 6 percent reported smoking cigarettes between one and 29 days a month. Body Mass Index, a calculation using a person's height and weight, is also an important indicator of chronic disease risk. We found that 34 percent of County residents are overweight and 35 percent are obese by using this measure (see Figure 1). A new health care system that incor- porates e orts aimed at addressing and preventing these and other risk factors will further contribute to improvements in these chronic County has a substantially lower ratio of primary care providers to the population compared to surrounding counties and the state. The areas of highest primary care need are within the Beltway and in the southern region of the County. An additional 61 primary care physicians (13 percent increase) and 31 dentists (7 percent increase) are needed to meet the minimum recommended ratios in these areas. We reviewed the geographic distri- bution of primary health care resources at the County and two sub-county levels. There are fewer providers for the population for each medical, dental and mental health primary care category compared to surrounding counties. In addition, there are sub-county areas where this ratio appears worse than the ratio used by the federal govern- ment to designate Health Professional Shortage Areas. For primary care physicians, four of the County's seven Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) have provider-to-population ratios that meet the federal criteria for primary care physician shortages. For dentists, two PUMAs have ratios that meet the criteria for dentist shortages. We iden- tied geographic primary care need by ZIP code using several measures. We looked at the ratio of primary care physicians to the population and found that nearly half of County residents live in areas that have a sucient number of primary care physicians, while a third live in areas where there is a high need for these providers. For a more specic look at geographic need for primary care, we included population charac- teristics and hospital use patterns in addition to physician count. Using this approach, we found seven ZIP codes have high primary care need, repre- senting 16 percent of County residents. /R.sc/A.sc/T.sc/I.sc/O.sc/N.sc/A.sc/L.sc/E.sc We used a variety of approaches to review County and sub-county geographic areas of need for primary care. One approach uses the ratio of health care providers to the population. FIGURE 1BODY MASS INDEX OF SURVEYED COUNTY RESIDENTS* Obese /i.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc /s.sc/t.sc/u.sc/d.sc/y.sc Another approach adds population and hospital event characteristics to that of provider information. ANALYSIS BY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CATEGORIES We closely examined physician avail- ability and capacity, and also reviewed the full array of primary care providers, including nine groups that represent three major categories of primary care providers: medical (primary care physi- cians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants); dental (dentists, dental hygienists); and mental (clinical social workers, psychologists, therapists/ counselors, psychiatrists). Databases for active licensed providers were obtained from the respective DHMH licensing boards. For all provider groups, except for physicians, counts were based on their practice location and no adjustments were made for specialty focus. We only counted licensed, board-certied primary care physicians who report providing patient care for 20 hours or more per week in a practice in the County. The County has 465 primary care physicians, which results in 54 primary care physicians per 100,000 people (1:1,851). When pediatri- cians alone are reviewed, the ratio is 39 per 100,000 children up to age 18 (1:2,564). More of the County's primary care physicians (42 percent) are involved only in patient care, compared with primary care physi-cians (37 percent) in the state as a whole. Fewer County primary care physicians reported being involved in teaching (21 percent vs. 30 percent) and research (6 percent vs. 10 percent) compared with those in the state. A review of provider-to-population ratios for each category of primary care provider is shown on T able 4. The sup-ply of health care providers for Prince George's County is far below that of other jurisdictions, and for the state as a whole, for every provider group. PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE NEED BY SUB-COUNTY GEOGRAPHIC AREA T o gain a better understanding of which areas of the County are served adequately, we looked at provider-to-population ratios for each category of providers, and compared them to the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) criteria used to designate Health Professionals Shortage Areas des- ignate an area as a medical HPSA is a primary care physician-to-population ratio of 1:3,500 or worse, while a ratio of 1:2,000 is deemed sucient. Map A highlights for each County ZIP code in which three categories of ratios are met: those that meet the recommended ratios for primary care physicians per 100,000 population TABLE 4THE RATIO OF MEDICAL, DENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS PER 100,000 POPULATION IN MARYLAND COUNTIES AND FOR THE STATE Jurisdiction Medical Care Dental Care Mental Health Care Primary Care Physician*Physician AssistantNurse Practitioner DentistDental Hygienist Social Worker Counselor Psychologist Psychiatrist Prince George's 53.9 39.0 24.2 54.4 17.1 45.9 42.2 13.2 3.6 Anne Arundel 65.7 70.3 64.5 63.1 57.8 78.5 56.4 27.5 3.9 Baltimore County 112.9 115.3 77.3 78.8 *Primary care physicians include specialists in pediatrics, family medicine, internal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology.viii/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc (green), those that reflect a shortage (red) and those that fall in between (yellow). Almost half (46 percent) of County residents live in areas that have a sucient number of primary care physicians, while a third (34 percent) of the residents live in areas where there is a high need for these providers. /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc /C.sc/a.sc/r.sc/e.sc designate sub-county geographic areas. The County has seven PUMAs, each reflecting populations about 100,000. Based on the provider counts in each of the three primary care categories, and the ratio of these providers to the population, we identied PUMAs with sucient providers and those that do not meet HRSA ratios for sucient providers. These ratios include 1:2000 for physicians, 1:3,000 for dentists and 1:10,000 for core mental health providers. T able 5 provides current counts and additional estimated counts needed for each category by PUMA. Using this approach, we found that several PUMAs need additional primary care physicians and dentists to reach a sucient provider-to- population ratio. We estimate that the County needs to increase the number of primary care physicians by 61 (about 13 percent) to meet the sucient provider-to-population ratio. Most of the PUMAs within the Beltway and one PUMA outside the Beltway would benet from additional physicians. T wo PUMAs within the Beltway would also benet from additional dentists, which translates to 31 dentists (about a 7 percent needed increase). While the ratio of core mental health providers to population for each PUMA appears sucient, the count of providers per PUMA is substantially lower in the PUMAs inside the Beltway than outside. If psychiatrists alone are used to estimate capacity for mental health care, we estimate the County would need to double the number of psychia- trists. A more detailed review of the County's mental health providers would allow for a better assessment of the capacity of this workforce category. ZIP CODE-LEVEL ANALYSIS OF HIGH PRIMARY CARE NEED This assessment complements the ZIP code area assessment of the primary care physician to population ratios (Map A). We developed an algorithm to identify ZIP codes where residents may be at higher need for primary care services, using provider, population and hospitalization data. We reviewed population income and education data since poor health status is associated with low income and low education status. We examined the pattern of hospital events by ZIP code, using the ratio of hospital discharges for preventable conditions and 30-day readmissions. Hospital readmissions within a 30-day period after discharge are viewed as a reflection of insuf- cient treatment to resolve the health condition in the prior hospitalization or the lack of appropriate primary care and home care. For hospital discharges, we looked specically at conditions associated with the chronic diseases and conditions identied as being most TABLE 5CURRENT COUNTS AND ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL NEEDED PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND CORE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS BY PUMA BASED ON PROPOSED SUFFICIENT PROVIDER-TO-POPULATION RATIOS RegionPhysicians Dentists Core Mental Health* CountAdditional Needed CountAdditional Needed CountAdditional Needed Inside Beltway PUMA 1 37 15 57 \u2014 85 \u2014 PUMA 3 34 13 21 10 56 \u2014 PUMA 4 35 22 17 21 75 \u2014 PUMA 7 62 \u2014 43 \u2014 36 \u2014 Outside BeltwayPUMA 2 102 \u2014 85 \u2014 184 \u2014 PUMA 5 128 \u2014 151 \u2014 274 \u2014 PUMA 6 67 11 96 \u2014 195 \u2014 T otal 456 +61 470 +31 905 \u2014 *Includes and Psychiatristsix/p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /i.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc /s.sc/t.sc/u.sc/d.sc/y.sc MAP APRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN-TO-POPULATION RATIO BY ZIP CODE IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN TO POPULATION RATIO 1:2,000 or better (meets recommended ratio) Between 1:2,000 and 1:3,500 1:3,500 and worse (does not meet recommended ratio) ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) are dened by Maryland Department of Planning.

We dened areas of high-primary care need as those that meet each of three criteria: \u0099\u0015primary care physician-to-population ratio at or worse than 1:3,500, \u0099\u0015a population with a median income and/ or education level lower than the County average, and \u0099\u0015a population whose 30-day readmission ratio and/ or hospital discharge ratio is higher than the County average (2007-2009 data). Map B provides a visual of several levels of primary care need, rang- ing from high need for primary care (red) to adequate primary care (blue) with levels in between. Using this approach, the County has seven ZIP code areas with high need for primary care. These areas represent about 16 percent of the County's population. Several of these ZIP codes include an existing federally designated medi- cally underserved population. We also identied additional levels of risk by identifying ZIP codes that meet the same population and hospital event criteria, but with a marginal provider- to-population ratio (worse than the recommended 1:2,000, but better than 1:3,500). These are designated \"trend- ing to high need.\" ZIP code areas with the latter provider-to-population ratio, but that have either the population or hospital event characteristics are designated as areas with medium need. The light blue areas reflect some need for primary care. This assessment adds an additional dimension of primary care need to that of the provider-to- population ratios in Integrating primary care and public health can link programs and activities to \"promote overall efciency and effectiveness and achieve gains in population health\" (IOM, 2012). We used secondary data to identify the presence and range of services provided by programs serving County residents, with a focus on vulnerable populations throughout the life span. The County's resources include: \u0099\u0015public health and social services; primary facilities; \u0099\u0015health programs in public schools; and \u0099\u0015other partners such as Parks and Recreation, the University of Maryland Extension and hospital- sponsored programs. County-led e orts to improve the public's health and expand access to primary care will complement the impact of a new health care system. Achievement of the County's 2020 goal of an accredited health department will ensure that the basic public health functions of assessment, assurance and policy development are in place. These functions can contribute to eective integration of programs within the County's public health sector, col- laborative e orts among hospitals to address community benet programs and the integration of public health programs with primary care. Also the County is in a position to take advan- tage of the ACA provisions to enhance its safety net clinic capacity and extend facilities such the School-based Well- ness Centers. The County's public sector and academic programs are additional assets that support health and wellness of residents. The County's Health Care Coalition formed during the Baker administration provides an important foundation on which to build strong partnerships among public health, primary care and medical center programs and to create a more integrated system of care.xii/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /R.sc/A.sc/T.sc/I.sc/O.sc/N.sc/A.sc/L.sc/E.sc Improving health outcomes requires building upon the existing assets within the County. We describe selected resources and the opportunities and challenges inherent in integrating them into a broader health system. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT The Health Department provides general screening and referral pro-grams, health education and counseling services, and about a third of the locations provide clinical care. Realizing the County Health Improvement Plan's goal of achieving an accredited health department in 2020 will be a major asset for the County. With the capacity to provide the essential public health services of assessment, assurance and policy development, the County Health Department will be in a position to facilitate e ective partnerships and tailor public health resources to meet population needs. Our study of health care systems reveals that public health depart-ments and Federally Qualied Health Centers were mentioned most often as potential public health resources that can be mobilized to comple- ment the health care system's impact on health outcomes. Despite lack of adequate funding for health depart- ments, creative ideas for mobilizing public health resources should be considered when designing the new health system. One example includes creating a state health department- sponsored chronic care initiative where insurers are required to participate in an integrated, collaborative system or community coalition with community health centers.COMMUNITY-BASED PRIMARY CARE CLINICS The County's capacity of community- based primary care, including the safety net clinics, remains severely limited. These programs serve a critical role in the health care delivery system, and provide primary care health services to vulnerable and uninsured or underin- sured populations. Federal designation of Medically Underserved Areas (MUA) and Medically Underserved Populations (MUP) and designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) identify areas of high need. These designations allow communi- ties to request providers through the National Health Service Corps and establish of certication of facilities such as Federally Qualied Health Centers (FQHCs) or FQHC \"look-alike\" centers. The County has eight MUAs or MUPs, and is the only County in the state with multiple MUPs. The County has only one well-established FQHC\u2014 Greater Baden Medical Services\u2014that has multiple locations. In addition, two other FQHCs, Mary's Center and Community Clinic Inc. have recently established clinical sites within the County. The health care systems we interviewed highlighted the importance of FQHCs in providing primary care to underserved populations. The ACA contains provisions to expand FQHCs. Given the magnitude of the uninsured population in the County, it is clear that resources must be invested into expanding community health centers. HOSPITAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS The County hospitals are in a posi- tion to enhance community-based activities in partnership with the public health sector. Community Benet Reports are collected from state hospitals by the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) to determine the hospital's tax-exempt status. Community benet is dened by the Maryland law as \"an activity that is intended to address community needs and priorities primarily through disease prevention and improvement of health status, including: health services provided to vulnerable or underserved populations; nancial or in-kind support of public health programs; donations of funds, property, or other resources that contribute to a community priority; health care cost containment activities; and health education screening and prevention services (HSCRC, 2011).\" Currently, the ACA requires every hospital to conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every three years to main- tain its tax-exempt status and avoid an annual penalty. The County would benet from coordinated e orts among the hospitals to conduct needs assess- ments and to develop subsequent targeted community-based programs. BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES The County Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) highlights the need for addi- tional behavioral and mental health services, which are an essential part of primary care. The County's Depart- ment of Family Services, Mental Health and Disabilities Division provides leadership for an array of high-quality public mental health services, oversees all public mental health services and monitors the mental health programs and professionals in this system. In addition, the County's Department of Health and safety net facilities xiii/p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /i.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc /s.sc/t.sc/u.sc/d.sc/y.sc provide behavioral and/ or mental health services, as do several non- governmental entities. Behavioral and mental health programs are avail- able in all hospitals and services are provided by private sector practitioners. A targeted review of the integration and capacity of the County's mental health services would be benecial. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY DENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND PROGRAMS Dental care is another essential primary care service that requires a more targeted review. The County Health Department, professional organizations and practicing dental professionals provide select programs. There has been signicant activity since the death of 12-year-old Deam- onte Driver, a County boy who died in 2007 due to complications from untreated tooth decay. However, there is still a major need for resources to provide evidence-based preventive and health promotion services and programs to the dentally uninsured and underinsured in the County. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS Public schools traditionally have contributed to the health education of children and youth and provided or contracted for basic health care services as needed for children while they are in school. Schools provide a natural link between families and teachers, communities and the public education system. Many County schools have access to a registered school nurse, and several have addi- tional providers such as psychologists, speech pathologists and occupational therapists. All schools are part of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation sponsored by the American Heart Association, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation and the Clinton Foun- dation. There are four School-based Wellness Centers managed by the County Health Department located in high schools. Opportunities to extend these and initiate other school-based health centers would provide additional support for the County's residents. NURSING HOMES AND HOME HEALTH CENTERS Nursing homes and home health centers provide institutional and home- based services for the elderly and for special needs populations. There are 20 nursing home facilities in the County, which include respite and rehabilitative services and outpatient rehabilitative services. Home health centers provide nursing services, home health aides and one or more other services such as physical therapy, occupational therapy and social services. There are opportu- nities for the County to look at federal options to support innovative programs for special need populations. PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT HEALTH PROMOTION Prince George's County Parks and Recreation o ers residents vast park- land and community centers. These centers provide a health improvement programs, such as tness centers and nutrition and cooking classes, and o er a signicant opportunity for the provi- sion of clinical services. Many of these centers are located at or near schools and could be linked with School-based Wellness Centers or community health centers. The University of Maryland Extension (UME)-Prince George's County implements programs that address obesity; food insecurity; low levels of tness; unhealthy diets for youth, families and senior citizens; sustainable agriculture; school and community gardens; and outdoor education. UME collaborates with many organizations throughout the County, including the school and library systems, municipal and County govern- ment and County Health Department, and programs such as Head Start and Judith P. Hoyer Early Child Care and Family Education Centers. HIGHER EDUCATION HEALTH-RELATED ACADEMIC RESOURCES IN THE COUNTY The County has a number of higher education academic resources that contribute to health and wellness capacity through their continuing education, research, community out- reach and student training programs. Health workforce training opportuni- ties include Bowie State University's nursing program, Prince George's Community College's Academy of Health Sciences and the University of Maryland's School of Public Health and other academic programs that train public health providers, couple and family therapists, experts in physical activity, clinical psycholo- gists and others. In addition, health professions students from University of Maryland, Baltimore rotate through sites in the County as part of their training. The health care systems we interviewed had two innovative programs that could serve as models. One involved a partnership between the academic health care system and xiv/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc \"medical home\" with case managers for the under- and uninsured, achiev- ing cost savings and improvements in quality of care. Another system formed a communitywide \"Nurse Advice Line\" in collaboration with the public health department, managed care organiza- tions and the university. This Nurse Advice Line helped the state health department identify illnesses statewide and resulted in decreased emergency department visits, increased use of medical homes and better coordination of patient Decisions about where to seek care are generally driven by individuals, but the extent to which insurance and provider referral practices influence these choices is critically important. County residents and key stakeholders alike identied key issues that would influence the use and success of a health care system for public health. They highlighted the importance of afliation with academic institutions, the role of insurance policies and practices, perceptions of health care quality, provision of health and wellness services, addressing health literacy and cultural competence, availability of primary care (both facilities and a sufcient workforce), effective design and use of technologies such as health information systems and system branding. The leaders we interviewed from the comparable models assessment also mentioned these issues. Maximizing uptake will require system improvements that include needed services and those valued by residents, changes in insurer policies and provider referral practices, careful consideration of location, and a major focus on quality of care. The potential to signicantly improve how County residents perceive the health care system would be enhanced by the ali- ation with an academic institution. As these improvements are implemented, ongoing communication with the public, health care providers and policymakers will be essential./R.sc/A.sc/T.sc/I.sc/O.sc/N.sc/A.sc/L.sc/E.sc We found the following to be key factors influencing consumer choice and the potential success of a new health care system. AFFILIATION WITH AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER Stakeholder interviews focused on a new system that would be aliated with an academic institution, including a medical school and teaching hospital. A teaching hospital would increase the status of the health care services, improve quality of care provided by physicians and compete with the university-based health care available in Washington, D.C. Leaders from model health care organizations also identied the university aliation as one strategy for enhancing perceived and actual quality. INSURANCE AND PROVIDER REFERRAL PRACTICES Physician referral practices and health insurance options and policies are other critical issues that impact xv/p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /i.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc /s.sc/t.sc/u.sc/d.sc/y.sc residents' choice of hospital. In the household survey, 85 percent indicated they were very likely to use a new hos- pital if their insurance company allowed its use. With regard to their most recent hospitalization, 31 percent of residents reported that their providers referred them to a hospital outside the County, and 13 percent reported that their insurer required use of a hospital outside the County. In the stakeholder interviews, this issue arose as well, including reference to Prince George's County employees whose health insur- ance carrier requires them to leave the County for hospitalization. REPUTATION AND QUALITY OF CARE Reputation and perceived excellence of a health care system are two key factors that contribute to maximizing the uptake of the system's services. Key stakeholder interview data showed that it is the reputation of the current health care in the County, and not always the actual care, that turns residents away or encourages physicians to make out-of-County referrals. In the random household survey, the reputation and perceived quality of hospitals were factors associated with the choice to leave the County for hospitaliza-tion. Additionally, when asked their choice of hospital, residents selected those outside the County. This again reflects general stakeholder opinion, which is that there is a perception problem that has impacted use. When residents were asked what would make them more likely to use a new hospital in the County, they identi- ed high-quality care, the availability of specialist care and referrals from their family and peer network, with 90 percent of residents considering quality of care the most important factor. Stakeholders emphasized the concept of building a \"world-class facility,\" along with centers of excel- lence that specialize in certain chronic diseases, as very important. Survey results demonstrated that residents do and will seek care at a hospital, often despite location, if it is associated with excellent care. The new system would be successful in a competitive market if it could build excellence in areas critically important to the County and provide distinctive programs. Attention to quality of care can draw residents back to the County for health care and influence physicians to keep referrals in the County for specialized services. While several stakeholders believed that the poor reputation is in perception only, all acknowledged that perception is reality when it comes to health care decisions. PERCEPTIONS OF AREA HOSPITALS Despite perception challenges, over 40 percent of residents believe that quality of service at the hospital closest to them was excellent or very good and 24 percent rated the care as good. We asked residents about which hospitals they would chose for di erent conditions and found perceptions varied. Interestingly, while Doctors Community Hospital was ranked highest among area hospitals for overall best quality (16 percent), it was not the rst choice for general hospitalization. Conversely, Wash- ington Hospital Center was the rst choice for general hospitalization with 15 percent and 11 percent of residents identifying it for overall best quality. For the two hospitals associated with Dimensions Healthcare System, opinions varied signicantly. More than 47 percent had favorable opinions about Prince George's Hospital Center, while 40 percent of residents reported unfavorable opinions. With Laurel Regional Hospital, however, the issue was less that it was viewed unfavorably than it was not well known. Fifty per- cent viewed it favorably, but 13 percent had never heard of it and more than 20 percent had no opinion. In each case, more than 30 percent of residents indicated that increasing the quality of sta and physicians would improve their perceptions of each hospital. INTEGRATION OF WELLNESS AND DISEASE PREVENTION EFFORTS The integration of health promotion and disease prevention services into the new system could enhance the like- lihood of making an impact on health status at the County level and attract residents. The survey showed strong interest in several of these services (see Figure 2). Stakeholder interviews support these ndings. Given the focus on prevention in the ACA, along with the County's Health Improvement Plan, these services could prove integral to the public health impact of the new health care system. CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND HEALTH LITERACY In a County as diverse as Prince George's, the new system has the unique potential to become known as a culturally competent health care system that addresses the health literacy needs of the communities it serves. More than a quarter of the residents surveyed needed some level of help reading medical materials, and 23 percent had some problems learning about their medical conditions due to diculty understanding written information. Similarly, only 48 percent of residents whose primary language xvi/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc was not English reported having access to a provider who spoke their language, and only 21 percent reported having an interpreter. One mark of distinction for the new health care system could be a large and mobile translator/inter- preter program, and health education materials that are culturally sensitive and language appropriate. Stakeholders and other interviewees also suggested developing patient navigator and com- munity outreach worker programs. RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS Recruitment and retention of qualied primary care and specialty physicians are needed to ll the current gaps in quantity, type and prestige of physician working in the County. The new health care system can begin to ll these gaps by considering part-time appoint- ments for well-known providers from surrounding jurisdictions. Providing incentives to medical school and other health professions graduates through existing federal loan repayment plans, coupled with potential economic incen- tives, such as low-interest mortgages, could assist in attracting providers to practice in the County. Enhancing the quality of other sta in the system can also impact perceptions of care. LOCATION AND ACCESSIBILITY OF CARE Location of care is a factor that con- tributes to use of services. When asked to identify their top three priorities for deciding where to seek care, more than 51 percent of residents surveyed indicated that a priority was whether the facility or doctor was close to home. The usage of the new system will be similarly a ected by accessibil- ity of care: hours of operation, ease of getting appointments and availability of specialist care. In the survey, we asked about dif- ferent health care services and how vital they are for residents. More than 77 percent reported that urgent care services were a vital need for Prince George's County. This type of service reflects care that is readily and rou- tinely available at the time of need. CAPACITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY The capacity and appropriate use of health information technology supports the success of a system for public health. The County's physicians and facilities are moving to adopt such technology, which ultimately would integrate care across systems, deliver decision support systems for provid- ers to implement evidence-based protocols and contribute to population health. In our interviews with model systems, some said they use auto- mated reminders that prompt providers about care needs and milestones, contributing to better health outcomes. BRAND MARKETING Eective marketing and positive branding of a health care system also contribute to increased uptake. Individuals need to be informed of the availability and unique types of services in a targeted way that is sensitive to cultural and language dierences. From interviews with individuals in other model systems, it is clear that a communication cam- paign must \"sell\" excellent services and quality and the image that the system serves more than uninsured or the poor. Involvement of residents in deciding a campaign strategy and messages would enhance its credibility and e ectiveness. This is an ongoing process, similar to the communication FIGURE 2COUNTY RESIDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF SERVICES FOR A NEW HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN PLANNING A NEW HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTY, DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE ABOUT WHAT SERVICES ARE VITAL TO THE COMMUNITY.

Addi- tionally, the careful use of community benet funds can enhance health and also raise visibility of the system while providing necessary services, such as health fairs and health promotion pro- grams. Marketing and communication to providers are also critical, particu- larly as they will need to understand and appreciate the breadth and quality of the new system in order to refer their patients to the County can make signicant strides in improving the health of residents with a new health care system committed to population health and prevention that includes a high-quality regional hospital center afliated with a university, a strong primary care network and integrated public health services. The establishment of such a transformative system would enhance the health of a County with major health needs and create a model for the nation. In addition, we forecast achiev- able 2020 health outcome targets for the County of a system with these elements. We estimate the resulting improvements in asthma, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and cancer through e ective prevention and management would be reflected in reductions in ED visits and deaths in 2020 and for each subsequent year. We forecast for 2020 a 16 percent reduction in cumulative emergency department visits for asthma, diabetes and hypertension and 340 lives saved that would have been lost due to heart disease or cancer. /R.sc/A.sc/T.sc/I.sc/O.sc/N.sc/A.sc/L.sc/E.sc Lessons learned by model health systems, input from key stakeholders and residents, and ndings from the scientic literature reveal system ele- ments and practices that contribute to health improvements and health care eciencies. A university-aliated regional teaching hospital center involved in interprofessional education, care and research would provide an anchor for a revitalized high-quality health care system in Prince George's County. As the anchor, the hospital center would: \u0099\u0015apply the latest technologies and knowledge to improve health and restore function, \u0099\u0015use interprofessional, team-based approaches to provide sustainable gains in health, and \u0099\u0015partner with primary care for eective care management of chronic diseases. These attributes would: \u0099\u0015attract and retain high-quality health care providers, \u0099\u0015earn the trust of residents who now seek care outside the County, and \u0099\u0015earn the trust of providers and insurance companies that now refer residents elsewhere.Strong primary care networks are associated with higher quality of care, lower health care spending and reduced health disparities. The creation of a strong primary care network in the County would require: \u0099\u0015increasing the number of primary care practitioners to address the identied shortages, \u0099\u0015increasing the number of ambulatory care centers in targeted areas of the County, \u0099\u0015empowering primary care through the adoption of the \"medical home\" model and access on nights and weekends, \u0099\u0015integrating primary care with dental health and behavioral/mental health, \u0099\u0015assuring connectivity through health information technology, \u0099\u0015measuring the quality of care through regular reporting, and \u0099\u0015collaborating closely with the public health system. xviii/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc The interface of the primary care net- work and the hospital with the public health sector contributes to improved health outcomes and population health. Key aspects of an integrated public health system include: \u0099\u0015primary disease prevention\u2014such as health promotion activities like health education, support for healthy lifestyles and the incorporation of health literacy principles, \u0099\u0015appropriate integration among public health sector community-based programs, and \u0099\u0015integration and coordination of services that cross sectors, such as health and social services playing a key role in a ecting health outcomes. T o estimate how much the new system as described would a ect key health outcomes, we used our study ndings and reviewed the relevant literature, ongoing and planned County and state activities and the County's baseline data. We realize that several of the key elements of the new system will not be in place until 2014 or thereafter. T able 6 presents the County target that should be achievable by 2020 with a new system in place for each of the key health outcomes, hold- ing population constant. Even with this conservative approach, we estimate these improvements would result in a collective reduction of emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, diabetes and hypertension by about 16 percent each year. With a strong primary care network and the use of evidence-based interven-tions, even greater benets should be achievable. A review of studies of care management approaches for chronic conditions revealed a range of interventions that decrease health care utilization and increase cost savings. For example, some studies have shown a signicant reduction in asthma-related ED visits with in-person care management. Both in-person and telephone-based care manage- ment studies found similar results for patients with diabetes, including a telephone care management study that found more than 30 percent reductions in ED visits and inpatient admissions (AHRQ, 2012). For heart disease and cancer deaths, we estimate that a 10 percent reduc- tion is achievable by 2020. This would equate to more than 340 lives saved each year, with potential for an even greater number of lives saved in each subsequent year. The collective and coordinated e orts of the primary care network and public health sector in reducing risk factors for all ve of these health outcomes, and attention to the relevant social determinants of health, could add to the rates of improvement. The ACA has specied innova- tions and initiatives that are already contributing to each of the elements of the new health care system. Mary- land is taking actions that will further support improvements in the County, such as the formation of the Maryland Health Benet Exchange that will extend insurance coverage and the creation of Health Enterprise Zone to reduce disparities, improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs by reducing hospital admis- sions and re-admissions. Coordinated eorts will extend the impact of the ACA and benet the County.TABLE 6ESTIMATED 2020 ACHIEVABLE COUNTY TARGETS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR KEY HEALTH CONDITIONS Health Condition and Measure (per 100,000 population)County Baseline TotalCounty Target Total Achievable by 2020 (estimated percent decrease from baseline)Implications (as ED visits averted or lives saved annually) Asthma\u2014Rate of ED visits for asthma* 717.0 573.6 (20%) 1,233 diabetes* 308.4 277.6 (10%) 265 ED visits visits for hypertension* 257.7 231.9 (10%) 222 ED visits disease deathsn 224.2 201.8 (10%) Cancer\u2014Rate 173.8 156.4 (10%) 150 lives saved *The data for ED visits are limited to Maryland hospitals.

With its vision of transforming the County's health care system, this initiative can catalyze partnerships and health care innovation, and most importantly, improve the health status of residents and the region. The study provides a detailed and expanded assessment of the public health capacity and potential impact on health outcomes of a new health care delivery system in the County. We designed our study to address gaps in data identied by previous assess- ments of the County's health care workforce, hospital use patterns and health status and to learn from County residents, other key stakeholders and comparable health care delivery models. As part of the study process, we developed a number of new prod- ucts that provide the basis for future and ongoing work: instruments used for the resident survey, stakeholder interviews and health system assess- ment; a novel approach to assessing population variables and presenting those data by geographic maps, and an econometric model that can be applied and modied for further plan- ning purposes. The answers to the ve framing questions provide insights from the range of study components and serve as the major ndings of this study.

To achieve this transformational change, it will be necessary to: ESTABLISH A HIGH-QUALITY, ACADEMICALLY AFFILIATED REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER WITH A STRONG AND COL - LABORATIVE PREVENTION- FOCUSED AMBULATORY CARE NETWORK. The medical center and network will serve as the anchor to the transforma- tion of the health care system. It will need to establish strong relationships with the community and demonstrate its commitment to population health. The planning phase should include meetings with insurance providers and with physician groups to understand and address patient referral patterns.DEVELOP A COUNTY-LED PROCESS TO IMPROVE PUB - LIC HEALTH, EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY PRIMARY CARE AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. DELINEATE LEAD ROLES AND CREATE AN INCLUSIVE CENTRAL PLANNING PROCESS Achieving large-scale transformational change requires the clear contributions and coordination among many sectors. The County is in the unique position to lead the innovation and transformation of the public health and primary care network. Engaging residents in the planning and monitoring of the new system will ensure the services meet needs and support appropriate use. A \"master health planning process\" should be implemented to facilitate and guide partnerships and new health care enti- ties that have an interest in serving the County, along with coordinating their eorts with the overall County Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). This process can address social determinants of health, reflect the concept of \"health in all policies\" and target priority areas identied by the County. Also as part of the \"master health planning process,\" County hospitals, the Health Depart- ment and academic institutions should collaborate to fulll mandates such as the hospital community benet e orts. COORDINATE EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE ACA IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY BY EMPHASIZING IMPROVED ACCESS, HEALTH EQUITY, HEALTH LITERACY, PREVEN- TION, POPULATION HEALTH AND DELIVERY INNOVATION. This emphasis is neces- sary to take advantage of health care reform. Residents will need tailored and frequent support to benet from reform initiatives and new health care system components. A prevention program that produces clear, understand- able, culturally sensitive, actionable education materials will improve health literacy and strengthen the capacity of all residents to enhance their health. This program will need to use appro- priate channels to reach the diverse segments of the County, and o er ways to help residents understand and act upon prevention messages. ADDRESS AREAS OF HIGH PRIMARY CARE NEED WITHIN THE COUNTY WITH A PARTICU- LAR FOCUS ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH FACILITIES AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS. Multiple approaches are needed to meet the primary care needs in select areas of the County. Strategies to recruit and retain primary care providers will xxi/p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /i.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc /s.sc/t.sc/u.sc/d.sc/y.sc require securing necessary government funding and use of loan repayment and other mechanisms. Innovative workforce development programs are needed to extend prevention and care throughout the population and integrate all needed disciplines into the primary care network. These programs could include strategies to train and grow the workforce capacity of County residents, as well as address the County's health needs. These programs will include the traditional health professions programs with innovative education strategies that support team learning and care. They also should include the development of innovative health care extenders, such as community health workers and navigators. Strategies for establish- ing new primary care centers would benet from exploring additional federal designation of medically underserved areas/populations and health workforce shortage areas. SUPPORT INNOVATION IN HEALTH CARE, PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH DELIVERY. The time is right to seize opportunities to enhance programs such as the School-based Well- ness Centers, incorporate promising practices such as the patient-centered medical home and accountable care organizations, and integrate behavioral/ mental and dental health into the new system. A new health care system could create a novel and model net- work, one that integrates primary care, public health and the active partner- ships necessary for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention to improve health outcomes and curb disease pro- gression. A critical review of existing public health functions and programs is needed in order to prepare to achieve the goal of an accredited health department. Given the emphasis on primary care and on reducing prevent- able hospitalizations and emergency department use, a detailed review also is needed of each of the identied priority health outcomes to implement appropriate health promotion, disease prevention and health care workforce initiatives. Support is needed for health information technology to facilitate and reinforce these linkages among public health, other public sector programs and clinical health care (outpatient and hospital) and provide real-time surveil- lance and evaluation. Lessons learned from comparable models provide a wide range of options from which to choose and adapt as needed.DEVELOP A CLEAR BRAND THAT PROMOTES A HIGH- QUALITY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ENCOURAGES RESIDENTS TO RETURN TO THE COUNTY FOR CARE AND CONTRIBUTES TO A SUCCESSFUL AND THRIVING SYSTEM. Thinking about the branding and marketing at this early stage will contribute to the system design. The County is rich in history and has a long legacy of commitment to community. A strategic marketing campaign's goals for the new health care system would include: creating a positive brand for the County's system, increasing the perceived stature of the quality of care that will be available, focusing on centers of excellence and unique facets of the system and increasing utiliza- tion of the County is primed for change with its new leadership and a renewed commitment to improving the health and quality of life of its citizens. Partnering with the state of Maryland, the University of Maryland Medical System, Dimensions Healthcare System and the public health system, the County has an exciting opportunity to re-imagine a health care system that enhances individual patient care, improves population health and reduces per capita costs of care. By integrating public health, primary care and a world-class regional medical center to serve the County and Southern Maryland, this new system would be known for its key characteristics: \u0099\u0015Guided by a master health plan that integrates the public and private sectors, along with philanthropy, in a broader vision to improve the social determinants of health and actual health care in the County, \u0099\u0015Committed to improving both health care and the health status of the County, \u0099\u0015Aliated with the University of Maryland and positioned to o er innovative inter-professional care, \u0099\u0015Comprised of a robust network of strategically placed primary care providers, \u0099\u0015Distinguished by a state-of-the- art medical center with centers of excellence that draw insured patients from the region, \u0099\u0015Focused on the integration of health promotion and disease prevention services and programs that address common risk factors, such as obesity, physical inactivity and tobacco use, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality\u0099\u0015Characterized by health literacy principles infused into health care, health facilities and health education for the public and providers and by culturally, competent health professionals \u0099\u0015Built on a sophisticated electronic and personal health care records system and other health information technology that facilitates coordinated care and enhances population health.xxiii/p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /i.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc /s.sc/t.sc/u.sc/d.sc/y.sc T o be successful, this new health care system, including its regional medical center, must grapple with the complex racial, ethnic, income and educational diversity of Prince George's County. There are signicant pockets of lower-income populations inside the Beltway, many without health insurance, while there are also higher income and education com- munities that are well-insured. As we move outside the Beltway, income and educational levels generally rise along with the proportion of individuals with insurance coverage. Y et, in 2014, as the health benet exchange component of the ACA is realized, the County will have signicantly more of its popu- lation insured, providing additional opportunities for residents to benet from comprehensive preventive and primary care services. While increased insurance cover- age will benet the new system and contribute to better health outcomes, the new system must grapple with the demands of partnering with others to assure that safety net facilities, such as FQHCs, are in place. This must be done early on while the new system also positions itself to meet market demands for high-quality care that will prove compelling to insured County residents and insurers themselves. The larger integrated system, working in partnership with other County agencies, can facilitate progress toward the real- ization of health equity in the County. Building this innovative health system can stimulate complex changes in the County and state. Improving the health of the County is essential to improving the health rankings for the state. As the health of the County's population improves, so does its attractiveness as location with a vital workforce, which will potentially stimulate new economic investments. Therefore, the health system itself can reap the benets of new economic investment in the County by the private and public sectors and drive its new George's County Health Survey Methodology Report.

AMBULATORY CARE Health-care services oered on an outpatient basis AMBULATORY CARE SENSITIVE CONDITIONS Conditions that are preventable and treatable in a primary care setting and, when addressed, should prevent/ avoid hospitalization BASELINE DATA Data collected to establish and understand the existing conditions before any kind of intervention or experi- mental manipulation begins BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) A mea- sure calculated from a person's height and weight used to screen for body fatness. This measure is used to identify weight conditions that may lead to health problems. DEAMONTE DRIVER A boy from Prince George's County Maryland who died at age 12 from a brain infection caused by bacteria from tooth decay in February 2007. His infection, which could have been prevented, and his tragic death have galvanized a national critical review of the capacity to provide oral health care and have stimulated legisla- tive and programmatic actions. EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOLS (OR EVIDENCE- BASED HEALTH CARE) The conscientious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients or the delivery of health services to a population. Current best evidence is up-to-date information from relevant, valid research about the eects of di erent forms of health care and health promotion e orts. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) A health organization that oers primary care and preventive health services to all patients regard- less of their ability to pay for care. A FQHC is a public or private nonprot organization that has been reviewed by the federal government and meets specic criteria to receive government funding. It must serve a medically underserved area or population. HEALTH DISPARITIES Dierences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care that are closely linked with social, economic and/ or environmental disadvantage based on race and ethnicity; religion; socio-economic status; gender; age; mental health; disability; sexual orientation, or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. HEALTH EQUITY The state of achieving the highest level of health for all people. This requires valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing societal eorts to address avoidable inequali- ties, historical and contemporary injustices, and eliminate health and health-care disparities. HEALTH LITERACY The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Health literacy is enhanced when providers give patients accurate, actionable health information in plain language and health facilities include design and system changes that improve health information, communi- cation, informed decision-making and access to health services. HEALTH OUTCOME A measure of a health condition such as disease status or death. HEALTH PROMOTION The process of enabling people to increase control over and to improve their health. Health promotion not only strengthens the skills and capabilities of individuals, but also involves changing social, environ- mental and economic conditions that impede public and individual health. HOSPITAL EVENTS Several terms are used in this report to dene hospital events: A hospital discharge is the process by which a patient is released from the hospital at the time inpatient care is no longer needed. Dis-charges or hospital admissions can be dened by the specic condi- tions that stimulate them. If these conditions are related to ambula- tory care-sensitive conditions (see above), then these can reflect ade- quacy of the primary care network. Hospital readmissions are used to describe hospitalizations that result seven to 30 days after a patient xxvi/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc has been released from a hospital. Hospital readmissions reflect on the quality of the hospital discharge process and on the capacity of the primary care network. PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOME A team-based health care delivery model led by a physician that inte- grates patients as active participants and provides comprehensive and con- tinuous preventive, acute and chronic care to patients with the goal of obtain- ing the best health outcomes. PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The health care reform law passed by the U.S. Congress in 2010 POPULATION HEALTH The health outcomes of a group of individu- als, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group. The goal of population health is to reduce inequities and improve the health of the entire population.PRIMARY CARE General health care services provided by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs. These clinicians often are the rst point of contact for patients, will develop sustained partnership with patients, and practice in the context of family and community. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS A category of physicians that includes specialists in the general practice of family medi- cine, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology. PRIMARY PREVENTION Eorts to keep diseases from occurring among suscep- tible people by reducing exposures or eliminating risk factors. These generally include health promotion and health education activities provided through public health, primary care and com-munity programs. PROVIDER-TO-POPULATION RATIO A measure used to determine the capacity of the number of providers available in a geographic region to serve the population size. PUBLIC HEALTH The art and science of protecting and improving the health of communities. PUBLIC USE MICRODATA AREA (PUMA) Areas dened by Census records in which each contains approximately 100,000 people. PUMAs are redened every ten years in conjunction with the decennial census. RANDOM (OR RANDOMIZED) SURVEY A survey of a sample population in which every person in the population has an equal chance of being selected. SECONDARY PREVENTION Eorts focused on detecting disease early and stopping its progression. These include screen-ing, periodic health examinations and reduction of risk factors through pri-mary care and public health sectors. TERTIARY PREVENTION Eorts focused on reducing further complications, disability and death once disease has been identied. These include rehabilitation, chronic disease treat-ment, specialty care and acute care and Chair, Herschel S.

Both the state and County Health Improvement Plans include ensuring residents receive the health care they need and the prevention and control of chronic diseases among their top goals (State Health Improvement Plan, Maryland Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.; Prince George's County, 2012). Specically, the Prince George's County Health Improvement Plan, 2011-2014, outlines a comprehensive agenda that seeks to reduce barriers to health care, reduce risk factors for leading causes of death in the County, reduce morbidity and mortality, and enhance access to care (Prince George's County, 2012). Understanding what those health care needs are, what the current health care practices and beliefs include and which chronic diseases are perceived to most affect residents is critical to achieve these goals. Information about County residents' experiences and perceptions of the health care system within Prince George's County is lacking, yet is criti-cal to the County's plans to design a transformative new health care system. T o address this gap, the Public Health Impact Assessment is informed by a random household survey, representa-tive of the population in Prince George's County, in order to garner community insights into health care utilization, pressing health issues and related topics. This is the rst survey for the County and the state that delves into these topics. The results can help shape the development of a new ambulatory care health system that will attract an economically viable patient base and impact key health issues faced by the County's diverse population. OVERVIEW A representative sample of 1,001 residents of Prince George's County completed the survey. The study consisted of a landline com-ponent (n=701) and a cell phone component (n=300). The survey instrument was developed by the School of Public Health (SPH) team. All sampling, data collec-tion and subsequent weighting of data was completed by Social Sci-ence Research Solutions (SSRS). /M.sc/e.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/d.sc/s.sc INSTRUMENT The survey instrument was developed by the SPH team with input from various stakeholders. Additionally, its development was informed by a review of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-lance Survey (CDC, 2011) and the Kaiser Family Foundation DC Health Care Access Survey (2003). Please nd a copy of the instrument at the end of the technical report.3/h.sc/o.sc/u.sc/s.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc /s.sc/u.sc/r.sc/v.sc/e.sc/y.sc PRETESTING The survey was pretested prior to elding to ensure that proper wording, question sequencing and informational objectives were being met. SPH team members participated in the monitoring of pretests. Information gained through the pre-test was used in the nal rene-ment of the survey instrument. SAMPLE T o address concerns about coverage, the study employed a dual-frame land-line/ cell phone random digit dial (RDD) telephone design. The landline sample was disproportionately stratied to provide sucient numbers of high- and low-income respondents and allow independent analysis of these groups. T able 1 shows the distribution of County households at each income level and the percent and number of interviews allocated to each stratum as targets for the landline sample plan. T able 2 shows the actual number and allocation of interviews after data collection. All samples were generated by SSRS's sister company, Market-ing Systems Group (MSG). The RDD landline sample was drawn from telephone exchanges within Prince George's County. Following generation, the landline sample was prepared using MSG's proprietary procedures that not only limit sample to non-zero banks, but also identify and eliminate approximately 90 percent of all non-working and business numbers and ported cell phones. For the RDD cell phone sample, numbers were initially drawn from the three switch-points (central routing mechanisms that send cell phone calls to di erent parts of the country) located in the County. Additional analyses were con-ducted through the T elcordia database that identied telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000 connected with switch-points outside of the County that are in fact routed to households within the County. These blocks were also included in the sample le. Furthermore, specic 100 blocks of cell phone numbers that were found to route specically to the County were oversampled, since the incidence of nding households that are actually located in the County from the initial sample selected was quite low. DATA COLLECTION The eld period for this study was Jan. 30 through March 4, 2012. All interviews were done through the Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system. The CATI system ensured that questions followed logical skip patterns and that complete dispositions of all call attempts were recorded. The SPH secured access to a University of Maryland telephone num-ber for SSRS in order to increase the likelihood that residents would respond to the call. Both landline and cell phone respondents were screened for being residents of Prince George's County. Respondents who either did not live in Prince George's County or who did not know or refused to give their County of residence and ZIP code were eliminated from the process. In order to maximize survey response, SSRS enacted the following pro-cedures during the eld period: \u0099\u0015An average of ve follow-up attempts were made to contact non-responsive numbers (no answer, busy, answering machine).TABLE 2 FINAL DISTRIBUTION OF LANDLINE COMPLETES BY STRATUM StrataActual Percent of Total LL InterviewsActual Number of Interviews Low Income (<35K) 35% 248 Medium Income (35K-100K) 19% 1LANDLINE BY INCOME of InterviewsTotal Interviews multiple times, varying the times of day, and the days of the week that call-backs were placed using a programmed dierential call rule. \u0099\u0015Sample rested for one to two weeks between the rst four call attempts and the last two attempts. \u0099\u0015Sample rested for one to two weeks between an initial refusal and a refusal conversion attempt. \u0099\u0015Interviewing sta was limited to the top tier of interviewers, resulting in a slower but more productive eld period. \u0099\u0015Respondents were o ered the option to set a schedule for a call back. \u0099\u0015Every refusal received one refusal conversion attempt from an experienced interviewer. WEIGHTING The nal data were weighted to correct for variance in the likelihood of selec-tion for a given case and to balance the sample to known population parameters in order to correct for systematic under- or over-represen-tation of meaningful social categories. Survey data were weighted to census population gures using the American Community Survey (ACS) totals. The ACS provides data for areas down to the PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area) level. Although PUMAs do not overlap perfectly with the boundaries of Prince George's County, we included data in weighting targets from any PUMAs that had any signicant portion within the borders of the County. Phone use (cell phone only, dual users and landline only) was mod-eled by averaging two techniques for assessing cell phone use at the County level. First, we utilized the same procedure used by the National Health Interview Survey to estimate phone use at the state level. Specically, a logistic regression was run within National Health Interview Survey data, predicting these three phone-use types separately. Then, Claritas and ACS estimates of the district were utilized to solve the regression equation for Prince George's County specically. As well, Marketing Systems Group is beta testing their own model of phone use, and they provided us with the percent cell phone only for the County based on their model. Overall, we found that 30.2 percent of Prince George's County households are cell phone only, compared to only 12 percent that are landline-only. The weighting procedure involved the following steps: 1. PHONE-STATUS CORRECTION (WPS) Respondents whose household members answer both landlines and cell phones have a higher likelihood of inclusion in the sample. T o correct for this, cases from dual-frame TABLE 3COMPARISON OF BENCHMARK DATA, UNWEIGHTED SAMPLE AND WEIGHTED SAMPLE Parameter Value Label Benchmark* Unweighted* Weighted* Education Not Cell Phone Only69.7% 89.3% 70.8% * Percentages may not add to 100 percent to account for cases where respondents refused to provide this demographic information.5/h.sc/o.sc/u.sc/s.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc /s.sc/u.sc/r.sc/v.sc/e.sc/y.sc households were assigned a weight equal to half the weight assigned to single-mode households. 2. WITHIN HOUSEHOLD SELECTION CORRECTION (WHC) T o correct for the fact that only one qualifying adult was selected in any given household, landline cases from households with a single qualifying adult received a weight of one, and those with two or more received a weight of two. Respondents with missing data were assigned the mean weight. Cell phone respondents received a weight of one, as there was no within-household selection on the cell phones. 3. STRATIFICATION CORRECTION (WST) The sample was weighted to correct for the disproportionality in the stratication plan. The correction adjusts for the fact that households in the high- and low-income strata were sampled at rates higher than their proportion of the population, and households in the middle-income stratum were sampled at a rate lower than their percent of the population. T o adjust for this, data are weighted back to their actual population proportions.The product of these three stages was the base weight for the sample: BW = W PS \u00d7 WHC \u00d7 WST 4. POST-STRATIFICATION WEIGHTING: The base weight was used as a balancing weight in the iterative proportionate tting (IPF) process, or \"raking.\" Universe counts were attained\u2014through the procedure described earlier\u2014for age, educational attainment, gender, phone use and race. We also included a target for popula- tion density in the post-stratication weighting. We used self-reported ZIP code to determine the population density (total population divided by total land area in square miles) for the ZIP codes in which the respondent lives and then the ZIP codes are ranked to recode the density variable into quintiles,where 1 equals lowest density and 5 equals highest density. Follow-ing the raking stage, the weights were truncated (\"trimmed\") to control the variance created by the weight and avoid having a small number of cases that a ect the data too strongly. The nal weights were trimmed to range from 0.25 to just over 4.0. Weighting procedures increase the variance in the data, with larger weights causing greater variance. Complex survey designs and post-data collection statistical adjustments a ect variance estimates and, as a result, tests of sig-nicance and condence intervals. The nal design e ect for the survey was 2.0, and the margin of sampling error was 3.1 (4.4 with design e ect). RESPONSE RATE The landline response rate was 32.2 percent and the cell phone response rate was 23.3 percent, for an overall response rate of 29 TABLE 4SAMPLE DISPOSITIONS LL Cell Total Eligible, Interview (Category 1) Complete 701 300 1,001 Eligible, non-interview (Category 2) Refusal (Eligible) 1,067 614 1,681 Physically or mentally unable 11 5 16 Language problem 50 119 169 Unknown eligibility, non-interview (Category 3) Always busy 358 34 392 No answer 367 126 493 Answering machine 2,078 1,223 3,301 Call blocking 1 7 8 T echnical phone problems 23 16 39 No screener completed 3 0 3 Not eligible (Category 4)Fax/data line 612 71 683 Non-working number ce, 414 1,296 No eligible respondent 95 Public Opinion Research's RR3 formula (AAPOR, 2011).

DATA ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics and two-way chi- square tests were performed in STATA 11.2 adjusting for complex survey sampling. A weighted proportion is reported for each category in descrip-tive statistics, while a weighted row or column proportion is reported in a two-way chi-square test. The signicances of the two-way chi-square tests were performed using Wald F-test. Alpha was set at .05. We examined selected questions by income, race, education, gender, age and insurance status. We also examined selected ques- tions by region. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are seven non-overlapping PUMAs within Prince George's County. Red indicates statisti-cally signicant di erences. Figure 1 provides the PUMAs in the County. SELECTED COMPARISONS WITH THE 2011 PRINCE GEORGE'S PRELIMINARY FINDINGS Prince George's County had supported an enhanced sample of the Behav-ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for calendar year 2011, and preliminary results are made available in March 2012 (Abt SRBI, 2012). In some instances, results from our survey are compared to data from this 2011 Prince George's County Health Survey (hereafter referred to as PGCBRFSS). The PGBRFSS random digit dial survey was conducted by Abt SRBI in late 2011-January 2012. In total, the sample included 1,624 interviews with 1,245 from the broader County and 379 from an oversample from the Port T owns. Utilizing the survey instituted by CDC in 1984, the BRFSS collects annual information on health risk behaviors, preventive health prac-tices, and access to health care from adults in the U.S. and in U.S. territories (CDC, 2012). The PGCBRFSS was a completely separate e ort from our survey, which was conducted as part of the Public Health Impact Assess-ment of Prince George's County. /F.sc/i.sc/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc/s.sc DESCRIPTION OF THE SAMPLE All results presented in the narra- tive, tables and charts represent the weighted data and as such can be generalized to the population of Prince George's County. The majority of sample respondents were African American and residents of the County for at least 10 years. Of the 615 respondents who identied as Black or African American, 10 percent reported either they or their parents were born in the Caribbean and 9 percent reported Africa. T wenty-three percent (n=169) were born outside the U.S. Of those, 31 percent had lived in the U.S. one to 10 years, 31 percent from 11 to 20 years, 24 percent from 21 to 30 years and the remainder more than 31 years. T wenty percent speak a language other than English at home. Thirteen percent had served in the military. Most are homeowners, have household incomes over $50,000 and 49 percent reported being employed full time. T able 5 presents a delineation of sample demographics. Approxi-mately 9.5 percent of respondents reported less than a high school educa-tion, making the sample a relatively educated group of respondents with 29 percent stating they were college-edu-cated with bachelor's (15.1 percent) and post-graduate (14.5 percent) degrees. Although 84 percent reported that they had health insurance, 15 percent (n=93) reported they were not insured. The primary reasons given for not being insured were in order: 43 percent could not a ord insurance, 19 percent indi- cated some other reason, 18 percent were unemployed, 7 percent reported that either their employer or their spouse's employer o ers insurance, but they could not a ord it, and 6 percent tried to apply for Medicaid/Healthy Families, but were not able to secure insurance. For the insured, the primary companies were CareFirst/Blue Cross/Blue Shield (33 percent), Medicare (15 percent), Aetna (12 percent), Kaiser (12 percent) and United Healthcare (10 percent). All others were less than 10 percent. Our nding of 84 percent insured is slightly higher than the 82.2 percent reported in the County's Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), but remains below its goal of 91.1 percent coverage by 2020.7/h.sc/o.sc/u.sc/s.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc /s.sc/u.sc/r.sc/v.sc/e.sc/y.sc FIGURE 1PUBLIC USE tion of ndings are organized by ve framing questions posed by Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene Joshua Scharfstein in planning discussions. These questions are as follows: 1. What are the key health outcomes in the County most amenable to improvement by a new health care system?2. What elements of a health care system (hospital and community) can a ect these outcomes and by how much (model)? 3. What is the geographic distribution of health care resources and where are the areas of greatest need for primary care? 4. What are the key issues to maximize uptake and achieve the potential of the health care system for public health?5. What resources can be mobilized in the public health sector to complement the impact of the health care system? The random household survey data will be used to address four of the ve questions. These are I, II, III and IV. Results are presented for the entire sample and by PUMA for selected items.

In this section, we include results on County residents' perception of health issues, current health status and key risk factors that are amenable to improvement. Respondents were asked, \"What do you see as the one most urgent health condition or disease facing residents living in Prince George's County?\" (see T able 6). Cancer is perceived as the most urgent health issue facing the County (17.2 percent) followed by T ype 2 Diabetes (15.7 percent). However, it is noteworthy that 14.7 percent of County residents stated that they \"do not know\" the one most urgent health issue facing residents. Perceptions of the most critical health issues in the County di ered by PUMA. Residents in PUMAs 3, 5 and 6 felt diabetes is the most urgent health issue, while 27.6 percent of PUMA 7 and 24.7 percent of PUMA 2 felt cancer is the most urgent issue (T able 7). Given the focus of the larger assess- ment on the health care system, we asked about the magnitude of health care access barriers as perceived by County residents. More than 77 percent saw the cost of care and the cost of insurance as major problems. Access and quality were considered major problems by 50 percent and 47 percent, respectively (see Figure 2). There were signicant di erences by PUMA in the perceptions about these health care access issues. In T able 8, 58 percent of residents in PUMA 3 felt access to health care was a major problem compared to only 38 percent of residents in PUMA 5. More than 69 percent of residents in PUMA 7 felt quality of health care was a major prob-lem compared to only 37 percent of TABLE 6PERCEIVED URGENT HEALTH CONDITION IN THE COUNTY (N=1001) Condition % Cancer 17.2% Diabetes 15.7% Don't 2.0% None Asthma transmitted diseases 1.4% Substance abuse 1.4% TABLE 7TOP PERCEIVED HEALTH ISSUES BY (N=1,001) at p<.05.

PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU THINK (INSERT ITEM) IS A MAJOR PROBLEM, A MINOR PROBLEM, OR NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY. HOW ABOUT (INSERT ITEM)? IS THIS A MAJOR PROBLEM, A MINOR PROBLEM OR NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY? 80% 60% 40% 20% TO HEALTH CAREQUALITY OF HEALTH CARECOST OF and 5. We included a number of items that assessed the health status of County residents. One common survey measure is self-reported health status. In response to the item, \"In general, would you say your health is Excel-lent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor?,\" 49 percent responded excellent or very good. Only 2.3 percent of County residents reported that their health was poor and 12.8 percent reported their health was fair (see T able 9). In T able 9, responses from residents in our survey are listed alongside data from the 2011 PGCBRFSS. Results from both surveys are similar.In response to the question, \"Have you ever been told by your doctor or a health care professional that you have a medical condition or chronic disease?,\" 37.1 percent of the sample reported they had received such a diagnosis. For that 37.1 percent, the next item was \"Y ou mentioned that you had been diagnosed with a medical condition or chronic disease. Please tell me which conditions you have been diagnosed with?\" T o garner the most appropriate prevalence estimate for the County, we adjusted the results from that sub-sample of 423 to the entire sample. Therefore, the top conditions of County residents, generalizable to the whole County, are: other, high blood pressure and diabetes (see T able 10). We were further interested in diagnoses of two key conditions that can contribute to signicant morbidity and mortality if they are not man-aged. These data represent additional diagnoses that are not accounted for in the 37.1 percent who reported a disease diagnosis in the previous question. When asked of the entire sample (n=1,001), \"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health care professional that you have pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes?,\" 16.7 percent reported being diagnosed with pre-diabetes. This is substantially di erent from the PGCBRFSS nding of 8.9 percent. Further analysis of both data sets would be necessary to understand this di erence in magnitude. Diabetes did emerge as an important issue in the stakeholder interviews of the Public Health Impact Study. Similarly, when asked \"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health care professional that you have pre-hypertension or borderline high blood pressure?,\" 33.2 per-cent of County residents reported pre-hypertension. While the survey only included one item on tobacco risk, we did ask, TABLE 9PERSONAL HEALTH POLL IN GENERAL, WOULD YOU SAY YOUR HEALTH IS EXCELLENT, VERY GOOD, GOOD, FAIR OR POOR?

This di ers from the PGCBRFSS, which found that 25.4 percent reported smoking cigarettes every day. Further analyses would be necessary to understand this di erence. Although our results indicate a lower prevalence, given the critical nature of tobacco use as a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases, this issue warrants further study. Body mass index is considered to be an important risk factor for many chronic diseases. In order to assess body mass index (BMI), we asked all participants two questions: About how much do you weigh without shoes? About how tall are you without shoes? We then calculated BMI, nding that 34 percent of County residents are overweight and 35 percent are obese (see Figure 3). However, only 0.5 percent of residents who indicated they had been diagnosed with a chronic condition responded that they had been diagnosed by a health care professional with obesity, and 10 percent of resi-dents reported obesity as the one most urgent health issue facing the County. Clearly, there is some signicant disconnect between BMI and diagnosis of obesity by a health care provider as well as a lack of awareness of obesity as an urgent health issue. Using two-way chi squares tests, we nd some statistically signicant dierences in BMI by PUMA (see Figure 4). Seventy-two percent of residents in PUMA 7 were overweight or obese compared to 59 percent of residents in PUMA 1. Furthermore, although not statistically signicant, PUMAs 3, 4, 6 and 7 all have greater than 70 percent in the overweight and obese categories combined. The data in Appendix B illustrate signicant di erences between Prince Georgians along a variety of demo-graphic and economic variables, which is consistent with relevant literature. For example, we compared respon-dents aged 65 and older (late life) with those age 18 to 64 (young and midlife) and found a statistically signicant dierence in being diagnosed with a chronic disease (58 vs. 35 percent), being told by a physician they had pre-diabetes (27 vs. 14 percent) and being told they had pre-hypertension (65 vs. 29 percent). We also compared the prevalence of disease and found signicant di erences in being diag- nosed with other diseases by late life compared to young and midlife: cancer, 8 percent vs. 2 percent; heart disease, 6 percent vs. 2 percent; diabetes, 13 percent vs. 3 percent; and high blood pressure, 10 percent vs. 5 percent. Asthma was an exception to this pat-tern where 4 percent of the young and midlife respondents reported being diagnosed by a physician with the disease compared to only 1 percent of the late life respondents. The data also expose other statistically signicant dierences by gender, insurance status, income and race including: \u0099\u0015Female respondents (20 percent) were more likely to be diagnosed with pre-diabetes compared to 13 percent of males. FIGURE 3BODY MASS INDEX* (R2; SELECTED RISK FACTORS) self- reported data on height and weight. Approximately, one third of both males and females were normal weight. Overall, 70 percent of males and 71 percent of females were overweight or obese. However, females (42 percent) were signicantly more likely than males (28 percent) to be obese. \u0099\u0015Whites (55 percent) were more likely to report being diagnosed with a chronic disease compared to 36 percent of African Americans. The data also revealed a signicantly higher prevalence of reported cancer among whites (5 percent) compared to African Americans (2 percent). \u0099\u0015Respondents with health insurance compared to those without were more likely to report being diagnosed with a chronic disease (40 vs. 24 percent), pre-diabetes (19 vs. 6 percent) and pre-hypertension (37 vs. 13 percent). On each of these objective measures, people with health insurance appear sicker than those without insurance. However, when we examine subjective fair/poor self-rated health among people with health insurance (13 percent) to those without (30 percent), a di erent pattern emerges. The objective vs. subjective health-status measures are complex and will be explored in a more detailed multivariate manner in subsequent analysis. \u0099\u0015We examined daily tobacco use in past 30 days and compared respondents across levels of education, income, race, gender and age. We revealed an expected pattern where smoking changes with educational attainment: bachelor's degree (3 percent), graduate school (7 percent), some college or associate degree (10 percent) and high school or below (17 percent). This was statistically signicant. Similarly, there was a statistically signicant di erence in tobacco use with lower- and mid-income respondents reporting daily use less than higher income respondents. Clearly, our ndings conrm the County Health Improvement Plan's focus on reducing chronic disease and the associated risk factors, particularly obesity. However, these results also call for careful consideration of the impact of demographic factors and social determinants of health on the health status of County residents. FRAMING QUESTION 2: WHAT ELEMENTS OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY) CAN AFFECT THESE OUTCOMES?Planning for a new health care system is a complex endeavor that requires multiple decisions. We asked respon-dents for their assessment of what services would be vital to the County. More than 77 percent reported that urgent care services were a vital need for Prince George County; this need was also identied in stakeholder interviews. Alcohol and drug abuse treatment was identied as the second vital health service need. This seems contradictory to the low percent (1.4 percent) reporting substance abuse as a major health concern for the County (see T able 6). How-ever, the CHIP estimates that 8 percent of County residents have a substance abuse problem (Prince George's County, 2012). This pro-portion is also more consistent with the identication of treatment as the second most-vital need. FIGURE 5SERVICE IMPORTANCE IN PLANNING A NEW HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTY, DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE ABOUT WHAT SERVICES ARE VITAL TO THE COMMUNITY.

The household survey included a series of questions focused on utilization of health care services including, but not limited to, where respondents received care and reasons for seeking medical care outside of Prince George's County. When asked, \"What kind of place do you usually go to when you are sick or you need advice about your health? Is it a doctor's oce, hospital emergency room, hospital outpatient depart-ment, urgent care facility, a clinic or health center, or some other place?,\" 69.7 percent reported doctor's oce, followed by clinic or health center (11.4 percent), hospital emergency room (8 percent), hospital outpatient department (3.7 percent), urgent care facility (3.6 percent) and no place (2.2 percent). There were statistically sig-nicant di erences in the usual place of care, with higher income, white/non-Hispanic, female, older and insured individuals more likely to report that they go to the doctor's oce. In the next question, respondents were asked to rate the quality of health care they receive at their usual location of care. In response, 31.9 percent rated their care as excellent, 34.3 percent as very good and 25.4 percent as good. Quality of care remains an issue for some with 7.4 percent rating the quality of their care as fair and 0.9 percent reporting the quality as poor. We then asked their assessment of care in a more specic question (see T able 11). More than 50 percent of respondents rated their doc-tor's oce or the hospital outpatient department as excellent or very good. For the other locations, the greatest percentage of responses fell into the good rating category. When asked if they have one person they thought of as their personal doctor or health care provider, 67.9 percent reported they have one person, 7.5 percent reported having more than one person they consider their personal doctor and nearly a quarter of all respondents (24.6 percent) reported not having a personal doctor or health care provider. In the PGC-BRFSS, they found that 68.1 percent reported having one person as their health care provider, but a larger proportion, 16.9 percent, reported having two people. The PGCBRFSS found that a smaller proportion, 15 percent, reported that they did not have a provider. When examined by PUMA, we nd that there are statisti-cally signicant di erences in access to a health care provider (see Figure 6) For those who reported having a provider (75.4 percent), we then asked the following, \"Of all the people you consider to be your personal doctors or providers, choose the most important one to you. What is that provider's specialty?\" The largest proportion (58 percent) reported family practice, fol-lowed by internist (21.1 percent), do not know (7.9 percent), obstetrician (4.7 percent), other (3.1 percent), cardiolo-gist (2.8 percent) and pediatrician (1.3 FIGURE 6 ACCESS TO A PERSONAL DOCTOR OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER BY PUMA 5 PUMA 6 PUMA 7 No not anyone Yes, one person Yes, more than one personTABLE 11PERCEIVED QUALITY OF CARE FROM USUAL SOURCE OF CARE Location of care Excellent Very Good Good Fair PoorDon't the location of their oces varied, 65 percent were in Prince George's County (see T able 12 for the top 13 locations). Of those reporting they have a pro- vider (n=988), 74.7 percent reported that they drive themselves to their doctor, followed by 11 percent who are driven by someone else and 9.7 percent who take a Metro bus. More than 80 percent of residents in PUMA regions 2 and 6 drive themselves compared to only 60 percent of residents in region 1. About 20 percent of residents in region 1 and 3 take the Metro bus to the doctor's oce, as do 15 percent of residents in region 7. It is critical to understand why County residents go outside the County for care. If they responded that their provider was outside of the County, the following question was asked, \"Y ou said that the provider who is most impor-tant to you is not located in Prince George's County. Why do you go out-side of Prince George's County to seek care?.\" More than 36 percent reported they preferred using their own provider. Further analyses could identify whether these are newer County residents who had a provider outside the County with whom they preferred to remain. T wo items are of particular interest. More than 7 percent indicated that their insurance required them to see a physician outside the County and more than 7 percent reported being unable to get an appointment with a special-ist inside the County. T able 13 reports these results. We examined di erences in who has their primary provider outside the County by race, income, education, gender, insurance and age. There were no statistically signicant di erences. We were also concerned with delays or diculty in getting needed health care. We asked about such delays within the last 12 months. A response: \"Sometimes people have diculty getting health care when they need it. By health care, I mean medical care as well as other kinds of care like dental care and mental health services.\" Approximately 17 percent of respondents stated they had dif-culty getting health care they needed. There were di erences by PUMA with more than 25 percent of residents in regions 2 and 3 reporting a delay in getting health care in the last 12 months compared to only 5.5 percent in region 7 and 7 percent in region 5.

Of particular concern was the reason for the delay or lack of care. When asked, \"Why was that care delayed or not received?,\" the results were interesting. Even though 83.8 percent of County residents had health insurance at the time of the survey, data in T able 14 demonstrate that 34 percent of County residents stated the health service was delayed due to lack of insurance, while 20 percent couldn't get an appoint-ment. The CHIP goal is to reduce those experiencing a delay in treatment to 15 percent by 2014.

We explored several of these fac-tors including priorities for seeking care, awareness of hospitals, qual-ity of care, impact of insurance and providers, health communication and literacy, and the role of cul-ture in health care encounters. /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/o.sc/r.sc/i.sc/t.sc/i.sc/e.sc/s.sc Survey participants were asked the question, \"What are your top three priorities when deciding on the loca-tion where you will get healthcare services?\". All responses were then grouped into the following broad categories: accessibility to care, cost of care, quality of care, location of care, TABLE 16PRIORITIES SEEKING PRIMARY CARE BY REGION PUMA 1 PUMA 2 PUMA 3 PUMA 4 PUMA 5 PUMA 6 PUMA 7 Whether or not the facility or doctor is close to my house38.2% 46.0% 58.8% 47.7% 55.1% 58.3% OF HOSPITALS SERVING PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY RESIDENTS, WHICH HOSPITAL COMES TO MIND FIRST?

Each of the broad categories was then divided into sub-categories and the sub-categories themselves were broken down to further illustrate the responses. For example, 43 percent of the partici-pants gave a response that fell into the category of accessibility to care. These 43 percent were further broken down to hours (22 percent), accessibility to doctors/facilities/services (20 percent) and access to medical records (1 percent). The 22 percent of responses that listed hours as a priority were subdivided into flexibility of hours (9 percent) and how quickly treatment or an appointment is available (13 per-cent). Overall, 51.4 percent stated that proximity to home was their top prior-ity, followed by accessibility of care (43 percent) and quality of care (36). T able 15 includes more detailed sub-catego-ries of responses given by residents. However, when we analyzed these priorities by region, we found that there were no signicant di erences for most priorities given, with the exception of the following factor. There were signicant di erences between region on proximity, with PUMA 1 reporting this as a priority signicantly less than PUMAs 3 and 6 (T able 16). Interestingly, 1, 3 and 6 are all adja-cent to the District of Columbia. /H.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc/s.sc In an e ort to better understand respondents' perceptions of hospitals in Prince George's County, we asked them to tell us what hospital came to mind rst. T able 17 reports that Prince George's Hospital Center topped the list with 20 percent of respondents followed by Doctors Community Hospital (16.4 percent), Washington Hospital Center (12.5 percent) and Southern Maryland Hospital (12.1 per-cent) as the rst hospital that comes to mind serving County residents.The largest proportion (22.9 percent) of residents reported that Prince George's Hospital Center was the closest to them (see T able 18). /Q.sc/u.sc/a.sc/l.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /c.sc/a.sc/r.sc/e.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /h.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/i.sc/c.sc/e.sc When asked about the service quality of the hospital closest to them, 40.4 percent of respondents stated the service was Excellent/Very Good, 24.2 person stated it was Good and 26.8 percent stated the hospital services were Fair/Poor. Figure 7 illustrates a breakdown of each response category. We asked respondents to identify their choice of local hospitals for specic medical services. In a separate question, we also asked them to rate the overall quality of hospitals. In T able 19, we focus on choice of hospital for two key services, general hospitaliza-tion and care for the leading cause of death, heart attack. The table also includes the percentage of respon-dents' overall best quality ranking of the hospital. In terms of respondent choice for general hospitalization, a plurality of respondents selected Washington Hospital Center (15.3 percent) followed by Doctors Community Hospital (13.5 percent), which was essentially tied with Holy Cross (13.3 percent). There were statistically signicant di erences with higher income, more educated and females more likely to report choosing a hospital outside the County. There is a similar clustering in how respondents rated the overall best quality of these three institutions, 16.3 percent for Doctors Community Hospital, 11.4 percent for Washington Hospital Center and 10.3 percent for Holy Cross. However, when respon-dents were asked to identify which hospital they would choose in the event of a heart attack, 31 percent selected Washington Hospital Center while far fewer selected Doctors (7.1 percent) or Holy Cross (6.4 percent). Prince George's Hospital Center was in single digits for general hospitalization (7.3 percent) and overall best quality (7.8 percent). It is noteworthy that in the event of a heart attack, 8.1 percent of respondents selected Prince George's Hospital Center, placing it second to Washington Hospital Center and tied with Washington Adventist Hospital. However, Washington Hospital Center is clearly the people's choice for cardiac care. For choice of hospital for a heart attack, again, there were statistically signicant di erences with those with higher incomes choosing a hospital outside of the County. When we examine which hospital respondents would choose for care by PUMA, respondents do not choose the hospital that is closest to them (see Figure 8). For example, in PUMA 1, 10 percent live closest to Holy Cross, but 18 percent choose this hospital for procedures. In PUMA 2, only 2.2 percent live closest to Holy Cross, but 24.6 percent choose this hospital for procedures. In PUMA 4, 67.4 percent live closest to Prince George's Hospital FIGURE 7HOSPITAL SERVICE QUALITY (N=951) Excellent HOSPITAL FOR GENERAL HOSPITALIZATION AND HEART ATTACK SORTED BY BEST OVERALL QUALITY (N=1,001) HospitalsChoice for general hospitalizationChoice for heart attackOverall best quality Doctors Community Hospital 13.5% 7.1% 16.3% Washington less than 1% responding \"overall best\" are excluded from tableHospitalsChoice for general hospitalizationChoice for heart attackOverall best quality FIGURE 8TO WHICH HOSPITAL WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO BE ADMITTED IF YOU NEEDED HOSPITALIZATION FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN EMERGENCY?

However, there is variation in preferred hospital for di erent medi- cal needs. For example, Washington Hospital Center was the top choice for the treatment of heart attack and general surgery for the residents of all PUMAs except region 1. The residents of region 1 chose Washington Adventist Hospital for heart attack (30.1 percent) and Holy Cross Hospital (19.6 percent) for general surgery (see Figure 9). We asked Prince Georgians, \"When was the last time you or someone in your household stayed overnight as a patient in a hospital?\" Approximately 36.4 percent stated it was three or more years, followed by 31.3 percent reporting less than one year, 14 percent reporting one to two years, 9.6 percent stated two to three years with 7.1 percent responding \"never\" and 1.6 percent responding that they did not know. When asked \"In which hospital was the last stay for you or someone in your household,\" 11.8 percent reported Doctors Community Hospital, followed closely by 11.2 percent for Washington Hospital Center and 10.4 percent for Holy Cross Hospital (see T able 20). Figure 10 displays their responses to the question, \"How pleased were you with your hospital experience?\" More than 57 percent indicated they were very pleased, followed by more than 28 percent who were somewhat pleased. If respondents reported using a hospital outside the County, they were asked their reasons for doing so (T able 21). Almost 31 percent were referred to a hospital outside the County by their physician, followed by 13 percent who reported that their insurance coverage dictated their hospital choice. Addi-tionally, two quality measures were also important factors with 12 percent reporting that the hospital they chose had a better reputation and 10 percent reporting that they do not have positive perceptions of hospitals within the County. We did further analyses in which we collapsed all responses into three categories: quality of care, insur-ance and location. We then examined those by demographic variables. There were no statistically signicant dierences. /P.sc/e.sc/r.sc/c.sc/e.sc/p.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc /o.sc/f.sc /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /G.sc/e.sc/o.sc/r.sc/g.sc/e.sc '/s.sc /H.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc/s.sc We in perceptions of existing hospitals in Prince George's County, particularly those associ-ated with Dimensions Healthcare. When asked, \"Thinking specically of Prince George's Hospital Center in Cheverly, whether you have ever been a patient there or not, what is your overall opinion of the hospital?,\" 47.2 percent reported a favorable view and 34.9 percent reported their view was unfavorable. More than 17 percent did not know. There were no sta-tistically signicant di erences in perceptions of the hospital center by demographic characteristics except with insurance. Those with insurance were more likely to have less favorable perceptions of the hospital center than those without insurance. If they responded with unfavorable, we asked what would change their opinion (see Figure 11). Most important factors in changing their opinion were adding more quality sta (31 percent), followed by 20.7 percent who reported that adding quality sta , adding quality physicians and improving or building a new facility were all equally impor-tant. We did nd some di erences in opinions by group for this question. Signicantly more minorities reported that a new facility would improve their TABLE 21WHY DID YOU NOT USE A HOSPITAL LOCATED WITHIN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY?

There was a statistically signicant di erence by gender with women reporting that more quality sta was important as compared to men. Residents over 65 years of age were signicantly less likely to see a new facility as important; older residents were also more likely than other age groups to see the combination of facil-ity, physicians and sta as important. We asked the same set of questions about Laurel Regional Hospital. We saw interesting results when we asked for their overall opinion of the hospital (see Figure 12). Just over 50 percent viewed it favorably but 12.6 percent had never heard of the hospital and 20.6 percent had no opinion. If they reported an unfavorable opinion, we asked what would change that opinion (see Figure 13). In this case, adding more quality sta and quality physicians were the most important factors in modifying opinions of the hospital. We asked, \"If there was a new state-of-the-art hospital built in Prince George's County, how likely would you be to use it?\" The results indicated a high degree of willingness with 55.1 percent indicating they were very likely, 37.1 percent reporting likely and 3.5 percent reporting they did not know. For the proportion (9.7 percent) who indicated they were not likely to use the hospital, we would need to do further analysis to determine whether insur-ance provider or physician would be the inhibiting factor. When examined by PUMA, there were no signicant dif-ferences in likelihood of use by region. There were no statistically signicant dierences by income with all income categories from 50 to 62 percent very likely to use a new hospital. There were statistically signicant di erences between racial and ethnic groups with only 40 percent of whites reporting they were very likely to use a new hospital compared to 62 percent of all other races. Age was a signicant fac-tor with 62 percent of those between 35 and 64 years reporting they were very likely to use a new hospital com-pared to 40 percent of those over 65. Of critical importance is to under- stand what factors would contribute to residents' use of a new hospital. We asked them to rate the importance of specic factors in their decision to use the hospital (Figure 14). Quality of care was the most critical factor followed closely by insurance coverage and specialist care.FIGURE 11WHAT WOULD CHANGE YOUR UNFAVORABLE OPINION STAFF OTHER THAN PHYSICIANS, SUCH AS NURSING STAFFALL OF THESE ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANTDON'T KNOW ADDING NEW QUALITY PHYSICIANS TO THE MEDICAL STAFFIMPROVING OR MODERNIZING THE CURRENT FACILITY OR BUILD A NEW FACILITYWOULD NOT USE PRINCE GEORGE'S FIGURE 12THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF LAUREL REGIONAL HOSPITAL, WHETHER YOU HAVE EVER BEEN A PATIENT THERE OR NOT, WHAT IS YOUR OVERALL OPINION OF THE HOSPITAL?

The survey included a number of questions on health literacy and com-munication across cultures. Overall, respondents did not report diculty understanding medical information and materials (see T able 22). Almost 74.6 percent reported never or rarely needing help reading medical materi-als and 76.8 percent reported feeling very condent or extremely condent lling out medical forms (see T able 22 and Figure 15). This is not surprising given the overall high education level of survey respondents. Further analysis is needed to explore the association between race, ethnicity, income and education with health literacy. Another point of interest regard- ing patient/provider communication was to what extent respondents had experienced diculties due to discor-dance\u2014that is, di erence on the basis of gender, race/ ethnicity or culture. We asked this overall question, \"Please tell me if the following has been a major problem for you, a minor problem for you, or not a problem at all during the last 12 months: a) being treated by a doctor or other health care provider who is from another country; b) being treated by a doctor or other health care provider who is not of your race/ ethnic group; c) being treated by a doctor or other health care provider who is not a man/woman; d) communicating with doctors or other health care provid-ers because of language di erences.\" Overall, respondents reported little diculty communicating with provid-ers of another country, di erent race/ ethnicity, or di erent gender (Figure 16). While 21.6 percent of respondents reported experiencing a problem due to language di erences, only 3.5 percent considered this to have been a major problem. However, communication may be a concern for those respondents who do not have access to providers who speak their language, since few reported having been provided with interpreter services. Of those respondents report-ing a primary language other than English, a little less than half (48.5 percent) have access to professionals who speak their language. Of this small group of respondents who are limited in their ability to directly communicate with their providers, only 20.9 percent reported access to interpreter services. REACTIONS TO RACE The literature on provider bias in health care is well documented. We were interested in a number of fac-tors that can shape County residents' responses to the health care system. From the Reactions to Race seg-ment of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we asked this question, \"Within the past 12 months, when seeking health care, do you feel your experiences were worse than, the same as, or better than for people of other races?\" Just over 81 percent responded they were treated the same as other races, 7.5 percent reported worse than other races, 6.1 percent reported better than other races and 3.3 percent did not know.

Of critical importance is that it is repre-sentative of the County's population, thereby allowing us to make generaliza-tions about the County as a whole. In 2008, Prince George's County contracted with RAND Corporation to study the health care needs of County residents and to assess the ability of the County to meet those needs. Results of the RAND study began to form the picture of health and health care concerns specic to Prince George's County, and in particular how these needs and concerns compared to the neighboring counties and the state. The RAND study indicated that while, overall, Prince George's County residents were no more likely than the rest of the state to self-report fair or poor health, Prince George's County residents were more likely to report being overweight or obese and having been diagnosed with diabetes relative to Maryland as a whole, as well as the neighboring jurisdictions of Howard and Montgomery Counties (Lurie et al. 2009). While the reports of other chronic diseases were similar between Prince George's County and other jurisdic-tions within Maryland, the health status of residents within the County varies widely, and is dependent largely upon educational attainment and income. Residents with more education were signicantly less likely to report having a chronic condition, including heart dis-ease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, asthma and disability. Likewise, resi-dents with household incomes greater than $50,000 per year were less likely to report that they had been diagnosed with heart disease, cerebrovascular dis-ease, or disability than residents with lower annual incomes. Furthermore, the RAND report indicates that Prince George's County residents are unin-sured at relatively high rates, especially as compared to residents of Mont-gomery and Howard counties, with 14 percent of adult residents reporting that they were uninsured. Addition-ally, 10 percent of residents reported missing needed care because the cost was too high, and nearly 16 percent reported having no regular source of care. Access to care was dependent FIGURE 15HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU FILLING OUT MEDICAL FORMS BY YOURSELF?

For example, males were nearly four times more likely to lack a regular source of care than females, and were almost three times less likely as females to have had a routine check-up within the past two years. Blacks were less likely than whites to report having a usual source of care (Lurie et al., 2009). RAND found that Prince George's County has fewer primary care physi-cians per capita than any other area jurisdiction, and many of the primary care doctors in the County are located outside of the areas where they would have the most impact on reducing the number of preventable hospitaliza-tions and emergency department visits. While in 2009 RAND assessed hospital capacity as adequate, the County had a relatively low supply of emergency department slots, even though resi-dents used the emergency department more intensively than residents of other jurisdictions. Finally, many residents of Prince George's County seek medical care outside of the County, a practice that is likely driven by a combination of convenience, preferences, and provider availability and referral patterns (Lurie et al., 2009). The results from the RAND report help identify some areas of heath and health care concern for residents of Prince George's County. One major limitation of that report, however, was that it lacked information about resi-dents' experiences with and attitudes toward health care services within the County. Our random household survey has helped ll that gap. Overall, our results lend support to many of the goals identied in the County's Health Improvement Plan while we also identify a few areas of di erence. For example, only 8 percent of residents identied HIV / AIDS as a major concern for the County and infant mortality was not identied as an issue at all. Other health conditions and risk behaviors\u2014from diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancer and the associated behaviors\u2014are consistent across our survey and the CHIP. We clearly found that while 65 percent of residents were receiving care from their doctor within the County, the use of hospitals outside the County remains an issue, driven by insurance, provider referrals, availability of specialty care and per-ceptions. Addressing these issues will require a multi-pronged e ort aimed at County residents, health care providers and insurers. /F.sc/u.sc/t.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc /A.sc/n.sc/a.sc/l.sc/y.sc/s.sc/e.sc/s.sc As with all research studies, the data provides other opportunities for a more sophisticated examination of critical questions. Specic areas for further analyses include: \u0099\u0015A more detailed analysis of health care utilization by categories of insurance (private insurance/public insurance); \u0099\u0015Further comparisons with the PGCBRFSS on risk behaviors and chronic conditions; \u0099\u0015Future examination of choices for hospital care in specic conditions in a more complex analysis with key demographic variables; \u0099\u0015Examination of the health literacy and patient/provider communication variables by race, ethnicity, income, education, length of time in the U.S. and other demographic variables; and\u0099\u0015Examination of the Reactions to Race module by demographic variables and perceived socio-economic position. LIMITATIONS The primary limitation was that lack of resources limited the length of the survey, in particular curtailing questions about health behaviors. Additionally, our questions about race and ethnicity provided only limited data about sub-groups within racial categories, thereby limiting our ability to conduct sub-group analyses. /S.sc/u.sc/m.sc/m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc This household survey provides valuable data on the perceptions, experiences and health care behaviors of a representative sample of County residents, thereby lling gaps in existing reports and strengthening the planning process for a new health care system.26/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc lic Opinion Research. 2011.

These strategies included strengthening the public health initiatives in the County and addressing non-medical determinants of health. Furthermore, rand reported no ambulatory care safety net and signicant out-of-County use of inpatient and emergency care by Prince George's residents (Lurie et al., 2009). In another report, data indicated that Prince George's County had higher hospitalization and mortality rates than Frederick or Montgomery counties, and African Americans with diabetes in the County have a higher rate of hospitalization than whites and a much higher mortality rate than the rates from surrounding counties (Partnering Toward a Healthier Future, 2007). For much of the auent populations in the County, there is a high proportion of residents that work and receive med- ical care outside the County (Lurie et al., 2009). The RAND report indicated that out-of-County use is perhaps driven by resident preferences, convenience and provider referral patterns. The authors argued that out-of-County health care use has policy implications: If, for instance, County residents perceive the quality of out-of-County hospitals to be better, then an- ticipated economic growth in Prince George's may perpetuate existing demand patterns. If, on the other hand, residents prefer to use care inside the County but are unable because of out-of-County commut-ing, then strategies aimed at building a stronger physician referral network, increasing the number of primary care physicians in the County, and increasing the availability of care on weekends and before and after hours may keep more patients in the County. Key stakeholder interviews were conducted to address these and other issues. While data on diseases and conditions, hospital use and provider capacity contribute essential informa- tion for the design of a new health care system, stakeholders provide critical insights in to the success of a system. Results of studies strongly recommend the involvement of stakeholders in for- mative research for program planning (Morcke, Wichmann-Hansen, Nielsen, & Eika, 2006). Scholars in communica- tion have asserted that stakeholder interviews are advantageous because they provide detailed information about individuals' perceptions (Darnall & Jolley, 2004). Interviews are two-way and thus, also allow for interviewers to clarify and restate questions to avoid miscommunication that might occur from survey data (Darnall & Jolley, 2004). Both formal and informal lead- ers can o er community perspectives on appropriate and e ective public health and medical interventions. Therefore, individual interviews with 40 key stakeholders were conducted for three main purposes. First, we wanted to gather and synthesize the opinions and perceptions of indi- viduals who can inform the process of developing an e ective and nancially viable health care delivery system in Prince George's County. Second, the interviewees might help to detect and pinpoint the potential constraints and solutions to developing and operating a viable delivery system in the County. Finally, the interviews can help capture the diverse perspectives of key influ- encers who can contribute to and who are a ected by the health care system in Prince George's County. Similar studies of stakeholders were previously conducted for purposes of 49/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc /i.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc/s.sc understanding health care in Prince George's County. For example, focus groups of community leaders and service providers assessed perceived health risk factors among children and adolescents (Child & Adolescent Health Assessment, 2002). The quali- tative data from the assessment and two surveys of parents and adolescents described health care experiences in the County. Findings from these surveys and focus groups provided implications for health care and policy that were signicant. For example, 41 percent of parents experienced dif- culties accessing health care for their adolescent in the past year. Among the most prevalent barriers that either prevented or delayed treatment were: inconvenient oce hours, appointment availability and cost (of doctor care and prescriptions). Problems with access were particularly prevalent among families living below the 200 percent poverty threshold. The community leaders in the study cited health care access concerns for the Hispanic and Asian communities, including prob- lems relative to culture, language and documentation. In addition to access to health care services, obesity and diet were among parents' top concerns (Child & Adolescent Health Assess- ment, 2002). A 2007 study included interviews with community leaders and compared Prince George's County with Frederick and Montgomery Counties across a range of health issues (Partnering T oward a Healthier Future, 2007). The study report cited lack of cultur- ally competent providers, diminished access to care and reduced rates of health insurance as chief contributors to poor health status among African Americans in the region. According to the report, \"Health illiteracy and linger- ing discrimination in the health care system also contribute to the health challenges faced by African Americans\" (p. 29). African Americans had the highest prevalence of diabetes, hyper- tension and HIV in the region. In Prince George's County specically, African Americans with diabetes had a higher rate of hospitalization than whites and higher mortality rates. These studies show the value of stakeholder interviews and the implications of ndings on decisions regarding a new health care system that will be developed for the County. We describe the methodology used to identify the stakeholders, conduct the interviews, analyze the data and sum- marize the ndings. /M.sc/e.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/d.sc IDENTIFICATION OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS We developed a framework of stake- holder categories that would provide a diverse and comprehensive perspec- tive (T able 1). These categories were selected to include sectors and groups of individuals who have influence in decision making or who contribute to decision making, would have experi- ence in the region and state, have worked with or been part of health and / or health care programs, and who have positions that permit them to view a diversity of policies and initia-tives. We developed an initial list of names and through an iterative process with the advisory committee a nal list of 40 was created. The nal list included state and local government representatives, health providers and health care administrators, and com- munity leaders.

In addition, advisory committee mem- bers o ered support for encouraging participation of other stakeholders. Initial contacts with stakeholders were made by phone or through email with a formal follow-up by phone. Interviews were scheduled on dates and times convenient for the stakeholders and within a two-month time frame to keep to the project's time limit. Interviews were conducted between February 1, 2012 and March 21, 2012. /I.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc /P.sc/r.sc/o.sc/t.sc/o.sc/c.sc/o.sc/l.sc Each interview was guided by a set of open-ended questions that were pilot tested and that varied somewhat according to the profession of the participant: whether the stakeholder's position was government, health or community based. For example, for participants in health care, specic questions were added about recruit- ment of primary care physicians to work in the County. The interview guides are in Appendices A, B and C. Specically, interview ques- tions addressed the ve main study questions and augmented with specic prompts: Question 1: What are the key health outcomes in the County most ame- nable to improvement by a new health care system? \u0099\u0015What stakeholders believe are the key health issues facing County residents \u0099\u0015Specic health indicators they believe to be priority for developing new health care system \u0099\u0015Stakeholder perceptions of the health needs of under-insured and uninsured populations Question 2: What elements of a health care system (hospital and community) can e ect these outcomes and by how much (model)? \u0099\u0015Health care services that might have greatest potential for improving the health status of Prince George's County Question 3: What is the geographic distribution of health care resources and where are the areas of greatest need for primary care? \u0099\u0015What stakeholders believe to be the changing demographics in the County and their e ect on health status indicators Question 4: What are the key issues to maximize uptake and achieve the potential of health care system for public health? \u0099\u0015Stakeholder explanations for why County residents travel to other, regional health care services Stakeholder recommendations for how the new County system can attract residents back to County for local health care services\u0099\u0015Stakeholder opinions about the supply and quality of the existing primary and specialty-care physicians and other health care providers serving the County, identication of the physician/ health care provider needs gap and suggestions for closing it \u0099\u0015Recommendations for recruitment and retention of physicians and nursing sta \u0099\u0015Stakeholder input on what would \"di erentiate\" and \"rank\" the new County health care system over other, regional health care services available to residents.

They were oriented ahead of time to the sets of questions that were developed for participants and were trained on equipment to use for audio recording the interviews. Each interview was initiated with a brief overview of the purpose of the study and a review of the consent form. Inter-viewees agreed to participate according to the conditions of the study by either signing the consent form in person or agreeing by phone to participate. The consent form asked and documented 51/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc /i.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc/s.sc whether or not the interviewee agreed to audio recording. T wenty-one interviews were con- ducted in person (n=21) and the rest by phone (n=19). The interviews averaged 45 minutes and ranged from 25 min- utes to 1 hour. T wenty-four interviewees agreed to be audio recorded. If no approval was given for audio record- ing, interviewers took detailed notes. In a few cases an additional person accompanied the interviewer to help with taking notes.DATA ANALYSIS T wenty-four audiotapes were tran- scribed verbatim and together with the typed notes provided the basis for analyses. Initial themes that emerged were identied. We also analyzed responses by question, by stakeholder category and by familiarity of the stakeholder with the health and health care in the County. The investigators reviewed the documentation of the interviews and developed an initial framework of themes. After all inter- views were conducted, the interviewers met to provide additional feedback and suggest rened themes they noticed in the interviews they conducted. Themes were organized into a list. Then each of the transcripts and sets of notes were reviewed to determine the variation in the support, refutation and extension of the list of themes. The transcripts were used to collect quotes that supported each of the themes. Any alternative explanations and unique perspectives were added to the analysis. After gen-eral themes were summarized, the ve main study questions were used as a framework and data were synthesized to respond to each. /F.sc/i.sc/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc/s.sc PARTICIPANT PROFILES The stakeholders that participated in the interviews represented a wide range of professional and commu-nity perspectives on the current and future health care system in Prince George's County. T able 2 presents the number of participants by category of stakeholders. There was no consistent pattern of responses that correlated with stakeholder category or type of profes-sion. Health care providers overall were most familiar with the County's current state of health care and the status of primary care providers. However, there were state-level policy leaders who were just as familiar with the health care status of residents and the constraints on local physicians. Not surprisingly, the participants who expressed the least knowledge of local health issues and health expertise were those who worked and lived outside County borders. STAKEHOLDER EXPERIENCES AND RESPONSE CONTEXT A little over half of the stakeholders worked in the County, and at least one-quarter lived and worked in Prince George's County. All those interviewed who worked but did not live in the County did not utilize health care services in the County. Some of the participants who did live in the County did not always use health care services within the County. One participant admitted, \"I always go to a District hospital, because I have health care [insurance and] because it's better...\" A local leader said, \"[I am] living here [but] my primary physicians are in the District of Columbia. And the reason I selected those is because they're close to where I work. So I am not overly familiar with [provider status for County].\" Another person who worked in the County said, \"I person- ally leave the County to get health care because that's where my insurance said the specialist was.\" One stake- holder encourages pediatric patients to go to Children's Hospital \"... And that concerns me.\" TABLE 2STAKEHOLDER GROUPS CAPTURED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS Group Number of Participants State level policy leaders and administrators 7 Local policy leaders 7 Health practitioners 8 Academic administration 4 Health and hospital administration 6Community level (from and discussions centered on two main topics, the current health care system in Prince George's County and a future health care system in the County. Findings are organized below rst according to the current status. The ndings that address the current status of health care in the County coalesced around seven main themes. Five themes reflected interviewer question topics: prevalent health risks, recommendations for local services, lessons learned from County and other services, reasons for leaving County for health care, and perceptions of Dimensions Healthcare System. T wo additional themes emerged in open discussion with participants: a negative perception of health care services and undue burdens on County physicians. Each of the themes are described and supported below with illustrative quotes from the interviews. PREVALENT HEALTH RISKS Overall, infant mortality and chronic diseases topped all the participant lists of prevalent health risks for the County. The specic chronic diseases mentioned were diabetes and heart disease, and related risks included obe- sity and hypertension. One stakeholder explained, \"[Obesity] is connected to most of those diseases that we are faced with dealing with as a commu- nity at large.\" Other health concerns mentioned (by one or two participants) were HIV / AIDS, and kidney disease and mental health. While not an illness or disease, access to primary care and preventive services ranked as a priority concern for all stakeholders interviewed as a health risk. This included lack of primary care, access to hospitals and access to specialty care. As one stakeholder commented, \"There's just not enough primary care. ... There's never enough specialty care.\" Another participant said, \"One of the greatest challenges in the County is the lack of primary care resources.\" As someone explained, \"for a new patient to try and schedule services ... the waiting list is unconscio- nably long. ...But the need for people to have a place to go is overwhelming in this County.\" /I.sc/n.sc/s.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc /v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/u.sc/s.sc /U.sc/n.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/s.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc . Responses were inconsistent as to whether health risks di ered by insur- ance status. Most participants believed the health risks were more prevalent in the underinsured and uninsured County populations, and a few believed the prevalent health risks cut across all populations in the County regard- less of ability to pay. One participant who reported a di erence commented that \"people who have insurance in our County fare pretty well.\" Another explained, \"People who are insured are more likely to get health care when they feel they need it. Those who are uninsured will attempt to hold o as long as possible for both themselves and family members until it's almost an emergency or crisis.\" One of the stake- holders who did not believe there was a marked di erence said, \"bad eating habits\" cut across all socio-economic status groups in the County and led to obesity County-wide. STAKEHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE COUNTY/REGION When asked where they currently recommend acquisition of health care services for others in the County, participants frequently responded with university-based health care options outside of the County or National Chil- dren's Medical Center, if asked about children. As one participant remarked, \"I'd love to say Doctor's Hospital, but for the most part I would advise [person with hypertension] to go to the District, George Washington or Washington Hospital Center.\" Another participant explained that she would refer them to the teaching hospitals in the District of Columbia because they are \"more research-oriented and probably had expanded resources.\" Another stake- holder said, \"The hospitals that our patients go to or are sent to are largely Montgomery County hospitals and Children's.\" A few of the participants referred to National Children's Medical Center as a model to emulate in struc- turing a new health care system. If not a model then a strong partnership for pediatric care would be desirable. One participant said, \"Partnerships with Children's would go a long way with me if I was moving, if I was that family that you just described coming in (to the County). I would probably still, for most of the care, go to Children's if I had a child that needed some specialty help.\" LESSONS LEARNED FROM CURRENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS A few of the participants suggested lessons learned from current services oered in the County. For example, one stakeholder viewed the current mobile vans as a program in need of expan- sion, \"Y ou have the vans that can go to dierent sites and that actually works well.\" Others referred to the quality of care at the T rauma Care Center at Prince George's Hospital and at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Prince 53/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc /i.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc/s.sc George's Hospital. One participant was \"very impressed with that unit there.\" Another said, \"If you have a trauma, Prince George's Hospital is the place to go. And I think that's what they do very well.\" Other services of Prince George's Hospital to keep included pediatrics, and \"they have a good heart center, but they don't have enough doctors.\" Wound care at Doctor's Hospital was exceptional to one participant, who said, \"A lot of people don't know some of the neat things that they've got going on there.\" A couple of participants listed Bowie Health Center and Laurel Health Center as facilities to retain in the new system, because they represent convenient access to health care for residents located near them, reducing emer- gency room visits by those residents. One person added that Laurel was \"known for psychiatric services.\" Also, a participant believed Anne Arundel County o ered best practices in terms of emergency services, \"The technol-ogy is streamlined; the wait isn't as long as in some of our hospitals.\" A few of the stakeholders instead oered general \"lessons learned\" from their professional experiences. One participant said that residents will retain original physicians from other locations when they move to the County. \"People do not want to leave the health care provider that they are comfortable with. They just don't.\" Also, residents use services close to them, so if the services closest to them are in T akoma Park or D.C. they will use them. Another lesson was to measure perceptions continuously and create a feedback loop for consumers, insurance companies and others to tell their side of the story so that manage- ment can stay aware of changes in perceived reputation. Other lessons pertained to orga- nizational structure and function. For example, \"Coordination is needed if we're going to overcome.\" One participant o ered a nancial les- son, \"Not to let immediate economics drive long-term economics. ...What we spend now will save millions of dollars later on.\" Someone referred to a para- digm guiding the structure of a new health care system: I guess the biggest thing for best practice is changing it from what's best for us as an organization and an entity and a structure and flipping that paradigm to what's best for the resident or the client or the customer. How are we going to provide what we need for \"Rosa\"? We know what she needs, but we've not made it convenient for her. PERCEPTION OF COUNTY'S CURRENT HEALTH CARE QUALITY All the stakeholders said that the negative reputation of the County's health care quality was a primary reason for residents choosing out- side the County for their health care services. For about half the participants, the poor reputation of health care in Prince George's County trumped the actual quality of health care, which for these participants was quite good. One participant said: I live close to Southern Maryland Hospital and ... as much as it's developing and it's getting better, it's still overcoming some people's negative connotations about if you go there with a heart problem you're going to die. And I haven't found that to be true, although it's one of those things that's always in the back of your mind. Another stakeholder who lives in the County described the pervasive- ness of the perception, \"I hear it at church; I hear at work. Y ou hear it all over, your neighbors, everywhere, what the perceptions are about what the hospitals are.\" Stakeholders said that the positive qualities of the current health care system go unrecognized. They believe there are good physicians in the County, but not enough of them. A participant said, \"All of the doctors I go to or have to see are located in Prince George's County. I'm very pleased with all of them so I would say that we have good doctors who do services here.\" Participants were asked why there might be a conflict between percep- tion and reality. One believed it was because Prince George's Hospital \"serves the underserved and those who can't pay.\" Another participant responded, \"We just think that the white people have more resources, better doctors and if you're good you're going to be recruited into a better system. I'm not saying that's the case; I'm saying that I know a lot of people who believe that to be the case.\" As one stakeholder put it, \"Perception becomes reality unless otherwise chal- lenged and the perception is that we don't have a good hospital system and for some parts they're right, but there are other parts of the hospital system that ought to be duplicated.\" For other stakeholders, the quality of health care in the County is poor and the reputation reflects the quality. One participant remarked, \"Quality, that's what we lack ...The clinical data states that the quality of care of primary care providers in Prince George's County is way below what's in surrounding jurisdictions.\" Another participant sum- marized, \"We have a pair of hospitals in the County whose reputation is not very good because the care there is not very good.\" This person felt the County needed strong management over the health care system. The sta in hospitals is unstable because they work within the constant threat of nancial demise, which system is broken, so I see an obvious opportunity to be able to try to help put something together.\" A di erent stakeholder suggested that one reason for the repu- tation is a lack of cultural competency, \"When I think of Prince George's I think of ... lack of cultural understanding or lack of cultural competencies. I think of people being shued from one place to another ...I don't think it's positive.\" The reputation in the County also derives from having so few primary care providers. One local leader quipped, \"Oh, it's horrible. We'd laugh. It's a running joke in the community that there are only three primary physi- cians that everybody goes to ... every female knows there's three places where you can get a mammogram.\" Residents deal with long waits for the good providers who are in the area. Sharing a personal story, one stake- holder said, \"My dad, as sick as he is, does not want to go to his primary care physician because he doesn't want to be in the waiting room for three or four hours.\" Another stakeholder said that the constraint on providers has also led to a perception of rigid appointment scheduling, so that if patients are a few minutes late to an appointment, they will allegedly not be seen by a provider. This participant responded, \"Just hav- ing a little more flexibility and thinking about the population that they're serv- ing and all the incredible barriers that they have to get where they're going.\" REASONS FOR LEAVING COUNTY FOR HEALTH CARE While poor reputation and limited access (time) for available primary care providers might be viewed as a main factor for residents who leave the County for their health care, the stakeholders listed other priority reasons as well. For example, some participants assert that residents work outside the County and select a provider close to where they work. Participants also said that proximity to health care over a close geographic border o ers greater access than a health care service in the County. Therefore, primary care physicians inside the County refer patients to outside the County for specialty care or for surgery. \"If your physician only will admit there, that's where you're going.\" Participants also mentioned that insurance companies also play a role in sending residents out of County for health care if they have restrictions on where to go. However, a couple of participants also argued that, \"people do self-select.\" What is available in D.C. is perceived as better because of the options for university hospitals, \"People put value on that.\" Many residents in the County originated from the District of Colum- bia or other local jurisdictions and continue to travel to those locations for their original health care provider. As one stakeholder commented, \"A lot of Prince Georgians were once Washingtonians, and so it's kind of their inclination towards their own set. I think that most of the African Ameri- cans primary physicians are practicing in Washington, D.C., so you still have that, a lot of folks still go to physicians that look like them.\" A couple of participants wished to emphasize cultural distinctions and the migration of Latino populations into the County. \"There is a tension between African Americans and His- panics. And it plays out in health care. And I think that in some way has to get into the debate.\" One participant explained that residents travel outside of the County to seek health care because of a status perception. \"The people in Prince George's County are not overly proud to be calling themselves Prince George's County\u2014or to say that they're from Prince George's with the way that the County is viewed in the surrounding areas.\" PERCEPTIONS OF DIMENSIONS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Responses were mixed to the ques- tion about Dimensions Healthcare System: Most participants did not respond. Some stakeholders asked to be informed about what aspects of health care in the County fall within the purview of the Dimensions System. Several stakeholders spoke positively of the Bowie facility and remarked that more such facilities are needed in the County. A couple of stakeholders who worked with Dimensions management had positive perceptions and stated that lack of public relations has been a barrier to informing the region of the services provided. One stakeholder who had personal experiences with Prince George's Hospital held nega- tive perceptions of the system based on the experience, \"It was awful ... the receptionist person was ridiculous. ... In leaving the hospital, they only let you out one door because of security rea- sons. ... There was no privacy. ...These were just things that I have not seen at other facilities.\" Another participant who lived in the County said, \"I think they have been politicized beyond politicizing for years. They have been the sole bidder, the sole recipient of everything in Prince George's County so we have not gotten better. So I would like to see some competition.\" The mixed perceptions were illus- trated by one who said, \"Politics played too much of a role in it and I think the lack of services that it's able to provide based on the care that it gives and the money it has to deal with, has had negative impacts on the whole hospital and the ancillary services it provides.\" Comments from stakehold- ers who have visited, but who do not 55/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc /i.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc/s.sc work at Dimensions, as well as those who work there, mentioned the state of the physical facility of Prince George's Hospital and the need to \"modernize\" it. Another comment reflected on the perceived low proportion of medical residents who graduated from U.S. accredited medical schools. PERCEIVED BURDENS ON COUNTY PHYSICIANS A couple of the participants com- mented on what they perceived as administrative and insurance burdens placed on physicians. There are con- straints in practicing medicine in the County. First, one stakeholder said that compared to neighboring jurisdictions, Prince George's County procure-ment process is so cumbersome that it deters physicians from wanting to practice full time in the County. As the participant concluded, \"If the local contracting problem is still a problem, then we're still not going to have any doctors.\" Second, insurance companies guide reimbursement rates but, as one stakeholder argued, locations as well, and \"If they're not going to reim- burse for services provided by Prince George's Hospital System or the paying mechanism isn't there in the relation- ship to the payers and the non-payers, raising the rates to help the cash flow only puts the insurance companies in a position to refer you to other hospitals where they are a one-fourth or a one- half percent cheaper.\" The argument is that physicians do not wish to work in the County because they believe they might not get paid or paid at a rate that meets a national standard. responses from interviewers that per- tained to recommendations for a new health care system for Prince George's County. Interestingly, there were similar patterns in responses across stake- holders, where most or several of the participants o ered the same recom- mendations. The consistent themes across interviews were: need for strong marketing campaign, academic/uni- versity framework, acute care centers, centers of excellence, culturally appro- priate health education and prevention, integrated electronic health record system, community partnerships, multicultural health care, aesthetics, patient-centered medical home model, more federally qualied health centers, status, location preference and recruit- ing primary care providers. ACADEMIC/UNIVERSITY FRAMEWORK The reputation of the County's health care system would greatly improve if it were associated with a teaching hospi- tal and related university research. All participants referred to this desire for an academically based regional health care system that included a teaching hospital. This factor also was men- tioned when respondents remarked about their own health care seeking behaviors or what they look for when they recommend health care facili-ties to others. One stakeholder said that County residents get their care in neighboring jurisdictions because they have this option, \"Y ou don't have the big name like a Hopkins. Y ou don't have a G.W. Y ou don't have a George- town.\" Another stakeholder argued that a regional teaching hospital in the County would help build the infrastruc- ture to support ambulatory primary care centers, \"I think it's going to be dicult to build the infrastructure if we move without it.\" In addition some stakeholders mentioned the value of providing team-based care and inter-professional training that could benet a new university health care system. A couple of stakeholders explained that the physicians in the County are not connected to a research-based infrastructure and therefore become \"stagnant\" in their knowledge. \"I participated in a clinical trial at NIH and I felt like I never wanted to go back to my physician once they kicked me out of the study, because of the level of care that I received. There was just no comparison.\" The other participant shared experiences with physicians in the County not being up to date on the latest available medications, \"We've experienced that with several physi- cians in the community.\" STRONG MARKETING CAMPAIGN There was consistent support for a new system of health care for the County. All participants recommended a bold marketing campaign to dispel current beliefs about health care in the County and to brand a new image for the health care system based on its new academic framework. One stakeholder commented about image restoration, \"They need to polish their own apple.\" Another used Mercy Hos- pital in Baltimore City as a model for an aggressive campaign that recruited well-known magazines and high-end kind of magazines [for] that the insured population who is read- ing, lots of radio advertising, with the doctors' pictures in the paper, in the magazines, on the TV.\" The marketing campaign would focus on certain elements of the new system. The stakeholders suggested a message referring to the County having \"the best minds in the business\" and a \"state of the art facility.\" One participant remarked, \"Some people don't know what board certied means, but if it sounds good, it's great.\" A couple of participants suggested linking the marketing of a new brand for the health care system with the preven- tion health programs sponsored by the new system. Then, according to one interviewee, \"There are people who will say, 'That's our [health care system].' And that's where you want to get them to, 'That's our [health care system].'\" The campaign would promote the multicultural aspect of the health care system and the communica- tion found in the new setting. Have translators, because, as one par-ticipant said, \"We have such a diverse population I think residents coming here would want to know, okay, I can go somewhere where Spanish is spoken or this language is spoken and that the services are quality.\" /E.sc/f.sc/f.sc/e.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /F.sc/r.sc/e.sc/q.sc/u.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /C.sc/o.sc/m.sc/m.sc/u.sc/n.sc/i.sc/c.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc /w.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc /R.sc/e.sc/s.sc/i.sc/d.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/s.sc Some of the participants emphasized the need for better messages to be sent in a variety of ways to the residents about health care in the County. How the County and the health care system communicates to residents, patients and potential health care consum- ers will likely impact the success of a health care system in Prince George's County. One stakeholder related the power of word-of-mouth in the County and its influence on perceptions of where to go for health care. Also, there is a need to promote having translators and the multicul- tural aspect of the care setting. ACUTE CARE CENTERS Many participants emphasized the need for acute care centers or \"urgent care\" centers to be located throughout the County. Acute care centers are \"at the front line that people could go to for their care instead of their emergency room visit.\" Participants suggested that these centers would o er services on the weekend, flexible appointments and \"dental for children and adults.\" A participant said that these centers are \"not your emergency room. It's your place where if I can go in my neighbor- hood to get my shots.\" One participant argued that even those with insurance use the emergency room for acute care due to lack of access to other qualied services. \"If there are doctors, and if there are extended hours, and if there are urgent care sites,\" argued one participant, emergency room rates would drop. CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE Most of the participants suggested the development of specialty care centers around the County, although there was no agreement to what specialties to focus on, \"something that you could say we're the best at.\" The Centers of Excellence would not only be accessi- ble to residents, but would also attract the best practitioners to the County to live and work. Areas of specialty that were mentioned included: cancer, heart disease, diabetes and \"I think OB/GYN and pediatric services are primary.\" A participant commented on where to recruit for the centers' providers, \"Y ou choose certain specialties and say it's chosen to be a cancer center or a heart center or a diabetes center, then you got to go and recruit those well-known docs and bring them from D.C. ... Y ou have to bring some of those D.C. docs or Montgomery County docs over, for like one or two days a week or one day a week so that their practice is split, and then gradually you'll bring more.\" Several stakeholders mentioned the opportunity to \"think regionally\" as part of the design of the new health care system. This would include doing an assessment that includes the metro- politan area surrounding the District of Columbia and considering emer- gency preparedness plans and other surge needs. CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE HEALTH EDUCATION AND PREVENTION Almost all of the participants listed pre- ventive services and health education as a strong component they wished to see in the County's health care system. Some of the stakeholders empha- sized the need for culturally sensitive prevention messages, particularly as the County sees an increase in its number of Spanish-language residents. One stakeholder explained, \"Denitely culture has a lot to do with people's decisions about health care, want to generally, maybe, speak with someone who can relate and understand that particular culture. It doesn't mean that they have to have someone in their same, say, ethnic group, but at least someone that I call culturally com- petent that understands and can talk that language.\" A few wanted to see health education classes and work- shops o ered through the new hospital. Prenatal care was also mentioned as a preventative service to include. One stakeholder asserted, \"I think that we need to do better at marketing preventive services and having classes at di erent hospitals throughout the County and have that 57/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc /i.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc/s.sc advertised so that people know that they can go and get information about how to remain healthy.\" INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM A few of the stakeholders discussed the role of technology in the new health care system and how important it could be to both the reputation and the eciency of a new health care system if it incorporated an electronic health record (EHR) system that linked all the regional health services. An integrated EHR system reduces multiplication of services for individual patients and cost of care. It also increases eciency in treatment by reducing time to search for and nd patient information from other sources. One participant said, \"I think using technology is fantastic, that we have that technology to provide high-quality care, that there's an electronic record that can go from the hospital to my physician, to wherever so that I don't have to carry these things along each time.\" COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS The health care system would benet from not just continuing some of the partnerships currently forged in the County, but also by developing new, varied and extensive partnerships across County and with various levels of leadership. As one stakeholder put it, \"There's not been a lot of collabora- tion with regards to how we attack problems in the community, not a lot of talking to each other.\" Developing coalitions, like the County's new Health Care Coalition, o ers opportunities to communicate across organizational borders and view health care from various \"lenses.\" Partnerships were viewed as an approach for tackling wellness and prevention goals as well: the County government, schools and wellness programs working together to prevent obesity and tobacco use, for example. Other recommendations for collaboration include co-sponsoring events with community-based organi- zations, employers in the County and religious organizations. Have a name and services in \"di erent environments\" of the County, as one stakeholder put it. \"What I'm nding also with the agencies in the community and then community- based organizations, they really don't talk to each other and pull together to do an event or this is what I do well, I've got this. Y ou do this well; can you do that? And then bring it to a place where it's around that.\" The County government, the new health care sys- tem, and community-based clinics and organizations work together to support legislation or development community resources. Another participant named Children's National Medical Center, Community Clinics Inc. and the Uni- versity of Maryland Medical System as strategic partnerships to foster. MULTICULTURAL HEALTH CARE AND COMMUNICATION A few of the participants added the importance of multicultural sensitiv-ity in health care communication across the County and within each health care setting. According to a stakeholder, \"There seems to be a very high Spanish-speaking popula- tion and also a very high population of individuals from African countries, and it seems like there isn't a lot of availability for them to get care in a language that they understand.\" A few stakeholders recommended implementing a multicultural patient navigator/ outreach program to assist consumers with managing their care. \"It's kind of like having a patient navigator, helping them make their appointments, helping them arrange for transportation, helping them to understand how to be a health care consumer because a lot of people are coming from countries that they don't know. They don't have preventive health where they're coming from and ... and they have so many competing life priorities that it's not their top priority so they don't necessarily know what's expected of them.\" AESTHETICS Some participants spoke about the physical location, cleanliness and other visual aspects of a hospital and doctors' oces that influence how consum-ers feel about their health care. One stakeholder commented, \"What does the place look like when you go there, whether it's the doctor's oce or the hospital? ... I think if you wanted people preferring to use the hospital, the hospital has to be in a place that looks like a nice place to go to and looks nice when you get there.\" PATIENT-CENTERED MEDI - CAL HOMES AND ACCOUNT - ABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS A few participants espoused the medical home model as a possible framework for primary care in the County. The medical home model would integrate behavioral health care and dental services with primary care allowing for a comprehensive care management plan for each patient as needed. Community health work- ers would be involved in the system, helping with outreach to consum- ers in need of health care and with education for preventative goals. The medical home model also allows for the development of an integrated electronic patient record system that links patient data across services. As one stakeholder explained goes to [one clinic] and then the next day goes to [another health care facility] it's all there.\" The medical home model would decrease the number of emergency room visits. Several mentioned the opportunity aorded by the accountable care organizations in supporting population health. In addition, the importance of having clear and appropriate bench- marks and routine monitoring of the care delivered was highlighted. MORE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS ( FQHC S) Instead of acute care centers, some participants believed that the County should invest in applying for and developing more FQHCs. One of these stakeholders, who is not employed by an FQHC, said \"The expansion of the FQHC has been a benet to the County.\" These clinics are mandated to provide specialty care, care man- agement and outreach. They have to provide a full range of primary care services for all ages and for all people regardless of ability to pay. In addition, Medicaid reimburses FQHCs at over double the rate for private practitioners. The board of advisors for each FQHC is required to comprise 51 percent of health consumers, so patients dominate the voice of decision making and have a role in maintaining quality. Furthermore, FQHCs are required to provide culturally sensitive services, so they are adept at reaching out to patients in the di erent communities that make up the County. ACHIEVING \"HIGH STATURE\" Stakeholders believed that what is perceived as high stature resonates with County residents. A new health care system would achieve perceived stature through: an academic link to the University of Maryland, the centers of excellence moniker for ambulatory centers, and perceived \"top-notch quality\" through \"well-renowned surgeons and private care.\" As one participant described the beliefs of auent County residents, \"I'm auent. I can a ord to pay for anything I want.\" Another stakeholder argued that the auent, educated communities in the County would follow \"state- of-the-art evidence\" provided by a university-based hospital in the County because they seek out the \"best\" in health care specialists. LOCATION PREFERENCE Limited specic suggestions were provided when stakeholders were asked about location of facilities. One mentioned that as long as there were ways to travel by public transporta- tion and the quality of the care was high, the location did not matter. Many participants did not believe they were qualied to answer this question, as one said, \"I'm not the expert. I don't have the expertise to decide where it should be.\" However, one participant oered specic recommendations, \"I would do something in Landover where Landover Mall used to be. I would come down and I would be in the Capi- tol Heights/Suitland community, close to the Census Bureau. It will come out closer to Bowie State University, right o of 295 on the southern end; it might be towards where Southern Hospital is, in the more rural setting, at the Maryland Hospital, and then of course, in the far Washington area, I'd be over by Silver Spring. I think that touches the whole of the County.\" Another stakeholder said, \"[The regional center] needs to move from where it is in Cheverly to some place that's central- ized to Prince George's County o major road accesses both public and private.\" In other cases, some general com- ments were shared about the location of an anchor care facility, such as hav- ing it accessible from a major highway or transportation such as the Metro, and having the space to expand the buildings if necessary in the future. A couple of participants recommended the regional center be relocated to a more southern location than where Prince George's Hospital is currently, \"Not close to the Charles County line but denitely a little bit southern than where we are.\" Similarly, one partici- pant suggested that if an acute care center or center of excellence is located near D.C. inside the beltway, residents from D.C. will go to it because it would oer accessible and better health care for the D.C. residents as well. RECRUITING PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS Most of the stakeholders held profes- sional positions unrelated to primary care, so the topic of physician recruit- ment was perceived as outside their purview. When primary care physi- cians were discussed in detail, it was suggested that group practices be made available to easily join so that new physicians do not have to handle the administrative burden. As one stakeholder put it, \"Y oung people are looking for a decent salary, a decent lifestyle and help with learning things.\" One stakeholder alleged that the local medical society did not engage its membership in being committed and active for the County and this might be indicative of the type of challenging factors that might constrain the recruit- ment of quality physicians. According to this participant, \"There is not that infrastructure or environment here in our County to get them to come out to work together, to talk together.\" Stakeholders who were not 59/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc /i.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc/s.sc physicians had few recommendations for recruiting physicians to the County. Most of the participants responded by asserting only that, \"We need to provide incentives for our primary care providers.\" A few suggested loan forgiveness plans. Others referred to the reputation of what will be the centers of excellence, and a connection with a teaching hospital and university as incentives to bring new physicians to the area. One stakeholder suggested developing an integrated strategic plan for aggressively recruiting physicians from other nearby jurisdictions. /R.sc/e.sc/s.sc/p.sc/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc/e.sc/s.sc /t.sc/o.sc /F.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc /M.sc/a.sc/i.sc/n.sc /Q.sc/u.sc/e.sc/s.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc Participant responses were analyzed also to answer the ve main questions that framed the project. Below is a summary of how data responded to each key health outcomes to address through a new health care system are chronic disease, specically diabetes and heart disease, and infant mortality. Related risks, such as obesity, hyper- tension and poor prenatal care should be addressed not only through health services, but also through a compre- hensive and strategic preventive health education program implemented throughout disease and infant mortality can be reduced once access to primary care and specialty care increases. Access is a key factor in improv- ing health outcomes in the County, according to the stakeholders. Access to primary care will be signicantly improved through a set of elements in the new health care system. These ele- ments include the following: \u0099\u0015Ambulatory care centers that address acute care needs in communities. Also referred to as urgent care centers, these facilities will have hours of operation in evenings and weekends, flexible appointments and locations near public transportation. The utilization of urgent care centers will reduce emergency room visits, which will impact key health outcomes in the County. \u0099\u0015Additional Federally Qualied Health Centers (FQHCs). Mandates for FQHCs o er opportunities to increase access to health care, improve culturally appropriate health communication and implement case management. Primary care services are reimbursed at over twice the standard rate, and health consumers fully participate in board decisions. \u0099\u0015Development of a patient-centered medical home model. The County is already preparing to implement medical homes, and stakeholders believe this initiative should be expanded and strengthened. \u0099\u0015Additional mobile health vans Access to specialty care will improve health outcomes and can be addressed through the development of centers of excellence. Stakeholders suggest build- ing a national leadership reputation through the creation of specialized care services located within the regional center or around the County. National experts would be recruited to operate the services and the County would be promoted as the leader in those specic care areas. Importance should be placed on clear and appropriate benchmarks and routing monitoring of the care delivered. An assessment should include the metropolitan area surrounding the District of Columbia and should consider emergency pre- paredness plans and other surge needs. The key health outcomes can also be a ected by retaining or modeling certain specialized elements of the cur- rent health care provided in the County. These elements include: \u0099\u0015The Critical Care unit of Prince George's Hospital \u0099\u0015Maternal and Child Health unit and neonatal intensive care unit of Prince George's Hospital \u0099\u0015Cardiac Rehabilitation unit of Prince George's Hospital \u0099\u0015Center for Wound Healing at Doctor's Hospital \u0099\u0015Bowie Health Center \u0099\u0015Laurel Regional Hospital's Behavioral Health unit The new health care system will better address health outcomes in coordination with government, community-based organizations the stakeholder suggestions for geographic distribution address access to Metro, and di erences between quality of care inside the Beltway and outside the Beltway. Specic recommendations included the following, \"I would do something in Landover where Landover Mall used to be. I would be in the Capitol Heights/ Suitland community, close to the Census Bureau. It will come out closer to Bowie State University, right o of 295 on the southern end; it might be towards where Southern Hospital is, in the more rural setting, at the Maryland Hospital, and then of course, in the far Washington area...\" Others suggested moving the regional center to a central- ized location accessible from a major highway or transportation such as the metro, and having the space to expand the buildings if necessary in the future. A couple of stakeholders recommended the regional center be relocated to a more southern and perceived excellence are key issues to be addressed in order for the new health care system to reach its potential. All the stakeholders cited perceived poor quality of services as the main reason that 1) leads residents out of the County for health care and 2) influences physicians to refer out of the County for specialized services. While several stakeholders believed that the poor reputation is in perception only, all acknowledged that perception is reality when it comes to health care decisions. Since many of the stakehold- ers believed that the \"true\" story of Prince George's County health care has gone untold, a bold and broad marketing campaign is recommended to maximize uptake of the new services. The campaign's goals would include: creating a positive \"brand\" for the County's health care system; increasing perceived stature of the quality of care that will be available and increasing use of the new health care services. Resident perspectives would be incor-porated in the designing of strategy and messages for the campaign. All local media and mobile channels will disseminate campaign messages, in addition to strategic use of opinion leaders in communities to share mes- sages by word of mouth. The campaign would promote di ering messages to be sensitive to cultural and language dierences in the County. An evidence-based university framework for the new system will signicantly improve the reputation of health care in the County. Stakehold- ers believe that a teaching hospital will increase the stature of the health care services, actually improve quality of care provided by physicians and com- pete with the university-based health care available in Washington, D.C. A basic need is that of recruitment and retention of qualied primary care and specialty physicians. There are three gaps that need to be addressed: the quantity, the quality and the type of physician working in the County. One suggestion was to propose part-time appointments for well-known providers from surrounding jurisdictions. Another suggestion was to incentivize medical school graduates with a loan repay- ment program. How the County and the health care system communicates to residents, patients and potential health care con- sumers will likely impact the success of a health care system in Prince George's County. The new health care system will be able to reduce key health risks by developing a comprehensive and culturally appropriate preven- tion and health education program. The program would include trained, multicultural health promoters in the community. Another suggestion was to place electronic kiosks in waiting rooms so that patients can nd preven- tive health information while waiting. Furthermore, within the clinical setting, resources should support a large and mobile translator/interpreter program. One stakeholder related the power of word of mouth in the County and its influence on perceptions of where to go for health care. These communication and translation e orts would harness the power of the word of mouth in the County. Finally, a mass media cam- paign would reinforce the new brand images. At its initial development, con- sider structuring the new health care system so as to incorporate prevention education at every phase of care and community outreach. Another key issue is related to the health insurance options and reimbursement rates that guide physician referrals as well as phy- sician recruitment and retention eorts. The new health care sys- tem must nd ways to address the nancial motives that are driving residents out of the County for care. One mark of distinction compared to neighboring health services would be the implementation of a coordi- nated, linked electronic health record system. The paperless system would incorporate clinical, administrative and billing services all on a single platform. All ambulatory centers as well as the regional hospital would be linked so that a patient seen by one physician in one facility would have his/her information shared with any referred provider system would benet from not just continuing the partner- ships currently forged in the County, but also from developing new, varied 61/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc /i.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc/s.sc and extensive collaborations with public health initiatives. Developing coalitions, like the County's Health Care Coalition, o ers opportunities to communicate across organizational borders and view health care from various \"lenses.\" Partnerships were viewed as an approach for tackling wellness and prevention goals as well: the County government, schools and wellness programs working together to prevent obesity and tobacco use. Other recommendations for collabora- tion included co-sponsoring events with community-based organizations, employers in the County and religious organizations. /D.sc/i.sc/s.sc/c.sc/u.sc/s.sc/s.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc The stakeholder interviews supported the results of previous reports about health and health care in Prince George's County. For example, similar to the RAND ndings, stakeholders lamented the lack of an ambulatory care safety net and the signicant out-of-County use of health care services (Lurie et al., 2009). Also, as in the RAND report, several stakehold- ers worked and received medical care outside the County, and they discussed the impact of residents traveling out of the County for their health care. The RAND report indicated that out-of-County use is perhaps driven by resident preferences, convenience and provider referral patterns (Lurie et al., 2009). Here, stakeholders viewed all three of these factors as influencing out-of-County health care use. It was a combination of factors, both structural and individual, that will need to be addressed in the development of a new health care system. Since one main nding here was that residents might prefer to use care inside the County if they did not work outside the County or get referred to outside the County by their physicians, then, as RAND sug- gested, \"strategies aimed at building a stronger physician referral network, increasing the number of primary care physicians in the County, and increas- ing the availability of care on weekends and before- and after- hours may keep more patients in the County.\" In previous research, the most prevalent barriers that either prevented or delayed treatment for parents were: inconvenient oce hours, appointment availability and cost (of doctor care and prescriptions) (Child & Adolescent Health Assessment, 2002; Partner- ing T oward a Healthier Future, 2007). Community leaders in the previous study cited problems relative to culture, language and documentation (Child & Adolescent Health Assessment, 2002). Similar concerns were cited by stakeholders in the current study as well. Access emerged here as the priority health care concern today, and the ways to address it included acute care centers that o ered appointment availability and convenient access. Also, stakeholders discussed a multicultural perspective for the development of communication in the clinical settings and in the community. The stakeholder study not only sup- ported previous research on the County, but also o ered a unique perspective of the County's health care, because it derives from community-based lead- ers, those on the front lines of health services, but who also have a \"bird's eye\" view of patient experiences. The combination insider/ outsider roles of these stakeholders contributed signicantly to our understanding of the current health care services and the desire for certain elements for a new health care system. The 40 stake-holders interviewed reflected a wide swath of professions that represent today's Prince George's County: health administrator, physician, legislator, businessman, resident, union leader. And yet all of the participants were optimistic about the plan for the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) to redevelop a County-wide health care system and committed to doing what they can to assist the e ort. LIMITATIONS The stakeholder study reflects perceptions and insights from a limited number of individuals. We had identied additional stakeholders, however, some individuals who were invited to participate did not respond to our requests or did not wish to be part of the study. These voices, while only ve, left a gap in the overall picture of what County stakeholders perceived for the future of health care.62/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /S.sc/u.sc/m.sc/m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc While data on diseases and conditions, hospital utilization and provider capacity contribute essential information for the design of a new health care system, stakeholders provide critical insights in to the success of a system. Individual interviews with 40 key stakeholders were conducted to capture the diverse perspectives of key influencers who can contribute to and who are affected by the health care system in Prince George's County. We wanted to gather and synthesize the opinions and perceptions of individuals who could inform the process of developing an effective and nancially viable health care delivery system in Prince George's County. Findings from the interviews addressed both current status of the health care system in the County and future recommendations for a new health care system. Overall, infant mortality and chronic disease topped lists of prevalent health risks for the County. All the stakeholders said that the negative reputation of the County's health care quality was a primary reason for residents choosing outside the County for their health care services. For about half the participants, the poor reputation of health care in Prince George's County trumped the actual quality of health care, which for these participants was quite good. The reputation in the County also derives from having so few primary care providers. Participants also mentioned that insurance companies play a role in sending residents out of County for health care. The recommendations for a future health care system included: using and promoting an academic/university framework with community partnerships, creating acute care centers and centers of excellence, developing culturally appropriate health education and prevention materials and activities; implementing a strong marketing campaign, building an electronic health record system, emphasizing multicultural health care; paying attention to physical aesthetics, furthering a patient-centered medical home model, and recruiting primary care providers. All of the participants were optimistic about the plan for UMMS to redevelop a County-wide health care system and were committed to doing what they can to assist the effort. /R.sc/e.sc/f.sc/e.sc/r.sc/e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc Child & Adolescent Health Assess- ment.

Retrieved from italics not to be read) INTRODUCTORY SCRIPT AT TIME OF INTERVIEW Thank you for spending time with me today. We are gathering information that will help contribute to the design of a new health care system in Prince George's County. We are conducting several interviews as part of a larger project that includes a survey and other types of research, and we want to nd out what key stakeholders, such as yourself, think about the health care in the County and about particular characteristics that could go into a new health care system. Y ou are being inter- viewed because you play an important role in health care and can o er valu- able advice about health care services. CONSENT FORM Before we begin, I have to make sure that you approve of being interviewed and audio recorded, so I would like to go through the consent form with you and ask you to sign it. (Present and read consent form. If over the phone, ask if participant read it and send it back signed, or conrm your receipt of signed consent form). Thanks. So let's get started, I'll begin with a couple of background questions: 1. Do you live or work in Prince George's County? How long have you lived here or worked in the County? 1.1 (If work) What is your current work in the County? 1.2 (If not) What is your connection to Prince George's County? The rest of the questions address health and health care in the County. 2. First, I want to ask about health issues that impact the County: When you think of the greatest health risks facing County residents today, what comes to your mind? Why? (probes below are used if participant does not share responses that address these Qs) 2.1 Are there other priority health concerns you would add? 2.2 If you had to pick three, which three would it be? Which one would you put as most critical, which next, etc.? And for which particular populations? 2.3 How would you compare the health risks and needs of the under-insured in the County with the health needs of the insured populations here? 3. How have the health problems in the County changed during your time here? 3.1 What else with regard to health has changed in the County since your time here? 4. Okay, now imagine for a moment a person with [priority health risk mentioned earlier] who develops a health problem related to the risk. If you could advise them where to go for care and treatment, where would you advise them to go? Why? 4.1 What are some specic factors that influenced you when you answered where to go for care? 4.2 In this County, how does location of residence influence where people go for health care? 5. We would like to hear your opinions about what a new health care system might look like for the County, one that includes a regional center for acute care and also outpatient surgery and a primary care network (Be prepared to dene these types of services). If you could oer up your wish list of health care services\u2014ones you think would have the greatest potential for improving the health status of Prince Georgians\u2014what health care services would you list? Why? 6. Consider for a moment the current health care services in the County. What are some good points or strong elements about the current health services that you would wish to keep in a new system? 6.1 What are lessons learned from the current health services in the County that you can share? 7. In your experiences, can you share with us some best practices in health care that you have learned about from other jurisdictions? 8. [If interviewee previously talked about residents going outside of County for care, then begin this Q with \"As you mentioned earlier\"], County residents have been traveling outside the County to other, regional health care services to get their health care. According to a RAND Report in 2009, about 25,000 residents receive care outside the County. Why do you think this is the case? 8.1 Do you believe cultural dierences between residents and health care providers impact choices in health care? How so or why not?64/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc think insurance aects residents' decisions to get their health care outside the County? 8.3 What do you think might motivate certain residents who currently utilize Washington D.C. and other area health care to stay in the County for their health care? 8.4 (only for non-hospitals) What is your impression of Dimensions Healthcare System? 9. In thinking about a new health care system, are there particularly unique services or an attractive characteristic that would be appealing to residents AND important to quality of health care? 9.1 What factors do you think would most influence a change in current health care usage for people? Is it the advice of primary care providers, the presence of a highly regarded provider, access to new or specialty services? 10. One critical characteristic of is access to good primary care. If you could dene what good primary care would mean to you, what would you say you look for in a good primary care physician? 11. And what do you think are some challenges providers face in this County? 11.1 In deciding to aliate with a health care center or hospital, what do physicians consider? 11.2 How can the County's new health care system help to overcome these challenges? 12. Think about what might be some important characteristics in a new health care system that would be specically attractive to excellent physicians. And imagine that you know of a colleague who is interested in moving to the County. What might you say to this colleague about the County's new health care services to convince her to move her practice here? 13. Those are all the questions I planned for today.

We are gathering information that will help contribute to the design of a new health care system in Prince George's County. We are conducting several interviews as part of a larger project that includes a survey and other types of research, and we want to nd out what key stakeholders, such as yourself, think about the health care in the County and about particular character- istics that could go into a new health care system. Y ou are being interviewed because of your important role in the County and you can o er valuable advice about health care services. CONSENT FORM Before we begin, I have to make sure that you approve of being interviewed and audio recorded, so I would like to go through the consent form with you and ask you to sign it. (Present and read consent form. If over the phone, ask if read it and sent it back signed or conrm your receipt of signed consent form). Thanks. So let's get started, I'll begin with a couple of background questions: 1. Do you live or work in Prince George's County? How long have you lived here or worked in the County? 1.1 (If work) What is your current work in the County? 1.2 (If not) What is your connection to Prince George's County? The rest of the questions address health and health care in the County. 2. First I want to ask about health issues that impact the County: When you think of the greatest health risks facing County residents today, what comes to your mind? Why?

Which one would you put as most critical, which next, etc.? And for which particular populations? 2.3 How would you compare the health risks and needs of the under-insured in the County with the health needs of the insured populations here? 3. How have the health problems in the County changed during your time here? 3.1 What else with regard to health has changed in the County since your time here? 4. We would like to hear your opinions about what a new health care system might look like for the County, one that includes a regional center for acute care and also outpatient surgery and a primary care network (Be prepared to dene these types of services). If you could oer up your wish list of health care services\u2014ones you think would have the greatest potential for improving the health status of Prince Georgians\u2014what health care services would you list? Why? 4.1 Where might you locate the services? Why? 4.2 What particular populations in the County do you think would use the di erent services? Why? 5. Consider for a moment the current health care services in the County. What are some good points or strong elements about the current health services that you would wish to keep in a new system? 5.1 What are lessons learned from the current health services in the County that you can share? 6. In your experiences, can you share with us some best practices in health care that you have learned about from other jurisdictions? 7. [If interviewee previously talked about residents going outside of County for care, then begin this Q with \"As you mentioned earlier\"], County residents have been traveling outside the County to other, regional health care services to get their health care. According to a RAND Report in 2009, about 25,000 residents receive care outside the County. Why do you think this is the case? 7.1 What do you think it would take to convince Prince George's County residents who currently utilize Washington D.C. and other area hospitals, to utilize a hospital located within Prince George's County? 7.2 What factors do you think would most influence a change in current health care usage for people? Is it the advice of primary care providers, the presence of a highly regarded provider, access to new or specialty services? 7.3 How do you think insurance aects residents' decisions to get their health care outside the County? 7.4 What is your impression of Dimensions Healthcare System? 8. Okay, now take a moment to imagine a particular family who recently moved to one of the County's more auent neighborhoods from Washington, D.C., and consider what might be their particular needs and preferences for health care. Please describe what you think they would be looking for in quality health care? 8.1 What do you think might be some factors that would motivate this family to stay in the County for their health care? 9. With regard to keeping residents in the County for health care, how could the new health care system distinguish itself from the other local options for health care? 9.1 Are there particularly unique services or an attractive characteristic that would be appealing to residents AND important to quality of health care? 10. If there was a state-of-the-art specialty care hospital center in Prince George's County, would you or members of your family use it as your rst choice for health care? 11. One critical characteristic of health care quality is access to good primary care. What is your opinion about the quality of primary care serving the County? 12. What do you think are some challenges residents face with regard to primary care providers? 12.1 How can the County's new health care system help to overcome these challenges? 13. Do you have any suggestions for how the County might retain and recruit excellent physicians and nursing sta for a new health care system?66/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc 14.

Thank you for your time and help with this project, it is and Categorization and Characteristics of Physicians in the State of Maryland and Prince George's County Mei-Ling report, we document our approach to quantifying physician supply for the state of Maryland and for Prince George's County. We also provide updated results on physician supply and selected practice characteristics. The quantitative analysis was cus- tomized to make use of appropriate measures for each specialty group and cluster category, using the most current relicensure data provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) Maryland Board of Physicians. Assessing the adequacy of the physician workforce involves considering the supply of primary care physicians and other specialists. The latter specialty groups are catego-rized into medical specialties, surgical specialties and hospital specialties to facilitate comparisons with the 2009 RAND report ndings (2009 RAND ref). The procedures used to derive physician counts and to classify each specialty and category are described in our methods. For the Public Health Impact Study of Prince George's County, we were inter-ested in assessing physician workforce capacity, dened as actively provid-ing quality clinical care to Maryland residents. Simply stated, our approach focused on identifying physicians who are board-certied, who provide patient care at least 20 hours a week and who have at least one practice in the state/County. We also wanted to compare the County data with that of surround-ing jurisdictions and the state. While we documented all physicians, we were particularly interested in primary care specialties, those specialties that serve as the initial point of contact and who serve to coordinate care. The result-ing counts were used to inform the geographic mapping, the econometric model and the comparisons with previ-ous studies. /M.sc/e.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/d.sc/s.sc A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO JUSTIFY PHYSICIAN COUNT A critical component in assessing physician capacity is the ability to accurately and systematically quantify the number of providers. We beneted from the process delineated in the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) report that applied the Health Resources and Services Administration Method to the Maryland data (MHCC Hogan Report, 2011) and assessed the dierences between Maryland Physi- cian Workforce Study report (Boucher & Associates Med Chi, 2008) and the Area Resource File. We applied the majority of the steps used in the MHCC Hogan Report in order to facilitate future comparisons (Appendix A T able 1 delineates the similarities and di er- ences in our respective approaches). Listed below is a description of our general two-step approach and additional steps taken for the Prince George's County counts. This is illus-trated in the flow chart for physician count management (Figure 1) and with resulting respective counts for Mary-land and for Prince George's County (T able 1). STEP 1We excluded physicians working for the federal government, physicians with primary practice as federal military and physicians with primary practice as federal civilian. However, we retained physicians working for Veterans A airs, since the patients they care for are civilian vet-erans who are now part of the general population. We also excluded interns and fellows as well as physicians aged 75 or older. Only active physicians who stated they provide direct medical care to Maryland patients were retained. STEP 2 We deleted physicians with data missing in their primary certica-tion. We looked at the possibility of substituting the secondary certica-tion, which included 23 physicians, but decided they were not sucient to include (Appendix B). We retained physicians who worked 20 hours or more in patient care or in their primary or secondary loca-tions. We also deleted physicians who declared they were not certied.71/p.sc/h.sc/y.sc/s.sc/i.sc/c.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc /c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/s.sc From the resulting 12,093 physi- cians in Maryland, the selection of the 922 board-certied active licensed physicians in Prince George's County was performed based on the ZIP codes declared by the physicians, not on the jurisdiction. There were 48 physi-cians who did not declared a ZIP code in Prince George's County, but who had the County as their jurisdiction. Because our analyses were based on ZIP codes, these were not considered in this analysis (see Appendix C for listing of their specialties). For the comparison counties, the selection of physicians was based on the declared jurisdiction only. In T able 1 we also calculated pri-mary care physicians with and without pediatricians in order to provide counts used for the econometric model and for a separate assessment of capacity for children and youth and adults.

We used the American Board of Medical Specialties' list of Recognized Medical Specialties and Subspecialties as a primary reference (www.abms.org/who_we_help/ physicians/ specialties.aspx). These are recognized specialties and subspecialties listed according to examining boards. 2. The procedure used to select the board-certied physicians who declare they are in direct patient care in the state of Maryland from the 25,687 physicians in the 2009-2010 renewal license dataset is described in previous section. 3. We placed physicians into four specialty categories: primary care specialties, medical specialties, surgical specialties and hospital specialties, for purposes of comparisons with the 2009 RAND report (specically T able 6.1; RAND 2009 Report). We describe our approach for each of the four categories. In the RAND 2009 report, physi- cians trained in family and general medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology are considered as primary physicians. We contacted RAND but were not able to identify the specic codes they used for their general categorization.TABLE 1GUIDE TO PHYSICIAN COUNT MANAGEMENT Adj.

If the jurisdiction of their primary practice is Prince George's County but the ZIP code of the Primary Practice is not, then the ZIP code of the secondary practice and the ZIP code of the non-public address were used. If none of these three ZIP codes are in Prince George's County, then these physicians were dropped from the survey. There are 43 board-certied physicians in this category. For the rest of the jurisdiction the selection was performed exclusively on the declared jurisdiction of their primary practice. ***Prince George's RESIDENTS, BY JURISDICTION* AND SELECTED SPECIALTIES** Prince George's Montgomery Howard Baltimore Anne Arundel State Primary Care T otal 53.9 94.9 75.2 101.2 66.6 84.4 1 Family medicine 10.7 13.4 13.6 12.3 14.7 14.7 2 General practice 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.1 \u2014 0.4 3 Internal medicine 26.1 42.8 27.9 57.1 29.0 40.0 4 Pediatrics 9.4 22.8 18.8 17.4 14.1 17.5 5 OB/GYN general 7.2 15.4 14.6 14.3 8.7 11.7 Medical Specialties T otal 20.0 56.9 48.4 52.9 32.7 47.4 1 Allergy and immunology 0.7 1.6 2.4 1.4 0.9 1.3 2 Cardiovascular disease 2.3 6.0 4.9 5.0 3.7 5.7 3 Dermatology 0.8 6.5 2.8 4.6 3.9 3.4 4 Diabetes and endocrinology 0.9 1.1 2.1 1.6 0.9 1.3 5 Gastroenterology 2.3 4.5 3.5 4.2 4.1 3.8 6 Internal medicine subspecialties 5.8 8.8 6.6 8.0 8.0 8.9 7 Neurology 1.6 4.2 5.6 2.2 2.8 4.0 8 Pediatrics subspecialties 0.9 3.0 \u2014 1.5 0.7 2.1 9 Psychiatry 3.5 18.1 19.2 20.4 4.1 13.1 10 Pulmonary medicine 0.7 1.5 0.7 2.4 2.2 2.0 11 Other primary care special 0.1 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.2 0.6 12 Other medical specialties 0.3 1.0 0.3 1.4 1.1 1.3 Hospital-Based T otal 16.2 47.0 20.2 45.3 29.8 43.2 1 Anesthesiology 4.3 17.6 7.7 13.0 10.8 14.7 2 Emergency medicine 3.8 9.7 3.5 8.2 6.7 8.8 3 Pathology 1.3 4.2 0.3 4.2 1.9 4.0 4 Physical medicine and rehabilitation 1.3 2.7 1.7 2.7 2.4 2.6 5 Diagnostic radiology 2.4 9.0 4.2 12.7 5.8 8.5 6 Radiology other 2.7 2.6 2.4 4.2 1.1 4.0 7 Other hospital based specialties 0.5 1.3 0.3 0.2 1.1 0.7 Surgical Specialties T otal 16.7 36.5 19.2 42.7 27.5 34.4 1 General surgery 3.8 6.0 3.5 9.3 4.8 8.2 2 Colon & rectal surgery \u2014 0.4 0.3 0.9 0.6 0.3 3 Neurosurgery 0.6 0.7 0.7 1.9 1.1 1.5 4 OB/GYN surgical 0.2 0.8 0.3 0.6 0.2 0.4 5 Ophthalmology 4.2 9.5 2.8 9.1 5.0 6.7 6 Orthopedic surgery 3.6 8.2 3.8 10.2 6.7 7.2 7 Otolaryngology 1.2 3.7 1.0 3.2 3.2 3.1 8 Plastic surgery 0.5 4.1 3.1 3.0 1.9 2.7 9 Thoracic surgery 0.7 0.7 \u2014 0.9 0.6 0.9 10 Urology 1.9 2.1 3.5 3.5 3.3 3.2 11 Other 0.1 0.3 \u2014 0.2 0.2 0.4 *The physicians counted in these rates are considered to be board-certied active physicians in Maryland selected from the 2009-2010 Maryland Board of Physician's Renewal License File and assigned to a jurisdiction using the procedure described in Table 1. **The procedures used to classify each certication into a subcategory are described in Section 2.2 on \"Approach Used in Classifying Physicians into report, primary care physicians were identied by codes for the primary certication provided to us by the DHMH Oce of Primary Care as specied by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). then placed other related subspecialties for the primary care specialties under medical specialties or surgical specialties as noted.

The Area Resource File data come from the American Medical Association's Physician master le, a le that includes current and histori-cal data, such as inactive physicians. The Maryland Physician Workforce Study was conducted by Boucher and Associates in 2008 for the Maryland State Medical Society and Maryland Hospital Association using the Mary-land relicensure data. Subsequently MHCC commissioned a study of the Maryland Physician Workforce Study that applied the HRSA method and resulted in the \"Hogan\" report that we used to derive our counts. For the Prince George's County Public Health Impact Study, these physicians are considered to be part of the 922 physi-cians board-certied active physicians in Prince George's County selected from the 2009-2010 Maryland Board of Physician's Renewal License File using the procedure described. TREND COMPARISON T able 4 provides comparisons of rates for 100,000 residents of Prince George's County for the di erent specialties previously described for the combination of years 2006-2007 and 2009-2010. These counts are based on raw renewal license datas-ets. Given that many of the variables used to select the licensed physicians TABLE 4PHYSICIAN COUNTS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY, BY YEAR* AND SELECTED SPECIALTIES** 2006-2007 2009-2010 Primary Care T otal 67.7 65.0 1 Family medicine 14.5 13.8 2 General practice 0.2 0.7 3 Internal medicine 30.4 29.9 4 Pediatrics 14.7 12.0 5 OB/GYN general 7.8 8.6 Medical Specialties T otal 26.9 24.9 1 Allergy and immunology 1.0 0.8 2 Cardiovascular disease 3.3 2.7 3 Dermatology 1.8 1.6 4 Diabetes and endocrinology 1.4 1.0 5 Gastroenterology 2.8 2.5 6 Internal medicine subspecialties 6.5 6.6 7 Neurology 1.3 2.0 8 Pediatrics subspecialties 0.6 1.2 9 Psychiatry 4.8 4.7 10 Pulmonary medicine 1.4 1.0 11 Other primary care special 1.0 0.2 12 Other medical specialties 1.0 0.5 Hospital Based T otal 23.6 21.4 1 Anesthesiology 5.4 6.1 2 Emergency medicine 6.8 5.6 3 Pathology 1.7 1.7 4 Physical medicine and rehabilitation 1.3 1.5 5 Diagnostic radiology 3.7 2.8 6 Radiology other 3.5 3.0 7 Other hospital based specialties 1.2 0.7 Surgical Specialties T otal 24.5 20.8 1 General surgery 6.2 4.4 2 Colon & rectal surgery \u2014 \u2014 3 Neurosurgery 0.8 0.7 4 OB/GYN surgical 0.2 0.2 5 Ophthalmology 5.9 5.4 6 Orthopedic surgery 5.6 4.9 7 Otolaryngology 1.4 1.6 8 Plastic surgery 0.5 0.5 9 Thoracic surgery 0.8 0.7 10 Urology 2.9 2.3 11 Other 0.1 0.1 *These counts are based on the raw renewal license datasets. Given that many of the variables used to select the licensed physicians and board-certied physicians in \"Guide to Physician Count Management\" were not collected in 2006 or 2007 it is not possible to perform the same set of adjustments. **The procedures used to classify each certication into a subcategory /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc and board-certied physicians in T able 1 were not collected in 2006 or 2007, it is not possible to perform the same set of adjustments and thus the counts per 100,000 are not identi-cal to those in T able 3 The renewal license datasets are grouped in sets of two years because the physicians are required to renew their licenses every two years. Using this alternate approach in all the four major cat-egories, the count of physicians per 100,000 Prince George's County residents in the 2009-2010 cycle falls below that of the 2006-2007 cycle. PEDIATRICIANS, ADULT PRIMARY CARE AND MEDICAL SPECIALISTS For purposes of future planning we also provide physician counts by ZIP code for pediatricians, adult primary care and medical specialists in Appendix F. We used these counts to ascertain the primary care physician rate per 1,000 population for specic age ranges. T able 5 provides the rates for pediatri-cian rates for the population that is 17 years or younger, adult primary care physician rates for the population that is 18 years old and older, and the rate for the medical specialist category. PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOARD-CERTIFIED PHYSICIANS We analyzed the relicensure sur- vey responses for board-certied physicians in order to get a better understanding of their capacity. We looked at both all board-certied physi-cians and board-certied primary care physicians for both the state of Mary-land and for Prince George's County. No statistical tests were applied. Appendix G includes preliminary tables for select items from the 2010 relicensure survey. The following narrative predominately highlights ndings for physicians in Prince George's County there are some major di erences with The survey asks physicians to identify their involvement in one of four types of activities: patient care, research, teaching and administration. About a third of board-certied physicians are involved in patient care only (Maryland 32 percent; County 38 percent). For primary care physicians this is about the same for the state as a whole (37 percent), but higher for primary care physicians in Prince George's County (42 percent). Involvement in teaching was reported by 36 percent of board-certied Maryland physicians and 30 percent of Maryland primary care physicians. The percent of all County physicians and primary care physicians involved in teaching was lower (23 percent and 21 percent, respectively). T wice as many Maryland physicians report they are involved in research activities (20 percent) as compared with those in the County (10 percent). This di erence remains when looking at the primary care physicians, although the percent is lower for both Maryland primary care physicians (10 percent) TABLE 6SELECTED PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY BOARD CERTIFIED TOTAL AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS BY PERCENT AND NUMBER, 2010 Prince George's County Physicians (ALL) (n=922)Prince George's County Primary Care Physicians (n=465) Practice only in Maryland 84% (722 ) 89% (414) Practice in and outside of Maryland 16% (145) 11% (50) Primary practice private for Primary practice private non-prot (96) Primary practice in solo practice 29% (266) 33% (152) Primary practice in single specialty group 36% (335) 27% (127)TABLE 5PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY PHYSICIAN RATES PER 1,000 BY PRIMARY CARE AND OTHER SPECIALTIES Supply of Pediatricians for 17 years old or younger Supply of Adult Primary Care Physicians for 18 years old or olderSupply of Medical Specialists 2010 Census Data* 205,999 657,421 863,420 Rate per QT Age Groups and Sex: 2010 (factnder2.census.gov.)77/p.sc/h.sc/y.sc/s.sc/i.sc/c.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc /c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/s.sc and County primary care physicians (6 percent). A small percent of physicians were involved in all four activities, with Maryland physicians more likely than County physicians to be involved in all four: all Maryland board-certied physicians (15 percent), Maryland primary care physicians (9 percent), Prince George's County physicians (6 percent) and primary care physicians (4 percent). Practice locations and primary prac- tice characteristics T able 6 provides a summary of the Prince George's County physician practice characteristics. The majority of both Maryland (89 percent) and County primary care physicians practice only in Maryland. Eleven per-cent of County primary care physicians practice both in and outside of Mary-land whereas 16 percent of all County physicians practice in both locations. The average number of practices reported by physicians in the County is 1.4 and ranges from 1 to 6. For County primary care physicians, the average is 1.3 with 1 to 5 practices as the range. The primary practice of the majority of these physicians is private for-prot and is either a solo or a single specialty group practice. About one-fth of the physicians, either all or primary care, practice in private non-prot oces. Physicians in the County are less likely to practice as hospital sta as their primary practice (6 percent) than phy-sicians in the state (15 percent), and are more likely to practice in a HMO group as sta (County 10 percent, state 3 percent) than the physicians in the state. /I.sc/n.sc/f.sc/o.sc/r.sc/m.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc /T.sc/e.sc/c.sc/h.sc/n.sc/o.sc/l.sc/o.sc/g.sc/y.sc /U.sc/s.sc/e.sc /i.sc/n.sc /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc /P.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/e.sc The pattern of information technology (IT) being used by physicians, whether in the County or the state is similar. The majority of physicians are using IT to nd general information such as information about treatment alterna-tives and guidelines and information on potential patient drug interactions (70-85 percent). A smaller proportion of physicians are using IT to com-municate with patients. For County primary care physicians, 42 percent send reminders of preventive medicine to patients and 33 percent communi-cate clinical issues with patients. Also 52 percent of County primary care physicians use IT to exchange clinical data and images with hospitals and laboratories and 41 percent use IT to share this information with other physi-cians. With regard to using IT to send prescriptions to pharmacists, 43 per-cent of County primary care physicians use IT for this purpose and more than two-thirds send more than 75 percent of their prescriptions in this manner. /U.sc/s.sc/e.sc /o.sc/f.sc /E.sc/l.sc/e.sc/c.sc/t.sc/r.sc/o.sc/n.sc/i.sc/c.sc /M.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/c.sc/a.sc/l.sc /R.sc/e.sc/c.sc/o.sc/r.sc/d.sc/s.sc About a quarter of all physicians in the state (26 percent) and the County (25 percent) are using all-electronic medical records. Slightly more of the primary care physicians are using only electronic medical records (state 30 percent, County 31 percent). Another portion of primary care physicians are using part-paper and part-electronic records (state 29 percent, County 22 percent). A higher proportion of County physicians are not using any electronic records (48 percent) than those in the state as a whole (37 percent). The pre-dominate reasons provided for those not using electronic medical records by all physicians was capital cost outlays (state 44 percent, County 52 percent) and the fact that it wasn't their decision (state 30 percent, County 26 percent). /P.sc/a.sc/r.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/i.sc/p.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc /i.sc/n.sc /I.sc/n.sc/s.sc/u.sc/r.sc/a.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /P.sc/r.sc/o.sc/g.sc/r.sc/a.sc/m.sc/s.sc More than 90 percent of all physi- cians participate in private insurance networks, while about three-quarters participate in the Maryland Medical Assistance Program. Of those par-ticipating in the Medical Assistance Program, most are accepting new patients (state 87 percent, County 88 percent). About two-thirds partici-pate in both the Medical Assistance Program and Medicare. Also of those participating in Medicare, most are accepting new patients (state 94 per-cent, County 95 percent). /H.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /P.sc/a.sc/r.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/i.sc/p.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc T able 7 presents the hospital admitting and other related activities for County physicians. A quarter of all County physicians have hospital admitting privileges only outside the County. This is about 60 percent higher than for all state physicians (15 percent). Also state physicians (15 percent) are more than twice as likely to have their pri-mary practice as sta in a hospital than County physicians (6 percent).

These data were used for additional analyses presented in other technical reports, specically for the geographic mapping of physicians, documentation of the ratio of physicians per population by category and jurisdiction, and for application in the econometric model that assessed the association of factors with hospital events. Further discussion with others who are involved in deriving physician counts for purposes of planning healthcare systems would be benecial. This paper also provides several select ndings: \u0099\u0015The ratio of physicians per 100,000 population in Prince George's County for each of the four categories of physicians (primary care, medical, hospital and surgical specialties) continues to be below that of the surrounding jurisdictions and the state as a whole. For example, the ratio of primary care physicians per 100,000 for Prince George's County, when compared with Montgomery County, is between half to two-thirds lower. \u0099\u0015There appears to be a decrease in the count of physicians in the County per 100,000 population. When looking at all four major categories of physicians, the count of physicians per 100,000 Prince George's County residents in the 2009-2010 cycle falls below that of the 2006-2007 cycle. \u0099\u0015The County has 81 pediatricians (0.39 per 1,000), 384 adult primary care specialists (0.58 per 1,000) and 173 (0.20 per 1,000) physicians with medical specialties with ZIP codes in Prince George's County. In general, the practice prole of County physicians is similar to that of the state of Maryland. A few notewor-thy di erences include: \u0099\u0015County physicians are more likely to have hospital privileges only outside Maryland (25 percent) compared with the state (15 percent). \u0099\u0015Physicians in the County are less likely to practice as hospital sta as their primary practice (6 percent) than physicians in the state (15 percent), and are more likely to practice in a HMO group as sta (County 10 percent, state 3 percent) than the physicians in the state. \u0099\u0015While about one-third of board-certied physicians are involved in patient care only (Maryland 32 percent, County 38 percent), twice as many state physicians report they are involved in research activities (20 percent) as compared with those in the County (10 percent). These ndings are preliminary and descriptive and warrant additional analyses. /R.sc/e.sc/f.sc/e.sc/r.sc/e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc Lurie, N., Harris, K.M., Shih R,A., Ruder ,T., Price, A., Martin, L.G., Acosta, J., Blanchard, J.C.

This was addressed by dening health care and other parameters of primary care need, documenting the geographic distribution of these parameters and then, based on a synthesis of these ndings, identifying areas that reflect differential levels of primary care need. To place the county data in the context of the region and state, the data are presented for four additional jurisdictions: Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Baltimore and Howard counties. These counties either border Prince George's County and/or have similarities in population characteristics. Primary care has been dened by the Institute of Medicine as the \"provi- sion of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community\" (IOM, 1994). This denition remains viable today with its hallmark focus on the patient, family and community, and with care facilitated and augmented by teams of providers working within integrated delivery systems. Integrated care includes the provision and coordination of services that address health care needs at stages throughout a patient's life cycle and continuous over time. This care focuses on disease prevention, chronic disease management and epi- sodic care for acute systems. Mental and behavioral health and dental health are included in the scope of services that support functioning of individuals and work is ongoing to integrate these services within a primary care delivery system. Three primary types of data were assessed to contribute to the identication of need for primary care at the level of ZIP codes. These include select population characteristics, rates of licensed primary care workforce categories and several measures of health-status based on hospital dis- charge data. In addition, the geographic location of hospitals and safety net clinics in Prince George's County are mapped. Additional information on public health resources is referenced in another technical report. POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS There are a number of characteristics that can be used to assess need for primary care. Three were used for this assessment: education, income and race/ ethnicity. Populations with low education and those with low incomes have higher risk for disease and lower use of preventive health services. Race/ ethnicity of populations has been associated with di erential risks for disease as well. The latter factor was added for comparison purposes and due to the general literature, although it is done with the knowledge that Prince George's County's population reflects a large and diverse majority African American population and is a county with the wealthiest African American population in the nation. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS Primary care providers serve as a principal point of contact for patients seeking to maintain optimum health within a health care system. The parameters of state practice acts dene the supervisory structure and settings of the care provided, such as care provided through independent practice or supervised care provided within teams of providers. For purposes of this study we have taken an initial step to look at a more extensive scope of primary health care providers in the state of Maryland. These licensed providers fall within three major categories: medical, dental and mental/behavioral health. 97/M.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/c.sc/a.sc/l.sc Primary care physiciansThese include medical specialists in family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology. Nurse practitioners These providers are advanced practice registered nurses and provide a full range of medical ser-vices with a focus on health promotion and disease prevention. In Maryland they work both independently and in collaboration with physicians. Physician assistantsThese pro- viders work under the supervision of licensed physicians and provide a range of diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive health care services as delegated by a physician. /D.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc DentistsThe majority of these providers are general practice practi- tioners who provide medical, surgical and disease preventive services for oral and dental disorders and diseases. Additional specialists contributing to primary care include pediatric dental specialists, dental public health special- ists and others. Dental HygienistsThese provid- ers work under the supervision of licensed dentists and provide a range of disease preventive health ser- vices. In Maryland, licensed dental hygienists can also provide services in public health settings under the general supervision of dentists. /M.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /B.sc/e.sc/h.sc/a.sc/v.sc/i.sc/o.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc /H.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc We include a full range of providers in this category and recognize that their scopes of practice di er, though all focus on improving an individual's men- tal health or treating mental illness. The most signicant di erences between these providers are the laws regard- ing required education and training across the various professions (Cherry, 2007). In Maryland, each of these four provider categories is licensed and can practice independently: psychiatrists (physicians who specialize in psy- chiatry), psychologists, clinical social workers, and therapists and counselors. HEALTH STATUS AS CAPTURED BY HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA Hospital inpatient care is often referred to as tertiary care; however, inpatient care that could have been prevented through e ective outpatient pri- mary care services (ambulatory care sensitive conditions), or care that is better coordinated between hospital discharge and outpatient care (30-day readmissions), has been used as a measure of primary care need. This study assessment uses three hospital events for Prince George's residents: hospital 30-day readmissions, hospital diseases for select ambulatory care- sensitive conditions and overall hospital discharges. The latter is an additional measure of health status, not necessar- ily primary care alone. In addition, two case studies provide data that concur- rently look at two health conditions, asthma and myocardial infarction, in the context of health care providers. GEOGRAPHIC MAPPING The centerpiece of this assessment is on geographic mapping based on applying the Geographic Information System. A Geographic Information System, also called GIS, is a computer- based system to aid in the collection, maintenance, storage, analysis, output and display of spatial data (Hanchette, 2003). Geospatial mapping of health data can be instrumental in visualizing patterns and generating questions that may not have otherwise occurred to researchers and the public. Historically, GIS has been used in the management of land and natural resources, and in environmental science. More recently, GIS has emerged as a new technol- ogy in public health. In particular, it provides analytical tools for health geography and epidemiological research in cases where geographical display is important. As a spatial ana- lytical tool, GIS serves to advance the knowledge base of health geography and informatics. /M.sc/e.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/d.sc/s.sc We conducted the analysis on four selected socio-demographic factors among ve jurisdictions. All data were collected at the ZIP code level and were obtained from the Census 2010 except the household income, which was obtained from Census 2000.

We used 2010 Census when available. Otherwise 2000 Census data were used. Specic census data included: \u0099\u0015Population size \u0099\u0015Median household income \u0099\u0015Percent of black/ Maryland hospital discharge data included: \u0099\u001530-day \u0099\u0015Hospital discharges for selected ambulatory care-sensitive conditions study-specic data using hospital discharge data for myocardial infarction and asthma MEASURES An age-adjusted rate is a weighted average of the age-specic (crude) rates, where the weights are the proportions of persons in the cor-responding age groups of a standard population. The potential confounding eect of age is reduced when compar- ing age-adjusted rates computed using the same standard population. These include the 2010 U.S. standard popula- tion as well as standard millions for the U.S. population. The age-adjusted rate for an age group comprised of the ages x through y is calculated using the fol- lowing formula:FIGURE 2GEOGRAPHICAL MAP OF FIVE SELECTED JURISDICTIONS from street addresses or any other spatially refer- enced data such as ZIP codes, parcel lots and address locations. A reference theme is required to geocode individual addresses, such as a road centerline le with address ranges. The individual address locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided in the form of a table or database. The GIS will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address 1 and ends with address 1000. Geocod- ing can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information. Various algorithms are used to help with address matching when the spellings of addresses di er. Address information that a particular entity or organization has data on, such as the post oce, may not entirely match the reference theme. There could be variations in street name spelling, community name, etc. Consequently, the user generally has the ability to make matching criteria more stringent, or to relax those parameters so that more addresses will be mapped. MAPPING COORDINATE SYSTEM Mapping needs a coordinate system for a location and the common is the use of latitude and longitude\u2014the Maryland State Plane Coordinate System is adopted. According to the 1987 version of the Maryland Coordinate System (see gure blow), a point's location is des- ignated by actual distances from two imaginary lines, one running east-west and the other north-south through the point of origin. The 1987 system is metric (although conversion to feet is allowed). The origin of the Maryland Coordinate System has been xed at a point southwest of the state so that all coordinates lie east and north of the imaginary origin. Distance in the east direction is called an Easting; distance north of the origin is called a North- ing. Thus, any point can be identied by two values, or distances, from the origin\u2014an Easting and a Northing. In the mathematical sense of graphs, all Maryland coordinates are in the rst quadrant, which means Easting (\"x values\") and Northings (\"y values\") are positive numbers. GIS MAPPING SOFTWARE ArcGIS Desktop is the primary product used by GIS professionals to compile, use and manage geographic infor- mation. It includes comprehensive professional GIS applications that sup-port a number of GIS tasks, including mapping, data compilation, analysis, geodatabase management and geo-graphic information sharing. ArcGIS Desktop is the platform that GIS professionals use to manage their GIS workflows and projects and to build data, maps, models and applica- tions. It's the starting point and the foundation for deploying GIS across organizations and onto the Web. For this study, we adopted the ArcGIS Desktop 10 (ESRi, 2012) for the geographical mapping. ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop 10 with ArcMap platforms has the industry-recognized, out-of-box spatial analysis tools and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). MAPPING METHOD Most of our geographic mapping in this study used a visual overlay method of several spatial datasets (points, lines, or polygons), which creates a new display, visually similar to stacking two maps of the same region. 101/F.sc/i.sc/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc/s.sc THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF SELECTED JURISDICTIONS Four census variables (population size, percentage of African Ameri- cans/blacks, percentage of residents 25 years or over who attended high school but did not receive a diploma (high school/no diploma) and median household income) that can serve as surrogates for need for primary care were selected and compared across the ve jurisdictions. In addition to the geographical map, a quintile ranking was used to order and compare the ZIP codes by each of four di erent variables. A quintile refers to one-fth of the sample or population. A chart alongside each map displays by jurisdiction a) the number of ZIP codes in the highest or lowest quintile, b) the percent of ZIP codes within the highest or lowest quintile, c) the number of residents associated with those ZIP codes in the highest or lowest quin- tile and d) the percent of residents associated with those ZIP codes in the highest or lowest quintile. For the patient care workforce, the quintile analysis could serve as a method to identify the areas that are in need of primary care. POPULATION First, we compared Prince George's County to other jurisdictions with populations of similar size. The largest county in Maryland is Montgomery, with a population of 971,777. The next four most- populous counties include Prince George's, with a population of 863,420; Baltimore, with a popula- tion of 805,029; Anne Arundel, with a population of 537,656; and Howard, with a population of 287,085. (Note: Baltimore City and Baltimore County are separate entities and Baltimore City is not included in the county's population.) Within these ve jurisdictions, Prince George's County ranked third in percentage of popula- tion residing within top-quintile ZIP codes (ZIP codes with a population greater than 313, 938). Close to half of Prince George's County residents (47.2 percent) are located in these 10 top- quintile ZIP codes (see Figure 3). The Maryland Census data can be obtained from the Maryland State Data Center website, www.mdp.state.md.us/msdc. FIGURE 3GIS ANALYSIS OF POPULATION POPULATION The 2010 Census indicated that the largest ethnic group in Prince George's County is non-Hispanic blacks (63.52 percent). This percentage is greater than the proportion of blacks across the entire state (nearly 30 percent in the 2010 Census) and the proportion of African American/black across the entire nation (12.2 percent) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2011). The geo- graphic analysis indicated that among the ve most-populous jurisdictions, Prince George's County has 29 ZIP codes in the top quintile, i.e., ZIP codes having populations with greater than 39.9 percent of African Americans/ blacks. These 29 ZIP codes consisted of more than half a million residents. Baltimore County ranked second, with six ZIP codes in the top quintile, con-sisting of 84,940 residents. No other jurisdictions had more than three ZIP codes in the top quintile (see Figure 4). FIGURE 4GIS ANALYSIS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN/BLACK POPULATION BY JURISDICTIONS NOTE ** INDICATES THE SUPPRESSED DATA WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE RESIDENTS WAS BELOW SIX 103MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME Prince George's County contains the largest number of ZIP codes (n=15) in the bottom quintile of median house- hold income ($0-50,552), associating with 359,837 residents. Baltimore County ranked second, with 10 ZIP codes in the bottom quintile of median household income ($0-50,552), 369,837 residents were located in these areas. Howard County had only two ZIP codes in the bottom quintile of median household income, with 2,666 residents in these areas (see Figure 5).

Almost 38.8 percent of all households in Prince George's County earned more than $100,000 in 2008 (United States Census Bureau, 2010).HIGH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE, BUT NO DIPLOMA AS THE HIGHEST EDUCATIONAL LEVEL Prince George's County contains the largest number of ZIP codes (n=12) in the top quintile of ZIP codes with high school/no diploma as the highest educational level; 254,046 residents (29.4 percent) are located in these areas. Baltimore County ranked second, with 10 ZIP codes in the top quintile, and 244,934 resi- dents (30.4 percent) in these areas. Residents in Montgomery County and FIGURE 6GIS ANALYSIS OF HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AS THE HIGHEST EDUCATIONAL LEVEL BY JURISDICTIONS 105Howard County had the best edu- cational attainment; these counties had only one ZIP code (1.9 percent of the population, 293 residents) and two ZIP codes (0.9 percent of the population, 2,666 residents) in the top quintile, respectively. The educa-tional level corresponded well with the median household income as reported frequently in the literature. Areas with lower median household income were associated with more residents in top-quintile ZIP codes (see Figure 6).SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS Our analysis indicated that Prince George's County contained the largest number of areas with African Ameri- can/black populations, lower median household income and high school but no diploma as the highest educational level. By computing the ZIP codes with quintiles of all three socio-demographic measures, it was found that Prince George's County contained the highest number of ZIP codes (seven), followed by Baltimore County with two ZIP codes and Howard County with one ZIP code. Anne Arundel and Montgomery had no ZIP codes with all three socio- demographic measures in the risk quintiles. These social and economic dispari- ties appear to negatively impact the access to health care and patient care workforce supply, which will be discussed later. However, in examining the social-demographic characteristics within the Prince George's County, i.e., between inner-Beltway and outer- Beltway areas, one salient point emerged. The county is comparable in terms of the population size and the rates of African American/blacks. However, the median household income and educational level are highly diverse between inner-Beltway resi-dents and the outer-Beltway residents. Residents living in the northern regions of the inner Beltway have the highest poverty rates and lowest educational attainment. Residents living in outer- Beltway areas are substantially more auent and more highly educated. In fact, the GIS could not detect sub- stantial di erences between county residents outside the Beltway and residents in neighboring jurisdictions (Montgomery, Howard and Anne Arun- del) in terms of the median household income and educational level. According to a report released by the U.S. Census Bureau, 20 percent of Prince George's County's eligible population did not have any health insurance as of 2005, the highest rate in Maryland. This translates to more than 150,000 people in Prince George's County who do not have health insur- ance, which also is the highest number in the state. While roughly 76,000 of the uninsured Prince George's patients listed in the census report make less than $25,000 a year, the other half make more, but chose not to have health insurance due to the costs involved (Valentine, 2008).FIGURE 7GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF COMMUNITY FACILITIES Coordinate System: Maryland State facilities are described in the Overview of Public Health Resources technical report. This map (Figure 7) displays the Prince George's County Health Department programs and facilities, the safety net clinics and the hospitals in the County. TWO CASE STUDIES OF HEALTH STATUS USING HOSPITALIZATION DISCHARGE DATA BY JURISDICTIONS The health status of a population reflects its demographic and socio-eco-nomic composition, as well as the need for and e ectiveness of its health care delivery system. We obtained a limited number of hospital discharge data from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). Of the available data, we selected two of the most common conditions, myocardial infarction and asthma, to provide a selected picture of the health status of Prince George's County residents, and to compare their health with the resi- dents in surrounding jurisdictions. We analyzed the health status by rst computing the age-adjusted rates of myocardial infarction and asthma at the ZIP code level, using the U.S. standard population from the 2000 Census. Then we used ArcGIS Desktop to map these rates in order to examine the geospatial clustering of the disease incidence. These clusters are often termed \"disease hot spots.\" The iden-tication of these hot spots will allow investigators to focus on these areas, identify the risk factors associated with the hot spots and implement e ective health care services. This approach could be done for other conditions of interest, including hospital readmis- sions to help with planning a new health delivery system./M.sc/y.sc/o.sc/c.sc/a.sc/r.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/l.sc /i.sc/n.sc/f.sc/a.sc/r.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc We compared age-adjusted myocardial infarction hospital discharge rates for Prince George's County with those in the neighboring Maryland jurisdic-tions. These rates are presented in quintiles in the geographical map by ZIP codes. In addition, we also computed the number and percent of ZIP codes in the top quintile, and the number and percent of residents in these ZIP codes for each county. Figure 8 presents the myocardial infarction age-adjusted rates by jurisdiction and the Maryland average rate. Surprisingly, all ve jurisdiction rates were higher than the Maryland state average (81.8 per 100,000 residents). The rates for these ve jurisdictions ranged from 91.7 to 190.6. The rate for Prince George's County (110.0) was higher than the rate for Montgomery, but lower than the other three jurisdictions (Anne Arundel, Baltimore and Howard).

The map (Figure 9) revealed that three ZIP codes in Prince George's County fell into the fth quintile (i.e., a rate > 183.1) with 29,531 residents. This number was substantially lower than that of Anne Arundel County, where 10 ZIP codes fell into the fth quintile with 244,317 residents (45.4 percent of the county population) and lower than that of Bal- timore County, where 12 ZIP codes fell into the fth quintile with 257,551 (32 percent of the county population)./A.sc/s.sc/t.sc/h.sc/m.sc/a.sc Figure 10 presents the age-adjusted rates of asthma by jurisdiction and the Maryland average rate. Surpris- ingly, four of the ve jurisdiction rates were higher than the Maryland state average (83.8 per 100,000 residents). The rates for these ve jurisdictions FIGURE 9GIS ANALYSIS OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION HOSPITAL rate for Prince George's County (127.4) was higher than the rate of Montgomery County (90.1) and Howard County (74), but lower than Anne Arundel County (137.2) and Baltimore County (233.1). A geographical map of the age- adjusted rates per 100,000 residents was developed at the ZIP code level across ve jurisdictions for a more detailed examination of asthma distri- bution. The map (Figure 11) revealed that ve ZIP codes in Prince George's County fell into the fth quintile (i.e., a rate > 170.3), with 145,851 residents. This number was substantially lower than that of Anne Arundel where seven ZIP codes fell into the fth quintile with 207,018 residents (38.5 percent of the county population) and lower than that of Baltimore County where 16 ZIP codes fell into the fth quintile with 425,190 (52.8 percent of the county population).HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE SUPPLY ANALYSIS One of the objectives of this project was to use GIS mapping to assess the health care workforce and identify the shortage area geospatially. The workforce data included ve categories: active licensed primary care physi- cians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dental care professionals (dentists and dental hygienists), and licensed behavioral and mental health professionals (psychologists, psy- chiatrists, clinical social workers, and counselors and therapists). T o gain a better understanding of the patient care workforce, three analyses were conducted: 1. Computing rates of workforce per 100,000 residents by each jurisdiction as well as the Maryland average to allow comparisons between counties and with the state; 2. Computing rates of workforce per 100,000 residents at each ZIP code level across ve jurisdictions and computing the quintiles. The ZIP codes associated with the rst or rst and second quintiles were identied as well as the total number of residents living in these areas. This step allowed the assessment of di erential levels of primary care provider need, with the lower quintiles reflecting higher need for primary care.

Computing rates of workforce per 100,000 residents at each Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) within Prince George's County. PUMAs are the geographic areas dened by the U.S. Census Bureau. There are seven non-overlapping PUMAs within Prince George's County. Each PUMA contained approximately 100,000 people at the time of the 2000 Census. The seven PUMA boundaries and ZIP code boundaries are presented in Figure 12. The region of Prince George's County located inside Interstate 495,the Beltway, is divided into four PUMAs; the area located outside of the Beltway is divided into three PUMAs. The larger geographic size of PUMAs located outside the Beltway reflects their lower population density.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS In 2010, there were approximately 4,870 active, non-federally employed primary care physicians practicing in Maryland. These included specialists in family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecol- ogy. Of this number, 2,867 practiced in the selected ve jurisdictions and 465 in Prince George's County. The rate of primary care physicians in Prince George's County was the lowest (53.9 per 100,000 residents) among ve jurisdictions. This rate was 30 points lower than the average rate for the state of Maryland (84.4 per 100,000 residents). Anne Arundel County had the second-lowest rate among the ve counties, 66.6 per 100,000 residents. The highest rate belonged to Baltimore County (101.2 per 100,000 residents), which was more than twice the rate of Prince George's County. Montgomery County had the second highest rate, with 94.9 per 100,000 residents (see Figure 13). A geographical map of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents was examined for each ZIP code across the ve counties for a more detailed examination of primary care physi- cian distribution. The map (Figure 14) revealed that 11 ZIP codes areas in Prince George's County fell into the rst and second quintile (i.e., < 9.6 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents) with 138,676 residents. This is con- trasted with neighboring Montgomery County, where 16 ZIP codes were in the rst and second quintiles, with only 87,775 residents.TABLE 1THE NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE BY TYPE AND BY COUNTY Jurisdiction Primary Care PhysiciansPhysician AssistantNurse Practitioner Dental Care Mental Health Anne Arundel 353 378 347 650 894 Baltimore 909 928 622 1023 2431 Howard 221 203 277 573 1060 Montgomery 457 1578 2933 339 209 618 905 TABLE 2THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DENTAL CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE BY COUNTY Jurisdiction Dental Care Mental Health Dentist HygienistSocial Worker Counselor Psychologist Psychiatrist Anne Arundel 339 311 422 303 148 21 Baltimore 634 389 1109 761 381 180Howard 355 218 499 226 286 49 Montgomery 1203 375 1423 502 833 175 Prince George's 470 148 396 364 114 31 FIGURE 13PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN RATE PER 100,000 RESIDENTS BY JURISDICTION, 2010 120 100 6080 40 20 0 ANNE ARUNDEL BALTIMORE HOWARD MONTGOMERY PRINCE GEORGE'S 94.975.2101.266.6 53.9 Maryland JurisdictionRates of Primary Care Physicians a better understanding of how 2,867 primary care physicians were distributed across the ve juris- dictions, a density map was created using various advanced spatial analysis methods. The spatial density of the pri- mary care physicians was determined by the number of physicians normal- ized by the size of the area. The area was dened as a function of the mean nearest area distance. Geographic areas with a density higher than a selected threshold were then circled and displayed on the map. The selected areas represent clusters of primary care physicians. Figure 15 shows that while there were several clusters in each of the jurisdictions, the clusters were smaller for Prince George's County. Identifying these clusters could help investigators examine the underlying FIGURE 14 GIS ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN RATE PER 100,000 RESIDENTS BY JURISDICTION, 2010 113factors associated with the clustering. Figures 16 and 17 present the geographical locations of primary care physicians, overlaid with the age-adjusted myocardial infarction rates and the age-adjusted asthma rates, respectively. These two maps demonstrate the demand for patient care and the supply of the primary care physician workforce. It was apparent that the clustering of primary care phy- sicians did not correspond to the higher rates of myocardial infarction and asthma. For example, the age-adjusted rates of myocardial infarction and asthma were substantially higher than the south region of Montgomery County, but the density of primary care physicians was one of the highest among ve jurisdictions.

However, one inner-Beltway PUMA (4) was substantially higher (51.9 per 100,000 residents) than other inner-Beltway PUMAs, while one outer-Beltway PUMA (6) was substantially lower (18.8 per 100,000 residents) than other outer- Beltway PUMAs (see Figure 18). PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS ( PAS) In 2011, there were approximately 4,560 licensed PAs practicing in Mary- land. Of this number, 2,557 practiced in the ve selected jurisdictions and 339 in Prince George's County. For the county, the rate of physician assistants was the lowest (39.0 per 100,000 residents) among the ve selected jurisdictions. This rate was less than half of the average rate for the state of Maryland (79.0 per 100,000 residents). The rate for Prince George's County was at least 30 rate points lower than the rates for Anne Arundel, Howard and Montgomery counties; it was approximately one-third the rate of Baltimore County (115 per 100,000 residents) (Figure 19). The geographical map of physi- cian assistants per 100,000 residents was examined (Figure 20) for a more detailed analysis of physician assistant workforce distribution by ZIP code level. If we dene the bottom two quintiles of the rates as the areas that had the highest need for primary care (i.e., < 15.6 physician assistants per 100,000 residents), we see that Prince George's County contained 26 ZIP codes (65 percent of all Prince George's County ZIP codes) that fell into these areas, where 572,102 (66.3 percent of all Prince George's County residents) resided. Baltimore County contained 35 ZIP codes in the shortage area, with 396,067 residents (49.2 percent of all Baltimore County residents).

However, one inner- Beltway PUMA (4) was substantially higher (51.9 per 100,000 residents) than other inner-Beltway PUMAs, while one outer-Beltway PUMA (6) was substantially lower (18.8 per 100,000 residents) than other outer- Beltway PUMAs (Figure 21).NURSE PRACTITIONERS In 2011, there were approximately 3,002 licensed nurse practitioners in Maryland. Of this number, 1,930 practiced in ve jurisdictions and 211 in Prince George's County. The geographical map of nurse practitioners per 100,000 residents was examined (Figure 22) for a more detailed analysis of nurse practitioner workforce distribution by ZIP code level. If we dene the bottom two quintiles of the rates as the area in need of primary care (i.e., < 23 nurse practitioners per 100,000 residents), we see that Prince George's County contained 24 ZIP codes (60.0 percent of all Prince George's County ZIP codes) that fell into this area, where 510,554 people (59.1 percent of all Prince George's County residents) resided. Baltimore County contained 20 ZIP codes in this area, with 146,227 residents (18.2 per- cent of all Baltimore County residents). For Prince George's County, the rate of nurse practitioners was the lowest (24.2 per 100,000 residents) among ve jurisdictions. This rate was less than half of the average rate for the state of Maryland (51.5 per 100,000 residents). The rate for Prince George's County was less than one-fourth of the rate for Howard County, which has the highest rate (96.5 per 100,000 residents) among the ve selected jurisdictions (see Figure 23). Within Prince George's County, the rates of nurse practitioners per 100,000 residents were substantially lower for inner-Beltway PUMAs (1, 3, 4 and 7) than outer-Beltway PUMAs (2, 5, and 6). For the inner-Beltway areas, the rates ranged from 4.2 to 11.6, while the outer-Beltway areas had rates from 24.3 to 49.6. T wo inner-Beltway PUMAs (4 and 7) had the lowest rates, 7.9 and 4.2, respectively (Figure 24).FIGURE 21LICENSED PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS, BY PUMA, 2011 Inner Beltway Outer Beltway 80 4060 20 0Rates per 100,000 OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS BY JURISDICTION, 2011 100 6080 40 20 0 ANNE ARUNDEL BALTIMORE HOWARD MONTGOMERY PRINCE GEORGE'S 47.096.577.364.5 24.2 Maryland JurisdictionRates of Nurse Practitioners per 100,000 ResidentsMaryland average = 51.5119FIGURE 23 GIS ANALYSIS OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS BY JURISDICTION, 2011 /G.sc/e.sc/o.sc/g.sc/r.sc/a.sc/p.sc/h.sc/i.sc/c.sc /m.sc/a.sc/p.sc/p.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc120/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc there were approximately 6,651 dental care professionals (4,121 dentists and 2,527 dental hygienists) practicing in Maryland. Of this number, 4,442 practiced in the ve selected jurisdictions and 618 in Prince George's County (470 dentists, 148 hygienists). For Prince George's County, the rate of the combined dental care professionals was the lowest (71.6 per 100,000 residents) among ve jurisdic- tions, and the only county among ve jurisdictions with the rate below the average rate for the state of Maryland (115.2 per 100,000 residents). Anne Arundel County had the second-lowest rate among the ve counties (120.9 per 100,000 residents) which was almost 50 higher than the Prince George's County (Figure 25).

Within Prince George's County, the rates of dental care professionals per 100,000 residents were substantially lower for inner-beltway PUMAs (3, 4 and 7) than for two of the outer- beltway PUMAs (2 and 5). For the inner-beltway areas, the rates ranged from 14.9 to 54.9, while the rates for outer-beltway areas ranged from 61.6 to 82.3. Additionally, the lowest rate in the outer-beltway PUMAs (61.6) was greater than the highest rate in the inner-beltway PUMAs (54.9) (Figure 29).

Of this number, 8,223 practiced in the ve selected jurisdictions and 905 in Prince George's County; 396 social workers, 114 licensed psychologists, 31 psychia- trists and 364 licensed counselors. For Prince George's County, the rates of mental health professionals were the lowest (104.8 per 100,000 residents) among ve jurisdictions. This rate was less than half of the average rate for the state of Maryland (229.8 per 100,000 residents). Anne Arundel County had the second-lowest rate among the ve counties, 166.3 per 100,000 residents, but this rate was 60 points higher than the rate of Prince George's County. All other jurisdictions (Baltimore, Howard and Montgomery counties) had rates that were approximately three times that of Prince George's County (Figure 30). For a more detailed analysis of the mental health professional workforce distribution by ZIP code level, the geographical map of mental health professionals per 100,000 residents was examined (Figure 31). When we dene the bottom quintile of the rates as the high primary care-need area (i.e., < 61 mental health professionals per 100,000 residents), we see that Prince George's County contained 14 ZIP codes (35 percent of all Prince George's County ZIP codes) that fell into this area, where 266,659 people (30.9 percent of all Prince George's County residents) resided. Baltimore County contained eight ZIP codes in this high primary care-need area, with 65,933 residents (8.2 percent of all Baltimore County residents). Within Prince George's County, the rates per 100,000 residents were substantially lower for inner-Beltway PUMAs (1, 3, 4 and 7) than for the outer-Beltway PUMAs (2, 5, and 6). For the inner-Beltway areas, the rates ranged from 37.5 to 81.9, while the rates for the outer-Beltway areas ranged from 107.6 to 169.7. Additionally, the lowest rate in the outer-Beltway PUMAs (107.6) was greater than the highest rate in the inner-Beltway PUMAs (81.9) (see Figure 32).SUMMARY This part of this investigation assessed the distribution of the health care workforce associated with primary care, including: primary care physi-cians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dental care professionals (dentists and dental hygienists), and behavioral and mental health profes- sionals (psychologists, psychiatrists, FIGURE 30RATES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS BY JURISDICTION, 2011 300400 200 100 0 ANNE ARUNDEL BALTIMORE HOWARD MONTGOMERY PRINCE GEORGE'S 301.8369.2302.0166.3 104.8 Maryland JurisdictionRates of Mental Health Professionals per 100,000 ResidentsMaryland average = 229.8FIGURE 29LICENSED DENTAL CARE PROFESSIONALS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS, BY PUMA, 2011 90 80 40506070 20 1030 31 GIS ANALYSIS OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS BY JURISDICTION, 2011 /G.sc/e.sc/o.sc/g.sc/r.sc/a.sc/p.sc/h.sc/i.sc/c.sc /m.sc/a.sc/p.sc/p.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc126/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc and therapists). In addition, this investi- gation assessed the level of primary care need based on quantifying the provider-to-population rates. Three major analyses were con- ducted on Prince George's County and four neighboring counties: \u0099\u0015Between jurisdictions \u0099\u0015Within ZIP Areas (PUMAs) /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc /C.sc/a.sc/r.sc/e.sc /P.sc/h.sc/y.sc/s.sc/i.sc/c.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/s.sc The results indicated that the primary care physician workforce for Prince George's County was substantially less than the neighboring jurisdic- tions. Specically, the rate of primary care physicians for Prince George's County was below the average rate of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents in Maryland, and below any of the four neighboring jurisdictions. When considering the lowest two quintiles as the high primary care- need area, the rate of primary care physicians supply was smaller than or equal to 9.6 per 100,000; 138,677 residents (16.2 percent of the popula- tion) in Prince George's County lived in this area. The overlay geographi- cal analysis case studies indicated that there was a disparity between the primary care physician locations and the rates of myocardial infarc- tion and asthma hospital discharges. Within Prince George's County, some disparities were observed. Overall, the outer-Beltway areas (PUMAs 2, 5, and 6) had higher rates than the inner-Belt- way areas (PUMAs 1, 3, 4 and 7). The average rate of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents in the outer Beltway was about 20 points higher than that of the inner Beltway (66.9 vs. 40.8). It was also noted that inside the Beltway, the rate for PUMA 7 (64.5) was substantially higher than for other PUMAs inside the Beltway, which had rates in the 30s). In the outer Beltway, the rate for PUMA 6 (37.0) was sub- stantially lower than two PUMAs (94.1 and 69.7). /P.sc/h.sc/y.sc/s.sc/i.sc/c.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc /A.sc/s.sc/s.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc/t.sc/s.sc The results physi- cian assistants' workforce for Prince George's County was substantially lower than the neighboring jurisdic- tions. Specically, the rate of physician assistants for Prince George's County was just about half of the Maryland average and at least 30 points below any of the four neighboring jurisdic- tions. Furthermore, when considering the lowest two quintiles as the high primary care-need area, the rate of physician assistants supply was smaller than or equal to 15.6 per 100,000 residents; 572,102 individu- als (66.3 percent of the population) in Prince George's County lived in this area. Overall, the outer-Beltway areas (PUMAs 2, 5 and 6) in Prince George's County had higher rates than the inner-Beltway areas (PUMAs, 1, 3, 4 and 7). However, the rate for PUMA 4 was substantially higher than other PUMAs inside the Beltway and the rate for PUMA 6, in the outer Beltway, was substantially lower than in the other two PUMAs. /N.sc/u.sc/r.sc/s.sc/e.sc /P.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc The results indicated that the nurse practitioners' workforce for Prince George's County was substantially lower than the average for Maryland and the neighboring jurisdictions. The rate of nurse practitioners for Prince George's County was less than half of the Maryland average and at least 30 points below any of the four neighbor- ing jurisdictions. Furthermore, when considering the lowest two quintiles as the high primary care-need area, the rate of nurse practitioners sup- ply was smaller than or equal to 23.0 per 100,000; 510,554 residents (59.1 percent of the population) in Prince George's County lived in this area. All outer-Beltway areas (PUMAs 2, 5 and 6) in Prince George's County had much higher rates than inner- Beltway areas (PUMAs 1, 3, 4 and 7). /D.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /C.sc/a.sc/r.sc/e.sc /P.sc/r.sc/o.sc/f.sc/e.sc/s.sc/s.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/a.sc/l.sc/s.sc The results indicated that the dental care workforce for Prince George's FIGURE 32LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS, BY PUMA, 2011 180 150 306090120 0Rates was substantially lower than the neighboring jurisdictions. There are 470 dentists and 148 dental hygienists in Prince George's County in compari- son to 1,203 dentists and 375 dental hygienists in Montgomery County. Specically, the rate of dental care professionals, when dentists and dental hygienists are combined, for Prince George's County was more than 40 points lower than the Maryland average, and substantially lower than Montgomery and Howard counties. Furthermore, when considering the lowest two quintiles of dental care professionals as the high primary care need Prince George's County has a more substantial proportion of its residents living in this areas, 419.780 residents (48.6 percent of all Prince George's County residents), as compared with Baltimore County with 270,042 residents (33.6 percent of all Baltimore County residents). Only 5.9 percent of Montgomery County's population falls within these same two quintiles. Overall, the outer- Beltway areas (PUMAs 2, 5 and 6) in Prince George's County had higher rates than the inner-Beltway areas (PUMAs 1, 3, 4 and 7). However, the rate for PUMA 1 is higher than for other PUMAs inside the Beltway. /M.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /H.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc /P.sc/r.sc/o.sc/f.sc/e.sc/s.sc/s.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/a.sc/l.sc/s.sc The results indicated that the mental health workforce for Prince George's County was substantially lower than the neighboring jurisdictions. Spe- cically, the rate of mental health professionals for Prince George's County was less than half of the Maryland average and was about 200 points below any of the three neighbor- ing jurisdictions (Baltimore, Howard and Montgomery). Furthermore, when considering the lowest quintile as the high primary care-need area, the rate of mental health professionals supply was smaller than or equal to 61.1 per 100,000 residents; 266,659 residents (30.9 percent of the population) in Prince George's County lived in this area.

However, the current study expanded on previous studies by including the full range of primary care health care workforce categories, provided an analysis at the ZIP code level, and applied geospatial mapping to investigate the areas of high primary care need and the variations within PUMAs. Prince George's County has a substantially lower number and ratio of primary care physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, dental care professionals and mental health professionals compared with neighboring jurisdictions. The areas that are more affected appear in the inner-Beltway PUMAs, where a large proportion of lower-income African American/blacks and Hispanics reside, than in the outer-Beltway PUMAs (See Tables 1 and 2). Even within Prince George's County, there were disparities across ZIP codes. The Prince George's County ZIP code areas that fell within the Beltway (inside the yellow line in Figure 31.) generally had lower rates than ZIP code areas lying outside the Beltway (see T able 3). T o contribute to discus- sions about primary care health care workforce need, we also applied the HRSA provider-to-population ratios for Health Professions Shortage Areas at the PUMA level for primary care physi- cians (1:2,000), dentists (1:3,000) and mental health professionals, as mea- sured by psychiatrists alone (1:10,000). (HRSA, 2011). T able 4 reflects the ndings of this assessment. Although the study did not attempt to investigate the reasons for these dis- parities, the literature suggested that economic factors in the region might influence the recruitment and retention of this professional workforce. Health care workers\u2014particularly those pro- viding direct services\u2014may face many issues related to safety and work ben- ets in their work environments. The lack of having teaching hospitals with an academic aliation also may con- tribute to this challenge of recruitment and retention. These factors should be carefully studied in future assess- ments of the health care workforce. They should also be considered in any attempts to understand why Prince George's County had substantially lower rates of health care workers than other comparable counties in Maryland. Figure 31 presents an integrated map of Prince George's County consisting of three and readmis- sions; 2) demographics of education and median household income and 3) the geographical distribution of health care workforce of primary care physicians, psychiatrists and dentists. LIMITATIONS The ZIP code-level data analysis may provide more detailed sub-county-level information, but it is not without limitations. Some ZIP codes located in the sparsely popu- lated areas of the county have a small number of residents and are thus more likely to have no patient care profes- sionals providing care in the area. As a result, the rate computed for such areas is zero. On the other hand, if it happens that one or a few patient care professionals do provide services in these areas, the resulting rate could be FIGURE 33 INTEGRATED MAP OF PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY CONSISTS OF HOSPITAL DISCHARGES AND READMISSIONS; EDUCATION AND MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME; AND THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE 129unrealistically high. These zeros and inflated rates may become \"noise\" for the true pattern of the rates of patient care workforce computation and for the geographical mapping. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS The ZIP code-level patient care workforce data analysis may be compared to the health professional shortage areas (HPSAs), medically underserved areas (MUAs) and medically underserved populations (MUPs). Currently, the HPSA data is based on the census tracts, which do not match with the ZIP code areas, making it dicult to combine the patient care workforce data with HPSAs without the alignment with the ZIP code. Future studies may also consider the socioeconomic index in relation to geographical mapping and the patient care workforce. Multiple density clustering\u2014i.e., clusters of residents, clusters of patients and clusters of the patient care work- force\u2014may also be considered. PUMAs are generally useful in categorizing regions within Prince George's County. However, since each PUMA consists of more than 100,000 residents, the sub-county-level analysis of patient care workforce by PUMA may lose some necessary granularity. Breaking some or all of the PUMAs down into two to three regions might better illustrate the socio-demographic prole of the residents and the supply of the patient care workforce. In the past, the denition of active physicians varied from study to study, making the results incomparable. Our denition of active physicians was perhaps more stringent than in other studies. Though the physician counts appeared to be smaller than that of the previous reports, our study could reflect more of the true patient care workforce. In the future, the tallying of physicians and other applied patient care workforce may be standardized so that studies on Maryland's patient care workforce can be compared across years.TABLE 3THE RATES OF HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE PER 100,000 POPULATION BY TYPE AND BY PUMA FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Region Primary CarePhysician AssistantNurse Practitioner DentistDental Hygienist Mental 17.3 11.6 54.9 15.4 81.9 PUMA3 36.4 21.4 2.1 59.9PUMA4 30.8 51.9 7.9 15.9 4.4 65.9 PUMA7 64.5 14.6 4.2 37.5 THREE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE WORKERS NEEDED BY PUMA , PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Region Current PCP neededCurrent dentist countNumber of dentists neededCurrent psychiatrist countNumber of psychiatrists needed Inner Beltway PUMA1 37 15 57 0 3 7 PUMA3 34 13 21 10 4 5 PUMA4 35 22 17 21 2 9 PUMA7 62 0 43 0 1 9 Outer Beltway PUMA2 102 0 85 0 9 2 PUMA5 128 0 151 0 7 11 PUMA6 67 24 Retrieved from psychology.about.com/ od/ psychotherapy/f/ psychvspsych.htm.

Initial identication of counts of primary care professionals was provided for physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, dental hygienists, social workers, psychologists, and counselors and therapists. (See T echnical Report on Physician Counts and T echnical Report on Geographic Mapping and Primary Care Providers) 2. We used Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) as the geographic footprint in County. This approach, rather than using ZIP code provider ratio data, was recommended by DHMH (Oce of Primary Care). We adjusted the PUMAs to ensure that estimated populations capture County residents, given that some ZIP codes overlap geographic boundaries with other counties.3. For projections we focus only on the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) categories for primary care providers: medical (primary care physicians), dental (dentists), and mental health (core mental health providers and/ or psychiatrists). 4. Specic approach for each category of health providers follows: 4.1 Primary care physicians are dened by four specialties (general or family practice; pediatrics; internal medicine; and obstetrics and gynecology). Similar to HRSA, we have counted only non-federal physicians (of medicine and osteopathy) providing direct patient care; and do not include physicians who participate solely in teaching, research and/ or administration without practice. Unlike HRSA we have not fractionated the hours per physician. Our count includes physicians who report practicing 20 hours or more a week. Each such physician is considered \"a count.\" Unlike HRSA, we have not included interns and residents; we include all physicians who have designed Prince George's County as a primary practice location. T o ensure quality of care, we only count physicians who report being Board Certied in their respective specialties. This is not mentioned in the HRSA guidance. Physicians who are counted are those who have a practice in the county. This could be a primary or secondary practice.4.2 Dentists include any licensed dentist in the County. Most dentists are general practitioners, so no attempt was made to separate general practitioners from specialists. 4.3 Mental health workers were reviewed in two ways: a. Board certied psychiatrists, or b. Core Mental Health Provid- ers, dened as Board certied psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and therapists/ counselors. We use a modication of the HRSA denition of \"core mental health professionals,\" minus psychiatric nurse specialists, for our initial assessment. The HRSA denition from Criteria for Mental Health HPSA states: \"Core mental health profes- sionals or core professionals includes those psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse specialists, and marriage and family therapists...\" c. We did two assessments: a separate assessment for psychiatrists alone and then a second, for the aggregated core mental health profession- als that include psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers and marriage and family therapists (as noted from HRSA above). In our state data base we have one list for therapists and counsel- ors for the latter. 133Personal Communication with sta at Oce of Primary Care, DHMH regarding general approach; and for advice on how to approach mental health workers. 5. The HRSA criteria for provider to population ratios used to designate a Health Professions Shortage Area were reviewed: 5.1 Primary Medical Care HPSA includes a: Ratio of at least 1:3,500, or a Ratio of greater than 1:3,000 if there are other \"high needs for primary care services, or insucient capacity of existing primary care providers.\" 5.2 Dental HPSA includes a: Ratio of at least 1:5,000, or a Ratio of worse than 1:4,000 and with unusually high needs for dental services as shortage 5.3 Mental Health HPSA The HRSA criteria for mental health providers are not clear. We got advice from DHMH to proceed with looking at both provider categories and ratio levels. For ratios: T o determine a need we used 1: 30,000 and worse for a shortage of psychiatrists alone; and 1:10,000 and worse for the core mental health professionals. Ratios in item #5 were obtained ratios as \"meeting the need for primary care providers\" with were obtained from HRSA site: bhpr.hrsa.gov/ shortage accessed 5/31/12 7. Logic for identifying \"Need\" for primary care providers 7.1 We considered immediate need; not a projected future need. 7.2 We acknowledge, but do not separate specialties within the primary care physician category. 7.3 Need is based on 2010 population census 7.4 We do not adjust according to population practices, but acknowledge them. 7.5 We recognize that provider counts needed may change over time depending upon provider mix, but acknowledge that this is not taken into account for this exercise. 8. We applied the aforementioned approach to create Map A in Section 1 that identies ZIP codes with three levels of primary care physician ratios.9. We also applied the aforementioned approach and used the ratios from item #6 to develop our estimation of need for each of the three provider categories. The resulting table is presented in Section I in response to the identication of primary care workforce need by geographic area. The additional counts needed are based on the number needed to add to the base counts in order to reach the respective recommended ratio for each PUMA. Using the seven PUMAs in the County we identied the count of each category of health provider and determined the additional count needed to reach the ratio considered to be sucient: 1:2,000 for primary care physicians; 1:3,000 for dentists; and 1:10,000 for core mental health providers. Where the existing base counts were sucient to meet the recommended ratio, no additional workforce counts are noted. We then added the individual PUMA specic additional counts needed to reach the total additional count needed for that sub-county level. While we did not nd a shortage using \"core mental health providers\" we did when only psychiatrists were used. This area warrants further study. /Z.sc/i.sc/p.sc /C.sc/o.sc/d.sc/e.sc/s.sc /w.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc /H.sc/i.sc/g.sc/h.sc /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc \u2014 /C.sc/a.sc/r.sc/e.sc /N.sc/e.sc/e.sc/d.sc T o determine geographic areas that reflect high primary care need we developed an algorithm using work- force, health care and population factors applied at the ZIP code level. These categories and respective criteria selected are ones that have been shown to be associated with primary care, such as the ratio of primary care providers to population. Hospi- tal events, such as the proportion of discharges that were considered ambu- latory of 30 day readmissions, reflect care that could have been averted and managed outside the hospital within a primary care network. Finally population characteristics, such as education and income levels, have been associated with lower levels of health and low levels of recommended health care utilization. We provide our rationale and approach for each of these factors and for the algorithm. We stress that we view this assessment as preliminary and a complement to the assessment of primary care physician to popula- tion ratios provided in Map A. Three categories of criteria were used to esti- mate primary care need in the County by ZIP codes. Better health outcomes have been demonstrated when the number of primary care physicians is sucient to serve a given population. We applied one of the criteria that Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) uses to designate Health Pro- fessions Shortage Areas as described earlier. HRSA designates a geographic area with a primary care physician to population ratio of at least 1:3,500 or worse as a shortage area, while a ratio of 1:2,000 is viewed as sucient. If this ratio is equal to or worse than the equivalent to one provider to 3,500 individuals, then we viewed this area having a primary physician shortage area. If the ratio is equal to or better than the equivalent to one provider to 2,000 individuals, then we viewed this area as having sucient primary care physicians. Ratios that fall within these two parameters are considered at risk for a shortage of providers. We used ZIP code level data from two hospital events for County resi- dents: an index that captures hospital discharges for conditions that are ambulatory care sensitive, referred to as the Prevention Quality Indicator (PQI) and the 30-day readmission rate. Both of these events reflect the level of primary care capacity in the com- munity. High rates are associated with lower primary care capacity. We used values at or above the average rate for each of these factors as indicating a primary care need. These data come from T echnical Report 6. The average rate for the PQI is 20.2 and for the 30-day readmission rate is 10% (.10). For the population characteristics we used the median income for each ZIP code population and education. Educa- tion was dened by the criteria of the proportion of individuals 25 years of age or older who attended high school but did not receive a diploma. If the ZIP code population was equal to or higher than the average for the County we considered this to reflect lower educa- tional attainment. For income we used the median income for the County as an indicator. If the median income for the ZIP code was equal to or lower than the median income for the County we considered this to be low income. A summary of the criteria for each of these categories follows: Primary Care Physicians, derive provider-to-population (/P.sc/C.sc/P.sc) ratio per /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code and use: \u0099\u0015PCP worse than 1:3,500 ratio for High Need, and \u0099\u0015PCP worse than 1:2,000 but better than 1:3,500 for T rending to High Need, Hospital Events: \u0099\u0015PQI for ZIP code is 20% or greater (20.2% is average for County Zip codes 2007-2009), and \u0099\u001530 Day Readmission for ZIP code is 10% or greater (10% is average for County Zip codes 2007-2009). Population Characteristics: \u0099\u0015ZIP code percent of population 25 years and older who attended high school but did not get a diploma is 10.5% or greater than 10.5%, and \u0099\u0015ZIP code median family income is $58,353 or lower. These categories and respective criteria were then applied according to the following algorithms to dene need for primary care: High Need HIGH NEED = PCP worse than 1:3,500 PLUS one or both of PQI or Readmis- sion PLUS one or both of education and income Trending to /H.sc/I.sc/G.sc/H.sc /N.sc/E.sc/E.sc/D.sc (approaching highest need for primary care): T rending to HIGH NEED = PCP worse than 1:2,000 but better than 1:3,500 PLUS one or both of PQI or Readmission PLUS one or both of education/income /M.sc/E.sc/D.sc/I.sc/U.sc/M.sc /N.sc/E.sc/E.sc/D.sc (has several indicators of need in each of two of three catego- ries, but not in all): MEDIUM NEED = PCP worse than 1:2,000 but better than 1:3,500 PLUS one or both of PQI or Readmission OR one or both of education/income /A.sc/D.sc/E.sc/Q.sc/U.sc/A.sc/T.sc/E.sc (appears to be able to meet primary care need) ADEQUATE = None of the criteria used to determine need were met. The following table documents Prince George's County ZIP code specic data for each of the ve factors and identies the outcome of applying the algorithm we developed to identify primary care need. This includes: High Need, T rending to High Need, Medium Need, Some Need (with presence (+) 135or absence (-) of the three categories delineated), and Adequate. We used these designations to create Map B in Section I. /F.sc/i.sc/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc/s.sc Applying this approach, seven ZIP codes fall into the High Need category: Aquasco, Brandywine, Bladensburg, Mount Rainier, Capital Heights, District Heights and one ZIP code of Hyattsville. Three additional ZIP codes are trending toward High Need: these include two more ZIP codes in Hyattsville and one in Oxon Hill. Areas of Medium Need have been identied for 7 ZIP codes. Of the remaining ZIP codes, all but two (Beltsville and one part of Bowie) have a low ratio of primary care physicians to population, but do not meet any of the other criteria used for this assess- ment. For this analysis, these two areas fall within the trending to Medium Need category. However, if decisions are to be made solely on provider to population ratios, these two areas would fall in a higher need category. /L.sc/i.sc/m.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc Our algorithm is a crude measure and does not give weights to the di erent factors. It also does not assess other measures of primary care need such as infant mortality rates or availability of safety net clinics.

Segal, M.P.H., MUrS the answer of the question, \"What resources can be mobilized in the public health sector to complement the impact of the health care system?,\" we undertook a high-level overview of Prince George's County public and public health- sector resources. We interpreted this question to reflect both existing and potential public health-sector resources that could be mobilized to complement the impact of the health care system. The design of a new health care system requires we extend and link with existing resources that provide support to population health. It also o ers the opportunity to review the basic func- tions of public health in light of a new system design. Support for population health depends on the expertise and services that underpin these basic functions: assessment, policy develop- ment and assurance. This support also includes the full scope of services, from clinical comprehensive or specialty health care services, screening and referral programs to health education and counseling services. Ideally the decision as to which resources in the public health sector to mobilize and how they can be mobilized should be considered at the initial stages of the design of a new health care system. This would permit integrated system planning dedicated to identifying programmatic foci of a new system and to activities that contribute to improvement in the priority health out- comes. It also would permit a review of the capacity of basic public health functions to support an enhanced and modied new system. The result would be the mobilization of a tailored set of resources to complement the system's e ectiveness and reach. We also have interpreted this question to include population health improvement as a focus of the impact. The opportunities and challenges related to partnerships and linkages among public health and medicine have received renewed interest. The focus on population health is a centerpiece of public health practice and programs. The recent health care reform initia- tives and legislation have reinforced the need to address population health, not just the health of individuals who seek care. Stine and Chokshi (2012) highlight the opportunity for these partnerships to address population health in an era of economic austerity and use the resulting partnerships to provide more ecient and cost-e ec- tive services and care. These authors highlight Maryland's State Health Improvement Process as one example of an \"e ective collaboration between health systems and public health departments.\" This state resource and the County's Health Improvement Plan provide the foundational processes and documents for collaboration support and accountability. The denition of integrating primary care and public health is well-stated in the IOM Report, \"Primary Care and Public Health: Explor- ing Integration to Improve Population Health (IOM, 2012)\": \"The linkage of programs and activities to promote overall eciency and e ectiveness and achieve gains in population health.\" This report also provides a framework that denes the spectrum of degrees of integration. Ultimately, awareness of existing and needed public health- sector resources in the context of the overall health care system redesign should facilitate e ective partnerships. /M.sc/e.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/d.sc/s.sc Within the parameters of this study, we took a preliminary step in captur- ing a high-level \"snapshot\", as of early 2012, of traditional public health-sector programs, programs that service vulnerable populations and programs that support the public's ability to maintain their health and quality of life in Prince George's County. This techni- cal report is designed to give a \"flavor\" of the scope of resources, primarily those that are situated within the public sector and are of importance to population health throughout the lifes-pan. They are designed to be used as a 139basis for determining which categories should be pursued for an in-depth assessment of capacity and ability to be mobilized. A more specic look at the behavioral and mental health programs available in the County and a brief summary of the dental programs is provided. Subsequent steps would require targeted discussions with and among entities in the County. This would need to be followed by detailed assessments of selected resources in order to delineate capacity and ability to be mobilized. We believe this assessment will best be done in tandem with the programs identied for the new system. We used the following approach to identify and categorize the resources:\u0099\u0015We focused on resources that are available to individuals who are most at risk for prevalent health conditions as well as resources that are available to all County residents that do not require additional eligibility. In addition, emphasis was placed on resources that support health promotion, disease prevention and early diagnosis and care, rather than tertiary care. \u0099\u0015A detailed search was conducted, primarily Internet-based, to identify and determine the scope of services for all entities providing the delineated range of health and health-related services. \u0099\u0015Members of the advisory committee were asked to provide suggestions for inclusion. These suggestions were incorporated into the appropriate categories and reports. \u0099\u0015All identied entities and their specic addresses are identied by street address and select entities are mapped and included in T echnical Report #3 to permit review by geographic area and type. In addition, the geographic locations of the safety net clinics were used as part of the econometric model found in T echnical Report #6. /F.sc/i.sc/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc/s.sc The County includes a broad array of programs that provide services to specic populations and contribute to the general wellness and quality of life of all County residents. These programs and resources are included: \u0099\u0015Prince George's County Health Department Services \u0099\u0015Safety net programs \u0099\u0015Hospital community health benet activities \u0099\u0015Behavioral and mental health facilities and programs \u0099\u0015Prince George's County School programs/services \u0099\u0015Nursing homes and long-term care facilities\u0099\u0015Department of Parks and Recreation \u0099\u0015University of Maryland Extension We recognize that the academic and community-related programs in the County provided by Bowie State University, Prince George's County Community College and the University of Maryland, College Park campus are an asset. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT The mission of Prince George's County Health Department (PGCHD) is \"to protect the public's health, assure avail- ability of and access to quality health care services and promote individual and community responsibility for the prevention of disease, injury and dis- ability.\" (PGCHD, 2012) PGCHD serves as the County's public health sector centerpiece and provides a broad range of programs and services to County residents. The programs o ered by the PGCHD are housed in 11 locations dispersed throughout the County. T able 1 and T able 2 identify the programs, by name, according to the primary population or condition being addressed. These programs reflect the identied needs of the County and the commitment made to support maternal and child health, address substance use and mental health, and infectious diseases. The majority of the programs and services provide general screening and refer-ral, health education and counseling services, and about one-third provide clinical care. In addition to the PGCHD pro- grams, there are four School-Based Wellness Centers under the auspices of the department. These centers provide comprehensive social and health services and are located in four of the County's public high schools: Northwestern High School and Oxon Hill High School. The goal is to \"make students avail- able for learning by promoting health, preventing disease, and reducing behavioral risks.\" (PGCHD, 2011). Services include physical examina- tion, laboratory testing, mental health counseling, treatment of common illnesses, gynecological care, on-site screening/treatment of sexually transmitted infections, dental care and immunizations. The Prince George's County Health Improvement Plan 2011 to 2014 sets the agenda for the \"Blueprint for a Healthier County.\" (PGCHD, 2011) This plan and the PGCHD programs provide the basis for identifying resources that can be mobilized to support a new health care system. Our study of 13 comparable health care systems reveals that public health departments and federally qualied community health centers were mentioned most often by the 13 interviewed health care systems as potential public health resources that can be mobilized to complement the health care system's impact on health outcomes. It is interesting that many of the health systems mentioned public health departments as complemen- tary sources of funding, despite the funding cuts currently underway by federal, state and local governments to public health programs. This means that health systems still expect public health departments to fulll their pub- lic health missions despite the funding cuts. Interviews with the systems pro- vided additional evidence of the value of these community health centers. The di erent health systems have many creative ideas when it comes to mobilizing public health resources that may be useful for Prince George's County to take into consideration when designing their new health system. Some of these are already part of the state-supported initiatives, such as funding that comes from a state tobacco tax and the receipt of the Community T ransformation Grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene now holds). Other initiatives included: a state health department- sponsored Chronic Care Initiative that requires insurers to participate; an integrated, collaborative system or community coalition with community TABLE 1PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS BY POPULATION Population Program Infants Healthy Start Program Infant at Risk Program Infants and T oddlers Program Children/T eens Care for Kids Program Dental Health ProgramHealthy T eens and Young Adult CenterHealthy T eens Center Immunization Program Oasis Youth ServicesOperation Safe Kids Youth and Community Services Program Women\u2014Maternity Dental Health Services Regional Access Centers T apestry Program Women\u2014General Breast and Cervical Cancer Program Healthy Women/Healthy Lives Maternal Health and Family Planning Family Food Protection ProgramHealthline Medical Assistance for Families Women, Infants and Children Adults Cancer Prevention, Education, Screening and T reatment Program (CPEST) Medical Assistance T ransportation (MAT) The Cheverly Adult Services Program Seniors Adult Evaluation and Review Services Division of Adult and Geriatric Health141health centers; partnering with school systems and employers; and local news media health awareness campaigns. SAFETY NET PROGRAMS Safety net programs provide a criti- cal role in the health care delivery system, providing primary care health services to vulnerable and uninsured or underinsured populations. These programs involve federal designation and include designation of medically underserved areas and populations (MUA/MUP) and designation of health professional shortage areas (HPSAs). Such designations identify areas of high need and allow communities to request providers through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and establish- ment of certication of facilities such as qualied health centers (FQHCs) or FQHC \"look-alike\" cen- ters. In addition, state governors can designate areas using state criteria and data approved by the federal govern- ment. The latter are primarily used by rural health clinics. T able 3 identi- es the programs for the safety nets that are provided by Prince George's County hospitals. T able 4 provides the names and locations of the traditional safety net clinics in the County. Prince George's County has been shown to have a low capacity for providing safety-net care apart from hospital and emergency room care (Lurie et al. 2009). This is in part due to shortages in primary care physicians in poor areas of the County (Lurie et al. 2008). Until 2012, the County had six MUA/MUPs, and was the only County in the state with multiple MUPs (MDHMH, 2010). In early 2012 two more areas were designated. The County has only one FQHC (Greater Baden Medical Services) that has multiple locations. In addi-tion, two other FQHCs located outside the County, Mary's Center (based in the District of Columbia) and Community Clinic, Inc. (based in Montgomery County) have estab- lished clinical sites within the County. T able 4 provides the locations of these centers and clinics. In addition, the ministries in the County and a few non-prots provide services to unin- sured and underinsured individuals. The health care systems we inter- viewed highlighted the importance of federally qualied health centers (FQHCs) in providing primary care to underserved populations. The Aordable Care Act (ACA) contains provisions to expand FQHCs. Given the magnitude of the uninsured population in the County, it is clear resources must be invested into expanding community health centers. OUTPATIENT AND COMMUNI - TY PROGRAMS OFFERED BY HOSPITALS TO THE PUBLIC: A LOOK AT COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORTS As a result of the limited safety net, the burden of the uninsured and underin- sured extends to the hospitals in the County, particularly Prince George's County Hospital. Programs for the community and that contribute to the TABLE 2PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS BY CONDITION/TOPIC Condition/Topic Program ControlEpidemiology HIV/AIDS Program (HAP) Sexually T ransmitted Disease (STD) Control ProgramSuburban Maryland Ryan White Part A Administrative Agency T uberculosis Control Program Substance Abuse/ Mental HealthAlcohol and Other Drugs Prevention ProgramAssessment and Case Management Services Division of Addictions and Mental Health Southern Region Addictions Substance Abuse Services T obacco Cessation ProgramT obacco Use Prevention, Cessation and Enforcement Environment/ Emergency PreparednessCommunicable and Vector Borne Disease Control Division of Environmental Health Environmental Engineering ProgramPlan Review/Institutions also provided by the ve hospitals in the County. Of these, Dimensions Healthcare oversees two hospitals (Laurel Hospital and Prince George's Hospital) and the Bowie Health Clinic. The latter provides 24-hour, urgent-care services. The ser- vices noted by hospitals include health promotion and education programs tailored to health risk reduction, patient support groups, health screenings, immunization programs and commu- nity outreach and education materials. Community benet reports are provided by each hospital in the state and provide a glimpse into the invest- ment and types of programs o ered by hospitals. Reports from each Maryland hospital are collected by the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC). This process was initiated by the Maryland General Assembly in 2001(Chapter 178 of the 2001 Laws of Maryland, and codied under Health-General Article %19-303 of the Maryland Annotated Code) and the FY 2010 reports reflect the seventh year of this practice. Community benet is dened by the Maryland law as \"an activity that is intended to address community needs and priorities primarily through disease prevention and improvement of health status, including: health services provided to vulnerable or underserved populations; nancial or in-kind support of public health programs; donations of funds, property, or other resources that contribute to a community priority; health care cost containment activities; and health education screening and prevention services.\" (HSCRC, 2011). The same report states that com- munity benets should meet the following criteria: \"Ultimately improve the health status and well being of spe- cic populations in the organization's service area who are known to have diculty accessing care and/ or who have chronic needs; generate a low or TABLE 3PROGRAMS FOR THE SAFETY NET PROVIDED BY PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HOSPITALS Hospital Description of Services Prince George's Hospital CenterCommunity support and outreach Partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs Emergency psychiatric services Inpatient behavioral health treatment Sta is comprised of psychiatrists, counselors, dietitians, pharmacists and social workers.

Currently, the guidelines for reporting community benets for hospitals are being revised to incor- porate aspects of the ACA. T able 6 is a summary of FY 2010 Prince George's County hospital com- munity benet reports and T able 7 summarizes the programs that are provided by these hospitals. Consideration should be given to partnerships among the hospitals and the County health department to support a shared County-wide assess- ment and a common planning process in order to support coordination and reinforcement of evidence-based pro- grams aligned with community needs. This approach would be cost-e ective, promote use of evidence-based inter- ventions and truly begin to address population health. In addition, given the fact that a large proportion of residents frequent hospitals in the surrounding jurisdictions, consideration also should be given to extending an aspect of that partnership to those hospitals as well. BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES Behavioral and mental health pro- grams are available in all hospitals and through the private sector health care providers. The latter capacity is presented as part of the paper \"Identi- cation of Geographic Areas of Need for Primary Care.\" The rates of licensed provider categories for psychiatrists, clinical social workers, therapists/TABLE 4TRADITIONAL SAFETY NET CLINICS IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY FQHC Clinic Greater Baden Medical Services, Inc.* Five 3028 Brightseat Rd., Glenarden, MD 20706 Heights, 20743 Oxon Hill Floor, 7450 Albert Rd., 2nd Center 8908 Riggs Rd., Hyattsville, Community Clinic, Inc T wo Locations: 9001 Edmonston Road, Suite 40, Greenbelt, MD 20770 Pregnancy Aid Center 4780 Erie Street, College Park, MD, 20742 *Greater Baden Medical Services is the only County-based FQHC in Prince George's County.

The County's Department of Family Services, Mental Health and Disabili- ties Division provides leadership for the \"development and institution of a diverse, comprehensive and accessible array of high quality public mental health services\" (PGCDFS, 2011). These services embrace the contribu- tions that citizens with disabilities bring to the Prince George's County commu- nity. Additionally, the division oversees all public mental health services and monitors the related programs and mental health professionals in this system. The County's safety net facilities include behavioral and/ or mental health services. Also identied are several non-governmental entities (NGOs) that are free-standing and provide services that vary widely in their scope. Because of the interest in identifying the scope of behavioral and mental health services, we provide specic contact information and an inventory of facilities derived from the County as well as our review. T able 8 provides the names and contact information for the identied facili- ties. In addition to the facilities listed in the latter table, clinical services are provided by Greater Baden Medi- cal Services, Inc. and Mary's Center provides mental health services. A thorough review of the behav- ioral and mental health capacity of the County beyond the identication of facilities and providers is recom- mended. The review will need to take into account the multidisciplinary nature of the provider groups involved in the provision of behavioral and mental health services, the diversity of the leadership and accountability of the programs and facilities planning and providing services and outreach programs, the mental health needs of the community, and the proposed enhanced mental health training of pri- mary care providers (State of Maryland and Governor's Workforce Investment Board, 2011). Ultimately, the challenge is to develop a detailed plan for integra- tion of behavioral and mental health and primary care. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY DENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND PROGRAMS The County was the home of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old boy who died in 2007 due to a dental infection that was not managed. The factors contributing to his tragic death are complex, but the solution would have been simple since we know how to prevent tooth decay. Maryland responded swiftly in response to Deamonte's death and took immediate legislative and TABLE 6SUMMARY OF FY 2010 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HOSPITAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORTS Hospital EmployeesTotal Sta Hours in CB OperationsTotal Hospital Operating ExpenseTotal Community BenetTotal CB as % of Total Operating ExpenseFY2010 Amount in Rates for Charity Care, DME and NSPITotal Net CB minus charity care, DME, NSPI in Rates Total Net CB (minus charity care, DME, NSPI in Rates) as % of Operating ExpenseCB Reported Charity CareReported Contact with Local Health Department Score hospital did not provide the number of employees in its FY 2010 CB report, therefore the number reported is from the FY 2009 report. **rounded to the nearest whole number145programmatic action. A special issue of the Journal of Public Health Dentistry (Horowitz & Kleinman, 2012; Vargas, Casper, Altema-Johnson, Kolasny, 2012, Thuku, Carulli, Costello & Goodman, 2012) documents the state's e orts in addressing oral health of the popula- tion and includes recommendations and lessons from other states and national perspectives. Five years later there still is a major need for resources to provide evidence-based preventive and health promotion services and programs to the dentally uninsured and underinsured in this County (this is usually three times greater than the percent of medically uninsured). The County health department and e orts of professional organizations and practicing dental professionals provide select programs. The Prince George's County Health Department, Dental Health Program operates one facility in the Cheverly Health Center, located centrally in the County. The clinic houses ve opera- tories and sta includes Program Chief Dr. Debony Hughes, one PTE dental hygienist, one PTE general dentist, one PTE pediatric dentist and two dental assistants. Funding from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has provided programmatic fees for the pediatric residents from Howard University College of Dentistry to rotate through the clinic one day per week. The Dental Health Program provides education and comprehen- sive dental treatment to all children 0 to 18 years of age and pregnant women. The program accepts children and pregnant women enrolled in the Maryland Healthy Smiles Program and the uninsured on a sliding scale fee. The program also receives Ryan White funding to provide dental care to those residents living with HIV / AIDS. Educa- tional programs are presented in the Prince George's County Public School System, during National Children's Dental Health Month and throughout the school year, emphasizing the rela-tionship of good oral health to overall good health. Collaborations are in place with several organizations to reach beyond the walls of our clinic to engage com- munities and vulnerable populations in our mission to improve oral health. The Deamonte Driver Dental Van Project and the Howard University College of Dentistry are two of these organiza- tions whose presence has provided delivery and dissemination of dental services and education to the most needed populations of the County.

In addition, schools provide eligible children with free lunch programs, and school principals and teachers have partnered with a broad range of sectors, including health care, to o er pro- grams beyond the routine curriculum. The school system provides a natural link between families and teachers, between communities and the public education sector. Finally, school build- ings o er the community another site for community-based events.The Prince George's County Public Schools system (PGCPS) is admin- istered at the County level and is overseen by the Maryland State Department of Education. The system includes 107 elementary schools, 24 middle schools and 24 high schools. The Board of Education of Prince George's County's mission is \"to advance the achievement of its diverse student body through community engagement, sound policy governance, accountability, and scal responsibil- ity.\" (Prince George's County Board of Education, 2010a). The PGCPS invests in the capacity and professional development of its health-related sta . As an example, in the 2009-10 school year, the PGCPS system conducted 16 hours of professional sta development with 225 school nurses and other allied health professionals on critical areas of medical need, inclusive of but not limited to, diabetes, case manage- ment, delegation and blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the County hired and conducted orientation for 35 professional school-registered nurses, trained 38 non-licensed individuals who were certied as medication technicians, and provided training for 78 participants who completed the renewal class as medication technicians (Prince George's County Board of Education, 2010b). The PGCPS partners with County academic programs and supports the development of the health care work- force pipeline. The schools served as a clinical practicum sites for 155 nursing students from Prince George's Commu- nity College and 20 nursing students from Bowie State University. Many county schools have a reg- istered nurse assigned to them and a few have additional providers such as psychologists, speech pathologists and occupational therapists. Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 provide a prole of the distribution of these providers by level of school: elementary, middle school and high school. The elementary schools have the greatest diversity of providers. As noted earlier, there are four School-based Wellness Centers (SBWCs) located in four high schools. Since schools have nurse health FIGURE 1PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY SYSTEM\u2014ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SERVICES School Nurse School Psychologist Guidance Counselor Speech Language Pathologist Professional School CounselorHealth Sta Community OutreachOccupational Therapist 9 104 FIGURE 2PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY SYSTEM\u2014ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SERVICES 100120 80 60 1 1 2 11 10732 149oces, they o er the opportunity to expand to become community/school- based health centers in the future as additional federal resources become available. All schools are part of the American Heart Association-Dell Foun- dation-Clinton Foundation Alliance for a Healthier Generation. The schools also provide Medicaid services to IEP and IFSP eligibles. For example, Frances Fuchs Early Childhood Center has more than 500 preschool age-children with special needs enrolled and receiving a variety of services. Also, it is worth noting that Dimensions Healthcare originally had the contract with PGCPS to operate SBWCs, now managed by the health department. NURSING HOMES AND HOME HEALTH CENTERS Nursing homes and home health centers provide institutional and home-based services for the elderly and for special needs populations. There are 20 nursing home facilities in the County (T able 9). They cover a wide spectrum of services that include respite and rehabilitative services and may include outpatient rehabilitative services. For example, Gladys Spellman Speciality Hospital is located at Laurel Regional and focuses primarily on very sick patients. Southern Maryland Hos- pital has a subacute care center that oers a number of services. The Prince George's County Senior Care Program provides services for seniors who may be at risk for nursing home placement. Older adults can access publicly funded services, or if they are not available, the sta will make arrangements with private vendors. Services can include personal care, chore, adult daycare, nancial help for medications, medical supplies, respite care, home-delivered meals, emergency response system, transportation and others. Home health centers provide nursing services, home health aides, and one or more other services such as physical therapy, occupational therapy and social services. Most often, the health care sta may provide care based on the needs of clients and families. Home health centers participate in the Medicare program and many health insurance programs include a home health benet. A physician referral is often required and a medical reason is regularly needed for these services to be reimbursed by Medicare or insur- ance. Home health care is suitable whenever a person prefers to stay at home, but needs ongoing care that cannot simply be provided by fam- ily and friends. T able 10 includes 14 entities that provide a varying range of home health services. Most include FIGURE 3PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY SYSTEM\u2014MIDDLE SCHOOL SERVICES 0 0 0 0 FIGURE 4PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY SYSTEM\u2014HIGH SCHOOL SERVICES care and many provide additional specialty services such as diabetic management, cardiac and oncologic care management, physical and occupational therapy and nutrition management. There are opportunities for the County to look at options with federal monies to support innovative programs for special need popula- tions, such as cash and counseling and money follows the person. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY PARKS AND RECREATION Prince George's County has more than 26,000 acres of Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC) parkland. Approximately one-third has been developed to provide active and passive recreation opportunities. There are approxi- mately 46 miles of paved hiker/biker/ equestrian trails that run throughout M-NCPPC's park system. Additionally, tness trails, hiking trails, walking loop trails and nature trails are also located in neighborhood and community parks. There are several community centers that are part of the County's parks and recreation programs. They provide a rich array of health improvement pro- grams. These include tness centers, classes, nutrition, cooking, and a variety of programs geared to seniors, ado- lescents, child care, etc. These centers provide a substantial opportunity to incorporate health promotion as well as clinical services. Many of these centers are incorporated in schools or are adjacent to schools that add additional health promotion and wellness oppor- tunities for school-based wellness and community health centers. Parks and other recreational facilities provide access to residents throughout the northern, central and southern parts of the County. Each area is sta ed by a maintenance crew that cares for the parks and facilities, an inclusion specialist who assists citizens with spe- cial needs and a coordinator who works with the community centers to provide programs for teens and preteens. Prince George's County Parks and Recreation sites are divided into three areas: Northern (Laurel, Beltsville, Berwyn Heights, College Park, River- dale Langley Park, Greenbelt, New Carrollton, Landover Mitchell- ville, District Heights, Landover, Seat Pleasant, Capitol Heights, Fairmont Heights, Forestville and Glenarden); and Southern (Marlow Heights, Forest TABLE 9PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY NURSING HOMES FACILITIES Name of Institution Location No. of Beds Bradford Oaks Center 7520 Surratts Road, Clinton MD, 20735 180 Cherry Lane Nursing Center 9001 Cherry Lane, Laurel, MD 20708 155 Clinton Nursing and Rehabilitation 9211 Stuart Lane, Clinton, MD 20735 267 Collington East West Highway, Riverdale, MD, 20737 140 Forestville Health & Rehabilitation Center 7420 Marlboro Pike, Forestville, MD 20747 160 Fort Washington Health and Rehabilitation 12021 Livingston Road, Fort Washington, MD 20744 150Future Care Pineview 9106 Pine View Lane, Clinton, MD 20735 192 Gladys Spellman Specialty Hospital at Laurel Regional Hospital7300 Van Dusen, Laurel, MD 20707 61 Heartland Health -Adelphi MD Riggs Road, Hyattsville, MD 20783 160HillHaven Nursing Center 3200 Powder Mill Rd., Adelphi, MD 20783 66 Larkin Chase Care and Rehabilitation Center 15005 Health Center Drive, Bowie, MD 20716 120 Magnolia Center Nursing Home 8200 Good Luck Road, Lanham, MD 20706 104 ManorCare Health Services - Largo 600 Largo Road, Glenarden, MD 20774 130 Patuxent River Health and Rehabilitation 14200 Laurel Park Drive, Laurel, MD, 20707 177 Sacred Heart Home INC. 5805 Queens Chapel Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782 100 St. Thomas More Medical Complex 4922 LaSalle Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782 250Subacute Care Center Southern Maryland 7503 Surratts Road, Clinton, MD 20735 24 Villa Rosa Nursing Home, Inc 3800 Lottsford Brandywine, emple Hills, Upper Marlboro and Morningside) (PGCPRD, 2012). MARYLAND EXTENSION University of Maryland Extension- Prince George's County (UME) has been a leader and partner in imple- menting programs throughout the County that address obesity; food inse- curity; low levels of tness; unhealthy diets for youth, families and senior citizens; best practices in conservation and nutrient management; and signa- ture programs in outdoor education. The programs include: Nutrition and Finance Educa- tion programs target underserved and high-risk families, especially those with young children: \u0099\u0015Food/space.tabStamp/space.tabNutrition/space.tabEducation/space.tab (FSNE)/space.tabprogram (SNAP-ED at the federal level) has four nutrition educators, two assigned to the County health department and two at the Center for Educational Partnership (CEP) in Riverdale. \u0099\u0015Expanded/space.tabFoods/space.taband/space.tabEducation/space.tabProgram/space.tab(EFNEP) includes seven local nutrition educators housed at the CEP and working throughout the County.

Agriculture includes the Master Gar- dener Volunteer program, Agriculture Marketing and Nutrient Management advising. Major programs include Grow It, Eat It, Preserve It; Sheridan Street Community garden; Farmers' Market support; educational programs for the general public through libraries, schools and churches; Bay Wise Certication; and development of best practices for landowners in the areas of conserva- tion and nutrient runo . Extension also supports economic development in the urban and rural areas of the community as it pertains to food and farms. Extension collaborates with many organizations including M-NCPPC (Healthy Heights, Extreme T eens and Community Centers), Prince George's County Public Schools (Alliance for a Healthier Generation, individual schools at all levels), Head Start, Judy Hoyer Centers, County Memorial Library System, municipal governments and County government departments. UME also supports school and community gardens and oer advice to homeowners, farm- ers and businesses as requested. HIGHER EDUCATION ACADEMIC RESOURCES IN THE COUNTY The County has a number of higher education academic resources that contribute to health and wellness capacity. In addition, health professions students from University of Maryland, Baltimore have also rotated through sites in the County. These programs include health provider and public health workforce training, continu- ing education as well as research and service programs. The health care systems we inter- viewed had two innovative programs that included academic partners and could serve as models. One program involved a partnership between the academic health care system and a community-based clinic to establish a medical home with case managers for the under- and uninsured. This program was successful in achiev- ing cost savings and improvements in quality of care. Another system formed a community-wide \"Nurse Advice Line\" in collaboration with the public health department, managed- care organizations and the university, and operated in both rural and urban areas. This Nurse Advice Line helped the state health department identify illnesses statewide and resulted in decreased emergency department vis- its, increased medical homes and better coordination of HOME HEALTH CENTERS Name of Institution, Contact Information Description of Services Americare In-Home Nursing 10905 Fort Washington Road, Suite 300 Fort Washington, MD 20744Orthopedic rehabilitation Cardiac Care Program Diabetic management Pain management Wound care management Joint replacement program Fall prevention program Oncology care program Observation and assessment Chronic disease management Southern Maryland Hospital 10403 Hospital Drive, Suite G-9 Clinton, MD 20735Home health aide Occupational therapist Registered nurse Social worker Speech therapist Specialty Areas: Certied wound ostomy nurse on sta Nutritionist on sta Wound-care certied Orthopedics Diabetes education Cardiac-related diagnosis Wound ostomy, continence Medstar Health, Vna, Inc. 4061 Powder Mill Road, Suite 500 Beltsville, MD 20705Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech therapy Home health aide Nursing care Professional Healthcare Resources, Inc. 4429 Forbes Boulevard Lanham, MD 20706Clinical assessment and monitoring Wound care Intravenous therapy Psychiatric nursing Diabetic care and services Cardiac care services Comprehensive patient and caregiver education Physical or occupational therapy Nutritional counseling Revival Homecare Agency 4810 Saint Barnabas Road T emple Hills, MD 20748Home health aid Medical social Medicare Nursing care Occupational therapy Physical therapy Speech pathologyAdventist Home Care Services 12041 Bourneeld Way, Suite B Silver Spring, MD 20904Adult nursing for: Diabetes mellitus Coronary artery disease ( CAD) Congestive heart ( Chronic Obstructive ( COPD) Decubitus wound care Ostomy care Indwelling urinary catheters Diabetes Management: Assessment of patient's condition Instruction of patients and families on monitoring blood glucose levels Dietary counseling and meal planning Medication teaching Awareness of drug interaction T reatment of feet and other skin issues Circulatory needs Meal planning Assessment for need of adaptive equipment and occupational therapy Coordination of community services: Medication management, ostomy care, cardiac nursing, maternal and child care, wound care, pediatric nursing, lactation support, phototherapy Amedisys Home Health Care 12510 Prosperity Drive, Suite 350, Silver Spring, MD 20904Home-based skilled nursing Rehabilitation Chronic disease management Amedisys Home Health Care\u2014Largo Location 1401 Mercantile Lane, Suite 351 Largo, MD 20774Home-based skilled nursing Rehabilitation Chronic disease management First Health Care Network 1408 Golf Course Drive Bowie, MD 20721Non-medical home care Personal care services Homemaker services Respite care services Hospice care services153Maryland Healthcare Services 4810 Saint Barnabas Road T emple Hills, MD 20748Deal with the following illnesses: Congestive heart failure Unstable angina Unstable blood pressure Osteoarthritis Osteoporosis Rheumatoid arthritis Pneumonia Anemia Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD) Stroke Bowel disorders Diverticulitis Fractures Post-operative surgery Parkinson's Disease Multiple Sclerosis Urinary retention Uncontrollable blood sugar\u2014diabetes Home Call of Prince George's County 1408 Golf Course Drive Bowie, MD 20721Nursing care Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech pathology Medical social and home health aide services Specialty Care Services 4810 Saint Barnabas Road T emple Hills, MD 20748Wound care management Diabetic management and care Cardiac/respiratory care Post-operative care Nutrition therapy Safety measures and universal precautions Medication management T ube feeding Injections Angels of Mercy Home Health Care Services LLC 99 Commerce Place, Suite 100 Largo, MD 20772Elderly care or geriatric care Personal care services Nursing procedures (vital signs monitoring, wound care, IV Therapy, etc.) Assistance with daily living activities Home-bound status Bedside care (temporary, intermittent or long-term careFamily and Nursing Care 8555 16th Street, Suite 101 Silver Spring, MD 20910Alzheimer's Disease Parkinson's Disease Cancer Hospice dare Dementia Diabetes Heart disease Stroke Depression Provide skilled nursing for: Medication management Diabetes management T ube feeding Wound care Injections Ostomy care Also provide activities of daily living, companionship, mobility assistance and other support services Homewatch Caregivers 6475 New Hampshire Avenue, Suite 304 Hyattsville, MD 20783Dementia care Elder care for chronic conditions such as (diabetes, Parkinson's, stroke, ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, heart disease and lung disease) Elderly care such as travel assistance, hospital review reveals that the County has many assets that are directed to health and wellness of its residents. These are imbedded in public health sector programs as well as in public sector programs that support education, social services and recreation. Upon cursory review, the public health sector programs in the County appear to be aligned with lifestage and special population needs and with health conditions identied in the County Health Improvement Plan. However, this snapshot also reinforces what other reports have emphasized: The County safety net clinics are severely limited in size and number and are not resourced to meet the current needs of the community. T wo new fed- eral designated medically underserved areas were added to the County this year. T o achieve success of any health care system, there must be an invest- ment to fulll and manage the County's safety net needs. This is the most critical and the rst factor to remedy. The hospital community benet reports reveal the burden of charitable care provided by Prince George's County Hospital that extends the safety net. We used secondary data to identify the existence and range of services provided by these programs. The existing capacity of these facilities and programs to meet the disease prevention and disease management demands of populations in need was not directly reviewed. Prior to consider- ing the mobilization of specic public health resources, a critical review of current program and clinical care struc- ture, process and outcomes is needed in light of the plans for the design of a new health care system and in the context of the priority health outcomes to be improved. The capacity for delivering the basic public health functions of assessment, policy development and assurance must be given priority in this review. These functions must be in place to serve the public health sector and to serve as a hub for the coordination and interaction of health and health care programs within the overall system. This type of review should be tailored to determine which, whether and how existing programs can be expanded or modied to address the health outcome priorities and complement the impact of the health care system, espe- cially in the context of the state health care reform innovations and mandates. Ultimately this review would provide the basis for determining the actual scal, workforce, Health Information T echnology (HIT) and programmatic investments needed to reach a level capacity to meet the current health needs of uninsured and underinsured County residents. The continuation of existing partnerships and the forging of new ones would be benecial. Emerg- ing multi-sectoral coalitions, like the County's Health Care Coalition, o er opportunities to communicate across organizational borders and enrich health and wellness for County resi- dents through proactive coordination of services and activities. T echnical Report #2 noted that partnerships were viewed as an approach for tackling wellness and prevention goals such as the County government, schools and wellness programs working together to prevent obesity and tobacco use. The stakeholders from this report also men- tioned collaboration opportunities by co-sponsoring events with community- based organizations, employers in the County and religious organizations. Novel approaches, such as those implemented by other systems, should guide the integration of public health sector and health-system programs for population health (See T echnical Report: Interviews with Professionals in Model Health Care Systems). We appreciate the input from leadership and sta from the County Executive's Oces and from the Prince George's County Health Department. In addition, we would like to acknowledge the meetings and input from the leadership and sta of the Maryland Extension programs and Prince George's County Parks and Recreation Services.155/R.sc/e.sc/f.sc/e.sc/r.sc/e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc Adashi, E.Y., Geiger, H.J., & Fine, M.D. (2010).

Oral health trends in Maryland. Journal of Public Health Dentistry, the Public Health Impact Study of Prince George's County, a series of studies were conducted to contribute to the understanding of hospital, health care and community population elements of a health care system that may contribute to the improvement of selected health outcomes. These studies provide both descriptive and analytic ndings of the hospital use of Prince George's County residents and of the hospitals they frequent. They were designed to complement the work of groups, beyond that of the School of Public Health, who are contributing to the design phase of the regional health care system and primarily focused on select hospital encounters of County residents. The econometric model informing this section was designed to primarily provide answers to the question, \"What elements of a health care system (hos-pital and community) can a ect key health outcomes and by how much?\" Secondarily, the model provides insights of relevance to all of the ques-tions posed by the advisory committee. The model was designed to integrate data from multiple sources to reflect eects of di erent aspects of the health care system on hospital discharges. The model provides a look at the macro level of the health care system and also allows flexibility to explore how health system and other factors a ect discharges for each major disease or condition di erently. A critical component of access to health care is the receipt of timely and eective primary care to prevent dis- ease, manage chronic illness and treat acute illness at an early stage to avoid hospitalization (Delia, 2003; Ansari, Laditka, and Laditka, 2006). The sup-ply of primary care physicians, nurse practitioners and safety net clinics are known components of access. Primary care physician supply is associated with improved health outcomes (Macinko, Stareld & Shi, 2007). Areas with higher concentrations of physician supply have been found to have fewer ambulatory care, sensitive discharges than areas with lower supply (Laditka, Laditka, and Probst, 2005), but this relationship does not hold true (Krakauer, Jacoby, Millman & Lukom-nik, 1996; Epstein, health char- acteristics of Prince George's County residents, access and capacity of the County's health care system, and patterns of hospital and emergency department use have been reported in extensive detail (Lurie, Harris, Shih, Ruder, Price, Martin et al., 2009). The results from this econometric model are critical for taking the next steps to analyze the associations between these local characteristics and inpatient dis-charges for key health outcomes. The econometric model estimates the sta-tistically signicant relationships that are essential to understand in order to improve the County's health care system. It is not enough to know the ratios per 1,000 residents of primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and safety net clinics in the County; it is imperative to understand how these health system factors are related to discharges for key health outcomes. Once we begin to understand the inner workings of these relationships, stakeholders in Prince George's County are able to focus on the factors that have the most signicant impact. The outline of this section is as follows: This section rst describes the data used in the analysis, then details the empirical method-ology and concludes with an analysis of discharge data. 159/h.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc /D.sc/a.sc/t.sc/a.sc A number of databases and data sources were used to dene elements of the community, the hospital health care system and of the community health care system. The primary data source was data for scal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 acquired from the Health Services Cost Review Com-mission (HSCRC) and the District of Columbia Hospital Association (DCHA) containing discharge data for Prince George's County residents. Discharges were from 59 hospitals located in Prince George's County, Montgomery County, Baltimore County, Anne Arundel County, the District of Columbia and a variety of other hospi-tals in the state of Maryland. The data included the following elds: indicator for Maryland or D.C. hospital, year, /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code, city, sex, age, race, hospital, where admitted from, visit type, discharge status, Interna-tional Classication of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9) primary diagnosis, ICD-9 secondary diagnosis, primary payer, total charges, hospital division, All Patient Rened Diagnosis code (APR), APR description, Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) and DRG description. There were no unique patient identi-ers in the data set. A variety of data sources were used to collect information on /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes, Maryland health care workforce, hospi-tal characteristics and readmissions for each /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code. /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code population data for 2000 and 2010 were collected from the Bureau of Census Population Data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). These data were used to assess population growth within each /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code in Prince George's County and to project popula-tion growth into 2022 for the hospital discharge 10-year projections. Maryland Health Workforce Data described in the geographic mapping section of this report were used for this analysis. We include a measure of the ratio of board-certied primary care physicians, a ratio of nurse practitio-ners and a ratio of physician assistants at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level per 1,000 resi-dents. Data on the 59 hospitals' total discharges (not limited to discharges of only Prince George's County residents) for scal year 2010 were collected from the American Hospital Directory web-site (www.ahd.com). One of the major limitations of the HSCRC and DCHA discharge data is that it did not include unique identiers, so readmission rates for individuals in the data could not be calculated. Readmission rates at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level were supplied by the Mary-land Health Care Commission sta from their analysis of HSCRC discharge abstract data for scal years 2008 and 2009 (personal communication, Je Johnson). SAMPLE SIZE The initial data set of 297,117 discharges included approxi-mately 100,000 discharges for each scal year, with D.C. hospitals report-ing roughly one quarter of discharges for Prince George's County residents (T able 1). Data were missing for a number of each of the elds. /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code data were coded as zero, 77777 or 99999 for 171 observations, so those observations were dropped as they could not be mapped to additional data on Prince George's County residents (Appendix). /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes that were for counties outside of Prince George's County (primarily representing D.C. and Montgomery County) were also dropped, reducing the sample by an additional 3,191 dis-charges. Discharges that had a /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code assigned to a post oce rather than a residential area were reassigned the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code value for the geographic area sur-rounding the post oce. The hospital name was missing for 1,725 discharges, so those observations were dropped as well. In order to maximize information from the data, di erent sample sizes were used for di erent analyses. T ables at the discharge level of analysis that did not require information on gender, primary diagnosis code and payer information used a large sample that included observations missing those data (n=292,030). For the regression models, discharges missing a primary diagnosis code (1,988) and payer information (5,623) were excluded. The resulting dataset for the regression models had a sample size of 284,402 discharges. TABLE 1 DISCHARGE DATA PER FISCAL YEAR, MARYLAND AND D.C. Fiscal Year Maryland D.C. Total 2007 71,201 commonly used indicator of access to primary care and its overall e ec- tiveness is the number of ambulatory care-sensitive admissions within a given population (Ansari, Laditka, & Laditka 2006). The Agency for Health-care Research and Quality (AHRQ) has developed measures of health care quality that make use of readily available hospital inpatient administra-tive data. Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) identify ambulatory care-sensi-tive hospital admissions in geographic areas that evidence suggests may have been avoided through access to high-quality outpatient care (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2012a). Access to good outpatient care and early intervention can potentially prevent these ambulatory care-sensi-tive conditions. AHRQ states that these indicators provide insight into the community health care system and services outside the hospital setting (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2012b). The ambulatory care-sensitive discharges can be used as a screening tool to help flag potential health care quality problem areas that need further research and investigation. Ambulatory care-sensitive discharges measured by PQIs provide a check on primary care access or outpatient services in a community by using patient data found in a hospital discharge abstract (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2012b). These data help public health agencies, state data organiza-tions and health care systems improve health care quality in their communi-ties. This analysis used the March 2012 technical specications. AHRQ provides an algorithm to identify these ambulatory care-sen-sitive PQIs at the County level, using County-level discharges of each of the identied conditions in the numerator, and County population as the denomi-nator. AHRQ clearly species that the denominator is based on the County of patient residence, not the County of the hospital. We modify their calculation to include /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-level discharge counts for each of the relevant indicators in the numerator, and /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-level popula-tion counts from the 2010 U.S. Census in the denominator. The purpose of the PQI, or ambulatory care-sensitive dis-charge, analysis is to show geographic variation in discharges that could have been prevented with better access to outpatient care. Our analysis focuses on those indicators reflecting chronic disease that are most aligned with the key health outcomes of interest for the public health impact assessment.The ambulatory care-sensitive condi- tions that we examine in the analysis represent key health outcomes that are chronic conditions\u2014those most amenable to an improved health care delivery system. These include the diabetes short-term complications admission rate, diabetes long-term complications admission rate, the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma in older adults admission rate, asthma in younger adults admission rate, hypertension admission rate, heart failure admis-sion rate, angina without procedure admissions rate, uncontrolled diabetes admission rate, and an indicator for a discharge with any of these admission types. The PQI ambulatory care-sensitive discharge measure excludes transfers from a hospital (transfers from a skilled nursing facility are not identied in the data). The public health impact assessment is primarily concerned about factors that a ect discharges for specic diag- noses, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, that could be avoided altogether if treated in a more appropriate outpatient setting. ICD-9 codes were used to identify these diag-noses from the primary diagnosis code in the discharge data and to generate the PQI ratios. /V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/b.sc/l.sc/e.sc/s.sc Key variables in the model include ambulatory care-sensitive hospitaliza-tions per 1,000 residents, readmissions within 30 days, health care workforce capacity (physicians, physician as-sistants, nurse practitioners and safety net clinics), and patient and population characteristics. The analyses include sex, age, race/ ethnicity and propor-tion of the population at or below the federal poverty level (/F.sc/P.sc/L.sc) at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level (Epstein, 2001; Delia, 2003). Data for Prince George's County are from the U.S. Census for 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). We classify race/ ethnicity at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level in categories that include non-Hispanic white and minority. Minority includes Hispanic, black and other, where other includes American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacic Islander, some other race and two or more races. White is the refer-ence category in the analyses. Due to 161/h.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc missing 2010 Census data on /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes 20601, 20607, 20608 and 20613, data from 2000 are used instead. Poverty is included as the proportion of the popu-lation at or below the federal poverty level, as measured by the 2000 U.S. Census (2010 data were not available at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level as of April, 2012). In preliminary analyses using age categories, also from U.S. Census data, of under age 18, age 18 to 44 (reference category), 45 to 64, and 65 and older, only the over 65 category was signi-cant. T o keep the model parsimonious, we include age over 65, with under age 65 as the referent category. Sex is mea-sured by the proportion of females in each /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code; males are the reference category. Ambulatory-sensitive conditions were dened using several of the AHRQ PQIs, and were analyzed indi-vidually in the econometric models as the outcome variable. The ICD-9 codes TABLE 2AMBULATORY SENSITIVE CONDITIONS DEFINITIONS AND SAMPLE MEANS Prevention Quality Indicator (PQI) Description ICD-9 Codes for Numerator AgePercent of Prince George's County Resident DischargesCount PQI Prince George's rate25002 25003 18+ 0.2 527 15 Asthma size excludes those with missing data on hospital locations, sex, primary diagnosis and primary payer. N=284,402 All PQIs are ratios per 1,000 residents of the numerators described above divided by the ZIP code population. Asthma in younger adults admission rate includes age 40, as does asthma in older adults, resulting in an overlap of discharges Procedure codes were not included in the discharge data, so PQIs requiring procedure codes (hypertension, heart failure and angina) do not exclude by procedure code, which are described in T able 2. The PQIs we measured that indicate ambulatory sensitive visits for chronic conditions include diabetes short-term complications admissions rate, diabetes long-term complications admissions rate, COPD or asthma in older adults admission rate, hyperten-sion admissions rate, heart failure admissions rate, angina without pro-cedure admissions rate, uncontrolled diabetes admissions rate, asthma in younger adults admissions rate, and an indicator for any of the above ambulatory care-sensitive conditions admissions rate. The count for each type of discharge was divided by the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code population and pre-sented as a rate per 1,000 residents. Procedure data were not available in the discharge data set, so the condi-tions that exclude cases with a cardiac procedure code (hypertension, heart failure and angina) may be over-esti-mated. Discharges with an indicator that they were transfers from other hospitals were excluded. These conditions and the respec- tive hospital encounters provide a picture of the management of care and discharges within hospitals as well as the capacity of the relationship between hospitals and community-based primary care. We did not include all conditions dened as ambulatory care-sensitive, rather we selected a subset that aligned with several key health outcomes. /A.sc/n.sc/a.sc/l.sc/y.sc/s.sc/i.sc/s.sc Using the aforementioned data sources including discharges, characteristics of the hospitals and local health system factors, data were merged in at both the hospital and patient /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code levels. We used this merged data le to model the dynamic e ects of \"what if\" sce- narios for each of the conditions, such as the potential impacts of changes in elements such as health care workforce supply on discharges, as well as project the impact of these changes out into the future. We applied the model using a macro-level approach in order to address the relationship between the various outcomes at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level, and overall system and population characteristics. We used the lens of specic conditions for a more specic assessment of any discharge for an ambulatory care-sensitive condition, as well as each identied ambulatory care-sensitive condition in turn and for the 30-day readmissions rate. Ordinary Least Squares linear proba- bility models were estimated to analyze the relationship between community, hospital and /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-level factors and discharges for specic diagnoses. The macro-level approach analyzes /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-level data on PQI discharges. Data from 2007, 2008 and 2009 are aggregated to increase sample size for the ratios (Epstein, 2001). The models are constrained by the sample size at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level, since there are only 36 /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes in Prince George's County. Therefore robust regression models were also estimated. Robust regression is an alternative to least squares regres-sion when data may be contaminated by outliers get a more detailed view of resident hospital experiences and their impact on hospitals in the County and the surrounding area, we pursued answers to several questions. Where do Prince George's County residents go for hos-pital inpatient care? For those residents using County hospitals, what propor-tion of all hospital discharges and inpatient days did residents represent? This information allows planners to view the impact of resident patterns of use, and raises questions about who comprises the remaining patients that use the County hospitals and estimate what proportion of hospital discharges for other jurisdictions County residents represent. The answers to the latter questions would provide useful infor-mation for planning a regional center of excellence as well as for forging formal regional partnerships among hospitals.Aggregate discharge data for 2007, 2008 and 2009 are displayed in T able 3 to provide the distribution of discharges of Prince George's County residents across hospitals in Prince George's County, D.C., Montgom-ery County, Anne Arundel County, Baltimore County and numerous other hospitals in the state of Maryland. Only 45.5 percent of discharges for Prince George's County residents are 163/h.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc from Prince George's County hospitals. Dimensions Healthcare hospitals were on the low and high ends of the spec-trum, with Laurel Regional accounting for 4.5 percent of discharges of Prince George's County residents and Prince George's Hospital Center accounting for 14.1 percent, the highest of any of the County's hospitals.The majority of County residents are discharged from hospitals in the region outside of the County. D.C. hospitals represent 26.3 per-cent of County resident discharges, with Washington Hospital Center accounting for 10.2 percent of County residents' discharges. Providence Hospital accounted for 4.3 percent of discharges, Children's National Medical Center for 4.0 percent and the remaining hospitals for 2.5 percent or less. Montgomery County hospitals account for 19.0 percent of County residents' discharges; Holy Cross Hospital represents 9.5 percent of total discharges and Washington Adventist Hospital accounts for 8 percent.

Hospitals in Baltimore account for 3.7 percent of discharges for Prince George's County residents, Anne Arundel hospitals for 3.7 percent and hospitals in the other counties of Maryland account for the remaining 1.9 percent of County discharges. There were no dominant hospitals in the Baltimore area, whereas in Anne Arundel County, Anne Arundel Medical Center represented the bulk of the discharges with 3.5 percent. The remaining hospitals in the Maryland area, such as Civista Medical Center (0.7 percent) and Howard County Gen-eral Hospital (0.7 percent) represented a very small fraction of the Prince George's County resident discharges. There is signicant variation in payer type across jurisdictions (T able 4), with discharges from Prince George's County hospitals reflect-ing the payer mix representative of safety net hospitals. Approximately two-thirds of discharges from Prince George's County hospitals are reim-bursed by Medicare (34.6 percent), Medicaid (16.9 percent) or self-pay/uninsured (7.3 percent), with only an average of one-third of the discharges reimbursed by private payers (32.3 percent). Discharges from hospitals in D.C., Montgomery County, Balti-more County, Anne Arundel County and other jurisdictions in Maryland had a larger proportion of discharges from private payment sources, and lesser proportions reimbursed by Medicaid, Medicare and self pay-ment. Montgomery County hospitals average payer mix was 53.3 percent of discharges reimbursed by private insurance, 16.9 percent by Medicaid, 23.0 percent by Medicare, 6.1 percent paid out of pocket by the uninsured and 0.7 percent were categorized as other payer. D.C. area hospitals average was 49.1 percent by private payer, 21.2 percent by Medicaid, 23.3 percent by Medicare, 6.1 percent by the uninsured and 0.7 percent by other sources. Aver-age payer mix for Baltimore County and the other grouped Maryland hospitals closely mirrored that of D.C. Anne Arundel County hospitals had a signicantly higher share of private pay discharges than any of the other jurisdictions, with 62.3 percent of them reimbursed by private payers. There was also signicant variation within jurisdictions. In Prince George's County, Fort Washington Hospital had the highest proportion of reimburse-ment by private payers at 41.2 percent, whereas Prince George's Hospital Center had the lowest proportion at 24.0 percent. Prince George's Hospital Center had 47.1 percent of discharges reimbursed by Medicaid, relative to only 3.8 percent at Fort Washington Hospital. All hospitals had a signicant share of discharges reimbursed by Medicare, ranging from 20.7 percent at Prince George's Hospital Center to 44.7 percent at Doctors Community Hospital. The uninsured accounted for a high of 10.6 percent of discharges at Fort Washington Hospital and a low of 6.3 percent at Laurel Regional Medical Center. Prince George's County hospitals serve out-of-County patients as well as its own residents; the extent to which those patients account for their total discharges varies by hospital. Hospital-reported scal year 2010 total discharges were used with s-cal year 2009 discharges for Prince George's County from the HSCRC data for County residents to estimate the percent of each hospital's discharges that are for County residents (These are estimates since the discharge data base sample size is reduced due TABLE 4ESTIMATED PERCENT OF PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HOSPITAL DISCHARGES THAT ARE FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY RESIDENTS Hospital 2009 actual 2010 actual*Prince George's residents/total^ Doctors Community Hospital inpatient days 43,691 # inpatient days days inpatient 2009 inpatient discharge data from HSCRC and DCHA Includes data on all discharges even those missing data on primary payer, etc. * Data from American Hospital Directory for scal year 2010 ending June 30, 2010.

These calculations are presented in T able 4. Prince George's County residents account for an estimated 85 percent of discharges from Doctors Community Hospital. County residents represent about 73 percent of discharges from Fort Washington Medical Center, 63 percent from Laurel Regional Hospital, 88 percent of Prince George's Hospital Center, and 74 percent of Southern Maryland Hospital. There is signicant variation in hospital capacity in the County. In terms of discharges, South-ern Maryland Hospital (13,825), Prince George's Hospital Center (13,815) and Doctors Community Hospital (10,598) had signicantly more discharges than Laurel Regional Hospital (4,330) and Fort Washington Medical Cen-ter (2,243) in 2009. This variation is expected since bed size varies con-siderably for these hospitals.

The ndings for specic hospitals within Prince George's County reflect the undue burden of Medicaid patients on Dimensions Healthcare hospitals com-pared with other County hospitals. The data also reflect ndings from previous studies that residents who have the capacity to pay for care are using ser-vices outside the County (Lurie, Harris, Shih, Ruder, Price, Martin et al., 2009). In order to assess what hospital/ health care and community population elements of the health care system can a ect health outcomes, such as those identied as having high impact if improved, we focused on the propor-tion of hospital encounters that fall within the ambulatory care-sensitive condition category. In this manner we explored the association of selected elements with hospital for each ambulatory care-sensitive PQI measure were detailed in T able 2. Diabetes-short term compli-cations admissions were 0.5 percent, or 1,355 discharges, and diabetes long-term complications admissions were 0.9 percent (2,474 of discharges). COPD or asthma in older adults was the primary diagnosis for 4,069 discharges or 1.4 percent of County resident's discharges. Hypertension was the primary diagnosis for 0.6 per-cent of discharges (1,816), heart failure for 2.8 percent (8,097), angina for 0.4 percent (1,143), uncontrolled diabetes for 0.2 percent (527) and asthma in younger adults for 0.2 percent or 492 discharges. Any ambulatory care-sensitive condition indicated by one of the above PQIs was also included as a variable; this indicator accounted for 7.0 percent (19,973) of discharges. By looking at this subset ambulatory care-sensitive conditions and learning about associations with community popula-tion and health care elements, we can begin to estimate the capacity of the health care system to make a di erence in the County's health status and health outcomes. The community population and hospital characteristics elements we selected are ones that have been highlighted in the literature as contrib-uting to improved health outcomes. These are listed in T able 6. We looked at these elements and associations at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level and at the level of the Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). This level of detail was undertaken to contribute to decision making for the regional health care system. The distribution of these discharges at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level is detailed in T able 7. Some /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes with few discharges have PQI indicator rates of zero. /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code 20601, for example, only had 50 total discharges over the three-year period, so PQI admissions rates are zero for most indicators. There is signicant variation in PQI admissions rates across /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes. The rates show that heart failure, diabetes and asthma are quite prevalent in the community and are important to address. The denitions, means and stan- dard errors of the dependent variables included in the econometric model are described in T able 8. The mean PQI ratio aggregated across all the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes was 21.2 (standard deviation of 10.6). This can be interpreted as on average 21 discharges per 1,000 total population of Prince George's County residents were for any of these ambula-tory care-sensitive conditions related to a chronic condition. The readmission rates aggregated at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level (available only for scal year 2008 and 2009 data) were also used as a dependent variable; readmissions aver-aged 10 percent for hospitalized Prince George's County residents. Descriptive statistics for the explana- tory variables are also included in T able 8. Age, sex and proportion of the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code population that is minority were controlled for in the analyses, follow-ing Epstein (2001).

Results from preliminary analy-ses showed that only the proportion of the population over 65 was statistically signicant, so we used an indicator of over 65 compared to under 65. On average, 52 percent of the population was female. The race distribution of the population was indicated by a variable reflecting the proportion of the popula-tion in each /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code that was classied as minority. Whites were the referent group, and minority included black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian and Pacic Islander, some other race and two or more races. Roughly 80 percent of Prince George's County residents were minorities. On average, 7 percent of the residents were at or below federal poverty level; this ranges from 2 percent in some /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes to a maximum of 18 percent. Health workforce characteristics measured at the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level were included as explanatory variables. The ratio of primary care physicians per 1,000 County residents (0.401) was a key explanatory variable.

Presence of a safety net clinic in the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code was included as a dichotomous indicator variable. The proportion of /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes with a safety net clinic was 0.22. /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-level details on each of these outcome variables (any PQI and readmission rates) are tabulated in T able 9.WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT ASSOCIATIONS USING HOSPITAL DISCHARGES We examined associations of com- munity population and health care elements with each ambulatory care-sensitive condition hospital encounter. The results from the ordi-nary least squares regressions and robust regressions are presented in Appendices B through J, including the estimated coecients, standard errors, t-statistics, P values and elasticities. The elasticity is calculated for ease of interpretation. It represents the percentage change in the mean rate of the dependent variable (ambulatory care-sensitive PQI) resulting from a 10 percent increase in the mean of each independent variable. For example, the elasticity for the minority variable is calculated as the mean of the minority variable (.798) divided by the mean of the outcome variable (any PQI, 21.168). This dividend is multiplied by the ` coecient for minority (=29.6) and then by 10 to determine the e ect of a 10 percent increase in the means (= 29.2 * (.798/21.2)* 10 = 11.01). A 10 percent increase in the proportion of the population that is non-white was TABLE 9ZIP CODE-LEVEL DATA FOR KEY OUTCOME VARIABLES Source: 2007, 2008 and 2009 discharge data from HSCRC and DCHA. Readmission rate data are ZIP code-level data received from HSCRC and DCHA. Total sample size= 292,013ZIP Code Any 11 percent increase in the rate of ambulatory care-sensitive discharges. The robust regression coef-cients are compatible for the ordinary least squares regression coecients for the variables that are statistically signicant in the model. Specic details on the estimates from the individual PQI admissions ratios are presented in an aggregate format in T able 10, an example of inter-pretation is included in T able 11, and all of the coecients and elasticities are presented in more detail in the in Appendices B through J. These include the results for short-term diabetes, long-term diabetes, COPD and asthma, hypertension, heart failure, angina, uncontrolled diabetes and asthma in younger adults. The consistent ndings across these models are that age and gender distribution across the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes are not persistently signicantly associ-ated with the ambulatory sensitive discharges, although proportion of pop-ulation over 65 is positively associated with these discharges in some models. The proportion of the population that is minority is positively associated with ambulatory care-sensitive discharges in most of the models; increasing the proportion of the population that is non-white associated with higher ratios of ambulatory care-sensitive discharges. Perhaps surprising, the primary care physician ratio per 1,000 residents and physician assistant ratio are not signicant in any of these models.

TABLE 11INTERPRETATION OF ELASTICITY FOR ANY AMBULATORY CARE-SENSITIVE DISCHARGE MODEL Element/Variable Elasticity ImplicationImprovement (+) Decline (-) Population 65+ 6.4 A 10 percent increase in the population 65+ is associated an increase in the ambulatory care- sensitive hospital discharge ratio of 6.4 percent.- Race/Ethnicity 11.0 A 10 percent increase in the proportion of the population that is non-white is associated with an increase in the ambulatory sensitive hospital discharge ratio of 11.0 percent.- Nurse practitioner to population ratio-1.60 A 10 percent increase in the ratio of nurse practitioners to population is associated with a decrease in the ambulatory care-sensitive hospital discharge ratio of ndings using discharge data for all of the state of Virginia (Epstein, 2001). However, the ratio of nurse practitioners per 1,000 residents is statistically signicantly associated with fewer ambulatory care-sensitive discharges per 1,000 residents, highlighting the importance of physician extenders in mitigating discharges for conditions that could be avoided with access to primary care in the community. WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT ASSOCIATIONS USING 30-DAY HOSPITAL READMISSIONS In order to get an additional measure of all ambulatory care-sensitive condi-tions we looked at 30-day readmissions for County residents (T able 12). Hospital readmissions are an important measure of quality of health care high-lighted in the Patient Protection and Aordable Care Act of 2010. Up to 50 percent of readmissions have been found to be preventable (Benbas-sat & T aragin 2000) and they may reflect quality of care in the hospital and in the community. These readmissions were aggre- gated as a proportion of admissions for each /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code. Similar to the other models, the only health care workforce supply variable that was signicantly associated with lower readmissions is the nurse practitioner ratio variable. However, this relationship was not signicant in the robust regression models, so it should be interpreted with caution.

All ve hospitals in Prince George's County are privately owned. Four of the ve are non-prot; the only for-prot hospital is Southern Maryland Hospital. Analyses con-ducted for other localities interested in projecting hospital demand were used to model projections (Stewart, T ate, Finlayson, et al., 2002; Mosco-vitch, 2005; Minnesota Department of Health, 2006). These are simple, unadjusted projections that only account for population growth. Our methods closely follow those used in Minnesota to predict the impact of a new hospital in Cass County (Min-nesota Department of Health, 2006). Several key assumptions were made for the hospital discharge projections, similar to those in the Minnesota analysis. The rst assumption was that hospitalizations by age groups would be the same as they were in 2009. T o predict future changes in hospitaliza-tion rates, we removed the two lowest and two highest /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code growth rates, modeling slower or faster growth rates in the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes that account for 75 percent of each hospital's discharges. We assumed that past growth rates (population change between 2000 and 2010) would hold true for the period 2012-2022. We assumed that the group of /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes that account for 75 percent of each hospital's discharges would remain the same. We also assume that utilization behaviors and technology improvements have the same e ect in the future as they had on past discharges. The data supplied by HSCRC and DCHA were only for Prince George's County residents. There was no clear pattern in discharges for Prince George's County residents using Prince George's County hospitals over the 2007 to 2009 scal year period. Fiscal year 2008 dis-charges were somewhat lower than for the 2007 scal year period, except for Laurel Regional Hospital and Southern Maryland Hospital, which were slightly higher. In contrast, some hospitals saw scal year 2009 discharges increase compared to the previous scal year (Doctors Community Hospital, Fort Washington Medical Center and Prince George's Hospital Center), but scal year 2009 discharges were lower than scal year 2007 discharges for Fort Washington Medical Center, Laurel Regional Hospital and Prince George's Hospital Center. Since no clear trends in growth were identied, the projec-tions were based o of the scal year 2009 data. Projection results for inpatient growth for Prince George's County hospitals are shown in T able 13. As described in the methods section, population growth rates between 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census were cal-culated for the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes that account for 75 percent of each hospital's discharges. We calculated the average growth rate for these /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes for the actual projection. We then re-esti-mated an upper bound for the average /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code growth by removing the two /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes with the lowest growth rates, and the lower bound by removing the two /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes with the highest growth rates. These projections are presented in the lower/upper bound row. Projec-tions were calculated for both total discharges as well as for the total number of inpatient days. There was signicant variation in both the population of these /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes as well as in their growth rates. Some /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes experienced population decreases over the 10-year period, whereas other /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes with small population totals experienced growth rates as high as 43 percent. The growth in /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes accounting for 75 percent of Doctors Community Hospital's (190 beds) discharges ranged between -7 percent and 43 percent. The average growth rate used for the projection was 11.3 percent, with a lower bound of 6.1 percent and an upper bound of 15.2 percent. Fort Washington Hospital (37 beds) had 45 percent of its discharges coming from one /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code, 20744. Three /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes (20744, 20745, and 20748) accounted for 75 percent of its discharges. The average popula-tion growth in these /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes was 1.7 percent. Since there were only three /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes in the 75 percent of discharges, we estimated the lower bound using the lowest /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code growth rate (-3 percent) and the upper bound using the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc with the highest growth rate (5 per-cent). One /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code (20707) accounted for 30 percent of the discharges from Laurel Regional Hospital. This /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code had a 23 percent population growth rate between 2000 and 2010. Three /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes accounted for 65 percent of visits and seven /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes accounted for 75 percent of discharges. The aver-age /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-population growth rate was 9.1 percent, the lower bound was estimated at 4.4 percent and the upper bound at 13.8 percent. Prince George's Hospital Center had two /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes each account for 15 percent of discharges (20743, 20785) and both of those /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes had negative population growth. Overall, 12 /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes accounted for 75 percent of their discharges. The average population growth for these /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes was 5.6 percent, the lower bound was estimated at 2 percent and the upper bound at 7.8 percent. One /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code (20735) accounted for 21.6 per-cent of Southern Maryland Hospital's discharges, and six /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes accounted for 75 percent of their discharges. The average population growth rate was 4.6 percent, the lower bound was at less than 1 percent and the upper bound at 7.8 percent. The projected increases in dis- charges are relatively modest (T able 13). Discharges from Doctors Com-munity Hospital are projected to be 11,194 in 2017 and 11,790 in 2022. The estimated range for the 2022 projec-tions 12,209. The number of inpatient days is projected to be 48,606 in 2022. Discharges from Fort Washington Medical Center are projected to be 2,262 in 2017 (range 2,209-2,299) and 2,280 in 2022 (range Inpatient are to 8,573 8,375-8,715) in 2017 and 8,644 (range 8,247-8927) in 2022. These numbers are relatively low relative to the 2007 and 2008 discharges, since they are based o of 2009 gures, which were lower than the two previous years. Laurel Regional Hospital discharges are projected to be 4,528 in 2017 (range 4,425-4,629) and 4,726 T inpatient in are to 18,591 18,169-19,005) and 19,403 in 2022 (range 18,560-20,231). Prince George's Hospital Center discharges are projected to be 14,206 in 2017 (range 13,953-14,354) and 14,598 in 2022 (range Inpatient are estimated to 62,600 2017 (range 61,484-63,249) and in 2022, 64,325 (range 62,093-65,623). Southern Maryland Hospital discharges are projected to be 14,148 in 2017 (range 13,877-14,361) and 14,470 T inpatient in are to 52,250 (range 51,251-53,038), and 53,442 in 2022 (range 51,442-55,015). For comparison with national sta- tistics, we took the average discharge ratio per 1,000 Prince George's County residents for 2007, 2008 and 2009. The average annual discharge ratio for Prince George's County was 101.8 per 1,000 residents. This is slightly lower than the national average of 116.9 per 1,000 population in 2006, 117.9 per 1,000 population in 2008 and 118.1 in 2009 (CDC 2008, CDC 2009). (The discharge data used in this analysis do not include data on the non-civilian population, which may explain some of the undercount.) The coecients from the regres- sion model of total discharges by /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code per 1,000 County residents are reported in T able 14. This allows us to understand the associations of community and health care sys-tem characteristics associated with total discharge ratios, and gives us a projection we can use in modeling future discharge ratios. The predicted discharge ratio from the model is 101.9 discharges per 1,000 County residents. This ratio can be increased or reduced based on beliefs about changes in the health care system and community in the future. For overall discharge ratios, the proportion of the population over 65, the proportion of the population that is minority, and the proportion of the population living at or below federal poverty level are all associated with more hospital discharges per 1,000 residents in the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code. None of the health care workforce supply variables TABLE 13PROJECTIONS FOR 2017 AND 2022 DISCHARGES FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HOSPITALS Hospital 2017 projected 2022 projected Doctors Community Hospital # discharges 11,194 (lower, Fort Washington Medical Center Laurel Southern 2017 and 2022 projections use 2009 data Includes data on all discharges, even those missing data on primary payer, etc. 175/h.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc were signicant in this model. This nd- ing suggests that presence of a safety net clinic, and supply of primary care physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants are not signi-cantly associated with discharges for Prince George's County residents. The outcome measured is all discharges, including injury and other acute condi-tions, which may mask the types of visits that truly would be impacted by local workforce supply. Given the econometric model nd- ings and the articulated intention of the planned regional medical center with an ambulatory primary care network, further estimates could be introduced to modify these projections. The follow-ing estimates could support additional health improvements. 1. Changes in health care workforce supply. The goal of the Governor's Workforce Investment Board is to \"increase workforce capacity by 10-25 percent over the next 10 years.\" Given our econometric model ndings this could reflect a decline in hospital use with the right mix of primary care workers and demonstrate an improvement in health outcomes for the County. 2. The Maryland Health Benet Exchange plans to be launched in 2014 and will extend insurance coverage to the uninsured and underinsured. Given the payer prole mix of County residents, this could be another factor that would contribute to improved health outcomes. The Maryland State Health Improvement Process estimates 17.2 percent of County residents do not have insurance.TABLE 14LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL RESULTS DISCHARGE RATIO PER 1,000 RESIDENTS Variable CoecientStandard Error t-statistic P Value Elasticity* Age, Race and Poverty 742.05 337.11 2.20 clinic -10.57 25.95 -0.41 0.69 -0.07 Primary care physician practitioner ratio observations 36 R2 = 0.7707, Adjusted R2 = 0.7028 *Elasticity is the percentage change in the dependent variable associated with a 10 percent increase in the independent variable.

The Maryland State Health Improvement Process and the Prince George's County Health Improvement Plan emphasize target improvements in all measures aimed at 2014. Most of these measures for chronic conditions reflect a 5 percent improvement. The e orts planned to achieve these improvements also could contribute to further improvements in health. /P.sc/r.sc/o.sc/j.sc/e.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /F.sc/u.sc/t.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc /D.sc/e.sc/m.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc Demand for inpatient care is sensitive to a variety of factors, including access to primary care, the economy, socio-demographic characteristics, health insurance coverage and technology. In Prince George's County, reputa-tion, perception of quality of care and geographic proximity matter as well. All of these factors will play a role in determining inpatient demand in the future. Incorporating data and informa-tion from the KPMG market analysis, we can make assumptions about future demand for inpatient care in Prince George's County. These assumptions also factor in the expected future increases in primary care workforce, spread of insurance via the benet exchanges and successful outcomes from the state and County health improvement plans. T aken together with declining trends for inpatient utili-zation over the last several decades, it seems reasonable to expect a 1 percent per year decline in inpatient discharges per 1,000 residents. For Prince George's County, this means that in the next decade, the discharge ratio is expected to decrease to below 100 discharges per 1,000 residents. /P.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /U.sc/s.sc/e.sc /M.sc/i.sc/c.sc/r.sc/o.sc/d.sc/a.sc/t.sc/a.sc /A.sc/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc /parenleft.sc/P.sc/U.sc/M.sc/A.sc/parenright.sc /R.sc/e.sc/s.sc/u.sc/l.sc/t.sc/s.sc Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) can be used to identify broader geographic variation in outcomes at a level that aggregates across /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc codes. Descriptive statistics at the PUMA level are presented in T able 15. These descriptive statistics are unadjusted, meaning they are only taking /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code population into account. They do not account for the distribution of age, minorities, sex or income in the PUMAs (see results in the following table for these adjusted models). There are several striking ndings when the data are tabulated at this level. PUMAs 1 and 5, and in many cases 2, are consistently lower than the average across these measures. Specically, the lowest ratios are for: short-term diabetes in PUMAs 1 and 5, long-term diabetes in PUMAs 2 and 5, COPD/ asthma in PUMAs 1 and 5, hypertension in PUMAs 2 and 5, heart failure in PUMAs 1 and 5, angina in PUMAs 1 and 5, uncontrolled diabetes in PUMAs 1 and 5, asthma in younger adults in PUMAs 1 and 2 (and also relatively low in 5) and any PQI in PUMAs 1 and 5. T otal discharge ratios and 30-day readmissions are lowest in PUMAs 1 and 2. Essentially, PUMA 5 has lower ratios than the other PUMAs across all of the PQIs. The PUMAs with the highest ratios of ambulatory care-sensitive discharges include PUMA 7 for every measure, and PUMA 4 for every measure except uncontrolled diabetes and 30-day readmissions. Moving beyond descriptive statistics, analysis including PUMA designation as an independent variable was con-ducted to isolate di erences in types of discharges. These models controlled for the demographic and local health care workforce variables included in the previous models. The PUMA analyses are reported in T able 16. Presenting the results in one table rather than numerous tables allows us to see which PUMAs have higher rates of ambulatory care-sensitive discharges, readmissions and total discharges. All of the results are relative to PUMA 5, a PUMA chosen because of its central location outside of the Beltway. PUMA 5 population is higher-income, gaining population and majority black. PUMA 1, a lower-income, losing population and growing Hispanic area, is not signicantly dierent from PUMA 5 on any of the outcome measures once demographic and health workforce characteristics are included in the model. PUMA 2, a higher-income, gaining popula-tion, majority black area, is similar in discharges to PUMA 5 but does have statistically signicantly lower 30-day readmissions than PUMA 5. PUMA 3, which is lower-income, stable population, growing Hispanic, di ers signicantly on several measures from PUMA 5. PUMA 3 has a higher rate of discharges for COPD/ asthma in older adults, heart failure and any ambulatory 177/h.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc care-sensitive discharge. PUMA 4, a lower-income, losing population and majority black area, has a higher discharge ratio for COPD/ asthma, hypertension, heart failure, asthma in younger adults and any ambulatory care-sensitive discharge relative to PUMA 5. PUMA 6, a higher-income, gaining population, majority black area, has a higher ratio of COPD/asthma, heart failure, angina and any ambulatory care-sensitive discharge than PUMA 5. PUMA 7, a lower-income, losing population and majority black area, has higher ratios of heart failure and any ambulatory care-sensi-tive discharge than PUMA 5. There are limitations to using hospital discharge data for statisti-cal analyses (Schoenman, Sutton, Elixhauser & Love, 2007). The data provided by HSCRC and DHA had several limitations. Some observations had missing data and in some cases those observations had to be excluded (for example, those discharges missing the hospital name). The data did not include a unique identier, so readmis-sions could not be directly identied in the data. The data set received did not have procedure codes, which are useful in determining the discharges to use for some of the PQIs. More than 70,000 discharges did not have data on the All Patient Rened Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs), a system of clas-sifying hospital discharges. APR-DRGs are grouped using ICD-9 codes as well as other discharge level data. This was not a major limitation, as using ICD-9 codes and AHRQ's PQIs are commonly adopted strategies in the literature. In fact, an advantage to using PQIs is that they take the population size into consideration. However, PQIs are tradi-tionally measured at the County level. This within-County analysis adopted the same methodology and applied it to the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code level rather than the County level. The /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-level of analysis is also a limitation, as there TABLE 15PUMA LEVEL OUTCOME RATIOS PER 1,000 RESIDENTS Outcome Measure PUMA 1 PUMA 2 PUMA 3 PUMA 4 PUMA 5 Diabetes 1.04 1.37 1.38 2.49 1.22 1.80 3.76 1.32 1.59 3.01 Heart Failure 6.22 6.75 7.90 15.86 6.62 7.79 12.76 Angina 0.33 0.52 0.11 0.15 0.13 Total Discharge Ratio (aggregate 2008 and 2009 TABLE 16LINEAR REGRESSION RESULTS: PUMA ASSOCIATIONS Outcome Measure PUMA PUMA 4 PUMA 6 PUMA 7 Short-term Diabetes Long-term Diabetes COPD/Asthma + + + Hypertension + Heart Failure + + + + Angina + Uncontrolled Diabetes Asthma Younger Adults + Any PQI + + + + T otal Discharge Ratio 30-day Readmissions - Source: Relationships from models estimating the association between Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) and ratios of ambulatory care-sensitive discharges, readmissions and total discharges. The relationships are relative to PUMA 5. Since the estimated coecients themselves do not have meaningful interpretations, the tables include an indicator of the sign of the coecient if the relationship is statistically in Prince George's County. The regression models were parsimonious to maximize degrees of freedom. The health care workforce ndings in this study need careful follow-up. The data used for this study include licensed primary care practitioners and their reported practice locations and do not reflect their actual practice congu-rations and capacity. /D.sc/i.sc/s.sc/c.sc/u.sc/s.sc/s.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc This model provided a /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-level analysis describing the relationship between local health system factors and Prince George's County residents' inpatient utilization. The majority of Prince George's residents seek hospital care outside of the County borders, including D.C. and Montgomery County hospitals. The payer mix for these discharges varies signicantly across hospitals. Discharges from the D.C. and Montgomery County hospitals are much more likely to have private insur-ance as the primary payer, whereas Prince George's County hospitals have the highest proportion of visits paid for by public sources of coverage including Medicaid and Medicare. There were no consistent di erences in trends in utilization between 2007 and 2009. Ambulatory care-sensitive dis- charges, measured using AHRQ's Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs), were analyzed for each /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code in Prince George's County. The /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code-level factors relating to these dis-charges were modeled using ordinary least squares and robust regression. The results consistently show that the ratio of nurse practitioners to 1,000 residents in a /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code is negatively associated with discharges for ambula-tory care-sensitive admissions and the proportion of the population that is minority is associated with increases in these admissions. Physicians, physician assistants and presence of a safety net clinic in the /Z.sc/I.sc/P.sc code were not related to the ambulatory care-sensitive admissions in the model. These nd-ings also hold in the readmissions model. Although this nding has been conrmed in some of the previous literature, it is an important dynamic to investigate within Prince George's County. Several recommendations arise from this analysis. First, review of the patient characteristics and related factors for all County hospital discharges and readmissions, as well as emergency department use is encouraged, not just for Prince George's County residents. This will allow a more comprehensive assessment of the current demand on the health care system in Prince George's County and as a regional resource since the hospitals also provide care to non-County residents. Second, a group should be convened to critically review these ndings in the context of other such studies in the region and to use the model to test other elements of the system. Third, a more specic assessment of the prac-tice characteristics of the primary care workforce should be conducted, with an emphasis on nurse practitioners, in order to understand the specics and implication of the reported association. It is important to further explore the relationship between nurse practitio-ners and admissions, including the existing practice models within the hospitals and the community. Adding a nurse practitioner to an inpatient sur-gery team has been found to improve overall resource use as well as reduce unnecessary emergency department visits by 50 percent (Robles, Slogo , Ladwig-Scott, et al., 2011). The current analysis does not measure where or how nurse practitioners are practicing. Fourth, we encourage investment in an information system that can monitor the interaction and contributions of the elements of the system and report on outcome levels in real time. Fifth, we recommend consideration of site visits to select health systems that have successfully altered to improve health outcomes to obtain additional informa-tion and insights.179/h.sc/o.sc/s.sc/p.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc /R.sc/e.sc/f.sc/e.sc/r.sc/e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

An adequate supply of primary care physicians has been shown to optimize health outcomes (Goodson, 2010). However, studies show that the U.S. have a severe maldistribution of primary care physicians (Goodell, Dower, & O'Neill, 2011). Communities that have reduced access to primary care\u2014typically comprising a high proportion of uninsured, low-income and minority individuals\u2014has a correspondingly high proportion of death and disease rates than communities that have better access to primary care (Bodenheimer & Pham, 2010). Under the Patient Protection and Aordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), 32 million more Americans will obtain health insurance, thereby increas- ing the number of individuals who will seek primary care services and require more primary care physicians to meet their health care needs (Brook & Y oung, 2010). However, the U.S. lacks a sucient number of primary care physicians to serve the health care needs of Americans, with many urban and rural communities currently underserved. Y et, these areas tend to have the greatest need for health care services (Goodell, Dower, & O'Neill, 2011). As a result of the projected shortage of primary care physicians, millions of individuals will be unable to readily obtain the health care services they need (Kirsch, Henderson, & Dill, 2012). Other factors, such as an aging population and the growth of the U.S. population will further increase the need for primary care over the next 15 years (Bodenheimer, Chen, & Bennett, 2009). In 2020, it is projected that the U.S. will have shortages of 45,500 primary care physicians and 46,100 medical specialists (Kirch, Henderson, & Dill, 2011). The ACA reforms address the primary care supply issues through several policy mechanisms, including implementation of physician pay- ment reform, primary care workforce expansion legislation and practice innovations. In addition, the ACA takes steps to resolve the maldistri- bution of primary care physicians by authorizing (though not guaranteeing) funds for tuition assistance to make it possible for poorer students to enter medical school, as these students are more likely to practice primary care in underserved communities (Dorsey, Nicholson, & Frist, 2011). Since the enactment of the ACA, the federal government has introduced nancial incentives designed to improve the cur- rent primary care practice model and strengthen primary care services. In October 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the Federally Qualied Health Center (FQHC) Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration, which will nancially support com- munity health centers for providing quality care and provide technical assistance throughout the demonstra- tion period, Nov. 1, 2011, and Oct. 31, 2014 (The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2011). Another ACA initiative, led by the Health Resources Service Administration (HRSA), the Health Center Quality Improvement and Patient Centered Medical Home Supplement Funding demonstration, supplies more than 900 community health centers providing primary care services throughout the U.S. with resources to better coordinate and deliver care to patients. (HHS). It is clear that states must take steps to improve their health systems and increase primary care access under the ACA; it is particularly critical that states address the maldistribution of primary care providers (Kirsch, Henderson, & Dill, 2012). In response to the predicted 195physician workforce shortage, the state of Maryland has developed a plan to prepare the state's workforce for the full implementation of health reform. This plan contains strategies to address the impending physician shortage in an eort to mitigate the negative impact on residents' health. T o address the lack of supply of primary care practitioners in service shortage areas, Maryland will take steps to ensure optimum use of innovative state and federal oppor- tunities for primary care workforce development by 2012 (The State of Maryland & The Governor's Workforce Investment Board, November 2011). Ensuring access to primary care ser- vices is a key factor in avoiding initial hospitalizations and post-discharge readmissions, since these providers serve as gatekeepers into the health care system, and can provide continu- ity of care after a patient is discharged from the hospital (Stareld, Shi, & Macinko, 2005) (Minott, 2008). A recent study found a substantial association between regional rates of overall hospital admissions and rates of readmissions (Epstein, Ashish, & Orav, 2011). These ndings underscore the need for primary care providers to be available to patients when health problems arise, so that avoidable hos-pitalizations are prevented (Stareld, Shi, & Macinko, 2005). Based on a review of the literature, reducing hos-pital readmissions will require system redesign, including re-engineered discharge planning and post-discharge coordination of care. Studies have shown that transitional care manage- ment plays a key role in preventing avoidable hospital readmissions (Oh, 2011). E ective care transition requires accountability among all participants, and facilitates a smooth hando between the hospital and post-dis- charge providers, as well as other individuals and organizations that may be responsible for following up with patient care post-discharge (Minott, 2008). Changes in the culture of health care will be necessary. For example, physicians and other professionals must embrace a patient-centered, col- laborative, integrated approach over professional autonomy. In summary, the literature has mainly focused on strengthening primary care and reducing hospi- tal readmissions. Thus our study attempted to ll some of the gaps in this literature by conducting an overview of comparative health care system models to identify informative characteristics to help guide the design of an e ective, ecient and nancially viable medical system able to improve health care delivery for all income lev- els in Prince George's County. Our team identied a group of existing models of regional health systems within Maryland (Montgomery County) and other states (e.g. Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, Ver- mont and Wisconsin) that can inform and demonstrate components of the proposed Regional Medical System in Prince George's County. /M.sc/e.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/d.sc/s.sc RESEARCH QUESTIONS, INTERVIEW PARTICIPANTS AND DATA COLLECTION /S.sc/e.sc/l.sc/e.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc /C.sc/r.sc/i.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc After IRB submission and approval, we conducted telephone interviews with ocials from 13 health care systems. The systems were selected based on a review of relevant literature and web- sites, and included innovative health care systems (e.g. hospitals, commu- nity health centers and other health care facilities) that provide high-quality, accessible and cost-e ective primary, chronic and specialty health care services. We also identied one system that does not meet these criteria (Arizona) for comparison purposes. /D.sc/e.sc/v.sc/e.sc/l.sc/o.sc/p.sc/m.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /o.sc/f.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /I.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/w.sc /G.sc/u.sc/i.sc/d.sc/e.sc The primary study questions guided the development of the interview questions. Interviews addressed the following issues: (1) key health outcomes ame- nable to improvement, (2) elements in the health care system that a ect these outcomes, (3) geographic distribution of health care resources and areas of greatest need for primary care, (4) utilization of the health care system by paying and non-paying patients, (5) type of public health sector resources mobilized to complement the health care system, (6) nancing mechanisms utilized by the health care system and (7) changes in the health care system implemented in the past year, includ-ing any innovations.

There were no monetary incentives for participants. T wo faculty researchers experienced in interview techniques from the Depart- ment of Health Services Administration conducted one-hour telephone inter- views February through March 2012. All interviews were audiotape recorded and transcribed. During the interview, participants were asked open-ended questions (Appendix A) that pertain to the health care systems they oversee. Participants were informed that their identities would remain condential.DATA ANALYSIS The methods described by Miles and Huberman (1994) and Morgan and Krueger (1998) guided the qualita- tive analysis for this study. First, the researchers developed brief descriptive case studies of each health care system. Next, the comments captured for each of the project study research ques- tions were transcribed and structured the analysis of the in-depth qualitative interviews. Three project analysts read the entire transcripts and the interview- ers' notes. Using the study research questions to structure the analysis, they developed table shells that mirror the interview questions. T o answer each study question, they reviewed the transcripts and identied key themes related to each question. T o establish consistent denitions of themes and sub-themes among analysts, they analyzed the rst interview as a team. When they reached agreement on denitions, they analyzed the remain- ing interviews independently. T o illustrate the themes and identify descriptive quotes, they sorted and categorized the interview statements. The analysts conducted this process using word processing to highlight, color code and re-arrange interview statements by research questions, themes and sub-themes. After they assembled each category, they wrote a descriptive summary for each section, comparing similarities and di erences. They also selected notable quotes to illustrate each section. Each table includes data for all 13 health care systems, thus the research- ers were able to answer each research question across health care systems. The analysts reduced the extensive qualitative data into synthesized tables with themes and sub-themes that answer each research question.

KEY HEALTH OUTCOMES MOST AMENABLE TO IM - PROVEMENT BY A NEW HEALTH CARE SYSTEM T able 1 includes key health outcomes addressed by the 13 model health care systems interviewed. While Prince George's County has identied their own priorities (Prince George's County Health Improvement Plan, 2011-2014), lessons from these systems can be instructive. The 13 systems reported 17 health outcomes most amenable to improvement, and most are chronic conditions. Seven of these outcomes were mentioned ve times or more: diabetes care, mental illness/behav- ioral health conditions identied in a primary care setting (with training/ consultation from behavioral health specialists), hypertension, asthma, cancer care, coronary artery disease/cholesterol management and conges- tive heart failure. Three other health outcomes were mentioned more than one time: children's programs (immu- nizations, child development screening and pediatric dental care), increased access to care/insurance and increased immunization rates. Individual health care systems identied the following seven items: HIV care, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, oral health, care for the homeless, decreased tobacco use and increased high school gradua-tion rates and developing a pipeline to health professions education. One health care system explained that a key element in determining health outcomes most amenable to change is community support for addressing specic health care prob- lems. It looks at the state's standing in the country on health indictors and selects areas that have clear metrics to measure success and have community support to address the problem. For that reason, its priorities look di erent from many other systems. For example, this system focuses on high school graduation rates and creating a pipeline to health professions education. It TABLE 2WHAT RESOURCES CAN BE MOBILIZED IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR TO COMPLEMENT THE IMPACT OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM? THE MOST COMMON PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES MENTIONED BY THE SYSTEMS WERE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. HOWEVER, THERE WERE MANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS AS OUTLINED BELOW. POTENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES: Community health centers 9 (federally qualied health centers) Public health department 9 (although public health programs are being cut by federal, state and local governments) Community-based providers (e.g., community mental health centers) 1 Community-wide Nurse Advice Line in partnership with the public health department, managed care organizations and a university. Works in rural and urban areas. Receives 15,000 calls/month, leads to decreased ER visits, increased medical homes, and coordinated care (patient records are faxed to the medical home the next day). Health Department monitors Nurse Advice Line to identify illness statewide. 1 Community Transformation Grants funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1 County funds and a collaborative relationship between community providers and hospitals support the County-wide program. County funds support care; however, the program relies on pro bono primary and specialty care from community providers as well as free clinic space from hospitals and community 1 Data sharing among all types of providers (using electronic medical records) 1 Federal government (since states have decits) 1 Health-related foundations (e.g. cardiovascular disease prevention, HIV prevention, etc.) 1 Integrated, collaborative system, public health and community coalition results in greater improve- ments in health outcomes than can be achieved by a health system acting alone. 1 Local news media (e.g. bilingual campaigns for prenatal care and immunizations) 1 Need for integration of community resources by one agency 1 Owned or funded clinics 1 Partnering with school systems and employers 1 Proceeds from the state tobacco tax 1 Specic community resources (new free clinic, resources for specic population e.g. heart disease or children) 1 State government (One state government required insurers to participate in a Chronic Care Initiative administered by the state health department.) 1/c.sc/o.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/r.sc/a.sc/b.sc/l.sc/e.sc /m.sc/o.sc/d.sc/e.sc/l.sc/s.sc198/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc selected this priority as it achieves several outcomes of importance to the community: increased education levels, improved health outcomes (resulting from improved education), increased recruitment of minority students for health professions and decreased unemployment as health care is a growing job sector. MOBILIZING PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES TO COMPLE - MENT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM'S IMPACT The health care system respondents mentioned public health depart-ments and federally qualied health centers most often when asked about mobilizing public health resources to complement their systems' impact. However, as reflected in T able 2, they had many other suggestions, including a state health department-sponsored Chronic Care Initiative that requires insurers to participate; an integrated, collaborative system or community coalition with community health cen- ters; community transformation grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and funding from a state tobacco tax. One interesting program involved a partnership between the academic health care system and a community-based health care services clinic initially funded by the system, which established a medical home with case managers for the under- and uninsured. Demonstrated successes in cost reduction, savings and qual-ity improvement led to hospital leadership support. Another innova- tive health care system developed a community-wide \"Nurse Advice Line\" in partnership with the public health department, managed care organiza- tions and a university. It operates in rural and urban areas and receives 15,000 calls per month. This program has led to decreased emergency department visits, increased medical homes and coordinated care (patient records are faxed to the medical home the next day). The state health department monitors the Nurse Advice Line to identify illness statewide. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTH CARE RESOURC-ES AND AREAS OF GREATEST NEED FOR PRIMARY CARE T able 3 reports systems' strengths and weaknesses in geographic distribu- tion of resources. In general, systems showed a consensus acknowledging that rural areas were in greatest need for primary care. One system located in a very urban state mentioned that they did not have problems with geographic distribution of health care resources as 90 percent of the population in the state lives in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Its services are equally distributed over the geography of the state. However, it is important to note that community resources can be dicult to access in crime-ridden urban areas. Examples of strengths in geographic distribution of resources include: a program that sends providers to a neighboring hospital (i.e. provid- ers go to patients instead of patients traveling to providers), federally qualied community health centers (FQHC) in underserved areas and hav- ing far-reaching acute care hospitals as well as urgent care centers. One comprehensive system covers a broad geographic region of one state and includes all aspects of the health care system (insurance coverage, acute care hospitals, health care centers, physi- cians employed by the system). All parts of the health care system interact with neighboring systems (e.g. system physicians practice in non-system community hospitals, system nurse practitioners work in nursing homes). They organize around a regional hub that has primary care and specialty resources to decrease patient driving distances. Their approach is coop- erative vs. competitive with other systems\u2014they help smaller community hospitals stay afloat. Examples of weaknesses in geo- graphic distribution of resources include: shortages of child psy- chiatrists (especially in rural states), undocumented immigrants with limited services options who may need to use emergency departments (low-income clinics and FQHCs can help) and home- less people who have no home to which they are discharged. One system with worker shortages in rural areas has a two-part approach to this problem: 1) train workers in their own communi-ties so they have roots and stay there (vs. train outsiders who leave) and 2) improve the pipeline for minority health care professionals by improving the poor educational backgrounds for this population, thereby changing who enters health professional schools. ELEMENTS OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY) THAT CAN AFFECT OUTCOMES As indicated in T able 4, respondents have a wide variety of approaches to improve health outcomes. Among the many approaches, the following examples illustrate ideas repeated in more than one system: \u0099\u0015Integrating a behavioral health specialist into the primary health care team to train primary care doctors and expand their capacity to diagnose mental illness. Seven systems are implementing this approach.199\u0099\u0015Focusing on fewer readmissions within 30 days of a hospitalization. The nancial disincentive in the ACA has encouraged health care systems to shift their thinking about their responsibilities for discharge and follow-up procedures. As hospitals will be nancially penalized for readmissions, rather than nancially rewarded, they are developing systems (often involving information technology) to be sure that patients receive comprehensive follow-up services. One system assigns a case manager to all patients over 65 years old when they leave the hospital. \u0099\u0015Establishing tight working relationships with hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies to improve discharge coordination TABLE 3WHAT IS THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTH CARE RESOURCES AND WHERE ARE THE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED FOR PRIMARY CARE? Having a big academic medical center in the area with lots of a liate providers Rewarding people in primary care through state initiatives such as one state's Chronic Care Initiative Sending providers once a week to a neighboring hospital (i.e., sending the providers to the patients instead of the other way round) Having a liated ambulatory care centers The County program has 25 service locations with diverse provider types (e.g. hospital, FQHC), and focuses on four areas with greatest need.Federally qualied community health centers located in underserved areas to provide primary care Having a broad service area and placing primary care throughout the region, having physical locations and facilities strategically located Implementing open access or advanced access to primary care (i.e., patient can call any time of day and night and schedule an appointment for same or next day). In addition, building a navigation platform that includes a 24/7 nurse triage system Having an adequate number of far-outreaching acute care hospitals and urgent care centersHaving a broad geographic region covered by all aspects of the health care system (insurance coverage, acute care hospitals, health care centers, physicians employed by the system). All parts of the health care system interact with neighboring systems (e.g. system physicians practice in non-system community hospitals, system nurse practitioners work in nursing homes). They organize around a regional hub that has primary care and specialty resources to decrease patient driving distances. The approach is cooperative vs. competitive with other systems, help smaller community hospitals stay afloat. STRENGTHS IN GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES: Geographic concentration: \"We don't have any ... facilities across the country, or even across the western part of the United States, we're tightly focused so that we have docs and hospitals within easy range. So that we're able to develop a communicating network so that we know what's going on in the patient's life. We don't want them in somebody else's facility where we don't know what happened to them. We think that breaks the continuity of care. So we try to be as geographically concentrated as we can as opposed to spread out.\" Avoiding duplication of services: by focusing the care in physician centers and clinics and avoiding freestanding surgery centers and the like Having a fairly extensive air transport system to reach remote communities, including trained people in stabilization of very ill patientsHaving a big academic medical center in the area with lots of a liate providers Rewarding people in primary care through state initiatives such as one state's Chronic Care Initiative Sending providers once a week to a neighboring hospital (i.e., sending the providers to the patients instead of the other way round) Federally qualied community health centers located in underserved areas to provide primary care Having a broad service area and placing primary care throughout the region, having physical locations and facilities strategically located Having a County program with 25 service loca- tions including diverse provider types (e.g. hospital, FQHC), and focuses on four areas with greatest needHaving a liated ambulatory care centers Implementing open access or advanced access to primary care (i.e., patient can call any time of day and night and schedule an appointment for same or next day). In addition, building a navigation platform that includes a 24/7 nurse triage system Having a broad geographic region covered by all aspects of the health care system (insurance coverage, acute care hospitals, health care centers, physicians employed by the system). All parts of the health care system interact with neighboring systems (e.g. system physicians practice in non-system community hospitals, system nurse practitioners work in nursing homes). It's organized around a regional hub that has primary care and specialty resources to decrease patient driving distances. The approach is cooperative vs. competitive with other systems, help smaller community hospitals stay afloat./c.sc/o.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/r.sc/a.sc/b.sc/l.sc/e.sc One comprehensive system places nurse practitioners in nursing homes full time to monitor patients and prevent hospitalizations, o er care in the nursing homes rather than hospitals when possible, and provide needed post- hospitalization follow-up care. \u0099\u0015Shifting the hospital mentality to keep people healthy and avoid unnecessary care. This requires changing hospital leaders' mindsets to understand that the goal is \"to do the best for patients rather than increase prots.\" This practice requires information technology to help practitioners provide services based on \"best practices\" with prompts to remind all providers about important procedures. \u0099\u0015Developing a team-based, multi- disciplinary, multi-specialty approach to treatment based on bundled payment for services. Each team is responsible for patient outcomes, conducts tasks to meet established metrics and receives nancial incentives for patient outcomes. Information technology prompts team members to meet the required metrics. TABLE 4WHAT ELEMENTS OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY) CAN AFFECT THESE OUTCOMES AND BY HOW MUCH (MODEL)? THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS HAD VARIOUS APPROACHES TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES: Tracking prescriptions (lled/not lled) to monitor compliance with medications for patients with chronic diseases. Each provides M.D.s with these data, who then contact and follow up with the patients. Integrating a mental health specialist into the primary health care team in order to train primary care doctors in diagnosing mental illnesses. Seven systems have done that. The idea is to take some of the mental health services out of the traditional setting and place them into primary care. Parity in coverage of mental health services \"[W]e have all the range of psychiatric services from acute inpatient to partial hospitalization programs and again, we work very closely with the community mental health center located in our County that does a lot of the outpatient work, so we provide call coverage for psychiatric services for them. They come to our emergency department when someone shows up here with a mental health issue and we jointly evaluate the patients to see if they need inpatient, can they go to one of their programs, so we work very closely as part of I'd say the continuum of care in mental health.\" Access to care for the insured and uninsured: Development of a health care services exten- sion infrastructure that can deliver health care resources to areas in need to improve health of the residents Identify where to focus health care improvement eorts and resources to improve population health Creation of medical home through partnership with a community health care services clinic that reduced admissions, readmissions and ER utilization: Case managers identify patients and follow up with them to ensure they are accessing post-treatment services, taking medications, have transportation, etc. have decreased \"no show\" rate to follow-up appointments for people discharged from ER, etc. \"[W]e've been able to dramatically reduce the uninsured margin to the hospital, what I heard last to [increase the margin] by $5 million because again these are patients who traditionally use the emergency department as their primary access point of resource.\" Intensive focus on prevention: Providers focus on intensive prevention versus general wellness when possible (e.g. address obesity, exercise, good nutrition, etc. to prevent diabetes). When it isn't possible, they focus on preventing further complications of a disease (e.g. diabetes). Electronic record prompting leads to best practices and fewer re-admissions, decreased costs and fewer deaths. Policy changes based on data/evidence based practices: The hospital reviews regularly data on health outcomes and the literature to develop policy changes. Coordination of care when a patient leaves the hospital using electronic records that inform the primary care M.D. that her/his patient is leaving the hospital. This results in better patient outcomes and lower readmissions. Shift in hospital mentality: Keep people healthy and avoid unnecessary care. Requires changing the mindset of hospital leaders and providers to understand that the goal is to do the best for patients rather than increase prots. It also requires developing payment systems that maintain incomes while avoiding unnecessary care. \"[A]s a not-for-prot company, our shareholders are the people that we care for. And so, for us to do an unnecessary CAT scan or an unnecessary surgery or to give them an expensive medication that's not going to benet them is essentially abandoning our duciary responsibility to our shareholders. I don't know if you've heard other people describe it that way, but it's kind of central to us trying to think di erently about things 'cause if we're looking at maximizing the bottom line that ain't gonna do it.\" Improvements in IT systems (having prompts in elec- tronic records to help providers ask the right questions, developing IT systems that include \"decision support information\" to help providers conduct best practices)201Establishing tight working relationships with nurs- ing homes and home health agencies to improve discharge coordination and prevent readmissions Improvements in outcomes due to pushing the primary care network outside its traditional setting into employer and school settings Building a planned care platform that responds to any condition and is not condition-specic (90 percent of the platform is the same for any condition) Redesigning care delivery around connected personal experience to reduce readmissions and save costs \"We're really trying to redesign care around the entire continuum and we're looking at how we build accountability for the patient experience across the continuum building our budget and nancing models, or quality models to really tell us how well we deliver care not in incremental visits, but in episodes.\" One hospital's real focus on primary care, including turning their primary care practices into patient- centered medical homes, resulted in having the highest o ce visits per capita in its area, but the lowest hospitalization rates. Improvement of patient transitions from hospital to home through case management where planning for patient's discharge starts once they're admitted to the hospital Implementing registries for chronic diseases: Allows community health centers to track and improve their data on chronic disease and has resulted in improvements in cancer prevention and immunizations. Using the lean system for process improvement that was developed by T oyota improves health outcomes Having a task force statewide to help in community-wide sharing of data and implementation of electronic medical records In the specic case of diabetes, having diabetes coordinators who follow up with patients resulted in improved diabetes outcomesTriaging patients in the emergency department and observation status (having many patients that are observation patients rather than inpatient admis- sions) reduces costs, but extended observation leads to patient dissatisfaction and adverse outcomes. Focus on high-service users by addressing mainly social problems leading to high levels of use (i.e. access to food, housing and transportation). Extension service trains community health workers to identify frequent users, bring them to case managers and address preventable conditions/high ER use. The university medical center structure views com- munity health as a high priority, and it is under the chancellor's o ce (not marginalized). A health econo- mist works in the Oce of Community Health and all medical students are required to earn a 17-hour cer- ticate of public health taught by public health M.D.s. \"Access to dental health services is a tough problem to address as it's expensive. We are trying to create mid-level dental health professionals to increase access.\" Develop a team-based, multi-disciplinary, multi-specialty approach to treatment and bundled care for nine diseases with practice metrics. Each team is responsible for patient outcomes, team members have discipline/role specic tasks, IT systems help team members conduct tasks to meet metrics, patient data are available to all team members, and the team receives nancial incentives when all metrics are met. For example, dierent team members are responsible for wellness/ prevention steps (e.g. immunizations, blood pressure and cholesterol control, smoking cessation, etc.). Patients receive automated birthday greetings with reminders about appointments/tests that need to be scheduled, and then transferred to a scheduler. Use \"predictive modeling\" to anticipate how many hospital patients will need follow-up visits, and create space for visits (rather than schedule as emergencies). Assign a case manager to anyone 65 years or older who is hospitalized, follow up for a month to monitor progress and schedule appointmentsEmploy full-time nurse practitioners in nursing homes to manage chronic care and provide treat- ment at the nursing home vs. hospital. Has reduced ER visits and re-admissions \"We're not a Kaiser model, a closed system. So two- thirds of our patients are insured by other insurers .\" A County-based program has tracking/reporting limi- tations, and plans to do more outcome measurement in the future. Process measures show increased access to care for specic population groups as they have bilingual/bicultural providers (Hispanic, Chinese, Muslim). Special programs focus patient transition from hospital to home or shelter for the homeless and ER diversion. Reimbursement approaches have been important to working with providers. They moved from a capitation to a xed-fee payment as that makes budgeting easier. The program relies on a strong provider network and an active advisory board to represent di erent segments of the community (hospitals, community clinics, medical society, the public at large, etc.). Coordinated programs that provide practice coaching so they can become e ective medical homes and learn quality improvement techniques. These programs work in concert with a statewide community care network that funds and provides case management services (so individual practices do not need to establish this infrastructure). They also work in concert with area health education centers (AHECs) to focus on practice re-design. All three programs support one another. Case management has helped manage utilization and education. Case management services are part of the pay- ment structure. The network began with Medicaid, expanded to the dually eligible population, Medicare and other funders. The network pays case managers to be in primary care practices, especially if a large Medicaid population. /c.sc/o.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/r.sc/a.sc/b.sc/l.sc/e.sc /m.sc/o.sc/d.sc/e.sc/l.sc/s.sc202/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc KEY ISSUES TO MAXIMIZE UPTAKE AND ACHIEVE THE POTENTIAL OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH As indicated in T able 5, respondents have a wide variety of approaches to maximize uptake and achieve the potential of a health care system for public health. The following examples illustrate variations in the health care systems' thinking, values and philosophies. \u0099\u0015\"... our goal is never to maximize utilization, we're trying to keep people from utilizing our services; we increasingly are being successful at getting our docs to think that the utilization of the health care system is a failure. ... it's not a success; we'd like people to be at home and healthy rather than sick and in the hospital. ... We're trying to make sure we're caring for our share ... of the paying population, but we're trying not to think about it as utilization. We're not trying to provide services to them, we're trying to get them under our umbrella and then keep them healthy.\" \u0099\u0015\"(sighs) development of high-quality services, convenience, availability, and that's all very dicult, very challenging to develop when you are also trying to meet the demand for care among those who don't have insurance. ... we had some success in attracting patients who have insurance other than Medicaid, ... it's certainly a challenge to attract patients who have insurance that's a better payer than Medicaid ...\" \u0099\u0015\"Public perception that the health system o ers an excellent facility, services and clinical product. ... must be viewed as a \"world- class health facility,\" ... not ... a facility that primarily serves the uninsured, because the public associates such providers with having poor quality services.\" \u0099\u0015\"... by developing a real ecient system of providing that care for those that aren't paying, you're sort of losing less and doing the right thing, which makes you feel good, but it's really about nding a way to care for the patients that are unable to pay in the same kind of system that you use for those that do pay .... and care for them with dignity and all the other good stu .\" \u0099\u0015\"Due to health care reform, the system is trying to increase their capacity for change and drive quality improvement. With the pressure to control costs and the pace of health care reform, people are scared that their program might get cut. So a big emphasis on demonstrating value right now. We've had the luxury to focus on the quality part of the value equation, but I think people are really focusing on the cost part of the value equation now.\" /D.sc/i.sc/s.sc/c.sc/u.sc/s.sc/s.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc KEY HEALTH OUTCOMES AMENABLE TO IMPROVEMENT All 13 model health care systems mentioned chronic diseases in their list of health outcomes most amenable to improvement. Thus, this discus- sion section will focus on chronic diseases, comparing our ndings to Prince George's County's health priorities while highlighting the two chronic diseases most frequently mentioned as priority health outcomes: diabetes and mental health. We also chose to highlight one health care system that had a distinct approach to prioritizing improvable outcomes. Upon examination of Prince George County's Health Improvement Plan for 2011-2014, we found some commonali- ties in terms of their health priorities (County outcome objectives) and those of the systems we interviewed. These commonalities were particularly salient in the area of chronic disease prevention. Prince George's outcome objectives include, among others: reducing death rates from heart disease; reducing the overall cancer death rate; reducing hypertension- related emergency room (ER) visits; reducing diabetes related ER visits; reducing tobacco use by adults; reduc- ing the number of ER visits related to behavioral health conditions; reducing new HIV infections among adults and adolescents; and reducing hospital ER visits from asthma. Heart disease, can- cer, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and behavioral health are health outcomes that were mentioned by ve or more of the health care systems we interviewed. In addition, two outcome objectives of Prince George's County focus on increasing the proportion of persons with health insurance and reducing the proportion of individuals who are unable to obtain, or delay obtaining, necessary medical care, dental care, or prescription medications. These objectives are in line with three of the interviewed health systems whose focus is to increase the number of 203TABLE 5WHAT ARE THE KEY ISSUES TO MAXIMIZE UPTAKE AND ACHIEVE THE POTENTIAL OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH? THE SYSTEMS HAD DIFFERING VIEWS ON HOW TO MAXIMIZE UPTAKE. Reduction of emergency room visits and keeping the population healthyOne system was a not- for-prot organization with a health care insurance component that covered one quarter of the population in the state. However, it mostly provided care to patients outside its insurance plan. The managed care plan focuses on overall patient care, ensuring continuity of care and o ers other insurance plans better deals if they agree to use only its facilities and physicians with whom this managed care plan collaborates with. This system focused its e orts on reducing emergency room use and physicians are instructed to welcome people without regard to ability to pay. They do not want the patient to view the ER as their source for primary care. Employed physicians are usually more welcoming of non-paying patients than non-employed or a liated physicians. They do not try to maximize utilization by paying patients, as they don't consider it utilization. \"Our goal is never to maximize utilization. We're trying to keep people from utilizing our services; we increasingly are being successful at getting our docs to think that the utilization of the health care system is a failure. It's not a success. We'd like people to be at home and healthy rather than sick and in the hospital. We're trying to make sure we're caring for our share, if you want to call it that, of the paying population, but we're trying not to think about it as utilization. We're not trying to provide services to them, we're trying to get them under our umbrella and then keep them healthy.\" Creating a connected personal experience and moving primary care to the employer setting \"I think what we've done is we've tried to place primary care at the employer setting, create access through the system, create what we call a connected personal experience, connect the continuum for individuals who are here for a medical or surgical condition. We're trying to maximize our commercial business, really respond to needs and what people want in that experience and then look at where we place services so they're convenient for people.\" Advertising MRI services, exploring global payments\"This is an interesting question because the typical response for many years is, 'We need more patients because we need more revenues so we want to somehow make services more available, or get fancier equipment to draw people in and kind of the more competitive way of delivering health care.' That has happened in Vermont in the past. We will advertise maybe our MRI services. If you don't want to wait at that hospital come to us and we'll do it faster, which gets to this increasing utilization to bring in new revenues ... So we're doing a lot of exploring of things like how do you form an accountable care organiza- tion? Or how do you as a system start accepting global payments for your population that you normally wouldn't be seeing? So some of these more cutting edge ideas of shifting away from fee-for-service to more of a population-based payment strategy.\" Maximize use by paying patients: high quality, convenience, availability\"Development of high-quality services, convenience, availability, that's all very challenging to develop when you are also trying to meet the demand for care among those who don't have insurance. So we worked on those issues and had some success in attracting patients who have insurance other than Medicaid, but Medicaid is a payer that's challenging to live on 'cause their reimbursement rates are so low. So it's certainly a challenge to attract patients who have insurance that's a better payer than Medicaid.\" Public perception that the health system o ers an excellent facility, services and clinical product. The system must be viewed as a \"world-class health facility,\" which means that is must not be viewed as a facility that primarily serves the uninsured, because the public associates such providers with having poor quality services. Specic strategies: excellence in trauma care and hope for the ACA to kick in Maximize use by paying patients by doing public information campaigns and advertising, health fairs, community education Need to increase the system's linguistic/cultural sensitivity to meet the needs of ethnic com-munities (e.g. need more providers from the ethnic communities). Provide incentives to provide specialty care in local areas to keep people local (e.g. extensive use of telehealth services) Looking to the future when the ACA is implemented, accessibility problems will increase due to more insured people. Linking community health centers with academic medical centers will make the com- munity centers more attractive for paying patients. Automated system that reminds team members about the care that's needed and proving that leads to better results \"... by developing a really ecient system of provid- ing that care for those that aren't paying you're sort of losing less and doing the right thing, which makes you feel good, but it's really about nding a way to care for the patients that are unable to pay in the same kind of system that you use for those that do pay .... and care for them with dignity and all the other good stu .\" While the County-based program targets the uninsured population, and only meets a fraction of current demand, the increased number of insured people from health care reform will create more competition for unpaid care. The program is screening eligibility now so as many people as pos-sible will obtain insurance/Medicaid. That will leave only the uninsured (including many undocumented immigrants) in the program. The state provides the hospital millions of dollars to provide \"charity care\" and they are always trying to woo more insured patients. They have a highly reputable heart care program that brings in a lot of money, and that cross subsidizes a lot of charity care. Current and future e orts focus on managing cost and eliminating overutilization, a big emphasis on integration of mental health and primary care. Due to health care reform, the system is trying to increase its capacity for change and drive quality improvement. With the pressure to control costs and the pace of health care reform, people are scared that their program might get cut, so a big emphasis on demonstrating value right now. We've had the luxury to focus on the quality part of the value equation but I think people are really focusing on the cost part of the value equation now. /c.sc/o.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/r.sc/a.sc/b.sc/l.sc/e.sc /m.sc/o.sc/d.sc/e.sc/l.sc/s.sc204/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc insured people and access to care. Chronic diseases constitute an important focus of health care reform under the Patient Protection and Aordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. It is estimated that 7 million of the non- elderly uninsured in the U.S. have at least one chronic disease (Homan & Schwartz, 2008). The ACA has many components dedicated to prevention of chronic disease including the establish- ment of a National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council (ACA, 2010; Section 4001). More- over, it provides incentives for states that o er Medicaid coverage for all U.S. Preventative Services T ask Force grade A and B recommended services (e.g. smoking cessation treatment, screening for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and cancer) and for the recommended immunizations by the Advisory Committee for Immu- nization Practices (ACIP) without cost sharing (ACA, 2010; Section 4106). Similarly, the ACA requires coverage of evidence-based preventive services without cost sharing by private insur- ance companies (Sections 1001 and 1302), and in Medicare (Sections 4104 and 4105) as well. In addition, this law establishes a National Diabetes Preven- tion Program (ACA, 2010; Section 10501[g]), which is of great importance as 12 of the health systems interviewed identied diabetes as a priority health outcome. The Maryland State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) and County health plan provide detailed outcome measures and 2014 targets for chronic conditions. Mental health was an important pri- ority for seven of the interviewed health systems. SHIP highlights behavioral health among its outcome measures, as does the County. Although mental health did not constitute a special focus of health care reform, it denitely benets from its provisions. The ACA prohibits insurance companies from denying insurance to people with preexisting conditions; thus, people with preexisting chronic conditions including mental illness, will be protected from discrimination by insur- ance companies (ACA, 2010; Section 1101). In addition, Medicaid expansions under the ACA will extend insurance to 3.7 million people with severe men- tal illnesses (Gareld, 2011). Along the same line, regulated insurance exchanges in each state are required to cover mental health in their base- level benet packages (ACA, 2011; Section 1302). Demonstration projects under reform such as medical homes (Sections 2703 and 3502), improved chronic care management (Sections 2703) and better integration of services will also improve mental health care (ACA, 2010). Maryland has already initiated patient-centered medical home pilots. One of the health systems inter- viewed had a non-traditional way of prioritizing health outcomes, which entailed examining national health priorities and setting goals around increasing the state's standing nationwide and prioritizing goals that elicit community support. Thus, this system focused on health equity and healthy communities with the specic goals of increasing the number of the insured, increasing immuniza-tions among indigent populations and increasing high school graduation rates. These are important con- siderations that health systems planning to improve quality and performance can draw lessons from. MOBILIZING PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES Public health departments and feder- ally qualied community health centers were mentioned most often by the systems as potential public health resources that can be mobilized to complement the health care system's impact on health outcomes. It is inter- esting that many of the health systems mentioned public health departments as complementary sources of fund- ing despite the funding cuts currently underway by federal, state and local governments to public health programs. This means that health systems still expect public health departments to fulll their public health missions despite the funding cuts. The ACA authorizes generous funding for federally qualied community health centers (The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2011). This is rel- evant to Prince George's County, given the limited safety net capacity. These centers provide important primary care services for many people with chronic illnesses and are usually located in underserved areas such as rural set-tings (Adashi, Geiger, & Fine, 2010). The interviews with the systems pro- vided additional evidence of the value of these community health centers. The di erent health systems had many creative ideas when it comes to mobilizing public health resources that may be useful for Prince George's County to take into consideration when designing their new health system. Among these are two innovative ones. One program involved a partnership between the academic health care system and a community-based clinic to establish a medical home with case managers for the under- and uninsured. This program was successful in achiev- ing cost savings and improvements in quality of care. Another system formed a community-wide \"Nurse Advice Line\" in collaboration with the public health department, managed care organiza- tions and a university and operated in both rural and urban areas. This Nurse Advice Line helped the state health department identify illnesses statewide and resulted in decreased emergency department visits, increased medi- cal homes and better coordination of patient care.205GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTH CARE RESOURC-ES INCLUDING PRIMARY CARE PROFESSIONALS The national shortage in primary care was echoed in the interview responses of the health systems. While the ACA addresses these shortages through several mechanisms including imple- mentation of physician payment reform, primary care workforce expansion legislation, and by authorizing tuition assistance for medical school among others (ACA, 2010), it is not certain that these measures will be sucient to accommodate the 32 million Ameri- cans who will gain insurance coverage under reform. The stated goal of the Governor's Workforce Investment Board November 2011 report, \"Prepar- ing Maryland's Workforce for Health Reform: Health Care 2020,\" called for increasing \"primary care workforce capacity by 10-25 percent over the next 10 years.\" This workforce includes primary care physicians plus advanced nurse practitioners and physician assis- tants. The health systems interviewed highlighted that primary care shortages were mostly in rural areas and in some states crime-ridden urban areas. Some systems had innovative practices to address geographic mal- distribution of health care resources. One system addressed shortages in rural areas through training workers in their own communities as opposed to outsiders who don't have roots there and through improving the \"pipeline\" for minority health care professionals by focusing on increasing educational levels for minorities and increasing their enrollment in health professional schools. Another system covered a broad geographic region of one state and included all aspects of the health care system (insurance coverage, acute care hospitals, health care centers, physicians employed by the system). All parts of this health care system interacted with other health systems in a cooperative way organizing around a regional hub that has primary care and specialty resources, which decreased patient driving distances. These are creative ideas to address maldistribu- tion of resources that may be useful for Prince George's County to take into consideration when designing their new health system. ELEMENTS OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT CAN AFFECT OUTCOMES Seven systems mentioned mental health as one of the priority health outcomes and a common strategy to address this issue was to integrate behavioral health specialists into primary care teams to train primary care doctors in diagnosing mental ill- nesses. Thus, the new trend is to move certain mental health services from their traditional psychiatric settings and place them in primary care settings. Moreover, one system emphasized parity in insurance coverage of mental health including the whole range of psychiatric services and their close col- laboration with the community mental health center in order to achieve a con- tinuum of care in mental health. The ACA explicitly states that mental health parity applies to qualied health plans in the health benet exchanges that will be established by states as well as in Medicaid benchmark plans (ACA 2010; Sections 1311 and 2001). Similarly, the Maryland Health Benet Exchange Act of 2012 (HB 443) requires qualied health plans to meet the mental health requirements of the Mental Health Par- ity and Addiction Equity Act. One important focus of the systems was on achieving fewer readmissions within 30 days of a hospitalization due to fear of being penalized under the ACA for avoidable readmissions. Hospitals will experience nancial penalties such as reductions in Medi- care payments for excess preventable readmission rates (ACA, 2010; Sec- tions 3025 and 10309). Maryland has been acting on these types of activi- ties for a while through the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Com-mission. Some strategies designed by the interviewed systems to reduce readmissions included assigning case managers that follow up patients after discharge; incorporating information technology into comprehensive follow-up services; and establishing tight working relationships with hospitals, nursing homes and home health agen- cies to improve discharge coordination. All these strategies seem to be inspired by the Hospital Readmissions Reduc- tion Program provided under reform (ACA, 2010; Section 3025). Another important system element aecting health outcomes entailed shifting the hospital mentality from prot-making to keeping people healthy and avoiding unnecessary care. This included a great focus by providers on prevention, tracking prescriptions to monitor compliance with medica-tions for patients with chronic diseases, electronic records prompting for best practices and changing the mindset of providers from making prots to doing what is best for patients. Increased access to care was another important system element to improv-ing outcomes. This can be achieved through creation of medical homes, identifying the best use of resources to improve population health, implement-ing open access or advanced access to primary care (patient can sched-ule same or next day appointments) and having federally qualied health centers covering underserved areas. As previously mentioned, Maryland has launched a pilot program. However, a few states mentioned that they are mainly waiting for the ACA to kick in order to increase access to their under- and systems also mentioned incorporating information technology in their systems as a means to achieve quality, ecient care. This included incorporating prompts in electronic records to help providers ask the right questions and rely less on memory in treating their patients. Another practice is developing information technology systems that include \"decision support information\" to help providers conduct evidence-based medicine. Information technology can also be used in tracking prescriptions to monitor compliance with medications and to support discharge planning by following up with patients upon hospital discharge. As one examines the system ele- ments mentioned in the interviews, it becomes clear that at least some of these systems will make use of the ACA provision that encourages Medicaid programs to implement health homes by providing a federal funding match of 90 percent in the rst two years (ACA 2010; Section 2703). This provision allows states to compensate health home providers with designated patients for services that cover care management, essen-tial referrals, provision of individual and family support, and for utilization of health information technology to ensure the monitoring and coordina- tion of all the providers involved in the care of the designated patients. KEY ISSUES TO MAXIMIZE UPTAKE The health systems interviewed had dierent ideas on how to maximize uptake and achieve the potential of a health care system for public health. One system focused its e orts on reducing emergency room visits and keeping the population healthy and refused the concept of increas- ing paying patients as they viewed their goal to not maximize utilization, but instead to decrease utilization by keeping people healthy. Another system focused on creating what it called a \"Connected Personal Experi- ence\" and redesigned care around the entire continuum as well as moving primary care to employer and school settings. A di erent system mentioned advertising its fancy equipment, such as MRIs, because they needed more revenue. However, respondents also mentioned exploring global payments in order to shift away from fee-for- service to more of a population-based payment strategy. Y et another system mentioned that to maximize use by paying patients it worked hard on developing high-quality services that are convenient and available. However, they emphasized that these strategies are very challenging to develop when trying to meet the demand for care by the uninsured and by Medicaid patients where reimbursement rates are low. Thus, there appear to be di er- ences in the values driving the systems' answers to ways of maximizing uptake. Some systems focus on strategies to increase the utilization of services by paying patients, while others focus on decreasing unnecessary utilization and on providing a continuum of preven- tive and treatment services that keep people healthy and prevent avoidable medical complications. /H.sc/i.sc/g.sc/h.sc/l.sc/i.sc/g.sc/h.sc/t.sc/s.sc /o.sc/f.sc /F.sc/o.sc/u.sc/r.sc /S.sc/y.sc/s.sc/t.sc/e.sc/m.sc/s.sc While all 13 health care systems o er valuable lessons that can inform the development of a new system in Prince George's County, four sys- tems include innovative designs that address critical needs: increased access to care, high-quality services addressing pressing community health outcomes, multi-disciplinary provider teams that o er coordinated care, as well as eciency and sustainability of provider organizations. (See Appendix B for a summary of each system and an explanation of its relevance to the County.) The innovative components of these systems are highlighted below.\u0099\u0015One health care system, serving a rural, multi-cultural population, focuses on health outcomes that have community support. It looks at the state's standing in the country on health indictors, and selects areas that have clear metrics to measure success and community support to address the problem. For that reason, their priorities look di erent from many other systems. As an example, this system focuses on high school graduation rates as improved education levels lead to improved health outcomes and other community priorities (increased employment as more people would have skills for health care jobs). T o meet the needs of a rural, ethnic population, this system works closely with community health workers from the University of Maryland Extension. They coordinate with this well-established system and provide health education and other preventive services. This innovative system also developed a community-wide \"Nurse Advice Line\" in partnership with the public health department, managed care organizations and a university. It operates in rural and urban areas, 207and receives 15,000 calls per month. The Nurse Advice Line has led to decreased emergency department visits, increased medical homes and coordinated care (patient records are faxed to the medical home the next day). The state health department monitors the Nurse Advice Line to identify illness statewide. \u0099\u0015A second system, that serves a mainly urban population, includes multiple components, including hospitals, insurers, employed physicians and other providers. While it is a \"tight system\" with one board of directors, it also works with other insurers and providers. Its focus on keeping patients healthy and out of the hospital requires a mindset that di ers from traditional hospitals. When asked how they increase the number of insured patients, the interview respondent described a philosophy that requires providers to view hospitalization as a failure. The system has developed information technology that helps providers implement best practices by prompting them to ask key questions, schedule preventive services, make follow-up appointments at the time of hospital discharge, etc. In place of increased revenue from admissions, physicians receive incentives for keeping patients healthy. They focus on cost savings by preventing unnecessary re-admissions. For example, they have \"embedded\" nurse practitioners in nursing homes so they can o er comprehensive follow-up care for elderly patients when they return from a hospitalization. \u0099\u0015A third system serves a large portion of one state that includes both rural and urban areas. Like the previously described system, this one also includes hospitals, insurers, employed physicians and other providers. However, they work closely with other hospitals, providers and insurers that are outside their system. They also have developed extensive information technology that helps providers follow \"best practices\" in hospital treatment and follow up care. They have developed a team-based, multi-disciplinary, multi-specialty approach to treatment based on bundled payment for services. Each team is responsible for patient outcomes, conducts tasks to meet established metrics and receives nancial incentives for patient outcomes. Information technology prompts team members to meet their required metrics. \u0099\u0015The fourth health care system focuses on increasing access to services for the uninsured population in one large County. It includes a large ethnic and immigrant population, similar to Prince George's County, and could inform the development of one component of a new health care system. This County-funded system works with a coalition of hospitals and outpatient providers, including many pro bono services, to serve their target population. In preparation for health care reform implementation, this system has increased its e orts to enroll clients in Medicaid and other programs. In addition, they anticipate increased access problems for people without insurance when the insured population greatly expands. They fear that the health care system's need to serve more insured patients will impact its ability to focus on those without insurance coverage. When health care reform is implemented, many of the remaining uninsured population will be undocumented immigrants in this service area as well as Prince George's County. \u0099\u0015All four systems that are highlighted have expanded their capacity to serve a behavioral health population. Three have incorporated a behavioral health specialist into their primary care services. LIMITATIONS Our ability to speak with more than one informant per health care system was limited by time. Due to tight time constraints, the research- ers did not use a qualitative data analysis program that requires line-by- line coding. SUMMARY This study has offered a glimpse into 13 innovative systems, with a more in-depth focus on four systems. It is clear that planners of the new health care delivery system could learn additional lessons from further study of these systems.

SYSTEM 1 /S.sc/y.sc/s.sc/t.sc/e.sc/m.sc /C.sc/h.sc/a.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/s.sc One model health care system is a primary care program within an academic health sciences center that serves a rural, multi-cultural popula- tion, and focuses on health outcomes that have community support. It looks at the state's standing in the country on health indictors and selects areas that have clear metrics to measure success and community support to address the problem. For that reason, its priorities look di erent from many other systems. As an example, this system focuses on high school gradua- tion rates as improved education levels lead to improved health outcomes and other community priorities (increased employment as more people would have skills for health care jobs). /I.sc/n.sc/n.sc/o.sc/v.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc /P.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc T o meet the needs of a rural, ethnic population, this system works closely with community health workers from the Extension Service to address the social determinants of disease within each community. It coordinates with this well-established system and provides health education and other preventive services. Health extension agents are located in rural communities across the state and are supported by regional coordinators and the Oce of the Vice President for Community Health at the Health Sciences Cen- ter. The role of agents is to work with dierent sectors of the community in identifying high-priority health needs and linking those needs with university resources in education, clinical service and research. Community needs, inter-ventions and outcomes are monitored by County health report cards. The Health Sciences Center is a large and varied resource, the breadth and acces- sibility of which are mostly unknown to communities. Community health needs vary, and agents are able to tap into an array of existing health center resources to address those needs. Agents serve a broader purpose beyond immediate, strictly medical needs by addressing underlying social deter- minants of disease, such as school retention, food insecurity and local economic development. Developing local capacity to address local needs has become an overriding concern. Community-based health extension agents can e ectively bridge those needs with academic health center resources and extend those resources to address the underlying social deter- minants of disease. This innovative system also devel- oped a community-wide \"Nurse Advice Line\" in partnership with the public health department, managed care orga- nizations and university. It operates in rural and urban areas and receives 15,000 calls per month. The Nurse Advice Line has led to decreased emer- gency department visits, increased medical homes and coordinated care (patient records are faxed to the medical home the next day). The state health department monitors the Nurse Advice Line to identify illness statewide. /I.sc/m.sc/p.sc/o.sc/r.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /f.sc/o.sc/r.sc /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /G.sc/e.sc/o.sc/r.sc/g.sc/e.sc' /s.sc /C.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/y.sc The ethnically diverse population served by the model system is akin to the diverse population of Prince George's County, and the School of Public Health (SPH) has faculty members with extensive experience working with the Extension Service system in Maryland. Many University of Maryland School of Public Health faculty members are well-versed in conducting community-based needs assessments and identifying key community priorities, as performed by this model system. Many les- sons from this system can inform the development of a new health care system in Prince George's County. SYSTEM 2 /S.sc/y.sc/s.sc/t.sc/e.sc/m.sc /C.sc/h.sc/a.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/s.sc This system is a not-for-prot orga- nization with multiple components, including 23 hospitals, more than 165 clinics, around 1,000 employed physicians and other providers. Its multi-specialty medical group operates physician clinics, pharmacies, hospital units and urgent care clinics. Moreover, the system owns six community clinics and supports 13 community clinics, all serving and low-income, homeless and uninsured patients. While it is a \"tight system\" with one board of directors, it also works with other insurers and providers. It has a health care insurance component that covers about 650,000 individuals, which represents approxi- mately one-quarter of the population in the state. This organization mainly serves an urban area where around 90 percent of the population lives in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Its clinical programs include cardiovas- cular, oncology, women and newborns, primary care, intensive medicine, surgical services, pediatric specialties, and behavioral health. This system's biggest problem in terms of geographic distribution of resources is the large undocumented immigrant population, which they mainly serve through low- income clinics and federally qualied 211health centers. Nine percent of the patients this organization serves are non-paying patients, but this organi- zation treats all its patients as if they are covered under its health insurance plan. The physicians employed by this organization are more likely to be welcoming of this non-paying popula- tion than non-employed or aliated physicians. This organization's focus on keeping patients healthy and out of the hospital requires a mindset that di ers from traditional hospitals. /F.sc/i.sc/n.sc/a.sc/n.sc/c.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /S.sc/t.sc/r.sc/u.sc/c.sc/t.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc In terms of nancing mechanisms, 23 percent of their patients are covered under Medicare, 11 percent under Med- icaid, 51 percent are privately insured, 9 percent are uninsured and 6 percent are covered through other means. The organization's health insurance plan is a managed care plan in the sense it is focused on managing overall patient care with the aim of improving health outcomes. In addition, it collaborates with several national health insurance plans to manage the care this organiza- tion provides to the insured population. For example, it focuses on coordinating patient care and ensuring continuity of care, and o ers other insurance plans a \"better deal\" if they agree to use only its facilities and physicians with whom it collaborates. This organization believes this approach increases the quality of care delivered to the patient and also reduces costs due to decreased adverse events. Its philosophy is that unnecessary care is not a source of revenue; rather, it is a source of damage to both the patient and to those who are paying the patient's health care bill. Thus, it is now developing payment mechanisms for both its employee-physicians and aliated physicians that will reward them for avoiding unneces- sary procedures and treatment, and increasing the health of their patients in order to reduce the need for such services. According to the senior vice president of this organization, as a non-prot hospital, their \"shareholders\" are patients. Its goal is to do the best for their patients, not increase prots. /I.sc/n.sc/n.sc/o.sc/v.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc /P.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc The system has developed information technology systems including \"deci- sion support information\" that helps providers implement \"best practices\" by prompting them to ask key ques- tions, schedule preventive services, make follow up appointments at the time of hospital discharge, etc. In place of increased revenue from admissions, physicians receive incentives in their payment systems for keeping patients healthy. They focus on cost savings by preventing unnecessary re-admissions. For example, nurse practitioners are \"embedded\" in nursing homes so they can o er comprehensive follow-up care for elderly patients when they return from a hospitalization. They also work with home agencies so that physicians follow patients from hospital to home health care. Using insurance records, the system tracks prescriptions (lled/not lled) for patients with chronic diseases to monitor compliance with medications. The focus is especially on diabetes, asthma, mental illness, cognitive heart failure and chronic cancers (e.g. pros- tate). By using metrics/ goals for each disease, they track improved health outcomes, cost savings, and decreased emergency department visits and hos- pitalizations. Moreover, providers focus on intensive prevention and general wellness when possible (e.g. address obesity, exercise and good nutrition to prevent diabetes). When that isn't pos- sible, they focus on preventing further complications of a disease. For mental illness, they have adopted a mental health specialist integrated into the primary health care team. The mental health specialist is part of the initial vis- its and trains primary care providers to become more mental health competent. Finally, the organization regularly implements policy changes based on data and evidence-based practices. In conclusion, this organization's main goal is to get its patients healthy and to keep them healthy. /I.sc/m.sc/p.sc/o.sc/r.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /f.sc/o.sc/r.sc /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /G.sc/e.sc/o.sc/r.sc/g.sc/e.sc' /s.sc /C.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/y.sc While this system is much larger than one County, it o ers many lessons for Prince George's County. Its focus on health promotion and disease preven- tion as a standard of practice addresses both quality and cost issues. The system leaders' philosophy is that the best patient care keeps people healthy and out of hospitals. They achieve this goal with innovative approaches such as adherence to disease preven- tion protocols and metrics for chronic diseases, technology designed to help practitioners meet these metrics, comprehensive follow-up care after a hospitalization, and case management for all elderly patients who leave the hospital. Their team approach to care, with bundled payments and nancial rewards for e ective team care, has also helped achieve this goal. This system also treats a large immigrant population, as does the County.

It serves more than 2.6 million residents in 42 counties as a not-for-prot, fully integrated health services organization. The physician-led system includes a multi-disciplinary physician group practice with system-wide aligned goals, clinical programs, an informa- tion technology platform, a robust research program and an insurance provider. This system includes three hospitals, 38 community centers with /c.sc/o.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/r.sc/a.sc/b.sc/l.sc/e.sc /m.sc/o.sc/d.sc/e.sc/l.sc/s.sc212/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc 800 employed physicians (primary care and specialists) and other providers.

Patient insurance includes the follow- ing sources: Medicare (39 percent), Medicaid (12 percent), private insur- ance (44 percent) and other sources (3 percent), with only 2 percent uninsured. /I.sc/n.sc/n.sc/o.sc/v.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc /P.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc The system has also developed exten- sive information technology that helps providers follow \"best practices\" in hospital treatment and follow up care. It developed a team-based, multi-dis- ciplinary, multi-specialty approach to treatment based on bundled payment for services. Each team is responsible for patient outcomes, conducts tasks to meet established metrics and receives nancial incentives for patient outcomes.

In addition to \"brick and mortar\" health clinics, the program also has mobile clinics that travel through- out areas of the County. All clinics are sta ed by medical professionals and are independently operated by non- government entities. The program aims to ensure that all residents of the County are able to obtain good health care services, regardless of their health care insur- ance status or income. There are 28 health clinics available throughout the County in multiple communities. Clinics provide basic, essential health care ser- vices, such as oce visits with medical professionals, medications/prescrip- tions, wellness check-ups, screenings, chronic disease management (i.e. diabetes and high blood pressure), as well as referrals for specialty care and dental services. The program also o ers a wide range of assistance to adults experiencing homelessness. There are more than 75 sites located throughout the County. A variety of critical services are o ered. Each site o ers specic types of assistance, including shelter, housing, food, emergency assistance, pharmacy assistance, transportation to medical appointments, STD screening, repro- ductive and mental health, nancial assistance, clothing, supplies for infants (i.e. diapers and formula) and other social services. /S.sc/y.sc/s.sc/t.sc/e.sc/m.sc /F.sc/i.sc/n.sc/a.sc/n.sc/c.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc The County provides partial funding to support a network of non-prot health clinics. The program relies on pro bono care from providers and donated clinic space. Each of these facilities has a distinctive history and culture, as well as their own additional funding sources. /I.sc/m.sc/p.sc/o.sc/r.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /f.sc/o.sc/r.sc /P.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /G.sc/e.sc/o.sc/r.sc/g.sc/e.sc' /s.sc /C.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/y.sc While this County program serves the uninsured, it is preparing for major changes when many more people become insured through the A ordable Care Act. Program sta are concerned that it will become will be even more dicult for the uninsured population to obtain care when providers are busier with a larger, insured population. They believe that the remaining uninsured population will comprise many undocu-mented people who will have limited access to care. This program's prepara- tion can inform Prince George's County as of data were used by the Public Health Impact Study investigators: 1) hospital data used for T echnical Reports 4 and 6; 2) health care provider data used for T echnical Reports 3, 4 and 6; and 3) population demographic data used for T echnical Reports 1, 3, 4 and 6. The data sources are organized in these three categories.HOSPITAL DATA SOURCES For Maryland-specic data we used data that originated from the Mary-land Health Services Cost Review Commission, but were provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the University of Maryland Medical System only for purposes of this study. Similarly, data that originated from the Dis-trict of Columbia were provided to us by the University of Maryland Medical System for this study.Data Source Time Period Description of Source Description of Use American Hospital Directory Ahd.comFY 2010 The American Hospital Directory is an online resource for data on hospital characteristics.Used to determine the total discharges for each Prince George's County hospital in scal year 2010 Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) FY 2007, 2008, 2009 HSCRC collects a variety of hospital information including hospital discharge and hospital readmissions dataUsed discharge and readmissions data as the outcome variables in the econometric analysis DHMH Board of Dental Examiners 2011 Lists licensed dentists and dental hygienists, their primary practice address and specialty status for dentists Used to assess the count and ratio of dentists, dental hygienists and dental care providers DHMH Board of Nursing 2011 Lists licensed nurse practitioners, their specialty and their primary practice address.

U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Estimates of the Population 2007 The Annual Estimates of the Population provides information such as the number of residents in specic jurisdictions Used to analyze the data on population size for Prince George's County for trend comparisons 215/a.sc/p.sc/p.sc/e.sc/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SOURCES All data on the eight categories of provider groups were obtained directly from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's respective boards that oversee licensure and relicensure. POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS SOURCES We used the U.S. Census data for our population demographic and size information. /A.sc/p.sc/p.sc/e.sc/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/x.sc /B.sc /S.sc/t.sc/u.sc/d.sc/y.sc /L.sc/i.sc/m.sc/i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc In reviewing the results of our study, the following limitations should be kept in mind: TECHNICAL REPORT 1: RANDOM HOUSEHOLD HEALTH SURVEY The limitations of time and resources constrained the length of the survey and resulted in limiting the questions about health behaviors. In addition, the questions related to race and ethnicity did not provide sucient sub-group data within racial categories and thus analyses within racial categories were not possible. TECHNICAL REPORT 2: INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS While our results present ndings from stakeholders in a range of categories, not all identied stakeholders were able to participate in the study. This may have left a gap in the overall assess-ment of input from stakeholders. TECHNICAL REPORT 3: PHYSICIAN COUNTS AND CATEGORIZATION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND AND PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Our approach to physician counts varies from other studies. We focused on identifying those physicians who are licensed, providing patient care at least 20 hours per week and who have completed their specialty boards. This approach is designed to address cur-rent high-quality, patient care capacity in the County. It is most aligned with the MHCC Hogan Report and di er- ences are described. We also describe these di erences when our ndings are compared with other reports and provide a very detailed description of our methods to facilitate discussions about the physician workforce. Our approach is internally consistent and should not a ect our comparisons with other jurisdictions. Since our counts were developed to be used for geographic analyses at the level of ZIP codes, we did not include a number of physicians who declared the County as their jurisdiction, but whose ZIP code was outside the County. This included a total of 48 physicians of which 18 are primary care physicians. TECHNICAL REPORT 4: IDENTIFICATION OF GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF NEED FOR PRIMARY CARE Our geographic analyses used both ZIP code-level data and data at the level of seven Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) to provide sub-county level information. Use of ZIP codes for provider-to-population ratios can generate results that are skewed due to the variation in the size of the popula-tion within a given ZIP code and the number of providers in that same code. We projected need for primary care providers using counts derived from PUMA parameters. Because we used PUMAs, which consist of about 100,000 residents each, we may have lost some more detailed and accurate data than would have been available had we used census tracks. Since there is no match between ZIP codes and census tracks, time did not permit the extensive coding needed to use census tracts. Our identica-tion of primary care need \"hot spots\" gives equal weight to three categories of factors (primary care physicians, hospital encounters and population characteristics), each of which come from di erent sources of data. 216/U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc /m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/o.sc/l.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc/h.sc TECHNICAL REPORT 5: OVERVIEW OF PUBLIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES We used predominately secondary data to identify the range of pro-grams and resources in the County. We did not conduct a direct review of these activities. A critical review of these activities is needed to determine their actual capacity. TECHNICAL REPORT 6: CURRENT EXPERIENCES (2007-2009) AND FUTURE PROJECTIONS OF PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY RESIDENTS' HOSPITAL ENCOUNTERS The data used for these analyses were specic to County residents' hospi-tal encounters and do not include emergency department use. The projections of future hospital dis-charges are based on 2009 discharges and population growth rates between 2000 and 2010 census data at the level of ZIP codes, and do not take into account any increases in provid-ers or any variations in their practices. These analyses do not include non-county residents who use and are discharged by county hospitals. TECHNICAL REPORT 7: ASSESSMENT OF COMPARABLE MODEL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS Time limited our interviews with one informant per health care system. HEALTH OUTCOME MEASURES AND PROJECTIONS The data presented for the baseline and projected rate of emergency depart-ment (ED) visits per 100,000 is limited to use of EDs in Maryland, and does not include the District of Columbia hospitals. Approximately 25 percent of County residents use the latter hospi-tals for their care. DATA ON PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE We used relicensure data for all eight workforce categories. We did not delineate hours of patient care per week or specialty status, except for the physician category. PROJECTION OF THE PRIMA - RY CARE WORKFORCE NEED We only used provider-to-population ratios to project the number of pro-viders needed by PUMA. The ratios used to determine sucient needs are ones HRSA has referenced when documenting provider need. We realize provider-to-population ratios are not the only indicator of need for care and future assessments would benet from assessing population health status, travel distances to clinics and other variables. We also did not consider subspecialty provider to population ratios in our projections.217/T.sc/e.sc/c.sc/h.sc/n.sc/i.sc/c.sc/a.sc/l.sc /R.sc/e.sc/p.sc/o.sc/r.sc/t.sc/s.sc Index Plan with Stratication

From hospitals to health clinics, Prince Georgians and other Marylanders living in the southern region of the state have been limited in their access to healthcare. According to a 2009 RAND Corporation report, it was critical that the County take strong and decisive action to improve access to quality healthcare. The County Council was the catalyst for the RAND report, which served as a basis to garner the support of other partners\u2014state government, the University of Maryland Medical System, and Dimensions Healthcare. It is clear that strong communities have excellent health indicators. A healthy community leads to positive health indicators including high academic outcomes, low crime, and a strong commercial tax base. In order for Prince George's County to fulfill our destiny as a vibrant community, it is imperative that we focus on improving the health and wellness throughout the County. We must continue our emphasis on healthy living to ensure that our healthcare delivery system is equipped to address the needs of our residents. This will require us to accomplish the following key goals: Expand access to high-quality, pa tient-centered primary care Improv e the health status of all Prince Georgians Advance healthcar e as one of the economic drivers for the County This strategic plan will guide us as we build a strong foundation for success. It is grounded by a tremendous collaboration between the State of Maryland, the University of Maryland Medical System, Dimensions Healthcare System, The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and Prince George's County. These partners and other stakeholders are committed to improving access to healthcare, improved health outcomes, and a high-quality system of primary care. All stakeholders have worked diligently to advance our healthcare delivery system in Prince George's County. This strategic plan will provide us with a road map that will lead to a world-class healthcare system for all Prince Georgians and residents of Southern Maryland. Rushern L. Baker, III County Executive Prince George's County PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION vi PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION vii PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Prince George's County, Maryland, is boldly moving forward with its mission to improve the health and quality of life for its residents. This effort began with the 2009 RAND report, Assessing Health and Health Care in Prince George's County. The report concluded that high rates of chronic conditions, social-economic disparities within the County, and limited primary care capacity made establishment of a primary care system an urgent concern. It also concluded that high numbers of residents traveling outside of the County for healthcare impeded economic development and that improving overall health required strengthening the public health system and addressing social determinants of health. Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker, III, made healthcare one of his administration's top priorities and committed to the improvement of the County's healthcare delivery system in order to improve the health outcomes of County residents. To inform the design of an improved system, the University of Maryland School of Public Health was commissioned to assess its potential public health impact. This work resulted in the 2012 report, Transforming Health in Prince George's County, Maryland: A Public Health Impact Study. The report presented three broad recommendations to support a successful new healthcare system: 1. Develop a Coun ty-led process to improve public health, expand access to high-quality primary care, and support systems integration. 2. Develop a clear br and that promotes a high- quality healthcare system, encourages residents to return to the County for care, and contributes to a successful and thriving system. 3. Establish a high-quality , academically affiliated Regional Medical Center with a strong and collaborative prevention-focused ambulatory care network. In response to these recommendations, John Snow, Inc., a public health consulting company, was engaged to develop a primary healthcare strategic plan for Prince George's County, focusing on a County-led process to improve public health and expand access to high-quality primary care while also creating a branding and marketing strategy. The establishment of a Regional Medical Center is proceeding in a parallel but separate process. Development of the Prince George's County Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan (the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan) was carried out under the direction of the Office of the County Executive, the Board of Health, and the Health Department. These project leaders defined goals for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan and convened an Advisory Committee and a Stakeholders Committee to guide and inform the strategy development. These goals are: 1. Expand access to patien t-centered primary care services within Prince George's County. 2. Improv e the health of all Prince George's County residents. 3. Advance the healthcar e industry's contribution to Prince George's County's economic development. The Advisory Committee, consisting of senior leaders from State and County agencies, healthcare organizations, and academic institutions, focused on the broader policy issues and ensured that the plan would meet the collective needs of Prince George's County. The Stakeholders Committee, with representatives from community providers, health plans, advocacy organizations, and Council appointees, brought the perspectives of their individual organizations and/or constituencies to plan development. Throughout the process, Advisory and Stakeholders Committee members provided input and feedback on research findings and preliminary recommendations through quarterly meetings and follow-up interviews. Advisory and Stakeholder members also served on workgroup committees that developed recommendations on three key areas: physician recruitment and retention, work force development, and community benefit. Contributions by the Advisory, Stakeholders, and PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION viii Workgroup Committees were invaluable in keeping the process focused and formulating a strategic plan that could achieve its goals. Further, the spirit of collaboration built among the participants was a hallmark of the planning process, and Prince George's County is committed to ensuring that stakeholder engagement and collaboration continue through plan implementation and into the future. Significant contributions to the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan also came from over 300 Prince George's County residents who participated in one or more of the five community meetings held throughout the County. Through guided discussions and polling, participants provided information about where they go for primary healthcare services, how they define quality healthcare, and barriers to primary care and good health. Findings from the community meetings were incorporated into presentations to the Advisory and Stakeholders Committees. Input from populations that may not have been as well represented at the community meetings (Hispanic/Latinos, young professionals and families, other recent immigrants) was obtained through follow-up interviews with representatives from these populations. Finally, the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan recommendations were informed by prior studies, secondary market data, census data, and site visits to Prince George's County as well as by industry state-of-the-art best practices. This collaborative and informed process resulted in recommendations for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. The recommendations will collectively contribute to the County meeting the three goals as defined for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. In addition, the process resulted in a recommended marketing and branding strategy focused on physician recruitment and retention, getting residents to return to the County for their healthcare and building a culture of health that will inspire residents to engage in improving their own health and well-being.Summary of Recommendations for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan To achieve the goal of expanding access to primary healthcare services, the County would need a multipronged approach: 1. Increase patien t-centered primary care practices in high-need areas. 2. Build capacity of exis ting primary care practices to operate as patient-centered medical homes. 3. Build collabora tion among Prince George's County hospitals. 4. Develop w ork force to support patient- centered primary care. 5. Implement a marke ting and branding campaign. 6. Establish a Prince Geor ge's County Primary Healthcare Alliance (Primary Healthcare Alliance). 7. Develop and implemen t a monitoring and evaluation plan. Recommendation #1: Increase patient-centered primary care practices in high-need areas.Provide incentives to recruit and retain primary care providers in high-need areas, designated as Health Investment Zones. Health Investment Zones have primary care provider shortages and socioeconomic indicators that impact health. Recommended incentives include but are not limited to: Establish Prince Geor ge's HealthAssure, a program that provides access to primary healthcare services for low-income patients. Secure reduced lease pa yments for primary care practices in the Health Investment Zones. Establish a plan t o secure federal and state loan repayment to physicians and dentists that choose to practice in Prince George's County at sites located in federally designated health professional shortage areas or for health professional shortage area-designated organizations.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION ix PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION Provide low-cost working capital loans to cover st art-up costs. These include operating losses during ramp-up period (12 to 18 months), purchase of equipment such as an electronic medical record system, and income guarantees for physicians and midlevel providers. Establish a plan t o subsidize malpractice costs for certain primary care practices. The County would promote hiring of primary care physicians and midlevel providers by federally qualified health centers, which usually have their malpractice costs covered. Establish opportunities f or residency training (medical and dental) in Prince George's County provider organizations, and develop a program to compensate physicians who agree to serve as preceptors at these sites. Recommendation #2: Build capacity of existing primary care practices to operate as patient-centered medical homes. Operating as a patient-centered medical home requires significant resources that are often not available to primary care practices. Further, patient-centered medical homes require staff to support care coordination, mental health integration, and population health management. Recommendations to increase the number of patient-centered medical homes in the County include: Encourag e the development of a private management service organization to provide services that enable primary care practices to operate as patient-centered medical homes. Expand clinical training opportunities within the Coun ty to accommodate training sites for the proposed work force. Prioritize impro ving the quality of customer service of all staff in healthcare fields, and provide customer service training to future clinical, public health, and administrative support staff. Recommendation #3: Build collaboration among Prince George's County hospitals. Build collaboration among hospitals within Prince George's County to develop complementary centers of excellence that would ensure residents have access to a full spectrum of high-quality healthcare services within an integrated delivery system. Support developmen t of hospital-based integrated delivery systems, including the new Regional Medical Center. Work collectiv ely to promote transitional care between hospitals and primary care providers to ensure appropriate primary care access and engagement among County residents. Achieve c ollaboration among Prince George's County hospitals and the Health Department to conduct community health needs assessment and carry out community health improvement programs. Creat e the Prince George's County Community Health Benefits Partnership to ensure collaboration among Prince George's County hospitals and the Health Department, to conduct community health needs assessment and to carry out community health improvement programs. Recommendation #4: Develop work force to support patient-centered primary care. Convene s takeholders with a shared mission of increasing and improving work force capacity. Creat e a systematic work force development plan for the County designed to meet the needs and demands of the patient-centered medical home model. Give priority to Coun ty residents and educational resources to achieve the proposed work force. Prioritize quality cust omer service training.

Develop and implement a marketing and branding strategy to accomplish two targeted marketing goals: (1) recruit and retain primary care providers; and (2) increase the number of Coun ty residents that choose to receive healthcare services within Prince George's County. Creat e and carry out marketing campaigns designed for identified market segments. Use common branding acr oss all marketing efforts. The proposed brand is \" Prince George's County, Our Health Matters!\" Recommendation #6: Establish a Primary Healthcare Alliance.Establish the Primary Healthcare Alliance, an independent, stakeholder-led entity, whose mission would be to transform health and healthcare in Prince George's County by leading, collaborating, and aligning efforts to improve primary care delivery. The initial priority for the Primary Healthcare Alliance would be to implement the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. Secure sust ainable funding. Convene the initial Boar d of Directors to serve as the governing body of the Primary Healthcare Alliance. Hire the Primary Healthc are Alliance's executive director and launch operations. Recommendation #7: Develop and implement a monitoring and evaluation plan. Develop and implement a monitoring and evaluation plan to assess whether the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is being implemented successfully and achieving desired outcomes. Define the monitoring and evaluation process and outc ome metrics, data sources, baseline values, and benchmark goals. Design report car d or other way of reporting results. Phasing Plan for Strategy Implementation The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan would be implemented in phases over a five-year period to balance resource requirements and align with supporting initiatives. An important step would be to convene the Board of Directors and establish the Primary Healthcare Alliance. The Primary Healthcare Alliance, an independent, stakeholder-led entity, whose mission would be to transform health and healthcare in Prince George's County by leading, collaborating, and aligning efforts to improve primary care delivery. Roles and responsibilities of the Primary Healthcare Alliance would include: Facilita te implementation of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. Administer the Prince Geor ge's HealthAssure Program. Creat e and provide support to Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership. Oversee the monit oring and evaluation plan. A broad implementation phasing plan is outlined below. Initial Steps and Ongoing: Establish Primar y Healthcare Alliance.

Develop and pr omote Largo Town Center Life Sciences Center as \"one-stop shopping for health\"\u2014medical care, social services, pharmacy, fitness centers, healthy food options, and other health-supporting products/services.The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan reflects the ongoing commitment of Prince George's County to improving the healthcare system and the health of its residents. The plan focuses both on expanding access to patient-centered primary care that is part of an integrated care system and on building a culture of health within the County. In order to achieve the \"triple aim\"\u2014improving health outcomes, reducing per capita costs, and improving patient experience\u2014it will be necessary to improve coordination of care within and across systems. The County must also continue to address the conditions that shape health in the environments where people live, work, and play. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan fully embraces these concepts of population health and is on the leading edge of healthcare reform in the United States. Once implemented in collaboration with all partners and stakeholders, the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan will reach its goals of expanding access and improving residents' health while contributing to the County's economic development.

PRIMARY HEALTHCARE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR TOMORROW Introduction Prince George's County, Maryland, is boldly moving forward with its mission to improve the health and quality of life for its residents. This effort began with the 2009 RAND report, Assessing Health and Health Care in Prince George's County. In 2009, the Prince George's County Council, concerned about the relatively poor health status of the County's residents, engaged the RAND Corporation to study the healthcare needs of its residents and the capacity of the County's healthcare system to meet those needs. In response to the study findings, Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker, III, placed healthcare as one of his administration's top priorities. In July 2011, leaders from Prince George's County, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the University of Maryland Medical System, the Dimensions Healthcare System, and the University System of Maryland signed a memorandum of understanding to address longstanding challenges and gaps in the County's healthcare delivery system. Their goal was to achieve improved health for the County, including a Regional Medical Center supported by a comprehensive ambulatory care and primary care network. To inform the design of a new system to improve health and healthcare in Prince George's County, the University of Maryland School of Public Health was commissioned to assess the proposed system's potential public health impact while answering key questions. This work resulted in the 2012 report, Transforming Health in Prince George's County, Maryland: A Public Health Impact Study (Public Health Impact Study). The report presented three broad recommendations to support a successful new healthcare system: 1. Develop a Coun ty-led process to improve public health, expand access to high-quality primary care, and support systems integration. 2. Develop a clear br and that promotes a high- quality healthcare system, encourages residents to return to the County for care, and contributes to a successful and thriving system. 3. Establish a high-quality, academically affiliated Regional Medical Center with a strong and collaborative prevention-focused ambulatory care network. In response to these recommendations, John Snow, Inc., a public health consulting company, was engaged to facilitate the development of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan while incorporating the above recommendations. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan project focused on two recommendations: expand access to high-quality primary care, and create a clear brand. The establishment of a Regional Medical Center is proceeding in a parallel but separate process. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan project was conducted under the joint leadership of the Office of the County Executive, the Prince George's County Board of Health, and the Prince George's County Health Department. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan was developed through a collaborative process. Advisory and Stakeholders Committees provided feedback throughout the planning process. The Advisory Committee provided policy oversight to ensure that the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan would meet the collective needs of Prince George's County, while the Stakeholders Committee brought the perspectives of their individual organizations and constituencies. Members of both committees provided input during regularly scheduled meetings, workgroups focused on key topics, and one-on-one interviews. Additionally, five community meetings were held to obtain direct input from County residents. While attendance at the community meetings was strong, not all County demographics were well represented, and input from other relevant stakeholders was sought. Data and information were gathered from local, state, and national sources to further inform strategy development and build upon work completed by the RAND Corporation and the PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 2 University of Maryland School of Public Health. A review was conducted of published industry best practices. A hallmark of the planning process was the collaboration built among all stakeholders. Prince George's County is committed to ensuring that this collaboration continues and that there is an infrastructure to support successful implementation, in conjunction with monitoring and evaluation, of the proposed recommendations. Throughout planning, stakeholders emphasized the importance of developing a plan that would facilitate transition from strategy to implementation. Additionally, it was requested that this plan be developed to sustain the County's efforts while addressing healthcare needs into the future. Goals for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan Expanding Access, Improving Health Outcomes, and Economic Development The goals for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan are to: 1. Expand access to patien t-centered primary care. 2. Improv e the health status of all Prince George's County citizens. 3. Advance healthcar e as one of the economic drivers for Prince George's County. Recommendations developed through the planning process were evaluated to ensure that they were practicable in achieving the overall goals. Expanding Access to Patient-Centered Primary CareThe proposed Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan calls for a three-pronged approach to expanding patient-centered primary care: 1. Adding new primary c are practices within areas of high primary care needs (referred to as Health Investment Zones). 2. Increasing the number of primary c are practices operating as patient-centered medical homes. Access to Pati ent- Centered Primary Care Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan Improved Health OutcomesEconomic Development Figure 1. Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan Key Goals3. Building hospital-affilia ted primary care networks. The Public Health Impact Study quantified the additional need of 61 primary care physicians in the County, resulting from the application of the Health Resources and Services Administration primary care physician-to-population ratios. Although the overall shortage of primary care physicians for Prince George's County was estimated to be 61, the need was not evenly distributed throughout the County. The shortage of primary care physicians was concentrated in the inner Beltway and the southern part of the County. In addition, the Public Health Impact Study created a measure of primary care that took into consideration health indicators (readmission rates and hospital discharges) related to patient-centered primary care and social determinants of health (household income, and education levels). Those areas with high primary care needs and tending to high primary care needs are designated as Health Investment Zones and are of immediate priority for expanding access to patient-centered primary care.

Site selection. 2. A care pr ogram based upon demographics of the population. 3. A facility design to support the c are program. 4. A business model to achiev e financially viable practices. Expansion of access to patient-centered primary care in Prince George's County means increasing the number of primary care physicians and midlevel providers, but it also means expanding the capacity of primary care practices to transform into patient-centered medical homes. Prince George's County lags behind neighboring jurisdictions in the number of physician practices accredited or certified as patient-centered medical homes. Transformation requires the model of care to become a team-based, integrated patient-centered medical home. Such transformation requires resources and also has implications for work force development as new types of professionals are needed to support patient-centered care and population health management. This plan's recommendations provide approaches on how to increase patient-centered medical home capacity within Prince George's County's primary care physician practices as well as how to strengthen a healthcare work force to support such transformation. Improving Health OutcomesAlthough some health indicators have improved, according to the 2014 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings, Prince George's County was ranked 14th on health factors (health behaviors, clinical care, social factors, physical environment) out of the 24 Maryland counties. The County was ranked even lower (21st) in the category of clinical care that includes percentage measures of uninsured, physician-to-population ratios, preventable hospitalizations, and health screenings. While access to patient-centered primary care is a key component of improving health outcomes, stakeholders, including local community members, stressed how important it is to identify contributing social determinants of health and population health management components. Hence, recommendations for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan were developed using a social-ecological approach to health promotion. A social-ecological model contextualizes individual behavior within social and physical environments, recognizing that sustaining changes in health behaviors require policies, environments, and social systems that address the determinants of health and support positive lifestyle habits. Further, the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan would bridge primary care and public health to create an integrated system of care focused on population health. Economic DevelopmentThe healthcare and life sciences industry has been identified as one of four industries targeted for economic development within the County. Based upon information collected from community meetings, a significant percentage of County residents continue to seek healthcare services outside of the County. Evidence-based literature or studies confirm that the reasons for leaving the County do not appear to pertain to race/ethnicity. A perceived lack of quality services was often noted as a reason for going elsewhere for services. In addition, County residents spoke of the perceived lack of board-certified physicians, customer-friendly staff, and pleasant physical facilities. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan focuses on building community-based primary care that will help to improve health outcomes while supporting economic development. Primary care practices will provide employment to physicians, midlevel providers, and support staff and will keep healthcare dollars in the County. Strong primary care networks would be able to enhance the coordination of care with all County hospitals, including the new Regional Medical Center. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 5 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPatient-Centered Medical Home The patient-centered medical home is a model of primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, coordinated, and accessible and focused on quality and safety. A patient-centered medical home is a place where patients are treated with respect, dignity, and compassion and where patients' privacy is maintained. The patient-centered medical homes improve healthcare delivery and health through innovative approaches to care coordination and chronic disease management, enabling strong and trusting relationships with providers and staff. What Does it Mean to Be a Medical Home? 1. Comprehensive. A team of care providers is wholly accountable for a patient's physical and mental health needs, including prevention and wellness and acute and chronic care. 2. Whole-Person, P atient-Centered Care. A partnership among providers, patients, and their families/caregivers that respects patients' needs and preferences. Patients receive education and support to engage and participate in their own care. 3. Coordinat ed. Care is organized across broader healthcare systems, including access to specialists, hospitals, home healthcare, community services, and public health. 4. Accessible. Pa tients are able to access primary care services with shorter wait times for appointments and urgent care, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Patients are able to communicate with providers through health information technology innovations. 5. High Quality. Clinicians and s taff provide high-quality care and are committed to quality improvement to ensure that patients and families/caregivers make informed decisions about their health and to ensure patient safety. Why Should Practices Choose to Become a Patient-Centered Medical Home? Primary care practices transform to patient-centered medical homes to improve the care they provide to their patients and their overall health outcomes. Primary care practices recognized as patient-centered medical homes are seen as providing high-quality care by consumers and health plans. Many incentive programs exist to encourage practices to become patient-centered medical homes, including several within Maryland. These initiatives have shown positive outcomes, including fewer visits to the emergency room, improved access, increased prevention services, improved patient and clinician satisfaction, and improved health. Several national organizations provide patient-centered medical home recognition or accreditation. Those organizations are the Joint Commission, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc., and the National Committee for Quality Assurance.

What Are the Key Factors in the Social-Ecological Model? The social-ecological model identifies various factors at multiple levels that come together to influence health, such as: Societal/P olicy factors that include social and cultural norms; health, economic, educational, and social policies; and federal policies. Community factor s that include availability and accessibility of places that promote health, for example where people live, work, and play. Organiz ational factors that include workplace policies, along with the availability of community-based and social service organizations. Interper sonal factors that include relationships with providers, family, friends, intimate partners, and peers. Individual factor s that include personal history and biological factors such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity. How Does Understanding the Social-Ecological Model Help to Promote Health? The social-ecological model tells us that many factors influence our health. In recognizing this fact, we can make sure to target prevention efforts and solutions at all levels and especially at the interactions among levels. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prevention efforts are more likely to be sustained if they are implemented across the continuum. A similar model is used for the County Health Rankings, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation program. Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

THE NEED FOR THE PRIMARY HEALTHCARE STRATEGIC PLAN The need for a primary healthcare strategic plan for Prince George's County was clearly identified in the research and technical studies conducted by the Public Health Impact Study. The more recent data and information obtained for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan continued to support this need. The following sections provide an overview of the current conditions that support the need for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan, the challenges that must be overcome or at least mitigated for the plan to be successful, and the opportunities for addressing challenges and successfully implementing the comprehensive Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. Assessment of the Current Conditions The need for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan was driven by several factors summarized below. Prince George's County residents experience higher rates of chronic diseases and poor health outcomes, both of which can be improved with access to quality primary care services provided within an integrated delivery system. Prince George's County residents experience higher rates of asthma, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer when compared to state averages, according to the findings from the Public Health Impact Study. Further, rates were found to be higher within the African-American population, despite Prince George's County being home to 5 of the 10 most affluent African-American communities in the United States. Although some improvements in health outcomes have been made according to the Prince George's County Health Department's Health Report 2014 , County residents continue to have poorer health compared to the surrounding counties. A primary goal of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is to improve health outcomes for all citizens of Prince George's County. Compared to surrounding counties and the State of Maryland as a whole, Prince George's County has a substantially lower ratio of primary care providers-to-population (medical and dental). The areas of highest primary care needs are in the inner Beltway and southern part of the County. Prince George's County also has fewer midlevel providers, who are increasingly important, to meet the need for patient-centered primary care services. The Public Health Impact Study indicated a need for 61 primary care providers and 31 dental providers. Although there have been new primary care practice sites established in the County since the study was completed, Prince George's County continues to lag behind the state and surrounding counties in population-to-primary care provider ratios for medical, dental, and mental health, according to the 2014 County Health Rankings. A major goal of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is to provide the blueprint to increase the number and capacity of Primary Care physicians practicing in Prince George's County, while decreasing the demand for primary care providers through health promotion and disease prevention. Prince George's County has relatively fewer primary care providers that have achieved patient-centered medical home recognition/accreditation from national accrediting organizations as well as fewer providers participating in the state-sponsored, patient-centered medical home program. Achievement of patient-centered medical home recognition/accreditation indicates that a primary care practice has implemented policies, procedures, and systems to support patient-centered care and population health management. Primary care practices that have not transformed to a patient-centered medical home may be less able to contract with health plans and participate in alternative payment arrangements that include quality and shared PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 8 cost savings bonuses. Primary care practices that are not operating as patient-centered medical homes may also lack the ability to support population health management and achieve desired improvements in health outcomes for their patients or communities. Patient-centered primary care is not only the best practice model within the healthcare industry currently but is the model of care desired by Prince George's County residents. Community meeting participants consistently expressed the desire to obtain services from patient-centered medical homes as well as the need for patient-centered medical homes that can serve persons with disabilities. A goal of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is to encourage transformation to patient-centered medical homes among new and existing providers in Prince George's County. Sufficiently sized space (minimum of 6,000 square feet) that can house primary care practices is lacking in Prince George's County generally and especially in low-income areas. Not only are low-income areas disproportionately in need of primary care, they are also disproportionately less likely to have the physical space to accommodate a new primary care practice. This makes increasing the number and capacity of primary care practices a challenge. A relatively large number of Prince George's County residents choose to access healthcare services outside of the County. The fact that Prince George's County residents travel outside of the County for healthcare services has been substantiated through the household survey completed as a part of the Public Health Impact Study, the real-time survey of residents attending community meetings, and Maryland hospital patient-origin studies. On an average, 50 percent of the County residents, including many long-time residents who attended the four local community meetings, indicated that they travel outside of Prince George's County for primary healthcare services. A desire for timely access to high-quality, patient-centered care was often noted as a reason for going elsewhere for healthcare services. A disproportionate percentage of Prince George's County residents are uninsured relative to the County's population. It is expected that this situation will continue even after full implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, given the number of new immigrants that settle in Prince George's County, specifically in the communities located in the northern part inside the inner Beltway. In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 21 percent of Maryland's uninsured lived in Prince George's County, and 14 percent lived in Baltimore with the remaining living elsewhere around the state. Further, the Urban Institute estimates that 382,000 Maryland residents will remain uninsured postimplementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , many of whom are undocumented immigrants. Assuming that the 21 percent uninsured remains constant, this equates to an estimated 80,000 Prince George's County residents being uninsured. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan includes developing an adequately funded and equitable program to provide access to primary care services for low-income, uninsured and underinsured residents. Maryland is shifting to global payments for the state's hospitals. On January 10, 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the State of Maryland jointly announced a new initiative to modernize Maryland's unique all-payer, rate-setting system for hospital services that will improve patient health and reduce costs. The state and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services believe that the new model will provide an opportunity for Maryland to reform its delivery system to align with the goals of delivering better health and better care at a lower cost. Under the new arrangement, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will require Maryland to PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 9 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONgenerate $330 million in Medicare savings over a five-year performance period. Maryland will shift virtually all of its hospital revenue over the five-year performance period into global payment models, providing an incentive for hospitals to work in partnership with other providers (including primary care providers) to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and readmissions. This shift to global payment for hospitals will change the landscape of primary healthcare delivery in the state, creating the need for a clear patient-centered, integrated primary healthcare plan to support all hospitals to establish better quality and reduce total cost of care. Challenges and Opportunities Challenges in and opportunities for implementing the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan and accomplishing the desired goals are summarized below. Some factors, such as Maryland's shift to global payment, represent both a challenge and an opportunity. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan was developed in the context of the existing conditions above with the challenges and opportunities discussed below. ChallengesPrince George's County has a socially, culturally, and economically diverse population. Prince George's County is a \"majority minority\" population. According to the 2013 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, Prince George's County's population is 63.7 percent Black or African-American, 16.2 percent Hispanic or Latino (any race), and 4.3 percent Asian\u2014nearly an 85-percent minority. The population is also diverse in economic status. Map 2: Race/ Ethnicity and P overty Distribution on page 12 provides a demographic profile by race/ethnicity and poverty levels based upon the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data. Across the United States, 5 of the 10 most affluent African-American communities are located within Prince George County where the average household income exceeds $100,000. On the other end of the spectrum are the communities primarily located inside the Beltway where the average household income is less than $60,000, and between 15 percent and almost 50 percent of the population are defined as low income (i.e., households below 200 percent of the federal poverty level). The lower-income geographic areas within Prince George's County are predominantly African-American and include Hispanics/Latinos, Caucasians, and, to a lesser extent, Africans and Asians. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan's development took into consideration diversity and community health needs obtained from secondary data sources (including the Public Health Impact Study household survey results and census data) and during community meetings and stakeholder interviews. Additional targeted primary research will add valuable information needed to implement the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan's multiple components. For example, families with young children, as well as Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and refugee populations, were not well represented at the community meetings. An effective marketing campaign must be developed and aimed at convincing residents within these population groups to choose Prince George's County providers for their healthcare. The following steps need to be carried out: 1. Conduct primary resear ch (focus groups, interviews, survey) to gather information about perceptions, preferences, and needs of all population groups. 2. Develop pot ential marketing messages and materials and pilot test with target audience. 3. Finalize messages and ma terials and communication channels. 4. Evalua te results.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 10 There is increasing competition for primary care providers and greater demands on primary care practices to become involved in population health management. More insured people, more integrated delivery systems, and the proliferation of urgent care centers have all contributed to increased demand for primary care providers. Maryland's recent shift to global payment for hospitals with cost and quality targets will further increase the demand for primary care providers that have transformed to patient-centered medical homes and have well-developed population health management infrastructures. Under this current environment, physicians are seeking more financially stable employment opportunities. The areas surrounding Prince George's County (the District of Columbia and Montgomery, Anne Arundel, and Howard Counties) offer opportunities for primary care physician employment in established and well-known healthcare organizations, including academic medical centers that offer teaching and research opportunities. Such opportunities are more limited in Prince George's County, although this is an issue the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan seeks to address. Significant resources are needed to transform primary care practices to patient-centered medical homes. Prince George's County needs expanded patient-centered, primary care in a well-developed integrated delivery system. Currently, a relatively small number of primary care practices have received patient-centered medical home recognition/accreditation in Prince George's County. Primary care practices often lack the resources or capabilities (such as implementation of an electronic health-record system and the hiring of care coordinators and community workers) needed to transform to and operate as patient-centered medical homes.Collaboration on service mix among Prince George's County hospitals could help to improve access for County residents. Dimensions Healthcare Systems' Prince George's Hospital Center and Laurel Regional Hospital and MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center are the only hospitals in the County that provide obstetrics and pediatric services. Doctors Community Hospital and Ft. Washington Medical Center do not offer these services. The number of obstetric beds for the new Regional Medical Center will be reduced from current levels at the Prince George's Hospital Center, but the number of obstetric admissions is projected to remain constant with reduced lengths of stay. The new Regional Medical Center will have few general pediatric beds. Given the differences in services offered by these hospitals, collaboration among hospitals-while respecting competition and regional networks-is critical to having the full spectrum of services within the County. Significant resources and effort are needed to improve quality of services and to change perceptions about the quality of services delivered in Prince George's County. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan provides a blueprint to improve the quality of care as well as to change the perception of quality through a marketing campaign. Lower quality of care\u2014real or perceived\u2014has a negative impact on the County's ability to recruit and retain physicians. It has also contributed to the significant percentage of residents that travel outside of the County for healthcare services. Prince George's County does not have a structured program to fund primary care services for low-income uninsured or underinsured individuals. As previously noted, Prince George's County has many uninsured residents, but it does not have a program to pay primary care providers for services provided to this population. Such programs do exist within Montgomery County and the District of Columbia. Not having a PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 11 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONstructured program for uninsured/underinsured residents makes recruitment and retention of primary care providers to low-income areas of high primary care needs more difficult. The lack of such a program also negatively affects County residents' ability to access patient-centered care and to achieve improved health outcomes. Opportunities The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is aligned with both the County's and the State of Maryland's priorities related to improving health and economic development. The Prince George's County administration has identified healthcare as a top priority for health improvement and economic development. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is aligned with several current initiatives being implemented within the State of Maryland and Prince George's County that include but are not limited to the Plan Prince George's 2035 Approved General Plan, the Transforming Neighborhood Initiative, Maryland's Health Enterprise Zone Program, and development of the Regional Medical Center to be located at the renovated Largo Town Center/Life Sciences Center. There is alignment between the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan and a number of patient-centered medical homes, quality improvement, and care coordination initiatives. Efforts to achieve the \"triple aim\" (improved patient experience, better health outcomes, and lower costs) across the healthcare industry are aligned with the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. A number of initiatives to expand access to patient-centered medical homes, improve quality, and increase care coordination are currently being implemented. These initiatives, for instance, are sponsored by health plans, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, The Maryland State Medical Society, and the Mid-Atlantic Association of Community Health Centers. As implementation of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan begins, Prince George's County will be able to leverage work with aligned initiatives and build collaboration among the County, health plans, providers, social service organizations, state health exchanges, and other stakeholders to achieve the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan's goals. Primary care practice sites proposed in the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan would meet a demand for residency training, including demand from the new Dimensions Family Practice Residency Program. In July 2014, Dimensions Healthcare System's Family Medicine Residency Program at Prince George's Hospital Center commenced operations. Four residents will be accepted into the program annually for a total of 12 residents at full operation. The goal of the Family Medicine Residency Program is to develop outstanding family physicians capable of providing comprehensive and compassionate primary care in a variety of settings. The expanded primary care practices as part of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan can serve as residency training sites for the Dimensions Family Practice Residency Program as well as for programs with other academic institutions. The high demand for residency training sites for primary care providers (including physicians, dentists, and midlevel providers) suggests that the expanded primary care sites proposed in the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan would be well utilized. Physicians often choose to practice where they complete their residency; hence, more residency slots support physician recruitment efforts. A number of new entrant federally qualified health centers have committed to serving Prince George's County residents, especially low-income and culturally diverse populations. Since completion of the Public Health Impact Study, two well-recognized federally qualified health centers have established practices in Prince George's County. Another federally qualified health center submitted a New Access Point Grant application to Health Resources PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 12 Map 2.

At the same time, Greater Baden Medical Services, an established federally qualified health center serving the County, is undertaking efforts to improve its quality and access. To optimize access and quality of services for patients, it will be important for federally qualified health centers to collaborate on alignment of service areas. A second challenge will be to prevent any one federally qualified health center from being overwhelmed with uninsured patients. Despite potential coordination challenges, federally qualified health centers represent a great opportunity for expanded access to services for low-income residents in Prince George's County. Federally qualified health centers operate across the United States and serve publicly and privately insured patients, including but not limited to low income populations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides funding for work force development. Existing training programs in the County and the state can be used to implement this funding effectively. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides new opportunities to support development of the primary care work force nationwide. The National Health Service Corps has supported primary care through loan repayment since 1972. The stimulus package and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act combined provided $1.8 billion in new funds over five years. By 2015, an increase of 18,000 providers nationwide is expected through the funding. For fiscal year 2014, $283 million was dedicated to the program from Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act funding, providing more than 5,100 student scholarships and loan repayments in 38 states. Certainly this funding is a significant opportunity for federal resources to support loan repayment across the country and, in particular, in Prince George's County. Yet, mandatory funding continues only through 2015, and it will be dependent on Congress to authorize continuation. Prince George's Community College, the University of Maryland, and Bowie State University offer education and training programs for healthcare professionals. Within these programs, there are positions that support patient-centered primary care and population health such as community/public health nursing and health information management. These existing education and training programs can be used to implement additional funding available through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Maryland payment reform supports hospital affiliations with patient-centered primary care practices. Maryland's shift to global payment creates an opportunity for Prince George's County. The global payment provides hospitals and hospital-based systems with incentives to invest in patient-centered primary care, community benefit programs, and other health promotion initiatives. Not only do these initiatives improve quality and health outcomes but also help hospitals to realize cost savings. The shift to global payment also presents a challenge to the extent that it increases demand for primary care providers and creates urgency in building patient-centered primary care capacity within Prince George's County. Prince George's County Health Department enhanced its ability to collect local-level data for Community Health Needs assessment. The ability to collect and analyze local-area (town- or zip code-level) data on health indicators is essential for preparing community health needs assessment to inform the development of hospital community benefit programs. These data will help to target health improvement initiatives. The County Health Department's recent hiring of staff with expertise in health analysis and health information exchanges will enhance its ability to acquire, analyze, and use local-area data for PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 14 health planning and promotion as well as for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. Maryland Health Connection, the state's health insurance marketplace, took steps to improve the enrollment process and committed to expanded resources for outreach and enrollment in Prince George's County. In addition, the Maryland Health Connection has committed to increasing resources and strengthening collaboration with community-based organizations operating within Prince George's County for the purpose of increasing residents' enrollment in healthcare coverage. There is a significant amount of key stakeholders' collaboration. The healthcare strategic planning process was completed with a spirit of collaboration among all stakeholders, along with a high degree of transparency. Continued collaboration will ensure that the plan is implemented successfully and that its goals are achieved.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 15 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONIII. METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan for Prince George's County was developed through a year-long process characterized by: Strong and collabor ative leadership. Broad-based and deep st akeholder input and involvement. Structured activities with int erim milestones and deliverables. Commitment to de veloping evidence-based recommendations. The process resulted in a comprehensive plan that has broad-based support among project leadership and stakeholders and will serve as the blueprint for implementation and sustainability for improved primary healthcare for the residents of Prince George's County. Project Leadership The project leaders from the Office of the County Executive, The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission Planning Department, and the Prince George's County Health Department established clear project goals and worked to ensure collaboration among stakeholders throughout the process. They also served as members of the Advisory, Stakeholders, and Workgroup Committees. The Advisory Committee, responsible for ensuring that the plan would meet the collective needs of Prince George's County, guided and supported the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. The Stakeholders Committee brought the perspectives of their individual organizations and constituencies to the plan. In combination, these committees included representation from hospitals, health plans, physicians, federally qualified health centers, advocacy organizations, County departments and agencies, state institutions and agencies, and County residents. During meetings, Advisory and Stakeholders Committee members provided input and feedback to research findings and preliminary recommendations. Smaller workgroups were convened with selected representatives of the Stakeholders and Advisory Committees to refine the recommendations tied to key issues. Through facilitated meetings, workgroup members discussed which resources could be mobilized and made recommendations on how the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan should address physician recruitment and retention, hospital community benefits, and work force development. The outcome of each workgroup was a set of actionable strategies for both the short- and long-term that were integrated into the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan for Prince George's County. Community Involvement One hallmark of the planning process was the desire to obtain input and feedback from the residents of Prince George's County. Multiple approaches were used to engage the community, which included open meetings and representation on the Stakeholders Committee. Community engagement should continue as the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is implemented. Countywide MeetingOn March 1, 2014, The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission hosted a public meeting at the Jericho Christian Academy in Landover, Maryland, on the topic of primary healthcare and the new Regional Medical Center. The meeting objectives: 1. Ensured an unders tanding that the new Regional Medical Center and the County's community hospitals will serve as the anchor for the primary care integrated healthcare delivery system with the capacity to deliver high-quality, accessible primary health and prevention as well as hospital care. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 16 2. Provided a f orum for further discussion regarding residents' vision and expectations of the new Regional Medical Center. 3. Began a discussion focusing on and cr eating a culture of health promotion, wellness, and disease prevention. Information regarding the Regional Medical Center design was provided. Survey cards were used to gather information about the attendees' healthcare use, and discussions were held regarding visions for the Regional Medical Center. Additionally, their visions for primary care services within Prince George's County were discussed. Polling of almost 200 participants was used to obtain general information; 136 community meeting attendees completed the survey cards. Local Community MeetingsA series of four, two-hour community meetings were held to gather input regarding the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. The objectives of the meetings were to confirm the major health concerns and access-to-care issues facing County residents as well as to get input from residents on what they believe to be the key factors associated with a strong primary care system. Meeting attendees participated in on-site polling, identifying for each community: (1) ke y determinants of health; and (2) factors associated with a strong primary care system. Data and information gathered during the four local community meetings provided valuable insights that were used to develop the overall strategic plan and the primary care prototypes. Over 200 residents participated in the countywide meeting, and 100 residents participated in the four community meetings with many indicating that they had lived in Prince George's County for more than 20 years. Despite this level of engagement, few young African-American families and professionals attended. Members of the Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and immigrant communities were also underrepresented at the meetings despite numerous outreach efforts. The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan's marketing and branding strategy includes recommendations on gathering more information from these communities. Summaries of the community meetings are available on the Prince George's County web site (princegeorgescountymd.gov) and the The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission Planning Department's web site (pgplanning.org). Advisory and Stakeholders Committees MeetingsPrince George's County residents were well represented on the Advisory and Stakeholders Committees. Committee members resided and/or worked in the County. Further, two residents from each of the nine Council districts were appointed to serve on the Stakeholders Committee as representatives of their respective community. Interviews were conducted with individual Advisory and Stakeholder Committee members to explore community-related issues in more depth. Findings from the Random Household Health Survey of the Public Health Impact Study: Technical Report 7 Results of the Random Household Health Sur vey were used to inform the strategy. Further, several questions used for the survey were also used for the on-site polling at the community meetings, providing insights on variations and trends. Research and Analysis John Snow, Inc. conducted research and analysis to develop a strategic plan that is unique to Prince George's County. Wherever possible, the extensive body of research on healthcare and planning in Prince George's County that had already been conducted was included. The research and analysis that is used for planning is outlined. More information regarding data and sources is included in Appendix B.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 17 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONBuilding on Previous Work 2012 University of Mar yland School of Public Health, the Public Health Impact Study: This study identified geographic distribution of primary care providers and shortage areas, estimated an overall shortage of 61 primary care providers distributed throughout the County, described community perceptions of healthcare services available and preferences on where to get care, and recommended the development of a primary care strategy and implementation plan. John Snow, Inc. used this report extensively throughout the planning process and conducted follow-up interviews with several of the authors. 2009 RAND Report, Assessing Health and Health Care in Princ e George's County: This report studied residents' healthcare needs and the County's healthcare system's capacity to meet those needs.

Literature Review Peer-reviewed journal articles and other trusted sources were researched to identify industry-best practices and models that would be relevant for Prince George's County. A list of articles, reports, and web sites is included in Appendix C. Primary Research Follow -Up Interviews with Stakeholders and Industry Leaders: Over 30 follow-up interviews were conducted with members of the Advisory Committee, Stakeholders Committee, and other industry leaders identified throughout the project. One-on-one interviews focused on gaining more in-depth understanding and information regarding key topics that were identified during the larger committee or community meetings. These targeted discussions helped to inform primary care strategies, site selection, prototypes, and adjustments in the number of additional primary care providers needed in Prince George's County. A list of those interviewed is included in Appendix B. Demographic and Health Dat a: Data were obtained from several sources that included: (1) the U.S. Census Bur eau, including the American Community Survey, for the County and zip code levels; (2) the Community Health Rankings, (3) the Chesapeake R egional Information System for our patients County-level data on hospital admissions for 2012/2013; and (4) live polling a t community meetings.

Information and data obtained during the site visits were used to inform site selection and design for the primary care prototypes. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 19 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONRecommendations for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan for Prince George's County are provided in the following section of this report. Recommendations are provided to expand patient-centered primary care, recruit and retain primary care providers, develop a work force to support expansion of patient-centered care, build collaboration on community benefit programs, and build a sustainable model for implementation and monitoring and evaluation. The matrix provided on page xii of the Executive Summary provides a crosswalk between the recommendations and the detailed descriptions included in Sections IV and V. Expanding Patient-Centered Primary Care in Health Investment Zones One of the first priorities of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is to increase the number of primary care practices in high-need areas, designated as \"Health Investment Zones.\" Taking into account community demographics and applying best practices, several recommendations for prototype primary care practices are offered. Defining Health Investment ZonesHealth Investment Zones are defined as those zip codes within the County that were identified by the University of Maryland School of Public Health in its Public Health Impact Study as having high primary care needs or tending to high primary care needs. The University of Maryland School of Public Health created a measure of primary care needs that takes into account physician-to-population ratios, health indicators related to patient-centered primary care (readmission rates and hospital discharges), and social determinants of health (household income and education levels). High primary care need areas meet each of the following criteria:I V. PRIMARY HEALTHCARE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary care physician-to-population ratio at or wor se than 1:3,500 (federal guidelines for the adequate primary care physician-to-population ratio is 1:2,000). Population median-inc ome and/or education level lower than the County average. Population 30-da y readmission rate and/or hospital discharge ratio higher than the County average. Additional levels of primary care needs were identified. Zip codes that were designated as tending to high primary care needs met the same population, socioeconomic, and hospital event criteria but had physician-to-population ratios between 1:3,500 and 1:2,000. Further levels were developed for medium needs, tending to medium needs, and adequate to meet primary care needs (see zip code-level analysis in Figure 2 on page 17). More information about the methodology behind this stratification can be found in the Public Health Impact Study. Analysis of Determining Locations, Models of Care, and Facility Design for Primary Care Practices in Health Investment Zones The Site Selection Committee convened to identify potential locations and models for added primary care practices within the Health Investment Zones. The Site Selection Committee included representatives from the Office of the County Executive, The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, the Prince George's County Health Department, and Dimensions Health System. In addition to being within the Health Investment Zones, potential locations were evaluated on their ability to meet the following criteria: A federally designa ted and/or state-designated health professional shortage area. An area tar geted by the County for economic development and/or health improvement. Availability of space t o accommodate patient- centered primary care practices.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 20 Accessibility by priva te and public transportation that currently exists or is planned for the future. Poten tial to be co-located with community-based organizations, social service agencies, and/or private businesses involved in health promotion (for example, healthy grocer, yoga/pilates center). Information and data to inform site selection, models of care, and facilities were gathered from several sources that included site visits, master plans, Public Health Impact Study technical reports, Health Resource and Services Administration data, census data, community meetings, and stakeholder interviews. A full list of sources is included in Appendix B. Suggested prototypes for facility designs were developed to accommodate the models of care for each location. The designs were based upon best practices for patient-centered primary care, as described in the following sections. Visuals of the facility designs are included in Appendix A. Best Practice Models for Patient-Centered Primary Care The suggested prototype for primary care practice sites is developed based on the patient-centered medical home model. Best practice models for patient-centered primary care continue to evolve incorporating new research and learning collaborative efforts; all are based upon the core concepts of patient-centered care. (Refer to the Patient-Centered Medical Home diagram on page 5.) The concept of the patient-centered medical home as a model for primary care is not new. The American Academy of Pediatrics introduced the medical home concept in 1967 as a single location for a patient's healthcare information and, in 2002, greatly expanded the medical home concept to include accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective care. In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, and the American Osteopathic Association adopted the Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home that have served as the basis for various patient-centered medical home initiatives and accrediting programs. Refinements to the joint principles include certain non-physician healthcare personnel as primary care providers. The care team in a patient-centered medical home may include physicians, midlevel providers, medical assistants, clinical care coordinators, community health workers, and behavioral health providers. Patient-centered primary care also incorporates oral health and medication management. Larger primary care practices support on-site dental and pharmacy services with oral health providers and clinical pharmacists joining the care team. A fully integrated approach to care reflects the social-ecological model for health promotion. The social-ecological model (also referred to as the whole-person care model) contextualizes individual behavior within social and physical environments. At the same time, the model is flexible and incorporates sustained changes in health behaviors that require revised policies, environments, and social systems to address social determinants of health while supporting individuals' positive lifestyle habits. (See the Social-Ecological Model for Health Promotion diagram on page 6.) The social-ecological model is consistent with the model used for Robert Wood Johnson County Health Rankings that is based on a model of population health, emphasizing the many factors that, if improved, can help make communities healthier places to live, learn, work, and play. County Health Rankings provides benchmarks and comparisons for evaluating the health of a County's population and are used by the Health Department to produce the annual Health Report 2014. The County Health Rankings model was used at the four local community meetings to elicit input from County residents on their health and healthcare.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 21 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONThe Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan defines primary care to encompass primary prevention (health promotion), secondary prevention (screening), and medical care (chronic disease management and acute care). Further, the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan recommends that primary care practices have integrated behavioral health, oral health, and care coordination. A list of services included as primary care is included in Appendix B. Recommendations for Patient-Centered Primary Care in Health Investment Zones Recommendations for patient-centered primary care practices in Health Investment Zones are solidly grounded in the patient-centered medical home and social-ecological models. Recommendations are consistent with the Community Integrated Medical Home model being implemented as part of Maryland's state innovation management grant. Further, the Prince George's County Health Department and The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, through its planning, zoning, and review functions, support the social-ecological model and their efforts can strongly influence social determinants of health and health promotion. Their leadership and strong participation bodes well for achieving the goals of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. Recommendation: Implement suggested prototypes for primary care practices in those areas identified as Health Investment Zones. Time Frame: Prototypes 1, 2, and 3 should be developed in the short-term; Prototype 4 should be developed within three to five years, consistent with the new Regional Medical Center opening. Four prototypes for primary care practices were developed; one for each of the four geographic areas designated as a Health Investment Zones: Riverdale/New Carrollton/Langley Park, Brandywine, Oxon Hill, and Capitol Heights. (See Map 3: Suggested Prototypes for Primary Care Practices in Health Investment Zones on page 22).Prototypes are summarized in Table 1, and additional information and visuals are included in Appendix A. The pr ototypes include site location, care program, facility plan, and a business model. A brief description of these suggested prototypes are given below. General site loc ations were identified within each of the Health Investment Zones, but specific locations are not being recommended with this report. The site location will be determined as the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan moves to implementation and will depend upon several factors, including what space is available for medical practices and progress on planned developments. Program w as based upon best practices for patient-centered primary care, modified to fit with the population demographics, community characteristics, and market conditions. Facility was based upon ar chitectural design principles that support the patient-centered primary care model. These designs support a team-based approach to care; maximize patient time with providers throughout visit; eliminate physical barriers between patient and staff; allow for variations in demographics, practice methodologies, and future technologies; use natural lighting and other features to create inviting space; and provide sufficient square footage. The proposed facilities would be built to meet environmental standards and to accommodate people with disabilities. Business model was dev eloped to support a financially viable primary care practice through start-up and for ongoing operations.

Based on needs and these best practices, recommendations specific to Prince George's County are outlined. Need for Primary Care Physicians in Health Investment Zones The University of Maryland School of Public Health conducted a rigorous analysis to quantify the number of primary care physicians needed for Prince George's County by geographically using the Public Use Microdata Area geographic units. The study indicated that a total of 61 primary care physicians and 31 dentists were needed to meet the primary care needs within the County, which are concentrated in the inner Beltway and southern part of the County. (The University of Maryland School of Public Health's methodology and results are included in the Public Health Impact Study.) John Snow, Inc. used available sources of information (stakeholder interviews, web sites, etc.) to update its understanding of projected need. The information gathered indicated that healthcare organizations had moved into or expanded their services within the County's high-need areas, reducing the shortage by 13 primary care physicians. It should be noted that there are several limitations to the exactness of the University of Maryland School of Public Health's original estimate and to John Snow, Inc.'s updates, as well as the federal guidelines for physician-to-population ratios. Taking these limitations into account, the estimated number of physicians needed in the County should be used as a guide to the magnitude of need. Based upon the information available, it is estimated that the remaining need for primary care physicians in the Health Investment Zones would range from 24 (assuming 50 percent outmigration) to 48 (with no outmigration). The proposed primary care practices would add 15 physicians and 7 midlevel providers or 22 total primary care providers. Proposed practices would increase the number of dental providers by four (two dentists and two dental hygienists). These providers would constitute a critical start to meeting the demonstrated need in Prince George's County. Analysis of Barriers to Physician Recruitment and Retention Barriers to physician recruitment and retention were identified primarily through stakeholder meetings, interviews, and a review of market-related documents. Barriers can be grouped under financial security, professional opportunities, quality, and systems support. Prince George's County has fewer opportunities for employment relative to the surrounding counties and the District of Columbia. Today, many physicians are looking for financial security and are less interested in the risk that accompanies setting up private practices. Compared to surrounding counties, physicians in Prince George's County have set up more small private practices. In contrast, in the areas surrounding Prince George's County (District of Columbia, Montgomery, Anne Arundel, and Howard Counties) more primary care physicians practice in established and highly recognized healthcare organizations, including academic medical centers that offer teaching and research opportunities. Prince George's County also has fewer opportunities for residency training, and as stated earlier, physicians often choose to practice where they complete their residency. Opportunities are particularly limited for pediatricians and obstetricians. Dimensions Healthcare System (includes Prince George's Hospital Center and Laurel Regional Hospital), along with MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center are the only hospitals in the County that provide obstetrics and pediatric services. Current plans for the new Regional Medical Center will reduce the number of obstetric beds (although obstetrical admissions are projected to PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 25 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONremain constant with reduced lengths of stay) and provide for a small number of pediatric beds. Prince George's County does not have an established program to reimburse primary care providers for services provided to uninsured or underinsured low-income individuals . Montgomery County and the District of Columbia have established programs to pay primary care providers for services provided to uninsured, low-income individuals. Primary care providers that practice in low-income communities often serve a disproportionate share of uninsured individuals as well as those who are underinsured (individuals who have health insurance plans with large deductibles or limited benefits). Given the lack of reimbursement for their services, there is little incentive for providers to work in these low-income communities of Prince George's County where, unfortunately, the need is often highest. Solo/small practice primary care providers in Prince George's County do not have resources to transform into patient-centered medical homes. There are relatively few primary care practices in Prince George's County that have transformed into patient-centered medical homes, as compared to those in surrounding counties and the District of Columbia. Solo or small practices often do not have the resources to hire staff (such as care coordinators) and implement systems (such as data analytic capabilities) to operate as a patient-centered medical home. In today's healthcare environment, physicians want to work for practices that have received patient-centered medical home recognition from one or more of the nationally recognized accrediting organizations (National Committee for Quality Assurance, The Joint Commission, or Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc.) that have the operational support to participate in shared savings and quality contracts. Developing primary care practices to function as patient-centered medical homes will be even more important with Maryland's shift to global payment models for hospitals. Under its payment reform initiative, over the next five years Maryland will shift virtually all of its hospital revenue into global payment models, providing incentives for hospitals to work in partnership with other providers (primary care providers, in particular) and preventing unnecessary hospitalizations and readmissions. There is a general perception that healthcare services are of lower quality in Prince George's County. The perception of lower quality adversely affects the ability to recruit and retain physicians. Not only do providers want to work in what is perceived as quality institutions, they are also concerned that, unless the quality of care within Prince George's County improves, the ability to develop a financially viable practice will be compromised. Communities with high primary care needs often lack medical office space that can support new primary care practices. Low-income areas often lack an inventory of sufficiently sized (minimum of 6,000 square feet) and affordable space needed to support primary care practices. Without existing space to support primary care practices, providers lack the incentive to even attempt to establish practices in these high-need areas. Effective Strategies for Physician Recruitment and Retention Effective strategies for recruiting and retaining physicians are those that offer opportunities for financial security and achievement of professional goals. Today, these strategies must respond to the increased demand for primary care providers and the accompanying responsibilities placed on them to support population health management. The following strategies for physician recruitment and retention are based upon best practices considered most relevant to Prince George's County. Strategies specific to Health Investment Zones are also included: Recruit primary c are providers into established organizations that provide reliable income and the infrastructure to support patient-centered PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 26 care. For example, a federally qualified health center located in Maine has grown by merging existing private physicians (solo practitioners and small groups) into the center. These physicians have exchanged autonomy for financial security (salary plus quality bonuses) and support from an organization (quality management, care coordination, and other support services). Recruit new ph ysicians from residency training programs. Many organizations see participation in residency programs as crucial to their recruitment strategy. Physicians coming from residency programs already share in a panel of patients and have assimilated into the practice operations and culture. Federally qualified health centers and larger private practices that can serve as a residency practice site have an advantage for recruitment. Offer loan repa yment and other incentives for physicians that agree to practice in a designated health professional shortage area. Medical school loans present a large financial burden to physicians; their ability to participate in federal and state loan repayment programs can be a major help. The most effective recruitment strategies offer loan repayment as part of a comprehensive package rather than the sole strategy. Creat e a \"package deal\" for recruitment. By necessity, rural health centers have developed physician recruitment and retention strategies that offer a package\u2014great place to live, low cost of living, employment opportunity for working spouse, good schools for the children, and the opportunity to become an esteemed member of a small community. Prince George's County can similarly be promoted as a diverse and historically rich community that offers a high quality of life for young professionals, growing families, and active seniors. Health Investment Zone Incentives Healthcare delivery overall and recruitment of primary care physicians, in particular, are shifting as more and more physicians are employed by larger healthcare organizations that are part of integrated delivery systems. This major shift is attributed to the complexities of healthcare reform that require primary care physicians to operate as patient-centered medical homes and engage in population health management. Increasingly, physicians want the security and support of working with larger organizations that are better equipped to handle the new, complex, day-to-day operations of a practice. Many see solo practitioners as a thing of the past. As there continues to be physician shortages, particularly in primary care medicine, the County must take measures to keep pace. The following recommended incentives enhance the County's capabilities to recruit and retain primary care physicians. Establish and oper ate a program to reimburse primary care providers for services to low-income patients who are uninsured or underinsured (referred to as Prince George's HealthAssure). The County would develop and operate the program in collaboration with key stakeholders. Following successful models, including Montgomery Cares and the DC Alliance Program, the program would be funded through a combination of private and public sources. Federally qualified health centers would also use some of their federal grant funds to subsidize the cost of services provided to uninsured patients, but the amount would not cover all costs. The recommended reimbursement per primary care encounter is $85.00, an amount consistent with the amount paid by Montgomery Cares and Medicare reimbursement for a comprehensive primary care visit. Develop a plan tha t will provide adequately sized and affordable medical office space that will qualify as a patient-centered medical home and includes primary care practices making reduced lease payments. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 27 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION Build out medical office space in the Health Inv estment Zones that supports patient- centered medical home care models, for example shared space for care teams and talking rooms for behavioral health consultations. (See Section IV on page 19.) Funding would come primarily from negotiated cost secured by the County from private developers. Additional funding could come through grants for federally funded health centers and capital campaigns sponsored by nonprofit organizations. Estimated costs to build out medical office space within an existing building that supports the patient-centered medical home model averages about $230 per square foot; estimated cost for ground-up (full facility) construction is $425 per square foot. Secure reduced lease pa yments for primary care practices in the Health Investment Zones. The County would secure reduced lease payments from private developers and property owners. The proposed subsidy is $10 per square foot or approximately half of the average lease cost for office space in Prince George's County (excluding utilities and leasehold improvements). In addition, the County would secure a minimum 15-year lease term from property owners. Establish a plan t o secure federal and state loan repayment to physicians and dentists that choose to practice in Health Investment Zones in Prince George's County. Work with feder ally qualified health centers and other eligible governmental and private nonprofit healthcare organizations serving the County to secure state and federal loan repayment for medical and dental school graduates who agree to work in sites located in Health Investment Zones. Work with the Mid-Atlan tic Association for Community Health Centers (represents Maryland's federally qualified health centers), The Maryland State Medical Society, and other stakeholders to promote the loan repayment program. Provide lo w-cost working capital loans to cover start-up costs such as operating losses during the ramp-up period (12 to 18 months), purchase of equipment such as an electronic medical record system, and income guarantees for physicians and midlevel providers. The Economic Development Corporation may provide the loans at favorable interest rates and have provisions for loan forgiveness for those providers that practice in the Health Investment Zones for the long term (10 to 15 years). Enable the ability of primary car e practices to operate as patient-centered medical homes by having access to support services through management service organizations. Management services organization(s) would be developed and operated as a private organization, for example a joint venture among health plans serving Prince George's County or services offered through The Maryland State Medical Society. The management service organization could charge service fees for primary care practices to cover operating costs. Services could be provided to primary care practices operating in a Health Investment Zone at reduced rates with the goal being that the management service organization operates at break-even (or above). Develop a pr ogram to subsidize physician income for primary care practices that agree to serve as residency practice sites in Health Investment Zones. The subsidy would offset lost productivity for physicians serving as preceptors for medical and dental residents. Funding for income guarantees to preceptors would come from private sources and/or the residency program. Establish a plan t o subsidize malpractice costs for primary care practices. The County would promote the hiring of primary care physicians and midlevel providers by federally qualified health centers, and/or primary care providers employed by federally qualified health centers usually have their malpractice costs covered.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 28 Recommendations for Recruitment and Retention of Primary Care Physicians for Prince George's County Based on effective strategies tailored to meet the goals of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan and evolving market conditions, the following recommendations developed through the Physician Recruitment and Retention Workgroup are proposed for Prince George's County. Recommendation 1: Provide financial incentives. Time Frame: Short- to Medium-Term Offer incentiv es to: (1) private physicians who are culturally competent, have desire to serve low-income or rural populations, and are willing to practice in sites located in Health Investment Zones; and (2) federally qualified health centers that are willing to expand capacity through opening new sites in Health Investment Zones. Offer low -cost working capital loans and two- year income guarantees to private primary care physicians who commit to establishing and maintaining practices in Health Investment Zones in Prince George's County. Establish an adequa tely funded program, such as Prince George's HealthAssure, to pay qualified providers for patient-centered primary care services to low-income uninsured and underinsured individuals. The program would apply to federally qualified health centers and to certain other primary care providers (as funding allows) in Prince George's County, including those practicing outside of the Health Investment Zones. Recommendation 2: Provide operational support. Time Frame: Short- to Medium-Term Physicians should be recruited into an integrated system that includes medical, behavioral, and social services. Physicians need to believe they do not have to \"do it alone.\" Systems include those inside the practice, such as staff that are trained in data analytics to support population health management and behavioral health providers, and those outside the practice such as public health nurses and other community-based social service organizations. There are multiple approaches to building operational support for primary care practices. They are not mutually exclusive and, further, can be implemented over time. Encourag e the development of a private management service organization that would offer services to primary care practices, in particular to solo practitioners and small practices. The management service organization would provide support services, including general administration, electronic health record implementation and maintenance, credentialing, contracting, population health management (quality analytics, care coordination), and legal services as well as technical assistance on transformation to patient-centered medical homes. There are various ways to structure and fund the management service organization. Given the resource requirements and needed expertise, it would be advantageous to work in collaboration with others that provide support to primary care practices, including but not limited to The Maryland State Medical Society, the Mid-Atlantic Association of Community Health Centers, and the Maryland Health Care Commission Management Service Organization Advisory Panel. Implement an infr astructure that can support the patient-centered medical home model for solo practitioners and small practices, in particular those operating in more rural parts of the County. One possible model is an Independent Physician Association. In this association, Physicians could practice in a shared model that purchases services through the management service organization. Physicians also could enter into joint contracts with health plans as well as form alliances with hospitals, home health agencies, urgent care centers, and other community-based organizations to improve transitional care and after-hours care. The Independent Physician Associations of a sufficient size could form an PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 29 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONaccountable care organization that would enter into contracts with health plans. Expand opportunities for residency and emplo yment in established healthcare organizations. Establish opportunities f or residency training (medical and dental) in Prince George's County provider organizations, and aggressively recruit within regional residency training programs to use practice sites within Prince George's County. Support expansion of feder ally qualified health centers that offer employment, malpractice coverage, and organizational supports for physicians and midlevel providers that want to serve low-income and culturally diverse populations. Support developmen t of hospital-based integrated delivery systems, including the new Regional Medical Center. Build strong c ollaboration between primary care sites in Health Investment Zones with the recently developed Family Practice Residency Program sponsored by Dimensions Health Systems. Recommendation 3: Market Prince George's County as a \"package deal.\" Time Frame: Medium- to Long-TermRecruit primary care physicians by offering Prince George's County as a package deal\u2014a great place to live and work. The package includes employment for the physician (and his/her spouse if both are physicians) into a supportive and high-quality healthcare system, employment opportunities for the spouse, access to good public schools, and ability to be part of the community. Implementation of this recommendation would require collaboration at local, County, and state levels, and includes: Making the necessary inv estments needed to build excellent healthcare at the Regional Medical Center. One tactic is to recruit a high-profile cluster of established, academically oriented specialists to the Regional Medical Center. Their arrival would reflect the County's commitment to improved quality, fulfill the original Memorandum of Understanding promise of a health sciences center and, most importantly, instill confidence within the medical community as well as with Prince George's County residents. Partnering with an academic ins titution to set up and pay for medical, dental, and allied health profession residency sites. Work with the state to implement the necessary policy changes that give priority to Maryland higher education institutions for residency and practicum slots. Working with Sta te education officials, Prince George's County Public Schools, private schools, colleges, and universities located within the County to ensure quality education is provided in all schools. Working with businesses to find emplo yment positions for physicians' spouses, including ones within medical practices and medical centers for spouses who are also physicians. Implementing the marke ting and branding campaign to recruit primary care providers as outlined in Targeted Marketing Goal #1 on page 48. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 30 Recommendation 4: Advance health promotion and disease prevention. Time Frame: Medium- to Long-TermThe social-ecological model on which the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is based recognizes that much of healthcare takes place outside of physicians' offices. To further increase primary care capacity, efforts should focus on expanding resources for health promotion and disease prevention outside of the primary care setting. Thus, while other recommendations in this section have focused on bringing in and retaining new providers to the County, this recommendation takes a different approach to reducing demand for primary care medical services. Improving health and reducing disease prevalence will reduce pressure on the demand for primary care. The following recommendations support that trend: Continue to include health pr omotion as part of community development (for example, building more sidewalks and providing incentives to service and retail establishments that support healthy eating and exercising). Prince George's County, through The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and the Health Department, has already implemented programs to support the development of healthy communities. Continuing these efforts in parallel with implementation of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan will advance the goal of improving the health of all County residents. Implement the health promotion c ampaign included as part of the marketing and branding plan, outlined in Section V on page 47. Provide adequa te funding for the Health Department to conduct health needs assessment, and implement health promotion and disease prevention programs as indicated. Encourag e health plans and employers to offer incentives to health plan enrollees and employees who engage in health promotion and disease prevention activities.Developing a Work Force to Support Expanded Patient-Centered Primary Care in Prince George's County Work Force Development under Healthcare Reform The profession of primary healthcare is transforming into a new work force. The patient-centered medical home model of care demands dramatically different skills and staffing and requires collaborative teams of health professionals. Given that context, the work force recommendations for Prince George's County are to adapt the health professional work force to support a patient-centered medical home for every resident in the County. With the expansion of healthcare coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, there is a need for expanded work force capacity to meet the needs of the newly insured and to fill gaps in access for existing insured residents. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, federal funding for the National Health Service Corps, which has existed since 1971 to provide scholarship and loan repayment to providers who serve in areas with a provider shortage, has been expanded. The funding is available for physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse midwives, mental and behavioral health providers, and dentists. New and existing primary care providers must be trained to build capacity of this new work force to align with the patient-centered medical home model. The new primary care work force will be composed of a range of health professionals who work together as a team to deliver high-quality primary care. Physicians cannot do it alone; clinical and non-clinical staff members ensure patients have support in many ways, such as helping them gain access to high-quality food, education on how to live a healthy lifestyle, and support to take medications. More and more, there is recognition that training on developing effective relationships among all members of the care team is needed, as well as training on practice-based population health. Practice-based population health PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 31 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONuses information on a group of patients within a practice or a group of practices to improve the care and health outcomes of those patients. Analysis of Work Force Needs for Prince George's CountyJohn Snow, Inc. analyzed work force needs in Prince George's County in two phases. During the first phase, an inventory of current training resources at local educational institutions, their capacity, and available degree programs was developed and is included in Appendix B. During the second phase, John Snow, Inc. reviewed best practices for delivering high-quality primary care, and based on these, a list of high-priority health professionals was developed (see Table 2). Table 2 demonstrates that there is a need for staff with qualifications in team management, data management, and information technology. This is in addition to the traditional medical staff usually thought of in a professional health work force. By having more members on a care team, a patient-centered medical home practice must manage more staff than a traditional practice. The need for information technology and data management staff is increasing, as providers move to electronic health records, and practices take a population health approach by actively managing their patients' preventive health needs. Best Practices in Work Force Development A work force that supports population health is diverse, involving not just physicians but a range of allied health professionals. While a comprehensive care team is a recognized requirement for patient-centered services, there is currently no single model, in terms of staffing configuration, to provide these supportive services. By prioritizing and investing in work force development, Prince George's County will be at the forefront of primary care. The work force Table 2.

DENTAL Dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants. best practices to support a patient-centered medical home transformation and population health are discussed below. Encourag e diversity of both clinical and non- clinical staff. By definition, the primary care work force to support patient-centered care is diverse. The work force to support population health and patient-centered medical homes includes individuals that have significant roles in care coordination, health education, and community outreach. The staff in these roles vary in their educational backgrounds and include nurses, public health nurses, social workers, licensed clinical social workers, pharmacists, and community health workers. Historically, these staff have been limited in their availability, because the current healthcare payment system has not paid directly for their services. With payment reform of both primary care and hospital systems, there are new financial incentives and mechanisms that encourage and allow for payment of these types of staff. The patient-centered medical home model increases PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 32 the ratio of staff per physician provider, and one study estimates this increase to be as much as 59 percent. Ensure all st aff are working at the top of their license. Team-based care supports allied health professionals to work with physicians. This provides two benefits: better value and better access to patients. Delegation of tasks from physicians to other staff extends the available time of providers. A more diverse staff enhances the referral and supportive services available. Adjust st affing model for each practice. Since no single model exists for staffing, patterns will need to adjust to the individual practice based on practice size, patient population age and illness severity, and resources available in the community. For example, care coordination and health education staff are provided by the Health Department and/or the health plans in some communities. Health plans offer these services to providers as a way to support them, but each health plan does it differently. While there is agreement on the need for care coordination and health education staff, there is variation in how they are managed, paid for, and work as a team with other healthcare providers. In the absence of consensus on the best staffing model for the ideal organization, there are excellent examples that can serve as models for others. One such example is Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's program to identify, support, and disseminate best practices in the primary care work force called LEAP (Learning from Effective Ambulatory Practices). This program is studying 30 high-functioning primary care practices nationwide. Among those is Unity Health Care, a federally qualified health center in Washington, D.C. The LEAP project found that primary care roles are shifting. Non-physician providers are taking more responsibility over patient health as part of a comprehensive care team. The LEAP project identified the following shifts in primary care roles: The medical assist ant's role is being elevated to include reviewing patient records prior to visits and ordering and administering immunizations based on protocols, making outreach calls, and coaching patients to set self-management goals. The nurse's r ole is shifting from triage to a focus on chronic care management and hospital-to-home transitions. Behavioral health w orkers include licensed, clinical social workers who are now co-located within primary care practices. Physicians ma y share a patient panel with team members who are empowered to provide portions of chronic and preventive care. Figure 3 represents a care team with a patient-centered medical home model practice, highlighting that patients and their caregivers are a part of the team. Some team members may not be employed by the practice. For example, clinical pharmacists may be employed by a local pharmacy but participate in Figure 3.

To support the development of these best-practice care teams within Prince George's County, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, has introduced an interprofessional team-based care pilot program with a focus on chronic disease management in Prince George's County and Southern Maryland. The planning phase of the pilot will determine the chronic diseases of focus, determine the team-based care model, identify patient engagement strategies, identify sites for implementation, determine the appropriate payment model, and outline evaluation metrics and plan. The pilot program was designed to complement the ongoing work of the Prince George's Health Enterprise Zone and the Primary Healthcare Strategic Planning project. The University of Maryland, Baltimore, will work in collaboration with Prince George's County as the pilot program moves forward. Work Force to Support Population HealthWith increased focus on care coordination and team- based care, training will be essential for both new and existing providers. Training should focus on how to be part of an integrated team of providers and how to instruct all providers to deliver services at their highest level of training and license. Enhancing local training opportunities in Prince George's County has several benefits beyond simply increasing the number of providers. The County is developing a professional career ladder for those who enter the health professions, supporting those who want to live and work in the County with a dynamic, flexible, and rewarding career path. Customer Service TrainingCustomer service training was identified, through the community meetings, as crucial to health professional work force development. Patient experience of their healthcare, along with perception of quality of care, is very much informed by patients' interactions with all levels of staff at a healthcare organization. The caring touch and humane interactions were considered to be almost as important as having well-trained providers with excellent credentials. The healthcare industry has lagged behind other service providers, such as grocery stores, hotels, and retailers, in providing the superb customer service that consumers have come to expect. In the healthcare world, people are often viewed more as patients than customers. In reality, consumers of healthcare are both customers and patients. As patients have choices in healthcare, they are also customers. However, healthcare choices are not the same as other retail ones as they are often made when consumers are vulnerable, and they may need input from providers and/or family members. Prince George's County is located in an extremely competitive healthcare environment where consumers can choose where to receive services in neighboring counties as well as the District of Columbia. Regardless of services available, poor customer service discourages patients from seeking out the preventive care and chronic disease management they need. The quality of customer experience is what will make some primary care options stand out for consumers and, in turn, make them loyal to those County providers who do prioritize customer service. Poor customer service turns patients away, regardless of the physicians', nurses', and other clinical staff's expertise. Patients demand and deserve high-quality customer service; the establishment of such a service, which is provided by the Health Science Collegian Center at Prince George's County Community College, would ultimately contribute to residents opting to stay in the County for their care. We provide some specific recommendations for how to embed customer service training into the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 34 Recommendations for Work Force Development for Prince George's County The following recommendations were developed through the Work Force Development Workgroup. Recommendation 1: Convene stakeholders with a shared mission of increasing and improving work force capacity. Time Frame: Short-Term As mentioned above, there is no consensus yet on the ideal staffing pattern or defined roles for the patient-centered medical home model. Thus, a learning community across the County on this work force topic would support dissemination of best practices. Convene stakeholders, including providers, health plans, the Health Department, County agencies such as the Economic Development Corporation, social service agencies, and educational institutions to discuss the topic of care coordination, health education, and community outreach. Coordinate activities in developing and training the work force to serve these functions, share what is learned, and develop a joint plan for building capacity and financing these types of services. A state group focused on training community health workers and the Health Enterprise Zones are two initiatives that have potential for informing stakeholders. This topic requires ongoing coordination and collaboration. Recommendation 2: Develop a systematic work force development plan. Time Frame: Short- to Medium-TermDevelop a systematic work force development plan for the County designed to meet the needs and demands of the patient-centered medical home concept and the \"ideal\" primary care practice provides top-quality primary care. All primary care practices in the County should work toward achieving the components and functionality of a medical home for the purposes of providing high-quality and cost-effective care. Recommended actions are: Support practices with educa tional resources on how to transition to a patient-centered medical home and train their staff/work force to meet the needs of an \"ideal\" primary care practice. This would include both the establishment of learning collaboratives across practices and the provision of technical assistance. Facilita te connections and collaborations with stakeholders, such as the Maryland Health Care Commission, that have resources and expertise. Ensure that the w ork force plan takes into consideration the broad spectrum of health professionals needed to link patients from primary care to the community and across the continuum of care (including ambulatory, inpatient, long-term care etc.). Recommend tha t all primary care practices in the County have the components of a patient-centered medical home that is currently tied to payment incentives. Engage a v ariety of stakeholders to invest in the work force. Hospitals could invest in or support partners to transform their work force, scope of service and/or operations through their community benefit plans. Health plans can support their network providers in various ways. Recommendation 3: Give priority consideration to residents and County educational resources to meet the recommended work force objectives. Time Frame: Short- to Medium-TermPrince George's County has a number of healthcare organizations that can provide clinical training and act as preceptors in partnership with academic and vocational institutions. However, clinical placements are limited and highly competitive. Recent experience of the health profession programs in the County shows that many clinical placements are being given to students from programs outside of the County. Collaboration between educational institutions and other stakeholders, such as primary care providers and clinical training sites, is needed to align program needs with the County work force needs. High schools are important for preparing and leading students to careers in the health professions. In addition to health work force development at the PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 35 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONsecondary, collegiate, and graduate levels, career ladders and continuing education are also needed. Expand clinical training opportunities within the Coun ty to accommodate academic training sites for the proposed work force. Support a stakeholder group to discuss clinical placements in the County that would include educational institutions, state representatives, and healthcare provider organizations. Include continuing educ ation for existing professionals and programs to support a career ladder for those in health professions. Include current health professionals (private practices) in the discussion of competencies needed in the work force and how to train new professionals most effectively. Encourag e the leadership of healthcare institutions to prioritize clinical placements for Prince George's County health profession programs. Recommendation 4: Prioritize quality customer service. Time Frame: Short-TermPrioritize improving the quality of customer service of existing healthcare staff in the County and in all training of future clinical, public health, and administrative support staff. Utilize the best practices of customer service, both those in healthcare and in other industries, to set a new standard of patient experience in Prince George's County. Best practices in cultural competence are also critical for good quality customer service. Specific recommendations to help promote quality customer service follow: Develop a br anding campaign to promote quality customer service in healthcare in collaboration with other County branding initiatives. Institutionalize high-quality cus tomer service in all areas of operations. Quality customer service should be embedded in the performance reviews of all employees. An annual in-service training on customer service and cultural sensitivity is highly recommended as a requirement. Encourage all organizations to monitor customer service through secret shopping and \"spot checking\" employee performance (secret shopping is the practice of marketing research where someone \"poses\" as a customer for research purposes). Identify r esources to support practices investing in and training staff on customer service. Ensure that healthcare providers understand the importance of such training for their patients and for their business. The Small Business Administration, the Mid-Atlantic Association of Community Health Centers, and local medical society offer training on customer service return on investment that healthcare staff would benefit from attending. Work to ward customer service training being part of the curricula for all health profession degrees provided in the County. Engage partner s to pursue excellence in customer service. The Economic Development Corporation could partner with healthcare and educational institutions to fund customer service training and partner with private businesses in Prince George's County to be role models of excellent customer service. Collaborating on Hospital Community Benefit Programs In order to strengthen its primary healthcare system, the County needs to expand access to services as well as coordinate and collaborate on broader community health and population-based activities. These community health efforts are critical to promoting a deeper awareness of health and wellness issues, along with the associated risk factors. More importantly, these efforts target those residents most at risk. This section provides an overview of community benefit programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It highlights the new requirements and best practices for conducting collaborative community health needs assessment. Recommendations for implementing collaborative PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 36 community health needs assessment and setting priorities based on community health needs assessment results in Prince George's County are also presented. Hospital Community Benefit Programs under Healthcare Reform Community Health Needs Assessment and Community Health Improvement Program The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has many components that promote primary care strengthening and population-based health activities. One is the new Internal Revenue Service Schedule H regula tions requiring that all hospitals work in collaboration with County Health Departments and other community health stakeholders to conduct both a community health needs assessment and develop an associated community health improvement program every three years. The process for the community health needs assessment and community health improvement program is designed to identify common priorities, encourage collective action, and maximize community impact. These new community health needs assessment and community health improvement program requirements present a significant opportunity for collaboration, not only among hospitals but also across the full breadth of other public and community health partners. They also align with the patient-centered primary care and social-ecological models presented earlier in this report. Community benefit was identified as a natural source of collaboration among hospitals operating within Prince George's County and the Health Department and as one that would advance the goals of the strategic plan. A Community Benefits Workgroup was formed to explore the possibility of developing a collaborative, countywide community benefits strategy and how that would be carried out. First, the workgroup reviewed the hospitals' existing needs assessment reports and associated planning documents in order to understand the extent to which these earlier efforts had identified similar priorities and proposed common strategic activities. Next, the workgroup assessed the desire and feasibility for collaboration with respect to an initial set of core priorities and action steps that members had conceived. Finally, the workgroup evaluated the prospect of creating a countywide structure for ongoing coordination and collaboration on community benefit program planning and implementation. John Snow, Inc.'s review of existing plans indicated that there was substantial consistency across the hospitals' and the County Health Department's community health needs assessment. The Public Health Impact Study was a common source of data for the community health needs assessment. Overall, the workgroup concurred that significant opportunities exist for collaborating on future community benefit planning and programs and that future needs assessment will require that updated data be collected at both the County and community levels. Best Practices for Hospital Community Benefit Programs As mentioned above, new regulations require that nonprofit hospitals work in collaboration with the County Health Department and other community health stakeholders to conduct a community health needs assessment and to develop an associated community health improvement program every three years. Health departments are also being encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies to become fully accredited by the National Association of County and City Health Officials. This accreditation process requires that Health Departments engage in periodic needs assessment and planning activities in collaboration with their community health partners. Furthermore, health and social service agencies of all types are regularly involved in their own collaborative assessment and planning processes as part of their usual course of doing business. As a result, there is increasing interest and motivation to collaborate or at least coordinate with respect to community assessment and planning.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 37 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONHospital Community Benefit Program Nonprofit hospitals have always played an important role in increasing access to healthcare. They provide \"community benefit\" in the form of health services for vulnerable or underserved populations, financial assistance or donations for public health programs, free health education programs to help individuals manage their health, and screenings and preventive services. Yet, in the past there has been variation in how and how much community benefit hospitals provide to their communities with little transparency regarding their practices. How Has the Hospital Community Benefit Program Changed under the Patient Protection and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ? As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, nonprofit hospitals must now meet new standards to qualify for federal tax exemption. They must: Conduct a community health needs assessment and develop an implementation plan every three years. They must use local data and meet with local community and public health experts to prioritize public health needs. Adopt and publicize a financial assis tance policy. Limit charges, billing, and collections for individuals eligible for financial assistance under the financial assistance policy. Why Do These Changes Matter? Requiring hospitals to lead a community health needs assessment will ensure that care is targeted where the need is most. This means that resources will be used as efficiently as possible, with an overall result of improved quality of care at reduced cost. The regulations also promote transparency by requiring hospitals to adopt and publicize their financial policies. Sources: Maryland Hospital Associa tion.

In the U.S., 60 percent of hospitals\u2014 approximately 2,900\u2014are nonprofit. They provide an estimated $12.6 billion in community benefit each year (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2012). According to the Maryland Hospital Association, Maryland hospitals provided $1.5 billion in community benefit in 2013.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 38 There is considerable variation in the form of this coordination or collaboration, but typically it falls into three categories. Data Sharing: Leading c ommunity health stakeholders may opt to develop systems that make sure that each has easy access to the same quality, quantitative information that will drive their assessment and planning efforts to ease the data collection burden. A central agency, usually the Health Department, academic institution, or private foundation develops a data warehouse of health-related information and makes it readily available to community agencies. Once data are made available, individual agencies are then responsible for engaging their relevant partners and integrating consumer (qualitative) information. Commission of Third Party Assessor: Leading stakeholders or a lead public agency may opt to commission a third party to conduct comprehensive needs assessment and priority setting. They allow organizations to leverage resources and conduct a more rigorous assessment and lead to a series of recommendations for addressing the identified priorities. Complete In tegration of the Community Health Needs Assessment and the Community Health Improvement Program Process: Leading health and social service providers may fully integrate their assessments and planning processes and pledge to develop one common community health needs assessment and community health improvement program. This is often accomplished through an existing collaborative structure such as a community health task force. It may also be accomplished as a separate collaborative effort. The goal is to collaborate on implementation of the community health needs assessment and creation of a short-, medium-, and long-term action plan that each entity pledges to incorporate into its organizational plan.There are an increasing number of regions, counties, or municipalities that have built collaborative organizations responsible for conducting health needs assessment and planning activities as well as implementing joint community health programs. Typically, these organizations are funded by an array of public and private participants, including Health Departments, service providers, and philanthropic organizations. The Primary Care Coalition of Montgomery County, Maryland; Maine Quality Counts; the Community Health Partnership of Sarasota County, Florida; and San Diego Community Health Partners, Inc. are examples of such collaborations. They conduct needs assessment, establish a set of core and secondary regional priorities, develop a range of community programs, and are supported by all participating stakeholders who, in turn, implement detailed action plans that address community health issues and promote overall health and wellness. Often these collaborations have their own staff that conduct the work but may use the resources of their participating organizations. Typically, these efforts also need ongoing collaborative assessment, quality assurance, performance improvement, and reporting systems. Recommendations for Hospital Community Benefit Programs for Prince George's County Collaboration on community needs assessment and chronic disease program The first recommendation supports more immediate collaboration using the hospitals' and Health Departments' current community benefit plans. Hospital community benefit plans are developed consistent with their fiscal years and, therefore, are in different places relative to planning and implementation. Longer-term collaboration (as outlined further in this section) will align planning and implementation processes.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 39 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONRecommendation 1: Work collectively to reduce the prevalence and burden of chronic disease. Time Frame: Immediate- to Short-TermWork collectively to reduce the prevalence and burden of chronic disease with a particular emphasis on diabetes and hypertension by promoting general wellness and behavioral change, promoting appropriate engagement in primary care, and increasing the number of adults with diabetes/hypertension who receive evidence-based counseling, coaching, and treatment. The following are some specific activities that were considered as part of this recommendation: Develop, e xpand, or support evidenced-based programs that educate the public about health risk factors, health promotion, and basic wellness (e.g., obesity, fitness, physical activity, and healthy eating). Develop, e xpand, or support community screening events that identify and screen residents for diabetes, pre-diabetes, and hypertension with the goal of linking those with new or uncontrolled cases of diabetes and hypertension to appropriate education, behavior change, primary care, and/or specialty care services. Collaborat e with community partners to develop targeted, evidence-based diabetes and hypertension education, health promotion, behavior change, care management, and treatment programs for those who are most at risk. Encourag e collaboration between hospitals and other community partners to implement emergency department-based initiatives aimed at reducing inappropriate (preventable/avoidable) emergency department utilizations and promoting greater chronic disease management. Encourag e hospitals and other community partners to implement care transition initiatives aimed at promoting better follow-up and care coordination for those with chronic disease. Work collectiv ely to measure impact and ensure that measures are aligned with the Maryland State Health Improvement Process/Local Health Improvement Coalitions. Creating Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership The following recommendations are intended for longer-term time frames and create an overarching community benefits planning infrastructure referred to as the Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership. Future community benefit programs would be developed and implemented collaboratively through the Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership. The following recommendations would be implemented over the next one to three years. Recommendation 2: Create the Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership. Time Frame: Medium-TermCreate the Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership made up of representatives from the five County hospitals and the Health Department. The Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership could be a partnership with a Memorandum of Agreement or a nonprofit corporation. Some activities to form the Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership are included here. Convene the Coun ty's five hospitals and Health Department in 2015, and agree on how to proceed in the short- and long-term with the assumption that the group will operate as the Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership. Facilita te agreement on a series of short-, medium-, and long-term strategic community health initiatives on which the Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership would agree to collaborate. Specific focus should be on identifying one or two initiatives that will be the focal points of the partnership. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 40 Coordinat e the County's community benefits program activities, and over time the partners would implement a more collaborative agenda of activities that would be operated by the formal Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership. Ensure that the activities tha t are implemented are aligned with best practices, and develop an evaluation plan that tracks the progress and impact of the collective community health activities. Promote a wareness of the partnership's efforts, and work to build broader collective action among other stakeholders. Recommendation 3: Work collaboratively to conduct a Prince George's County community health needs assessment. Time Frame: Medium-TermPrince George's County's five hospitals, in partnership with the County's Health Department, should work collaboratively to conduct a Prince George's County community health needs assessment and then work collectively to implement community health benefit activities. This process should start no later than 2016 so as to comply with the Internal Revenue Service requirements. Below are some specific activities that were considered as part of this recommendation. Creat e a broadly representative community health needs assessment steering committee to develop and implement a centralized community health needs assessment approach that collects quantitative and qualitative data on community need, service system capacity, barriers to care, possible strategic responses, and other relevant information. Engage r esidents and health and social service providers through surveys, interviews, community meetings, and/or focus groups. Facilita te a strategic planning process that identifies leading healthcare priorities, along with a series of agreed-upon community health strategies addressing priority issues that community partners will strive to implement. Develop a cen tralized, countywide community health needs assessment report and community health improvement program that summarizes needs, priorities, and high-level strategic goals. Recommendation 4: Develop a shared measurement system. Time Frame: Short-TermDevelop a shared measurement system that facilitates program alignment, tracks progress and impact, and helps to hold programs accountable. There should be a series of measures established to track the core set of activities on which the Prince George's County Community Health Benefit Partnership has agreed. The County Health Department, hospitals, and other community stakeholders should first track a series of measures related to their community health strategies and, to the extent possible, ensure that measures are aligned with Maryland's community health improvement program. Once measures are defined or have an agreement, participants need to track and report data to a central entity (or individual) for aggregation and analysis. Recommendation 5: Work collectively to promote access to primary care within community benefit programs. Time Frame: Short-TermWork collectively to promote access to primary care and ensure appropriate primary care engagement among County residents, particularly those most at risk. Specifically, hospitals should partner with the County Health Department, primary care providers, and other County partners to: Expand access to primary c are in certain geographic areas and for low-income, Medicaid insured and uninsured residents more generally. Expand implementa tion of emergency department diversion programs. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 41 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION Facilitate appropriate, timely, primary care follo w-up after discharge from the hospital so as to reduce inappropriate hospital readmission. Increase use of Chesapeake R egional Information System for our Patients data to identify \"hot spots\" for emergency department diversion, hospital-to-home transitional care, and patient engagement into primary care. Building a Sustainable Primary Healthcare System A Prince George's County Primary Healthcare Alliance (Primary Healthcare Alliance) should be developed to ensure successful implementation of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. This section provides an overview of a recommended structure for the Primary Healthcare Alliance, with examples drawn from two successful models. Recommendations for implementation of the Primary Healthcare Alliance have been informed by best practice models but are designed for Prince George's County. Primary Healthcare Alliance Mission, Governance, and Operational StructureThe proposed structure for the Primary Healthcare Alliance is based upon industry best practices for community-based improvement initiatives and revolves around collaboration, engagement, and accountability. Throughout the planning process, project leaders, advisors, and stakeholders stressed the importance of moving from planning to action and establishing a structure to ensure sustainability. The Primary Healthcare Alliance would achieve that objective. Mission: To trans form health and healthcare in Prince George's County by leading, collaborating, and aligning efforts to improve primary care delivery. The initial priority for the Primary Healthcare Alliance would be to implement the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan for Prince George's County. Governance: Governed by an independent, volunteer Board of Directors and formed under the following guiding principles. Board members should r epresent the wide range of key stakeholders, including consumers. Some members would be appointed to ensure appropriate representation and collaboration with key partners such as the Health Department. Board members should r eflect the socioeconomic diversity of the County. The Board should operate independently and be able to authorize collaborations or partnerships with other entities that would help to fulfill its goals, carry out special projects, and/or improve healthcare in the County. The Board should be of a manageable siz e but sufficient to have broad-based representation and carry out functions. Smaller subcommittees could be used to focus on specific areas. The Board should be self-perpe tuating with rules for nominations, elections, and appointments defined in the by-laws. Organiz ational Structure: The Primary Healthcare Alliance would be housed within the Office of the County Executive and would be appropriately and adequately staffed to carry out its functions. Initial funding would be needed for start-up, but the goal would be for the Primary Healthcare Alliance to be financially self-sustaining through public and private grants and contracts for services. Start-up funding would come through County appropriation and contributions from stakeholder organizations. The Primary Healthcare Alliance would be managed by an executive director who would report to the Board of Directors and be responsible for carrying out operations.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 42 Primary Healthcare Alliance Initiatives Several initiatives identified as part of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan would be managed through the Primary Healthcare Alliance. These initiatives would range from one-time efforts such as convening a task force on care coordination collaboration to ongoing functions such as administration of the Prince George's HealthAssure Program. Best Practice Models for Sustainability of a Primary Healthcare Alliance In reviewing models for sustainable health improvement initiatives, John Snow, Inc. found the following two organizations that have demonstrated success and that could serve as models for the Prince George's County Primary Healthcare Alliance. 1. The Primary Care Coalition of Mon tgomery County works with clinics, hospitals, healthcare providers, and other community partners to coordinate health services. Its mission is to be the catalyst for developing and coordinating a community-based healthcare system that strives for universal access and health equity for underserved community members. The Primary Care Coalition is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. An all-volunteer Board of Directors governs the Primary Care Coalition, overseeing its business, affairs, funds, and property. The Board holds and exercises all power and authority of the Primary Care Coalition and consists of up to 24 elected members, each of whom is a voting director. The Primary Care Coalition's president and chief executive officer serve as ex officio members of the board. 2. Maine Quality Counts is an independent healthc are collaborative committed to improving the health and healthcare for the citizens of Maine by leading, collaborating, and aligning improvement efforts. Formed in 2003 and incorporated in 2006, Quality Counts provides leadership, advocacy, support for improving care, and has defined the following current strategic priorities: (1) further increase s ystem alignment to transform health and healthcare; (2) promot e a sustainable system of quality improvement assistance to all providers in Maine; (3) fos ter meaningful consumer engagement in transforming health and healthcare; (4) promot e integration of behavioral and physical health; and (5) assure the or ganizational success and sustainability of Quality Counts needed to meet its mission. Quality Counts works through a diverse group of stakeholders to coordinate disparate efforts for supporting local, patient-centered care. Through an impartial forum, stakeholders in health and healthcare can view and exchange ideas. Recommendations for Prince George's Primary Healthcare Alliance Recommendation 1: Convene the initial Board of Directors to serve as the governing body of the Primary Healthcare Alliance. Time Frame: Initial Steps and OngoingDevelop board structure and by-laws consistent with guiding principles as outlined (see models for Primary Healthcare Authorities). Recommendation 2: Create the Primary Healthcare Alliance. Time Frame: Short-TermUnder the direction of the Board of Directors, establish the mission and organizational structure. Hire the executive director and launch operations. Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and evaluating is one of the key steps in any improvement process, such as the one being undertaken through the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. Figure 4 (see page 43), developed by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, shows evaluation is the first step after taking action. Monitoring and evaluation activities are distinctly different. Monitoring is the ongoing review of data to inform whether a project, program, or initiative is on track. Evaluation is a point-in-time activity that asks questions about whether the initiative is having the intended impact and achieving desired goals. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 43 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION Figure 4. Take Action Model for Improvement Image: University of Wisconsin, Population Health Institute, County Health Rankings & Roadmaps 2014. countyhealthrankings.org Need for Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and evaluating the progress of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan's implementation is beneficial for many reasons. Community-level change is long-term and requires continued engagement of stakeholders and commitment of resources. The progress and success of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan should be measured using both process and outcome metrics. Process metrics track which components of the plan are being implemented and their progress. Outcome metrics show if the plan's goals are being achieved and would include those measuring access to patient-centered primary care, improvement in health outcomes, and contribution to the County's economic growth. Results of monitoring and evaluation are placed into the planning process so that changes can be made to the strategy, implementation of the strategy, or both. Monitoring and evaluation is also a way to continue engagement and momentum with the community and stakeholders. Transparency and tracking increase the accountability of stakeholders and partners to the community and to one another. This may motivate the community by raising awareness and engagement. Best Practices in Effective Monitoring and EvaluationThree general best practices for effective monitoring and evaluation include tracking community engagement, using available metrics, and creating a way to share results with the community. Track Community Eng agement: Monitoring the progress at the community level could happen in a number of different ways. For example, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation developed a tool that could be used as a self-assessment of a community's readiness to build a healthy community. This tool was developed out of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Building a Culture of Health initiative and County Health Rankings. The Primary Healthcare Alliance, having been given the responsibility of monitoring and evaluation, could use a similar assessment tool to track community engagement and progress toward achieving the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan goals. Use Metrics That Ar e Readily Available: Evaluation and monitoring can be costly and are time-intensive activities. For this reason, it is recommended that, to the extent possible, existing monitoring and evaluation metrics be used, since there is no additional cost to develop and collect primary data. For example, the monitoring and evaluation plan would use the Chesapeake Regional Information System for Our Patients data to measure improvement in emergency department utilization at the community and County levels. Creat e a Report Card as a Way to Share Results with Stakeholders and the Community: One best practice in monitoring is to create a tool that is easily understood. The sharing of results can be done through a report card format (see page 44).

People unders tand it. Most of us have experience with report cards. The language of grades communicates to a broad base of people. Selection of a few k ey issues or categories helps focus attention on problem solving. Report car ds effectively communicate a general message, yet allow for more detail to be expressed. Recommended Monitoring and Evaluation Plan for Prince George's County Data Collection, Analysis, and ReportingData collection, analysis, and reporting for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan would be consolidated under the Primary Healthcare Alliance. The monitoring and evaluation plan would include the following: Process Monitoring: Monit ors which components of the strategic plan are being implemented, how successfully they are being implemented, and any changes that are needed for successful implementation. Progress of implementation would be monitored against a detailed implementation plan. Outcome Monit oring: Monitors the plan's achievement of the desired outcomes, including access to patient-centered primary care, improvement in health outcomes, and contribution to economic development. Further, outcome monitoring would happen at two levels: County and local area (defined community or zip code level). The monitoring and evaluation plan would define the metrics used for evaluation, data sources and collection process, baseline or target measures, and reporting format (report card). (See Table 3. Recommended Metrics for Monitoring and Evaluation for County Health Rankings on page 46.) Data collection and analysis for the monitoring and evaluation of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan would be coordinated with other initiatives. For example, data collected would also be used to develop the community health needs assessment and community health improvement program. MetricsRecommended metrics are outlined in Table 3 on page 46. Several of the metrics were drawn from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's County Health Rankings for two reasons. First, County Health Rankings is consistent with the social-ecological model of health promotion used in developing the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan for Prince George's County. Secondly, County Health Rankings provides comparative data for surrounding counties, the State of Maryland, and top performers around the nation. Although County Health Rankings is at the County level, it is recommended that measurement also happen at the local level. Local-area data are needed to evaluate the impact of the plan on specific communities to ensure that all residents benefit from the improvements. Recommended metrics from County Health Rankings, along with baseline measures for Prince George's County and sources used by County Health Rankings, are included in Table 3 on page 46. Following the table are additional metrics recommended for comprehensive monitoring and evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation plan would also include metrics specific to implementation of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. These metrics (and corresponding sources of data) are listed below: Number of primary car e providers recruited to establish practices in Health Investment Zones (Primary Healthcare Alliance). Number of primary car e practices in Prince George's County that have achieved patient-centered medical home recognition or accreditation (survey of primary care practices, PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 46 data request from accrediting organizations and state agencies). Consumer satisf action (focus groups and/or patient satisfaction surveys). Percen tage of residents that leave the County for healthcare services (Maryland Hospital Association and Maryland Health Care Commission patient origin/destination studies, consumer surveys). Number of graduat es from educational and training programs for advance practice public health nurses, community health workers, and other patient-centered medical home-related occupations (reported by Prince George's County Community College, University of Maryland, and Bowie State).

PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 47 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONV. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY MARKETING AND BRANDING STRATEGY Introduction The Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan was created in part to assist the County in improving the health outcomes of its residents by building high-quality primary healthcare capacity (including mental/behavioral and dental services) within the County to enhance access and quality of our primary care services. The branding and marketing efforts will contribute to the creation of impactful communications that influence and motivate residents to take positive actions that drive healthy outcomes and improve the quality of their lives. The branding and marketing strategies provide a road map that outlines the vision, audience, initial branding strategies, and focused campaign for the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan. These strategies are intended to provide a focused approach to help facilitate changes in the knowledge and perception around the quality of, and access to, healthcare in the County. They are also intended to help reduce communications complexity among the diverse targeted communities and audiences. The diversity of the communities within Prince George's County requires targeted messages that speak to a variety of cultures and circumstances. It is important to develop a customized marketing strategy that is rooted in acknowledging and respecting this diversity. There are two primary groups the marketing strategy is designed to reach: Community residents and pa tients. Physicians, den tists, mental health/behavioral, and other healthcare providers. Within these two groups are subgroups for whom individual messages should be designed and targeted. For example, the messages that we communicate to providers who live in Prince George's County, but work elsewhere, may be different from those messages we develop for providers who neither live nor work in the community. Similarly, among the patient and community residents, unique messages will be needed for different subgroups. For example, messages that resonate with individuals who were born and raised in Prince George's County may be different from messages geared toward young families setting up households in newly developed communities or for recent immigrants. With that in mind, the core audiences for this branding and marketing strategy are: Community Residents and Patients Residents curr ently receiving their healthcare in the County. Residents curr ently receiving their healthcare outside the County. Recent immigr ants. Young families with a single or dual pr ofessional parent(s). Older adults who have liv ed in the County 20 years or more. Physicians, Dentists, Mental Health/Behavioral, and Other Healthcare Providers Healthcare pr oviders who live in the County but work outside the County. Healthcare pr oviders who live outside the County that we wish to encourage to live and work in the County. Vision and Goals The vision of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan is that the healthcare delivery system in Prince George's County will be noted for its commitment to ensuring the delivery of primary care is patient-centered; everyone has the opportunity to thrive by living a healthy lifestyle; good health is valued by all residents within our communities, whether medical, social, behavioral, and/or environmental; and insuring that our healthcare workers are well-trained PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 48 and customer-focused in order to meet the demands of the future. The goals of the marketing strategy are to: Conve y that good health matters and that quality primary and preventative healthcare is accessible in all communities of the County. Differen tiate the messaging to accommodate the diversity and cultures. Monitor outc omes and adjust communication tactics accordingly. Marketing and Branding Strategies Changing community behaviors and social norms is more of a marathon than a sprint. Within any given population, individual members are at different stages regarding their readiness and/or willingness to adopt new behaviors. The marketing strategy explains the specific goals and desired outcomes of the marketing campaign. The branding strategy, which is one component of the marketing strategy creates a solid, consistent brand for healthcare in Prince George's County. It requires the development of a strong, positive, and emotional connection between Prince George's residents and the healthcare services available in the County. Marketing StrategyWhile the overall marketing strategy is to foster a positive change in the perception of healthcare in the County, it is imperative that we make substantive and essential improvements in the provision of our primary care providers and other essential healthcare workers. The increased access to primary care services will encourage residents to use these services in the County. Two targeted marketing goals are recommended: one directed at healthcare providers and the other at County residents.Targeted Marketing Goal #1: Recruit and retain primary care physicians, dentists, and other healthcare providers. This goal is intended to encourage providers to work and live in Prince George's County. Marketing efforts will focus on investing in the community in which you live, opportunities for professional growth, and making a positive difference in the health outcomes provided to residents in Prince George's County. In addition, the marketing efforts will support and promote the financial assistance available to physicians who provide healthcare to patients in the Health Investment Zones. The following messages will be targeted specifically for healthcare and allied health professionals: Affordable c ost of living, housing, and a high quality of life with parks and recreation in the County and nearby beaches. Opportunities for prof essional growth and career advancement. Poten tial to make a positive impact in the community where you live and work. Economic opportunity c ommensurate with surrounding counties and the District of Columbia. Financial assistance in es tablishing practices within the County's Health Investment Zones. Targeted Marketing Goal #2: Recapture patients and reduce outmigration of residents seeking healthcare services. Many Prince George's County residents choose to receive care outside of the County for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, a perception of poor-quality healthcare, inaccessible primary care services, inconvenience, and lack of available transportation. Messages should be designed to encourage patients to receive their primary and preventative healthcare services in the County. PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 49 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONThe message should inform the consumers that Prince George's County provides patient-centered primary healthcare and preventative services that are accessible and customer focused; physicians and other healthcare professionals have the highest character, education, and skills; and our healthcare support staff are well trained with a focus that the patient is first! The marketing strategy must include messages that speak to the various audience segments. Prince George's County residents are diverse socially, culturally, and economically. As noted by a participant at one of the four community meetings, \"We talk about Prince George's County, but I feel there are two Prince George's Counties.\" Five of the 10 most affluent African-American communities across the United States are located within Prince George's County. The average household income in these communities exceeds $100,000. On the other end of the spectrum are the communities primarily located inside the Beltway. The average household income in these areas is less than $60,000. Inside the Beltway, between 15 percent and almost 50 percent of the population is defined as low income (live in households below 200 percent of the federal poverty level). The lower-income geographic areas within Prince George's County are predominantly African-American and include Hispanics/Latinos, Caucasians, and, to a lesser extent, Africans and Asians. Market segmentation will be needed when developing campaigns to ensure that the marketing approaches and campaigns are effective in reaching the intended audience and successful in creating the desired response. The marketing strategy includes the search for additional input from diverse audiences in order to ensure that the marketing efforts are appropriately tailored to all County residents. For example, 67 percent of residents attending the community meetings have lived in Prince George's County for more than 20 years. From the stakeholder interviews, we learned that families with young children are less likely to attend the community meetings because of time commitments and conflicts with school and sporting activities. In addition, a small number of residents attending the community meetings indicated that they reside in the more affluent communities of Prince George's County. Despite outreach efforts with Hispanic/Latino, African, and Asian populations, their presence at the community meetings was minimal. Additional research will be required to develop an effective marketing campaign to recapture patients within these population groups. Brand StrategyBranding is one of the most important aspects of the marketing strategy for the primary healthcare system in Prince George's County. The brand is what the primary healthcare system stands for. It is a promise to the residents of the County that they will be provided with customer-focused, quality, primary healthcare and preventative services. It is a promise to ensure that healthcare professionals and support staff are highly trained and customer focused and that the patient is our first priority. Everyone should be aware of Prince George's County's commitment to provide patient-centered primary healthcare and preventative services to community residents. This message should be applied to all written communication using the same logo, color scheme, and consistent look and feel throughout. The brand is Prince George's County's promise to the community residents that provisions will be made to ensure that everyone has access to a quality healthcare system. The recommended brand is \"Prince George's County, Our Health Matters!\" Clear, consistent visuals, tone, and messaging will support this brand and create a culture, expectation, and realization that good health is valued by all residents within our communities, whether medical, social, behavioral, or environmental\u2014each is important!PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 50 Marketing Communication Campaign The marketing campaign will utilize a range of communication channels. Selected communication channels will reflect findings from the formative research (though additional research is required to further segment the target audiences). The communication channels include print material disseminated through community organizations (i.e., churches, schools, and health fairs) and providers, digital media, outdoor advertising, and radio. Creating multiple entry points for seeing and/or interacting with Prince George's County's marketing efforts allows increased opportunity for an individual to see the intended message. There are a number of benefits to this approach. First, it often takes multiple viewings for individuals to take the desired action. Second, from a community perspective, availability across various channels increases the overall probability that a message will be viewed by the broadest spectrum of people. Lastly, presenting the desired message in diverse locations creates the perception of the desired social norm before the behavior itself is routinely established. Brand Community Campaign The Brand Experience The tone of the brand will be supportive, confident, proud, warm, and caring. It will emphasize the emotional benefits of receiving good healthcare in Prince George's County. Residents should come away with the feeling that the community cares about them and that they are proud to receive healthcare in Prince George's County. The benefits of the brand and understanding from the targeted audiences include, but are not limited to: Emotional Benefits-P atients feeling respected, feeling cared for by their providers, and feeling comforted knowing their providers are well trained and have the expertise to care for them. Structural or Institutional Bene fits-Providers having access to opportunities for professional growth and development, loan repayment, and provisions made for business support services. Brand Positioning Statement A brand positioning statement captures the essence of the brand-who we are, what we do, and for whom we do it, along with a key differentiator, which is our brand promise. The goal of the Prince George's County brand strategy is to communicate the simple, singular idea that we are committed to high-quality healthcare in Prince George's County. Visual IdentityBy defining the key elements of our visual branding\u2014 relevance (do the visuals support our defined brand strategy and promise?), quality (are the visuals professionally designed with high-quality aesthetics?), and consistency (are the visuals consistent at all market touch points?)\u2014we will ensure that our visuals reinforce our positioning and brand experience. (See photos on page 52 for examples of the brand on billboards, in grocery stores, and in schools.) Brand RequirementsTo ensure that we provide a consistent brand experience, we must guarantee that every interaction with our audience supports our brand strategy. Part of that results from exposure to the brand through consistent visual imagery, tone, placement, and message saturation. The patient experience, exposure to the messages, and interactions with healthcare staff providing the services reinforces the branding experience. It is critical that all staff who work directly with the patient, or on behalf of the patient, support the brand promise of Prince George's County. The brand will be displayed in how we greet and speak with the patient, how we share and discuss health concerns with the patient and their family (whether in person or on the telephone), and how we speak with each other regarding the PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 51 PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONpatient's private health concerns. Work force training in all aspects of customer service must be provided for all staff in Prince George's County. Reinforcement of good customer service to support the brand may occur during employee orientations, employee performance reviews, and staff meetings. Monitoring and Evaluation of Marketing and Branding Campaigns Initial evaluation activities will focus on tracking outputs and assessing short-term outcomes of the first phase of the branding strategy. The initial evaluation will determine if our branding and marketing efforts have helped facilitate changes in knowledge and perception of the access and quality of healthcare in Prince George's County. The steps for evaluating the marketing efforts include: Collect process dat a such as the number of materials distributed, media buys, and/or people attending an event. Conduct surve ys that assess the engagement, awareness, attitude, and behavior of our audiences for each of the target campaigns. Inter cept Surveys: Intercept surveys in the community may serve as a source to measure brand recognition and the potential reach of specific communication channels. Evaluators may conduct an intercept survey using a convenience sample of respondents from the target audiences recruited from sites where branding and marketing materials were placed and/or events were held. Evaluators may administer a short questionnaire to assess brand awareness, recall, client satisfaction, and whether the marketing effort triggered a decision to take any action (e.g., seek care in Prince George's County or explore career opportunities). Community Partner Surv ey: In addition to tracking the number of materials distributed to community partners, evaluators can send a follow -up surv ey to community partners who received materials and/or participated in events. The survey will collect quantitative information about distribution activities, as well as qualitative information about target audiences' responses to the materials. Obtain da ta to evaluate the desired outcomes of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan; for example, has the percentage of residents seeking care within Prince George's County increased, has outmigration decreased, and what is the actual customer experience. (See page 54 for examples of questions and sources used for data collection.) Summary and Next Steps Once the overall marketing and branding strategies have been determined, next steps for implementing the proposed marketing efforts will likely include the following: Finalize a time line for de veloping materials and the marketing plan. Finalize a time line for dissemina ting materials and implementing the marketing plan. Develop pot ential marketing messages and materials. Pilot messages and mat erials with members of the target audiences. Identify e xisting community meetings and events. Reach out to pot ential primary and secondary partners regarding marketing campaign venues and materials. Finalize messages and ma terials. Disseminate ma terials. Begin monitoring and ev aluation activities. Refine mark eting efforts based on evaluation of findings and resources. It is anticipated that the evaluation of marketing activities will be an iterative process and that PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION 52 refinements will be needed, working with available resources. In summary, the branding and marketing efforts set forth in this strategy will help contribute to the community's perception of the value of good health and the quality of healthcare resources in their community.

PHASING PLAN FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION Implementing the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan will be done in phases to balance resource requirements and align with supporting initiatives. Preferably, one of the first steps would be to establish the Primary Healthcare Alliance. The Primary Healthcare Alliance will facilitate implementation of the Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan and guide additional decisions that are needed to work out details and achieve successful implementation. Detailed implementation plans would be developed for each of the major components of the plan. A broad implementation phasing plan is outlined below.

Provider Dir ected Medical Practice: The primary care provider leads a team of individuals at the practice level who collectively take responsibility for the ongoing care of patients. Whole Person Orien tation: The primary care provider is responsible for all the patient's healthcare needs or taking responsibility for appropriately arranging care with other qualified professionals. This includes care for all stages of life, acute care, chronic care, preventive services, and end of life care. Source: Steffian Bradley Architects Coordinated Care: Care is coordinated and/or int egrated across all elements of the complex healthcare system (e.g., subspecialty care, hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes) and the patient's community (e.g., family, public, and private community-based services). Quality and Safe ty: Providers practice evidence- based medicine and utilize technology-based clinical decision support tools. Patients actively engaged in decision-making regarding their treatment and care. Patient, families/caregivers, and staff participate in quality improvement activities. Enhanced Access to Care: Through systems such as open scheduling, expanded hours.PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONPRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY Primary Healthcare Strategic Plan THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSIONAppendix A-10 Planning a Medical Home The planning process should serve as a way to support your commitment to team-based care, patient-centered design, and provide optimal opportunities for staff and patient communication in a flexible design.

It is the policy of the UM Capital Region Health Entities to provide Financial Assistance based on indigence or high medical expenses for patients who meet specified financial criteria and request such assistance. The purpose of the following policy statement is to describe how applications for Financial Assistance should be made, the criteria for eligibility, and the steps for processing applications. DHS Entities will publish the availability of Financial Assistance on a yearly basis in their local newspapers and will pos t notices of availability at appropriate intake locations as well as the Billing Office. Notice of availability will also be sen t to patients with patien t bills. Signage in key patien t access areas will be made available . A Patien t Billing and Financial Assistance Information Sheet will be provided before discharge and will be available to all patients upon request. Financial Assistance may be extended when a review of a patient's individual financial circumstances has been conducted and documented . This should include a review of the patient's existing medical expenses and obligations (including any accounts having gone to bad debt except those accounts that have gone to lawsui t and a judgmen t has been obtained) and any projected medical expenses . Financial Assistance Application s may be offered to patients whose accounts are with a collection agency and may apply only to those accounts on which a judgmen t has no t been granted. DHS retain s the righ t in its sole discretion to determine a patient's ability to pay. All patient s presenting for emergency service s will be treated regardless of their ability to pay. For emergent/urgen t services , applications to the Financial Clearance Program will be completed , received , and evaluated retrospectively and will not delay patients from receiving care. PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY Consistent with their mission to deliver compassionate and high quality healthcare services and to advocate for those who do not have the means to pay for medically necessary care, UM Capital Region Health hospitals strive to ensure that the financial capacity of people who need health care services does not prevent them from seeking or receiving care. Specific exclusions to coverage under the Financia l Assistance program include the following: FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Policy Number: PAS - FIN.01 Page: 2 of 8 PROCEDURE, Cont'd 1.Services provided by healthcare providers not affiliated with UM Capital Region Health hospitals (e.g., durable medical equipment, home health services) 2.Patients whose insurance program or policy denies coverage for services by their insurance company (e.g., HMO, PPO, or Workers Compensation), are not eligible for the Financial Assistance Program. a.Generally, the Financial Assistance Program is not available to cover services that are denied by a patient's insurance company; however, exceptions may be made on a case by case basis considering medical and programmatic implications. 3.Unpaid balances resulting from cosmetic or other non-medically necessary services 4.Patient convenience items 5.Patient meals and lodging 6.Physician charges related to the date of service are excluded from DHS financial assistance policy. Patients who wish to pursue financial assistance for physician-related bills must contact the physician directly. Patients may be ineligible for Financial Assistance for the following reasons: 1.Refusal to provide requested documentation or provide incomplete information. 2.Have insurance coverage through an HMO, PPO, Workers Compensation, Medicaid, or other insurance programs that deny access to the hospital due to insurance plan restrictions/limits. 3.Failure to pay co-payments as required by the Financial Assistance Program. 4.Failure to keep current on existing payment arrangements with DHS. 5.Failure to make appropriate arrangements on past payment obligations owed to UM Capital Region Health (including those patients who were referred to an outside collection agency for a previous debt). 6.Refusal to be screened for other assistance programs prior to submitting an application to the Financial Clearance Program. 7.Refusal to divulge information pertaining to a pending legal liability claim 8.Foreign-nationals traveling to the United States seeking elective, non-emergent medical care Patients who become ineligible for the program will be required to pay any open balances and may be submitted to a bad debt service if the balance remains unpaid in the agreed upon time periods. Patients who indicate they are unemployed and have no insurance coverage shall be required to submit a Financial Assistance Application unless they meet Presumptive Financial Assistance Eligibility criteria . If the patien t qualifies for COBRA coverage , patient' s financial ability to pay COBRA insurance premiums shall be reviewed by the Financial Counselor/Coordinator and recommendations shall be made to Senior Leadership . Individuals with the financial capacity to purchase health insurance shall be encouraged to do so, as a means of assuring access to health care services and for their overall personal health. Coverage amounts will be calculated based upon 200-500% of income as defined by federal poverty guidelines published each year in the Federal Register. The new guidelines are effective with the first month following publication. Presumptive Financial Assistance Patients may also be considered for Presumptive Financial Assistance Eligibility. There are instances when a patien t may appear eligible for financial assistance , but there is no financial assistance form on file. There is adequate information provided by the patient or through other sources , which provide sufficient evidence to provide the patient with financial assistance. In the event there is no evidence to support a patient's eligibility for financial assistance, UM Capital Region Health reserves the right to use outside agencies or information in determining estimated income amounts for the basis of determining financial assistance eligibility and potential reduced care rates. Once determined, due to the inherent nature of presumptive circumstances, the only financial assistance that can be granted is a 100% write-off of the account balance. Presumptive Financial Assistance Eligibility shall only cover the patient's specific date of service. Presumptive eligibility may be determined on the basis of individual life circumstances that may include: FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Policy Number: PAS - FIN.01 Page: 3 of 8 PROCEDURE, Cont'd a.Active Medical Assistance pharmacy coverage b.SLMB coverage c.PAC coverage d.Homelessness e.Medical Assistance and Medicaid Managed Care patients for services provided in the ER beyond the coverage of these programs f.Medical Assistance spend down amounts g.Eligibility for other state or local assistance programs h.Patient is deceased with no known estate i.Patients that are determined to meet eligibility criteria established under former State Only Medical Assistance Program j.Non-US Citizens deemed non -compliant k.Non-Eligible Medical Assistance services for Medical As sistance eligible patients l.Unidentified patients (Doe accounts that we have exhausted all efforts to locate and/or ID) m.Bankruptcy, by law, as mandated by the federal courts Specific services or criteria that are ineligible for Presumptive Financial Assist ance include: a.Purely elective procedures (example - Cosmetic) are not covered under the program . b.Uninsured patients seen in the Emergency Department under Emergency Petition will not be considered under the presumptive financial assistance program until the Maryland Medicaid Psych program has been billed. PROCEDURES 1.There are designated persons who will be responsible for taking Financial Assistance applications. These staff can be Financial Counselors, Patient Financial Receivable Coordinators, Customer Service Representatives, etc. 2.Every possible effort will be made to provide financial clearance prior to date of service. Where possible, designated staff will consult via phone or meet with patients who request Financial Assistance to determine if they meet preliminary criteria for assistance. a.Staff will complete an eligibility check with the Medicaid program for Self-Pay patients to verify whether the patient has current coverage. b.Preliminary data will be entered into a third party data exchange system to determine probable eligibility. To facilitate this process each applicant must provide information about family size and income. To help applicants complete the process, we will provide an application that will let them know what paperwork is required for a final determination of eligibility. c.Applications initiated by the patient will be tracked, worked and eligibility determined within the third party data and workflow tool.

A written request for missing information will be sent to the patient. Oral submission of needed information will be accepted, where appropriate. 4.A patient can qualify for Financial Assistance either through lack of sufficient insurance or exce ssive medical expenses. Once a patient has submitted all the required information, the Financial Counselor will review and analyze the application and forward it to the Patient Financial Services Department for final determination of eligibility based on D HS guidelines. a.If the patient's application for Financial Assistance is determined to be complete and appropriate, the Financial Coordinator will recommend the patient's level of eligibility and forward for a second and final approval. i)If the patient doe s qualify for Financial Assistance, the Financial Coordinator will notify clinical staff who may then schedule the patient for the appropriate hospital -based service. ii)If the patient does not qualify for Financial Assistance, the Financial Coordinator will notify the clinical staff of the determination and the non -emergent/urgent hospital -based services will not be scheduled.

However, there are no limitations on the Financial Assistance eligibility period. Each eligibility period will be determined on a case -by-case basis. If additional healthcare services are provided beyond the approval period, patients must reapply to the program for clearance. In addition, changes to the patient's income, assets, expenses or family status are expected to be communicated to the Financial Assistance Pr ogram Department . All Extraordinary Collections Action activities, as defined below, willFINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Policy Number: PAS - FIN.01 Page: 5 of 8 PROCEDURE, Cont'd be terminated once the patient is approved for financial assistance and all the patient responsible balances are paid.

Except in exceptional circumstances , these actions will occur no earlier than 120 days from submission of first bill to the patient and will be preceded by notice 30 day s prior to commencement of the ECA action . Availability of financial assistance will be communicated to the patient and a presumptive eligibility review will occur prior to any action being taken. i)Garnishments may be applied to these patients if awarded judgment. ii)A lien may be placed by the Court on primary residences. The facility will not pursue foreclosure of a primary residence but may maintain our position as a secured creditor if a property is otherwise foreclosed upon. iii)Closed account balances that appear on a credit report or referred for judgment/garnishment may be reopened should the patient contact the facility regarding the balance report. Payment will be expected from the patient to resolve any credit issues, until the facility deems the bal ance should remain written off. iv)Extraordinary Collection Actions require the approval of the Finan cial Clearance Committee. 7.If a patient is determined to be ineligible, all efforts to collect co -pays, deductibles or a percentage of the expected balance for the service will be made prior to the date of service or may be scheduled for collection on the date of service. 8.A letter of final determination will be submitted to each patient who has formally submitted an application. 9.Refund decisions are based on when the patient was determined unable to pay compared to when the patient payments were made. Refunds may be issued back to the patient for credit balances, due to patient payments, resulted from approved financial assistance on considered balance(s). Payments received for care rendered during the financial assistance eligibility window will be refunded, if the amount exceeds the patient's determined responsibility by $5.00 or more. 10.Patients who have access to other medical care (e.g., primary and secondary insurance coverage or a required service provider, also known as a carve -out), must utilize and exhaust their network bene fits before applying for the Financial Assistance Program. Financial Hardship The amount of uninsured medical costs incurred at any UM Capital Region Health facility will be considered in determining a patient's eligibility for the Financial Assistance Program. The followi ng guidelines are outlined as a separate, supplemental determination of Financial Assistance, known as Financial Hardship. Financial Hardship will be offered to all patients who apply for Financial Assistance. Medical Financial Hardship Assistance is available for patient s who otherwise do no t qualify for Financial Assistance under the primary guidelines of this policy, but for whom: 1)Their medical debt incurred at UM Capital Region Health facilities exceeds 25% of the Family Annual Household Income, which is creating Medical Financial Hardship; and 2)who meet the income standards for this level of Assistance.

If the first level of appeal does not result in the denial being overturned, patients have the option of escalating to the next level of management for additional reconsideration. The escalation can progress up to the Chief Financial Officer who will render a final decision. A letter of final determination will be submitted to each patient who has formally submitted an appeal.
