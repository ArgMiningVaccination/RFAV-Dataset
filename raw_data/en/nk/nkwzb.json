There's Natural Pain Relief for Sinuses! [Dr. Robin Terranella](https://www.swintegrativemedicine.com/blog/author/dr-robin-terranella) Naturopathic Doctors in Phoenix Provide Natural Sinus Pain Relief Sinus pain, and sinus headaches, are often the result of acute sinus infections, or rhinitis. Naturopathic doctors use multiple techniques to relieve the inflammation that causes these painful, long-lived infections, which can provide immediate relief from their symptoms. In many cases, sinus infections are caused by [seasonal allergies](//www.swintegrativemedicine.com/blog/bid/145117/Need-Allergy-Relief-Visit-a-Naturopathic-Doctor). In others, inflammation, a chronic cold or excess mucus production allows bacteria to take up residence and wreak havoc on your sinus cavities. The more you can do to use natural sinus pain relief, the less likely you will need antibiotics or steroids, both of which can have serious negative side effects. Did you know antibiotics are rarely effective at healing sinus infections? It's true. For years, doctors have prescribed high doses of antibiotics in order to cure sinus infections. Unfortunately, a large percentage of patients with chronic infections would return with a relapse, and the host of negative side effects that so often accompany antibiotic use. Recently, western medicine finally has come to understand what naturopathic doctors have known all along; sinus infections have more to do with inflammatory issues and the immune system than they do about bacterial infections. In a [New York Times interview](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-sinusitis-ess.html), Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist Dr. Bradley Marple said, \"We may not be dealing with an infectious disease all the time. People have taken a step back and looked at chronic sinusitis as being probably more of an inflammatory disease process.\" This revelation completely transforms how medicine should view both acute and chronic sinus infections. Some of the most common causes of sinus infections include: - Seasonal allergies - Immune system deficiencies - Inflammation While neither of these conditions benefit from the use of antibiotics, they are all successfully treated by [naturopathic doctors](//www.swintegrativemedicine.com/blog/bid/138564/Top-5-Reasons-Patients-Seek-A-Naturopathic-Doctor) and phoenix acupuncture doctors, using holistic medicine, acupuncture, nutritional therapies, and herbal supplements and treatments. How Phoenix Acupuncture Doctors Provide Sinus Pain Relief So how do Traditional Chinese Medicine and [acupuncture doctors provide sinus relief](//www.swintegrativemedicine.com/blog/bid/109596/Acupuncture-for-Sinusitis-Holistic-treatment)? Very simply. Acupuncture works with the body's natural healing processes in order to reduce inflammation, boost immune function, open the sinuses, and stimulate the body's natural pain relievers. Acupuncture needles are used locally in and around the sinuses to increase blood flow, stimulate immune cells, and open the sinus passages. Other points are used peripherally in the body to balance the body's energy, stimulate endorphin release, and increase immune function. All of this is done using the bodies internal energy and can be supported with herbal medicine, vitamins, and other nutrients. These types of treatments have been perfected by naturopathic doctors. How Naturopathic Doctors Provide Sinus Pain Relief Just like your acupuncturist wants to know the details of the sinus pain, your visit to a naturopathic doctor will include a detailed discussion about other seemingly unrelated sources of sinus pain. Your naturopathic doctor will take the time to review your medical history, lifestyle, and diet, among other things. This will help him/her to get an idea of what may be causing your sinusitis. Once your naturopathic doctor has an idea of how and/or why your sinusitis originated, your treatment plan will be created accordingly. Some common treatment options include diet changes, optimizing digestion, herbal and nutrient support to minimize inflammation, and local treatments to the sinuses. Here is a more detailed look at your options. Some of the treatments that can be used by a credentialed naturopathic doctor in Phoenix include: - Acupuncture for sinusitis. [Acupuncture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23420231)has been proven to relieve sinus pain and pressure due to its abilities to reduce inflammation, trigger the release of pain-relieving hormones, and boost the immune system. - Herbal treatments. Your doctor may recommend herbal supplements, teas, and/or herbal extracts in order to relieve sinus irritation and inflammation. Some of these might include quercitin, tumeric, and boswellia. - Dietary changes. As we learn more about inflammation, we have found correlations between diet and chronic inflammation. If you are suffering from a sinus infection, your treatment may include avoiding certain foods which are known to increase inflammation, and also adding food with anti-inflammatory properties to your diet. - Nasosympatico treatment. This is a local treatment of essential oils applied topically to the sinus draining areas. This topical treatment is effective at helping the sinuses drain, assisting the lymphatic system, and releasing sinus pain and pressure. Please Note: Before you seek the treatment from an acupuncturist, always ask for and verify his/her credentials. A [licensed acupuncturist](http://www.azacupunctureboard.us/) must have three to four years of education, culminating in 1500 to 2000 hours of training, before s/he can become certified. In comparison, most chiropractors, MD's and NMD's have only 100-300 hours of training. Only allow those who have been thoroughly trained and certified to use acupuncture to facilitate your health recovery. At Southwest Integrative Medicine our naturoapthic doctors have separate degrees in acupuncture assuring the highest level of care for your treatment.
