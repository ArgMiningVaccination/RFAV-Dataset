Staying on top of your health becomes harder and harder as the colder weather draws in, and the winter months are so often associated with coughs, colds and even the dreaded 'flu. Prepare yourself for the long, frosty months ahead by making sure your aromatherapy kit is well stocked with some immune-system-friendly essential oils. Aromatherapy can be more than just a hobby during winter; it can, when used correctly, be your best friend and your health's saviour thanks to the way it intelligently boosts your immune system. Read on to discover the oils that you simply must have in your collection by the time the first frost approaches. Scots pine essential oil Pine oil is much-adored for its abilities to deal with respiratory conditions and is therefore the central ingredient in many cough and cold remedies. It can help to loosen phlegm and mucus from respiratory tracts and bring relief from that horrible bunged-up feeling of congestion. But instead of waiting until those nasty bugs bring you down, try diffusing or burning some [pine essential oil](https://www.freshskin.co.uk/product/pine-needle-essential-oil/) in the rooms you spend most of your time to boost your immune system and give it the best chances of fighting off common health complaints. Eucalyptus Globulus essential oil The fresh scent of eucalyptus is one most of us connect with being ill, as it's consistently used in off-the-shelf cough and cold remedies. But investing in a bottle of [eucalyptus essential oil](https://www.freshskin.co.uk/product/eucalyptus-essential-oil/) means that you can help to ward these illnesses off, as well as treating them yourself should they take hold, without having to hit the pharmacy. Diffusing or burning some eucalyptus essential oil in your home can help to eliminate airborne bacteria and cleanse your body of toxins. It also stimulates oxygen uptake in our body's cell tissue, increases circulation and can even help to cleanse the blood. Frankincense essential oil When mixed with a carrier oil such as olive, jojoba or coconut, [frankincense essential oil](https://www.freshskin.co.uk/product/frankincense-essential-oil/) can make a deliciously soothing massage oil, to help boost your immune system. Many people swear by soaking in a hot bath with a few drops of pure frankincense added in: inhaling the steam while you soothe your tired muscles can help to improve your immune system and boost your spirits at the same time. A great way to round off a particularly frosty, challenging day. Tea tree essential oil Even with all this aromatherapy assistance, sometimes colds and coughs just can't be avoided. As soon as you start feeling a little run down, try using your diffuser or oil burner to disperse clouds of [tea tree essential oil](https://www.freshskin.co.uk/product/100ml-tea-tree-pure-essential-oil/) through the rooms in which you spend most of your time. This will help to stimulate your immune system and alleviate the symptoms of your illness. Tea tree oil also takes the average foot rub and turns it into an immunity-boosting miracle! Mix a couple of drops with some coconut oil and massage into the soles of your feet - even better, get someone else to do it "}
