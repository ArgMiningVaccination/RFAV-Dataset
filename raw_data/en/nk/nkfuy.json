Health means maintaining one's inner harmony. TCM can be used for various conditions such as pain, sleep disorders, digestive problems and stress. The goal is to restore the balance of body, mind and environment and to activate the body's self-healing powers. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the life energy \"Qi\" is the root of all energy.
