Reactions may start with an itchy, tingly mouth, but later on cause stomach pains, rash, or trouble breathing. For this reason, it is very important not to ignore any reaction you might have after eating a kiwi. The kiwi, also known as Chinese gooseberry, has become very popular in the North American diet and around the world. Kiwi is also becoming one of the most common food allergies worldwide. This article describes different types and triggers of kiwi allergies, symptoms of an allergic reaction, and their treatments. It also discusses kiwi allergy in children and when to seek medical care. Types of Kiwi Allergies There are two types of allergic reactions to kiwis: A true food allergy is the body's immune response to kiwi. It can cause symptoms like abdominal symptoms, rash, and breathing problems. Oral allergy syndrome (OAS), also called pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS), is a condition where the body mistakes certain foods for pollen. It only causes a mild allergic reaction compared to a true allergy. Children are more likely than adults to have severe food allergy symptoms. A food allergy can last a lifetime, but some people outgrow them. Kiwi Nutrition Facts Kiwis are rich in: Vitamin C Vitamin A Vitamin E Potassium Omega-3 fatty acid Fiber Antioxidants Why Eating Kiwi May Improve Your Well-being Kiwi Allergy Symptoms The symptoms of a kiwi allergy depend on the type of reaction you're having to the fruit. Kiwi allergies can cause symptoms that range from very mild to life-threatening. If you have a kiwi allergy, it's likely you'll also react to some other fruits, vegetables, and pollen. Oral Allergy Syndrome If your kiwi sensitivity is classified as oral allergy syndrome (OAS), the symptoms are usually mild and only affect your mouth and throat. Kiwis and Asthma Symptoms Studies show that if you aren't allergic to kiwis, eating them may lessen asthma symptoms such as wheezing and bronchitis. OAS symptoms after eating kiwi include: Itching or tingling in the mouth, lips, tongue, or throatSwelling in the mouth and throatSymptoms that only last for a few minutes Your OAS symptoms might be at their worst when the pollen counts are high. You also may notice an increase in food-related symptoms when other allergens are peaking. Understanding Food Allergies True Kiwi Food Allergy People with a true allergy to kiwi usually have more severe symptoms than people with OAS. For most people, an allergic reaction happens right away\u2014sometimes within minutes, but it can take up to 2 hours. Symptoms of a true kiwi allergy can include: Abdominal pains Trouble breathing/anaphylaxis (more common than in OAS) Eczema (a skin condition that causes raised, itchy patches) Hives Rashes Vomiting Kiwi allergies that start off mild can get worse if you continue to eat the fruit. You might have some mild itching around your mouth when you first try a kiwi but have more severe symptoms if you eat the fruit again. In rare cases, anaphylaxis can occur after eating kiwi. It's a life-threatening reaction that involves an inability to breathe. This reaction is always a medical emergency. Kiwi Allergy Triggers and Cross-Reactions Researchers have found 13 different allergens in kiwi. These are otherwise harmless substances your body can mistake as dangerous, prompting an allergic response. Since kiwis have so many allergens, having a kiwi allergy may mean that you're allergic to other substances, too. This is called cross-reactivity. Foods and other plant parts that cross-react with kiwi nutsLatexMelonPeanutsPoppy seedsPotatoesRagweedSesame seedsWheat Studies have shown that there are more kiwi allergies in people who live in geographic regions with lots of birch pollen. Latex is a natural product that's made using rubber trees and similar plants. It is used in products such as surgical gloves and condoms. Latex and kiwi share at least two allergens, so people allergic to one might have symptoms when they're exposed to the other. Kiwi Allergy in Children Among children who are already diagnosed with allergies to other fruits or vegetables, studies have found that between 9% and 60% are also allergic to kiwi. Kiwi allergies in kids usually have the same symptoms as adults, but children often have a hard time describing how they feel so it can be difficult for caregivers to figure out what's wrong. Kids and adults may not easily connect their symptoms to kiwi. Allergy testing can be valuable when caregivers are having a hard time pinpointing what triggers a child's symptoms. A skin prick test is a common and safe way to test for a kiwi or other food allergy. It can be done on infants as young as one month old. For the test, a provider pricks the top layer of skin with a diluted allergen to see if it triggers an immune response. Treatments for Kiwi Allergy The best way to manage either OAS or a true kiwi allergy is to avoid kiwi and anything that you cross-react to. Kiwi is used in a lot of products, so it's important to check ingredient labels. In restaurants, tell your server about your food allergies as well. Sometimes, cooking or heating food can lessen or destroy the chemicals that trigger OAS symptoms. You may want to microwave a kiwi for a few seconds to see if you can tolerate it better that way. Emergency Treatment Usually, OAS does not need treatment and your symptoms will get better on their own quickly. However, if you have a true kiwi allergy, you may need to carry an epinephrine auto-injector (like an EpiPen) to make sure that you're prepared in case you develop anaphylaxis. This life-threatening allergic reaction is always a medical emergency. If you have any of the symptoms of a severe allergy, call 911 or go to the emergency room. Those symptoms include: Skin changes like hives or itchingA drop in blood pressureSwelling of your tongue, mouth, or throatWheezing or gasping for breathNausea, diarrhea, or vomitingFeeling dizzy or fainting Treating Mild Reactions For mild reactions, antihistamines like Benadryl (diphenhydramine) may help. Providers do not typically recommend taking an antihistamine regularly to prevent symptoms of kiwi allergy, but you can take one if you've eaten a food or been exposed to a trigger to help with symptoms. If you take a daily antihistamine to control seasonal or environmental allergies, it may lessen your food allergy symptoms. Foods That Might Contain Kiwi Reading labels and ingredient lists is the best way to keep from eating kiwi by accident. You may find kiwi in: Tropical or fruit smoothiesFrozen fruit blendsFruit saladsSorbets and fruit-flavored frozen desserts Some meat producers also use kiwi as a tenderizer or as an additive in p\u00e2t\u00e9 products. Some people with kiwi allergies are sensitive to papain, a papaya enzyme used to tenderize meats. When to See a Provider If you have allergy symptoms after eating kiwi, see a provider. An allergy specialist can help you pinpoint exactly what's causing the reaction so you can avoid triggers and prevent more severe reactions. A provider can also make sure you have an EpiPen and know how and when to use it. Summary Kiwi is a popular and nutritious fruit, but it can cause allergic reactions in some people. On the mild end of the spectrum, kiwi can cause OAS with tingling, itching, or swelling of the mouth and throat. On the severe end, a true kiwi allergy can bring on life-threatening symptoms. People allergic to kiwi often react to other fruits, vegetables, and pollen. If you have allergy symptoms after you eat or touch kiwi, see a healthcare provider for allergy testing. You may need to stay away from kiwis and plants that cross-react with them. You may also need medications, including an EpiPen, to treat a serious reaction.
