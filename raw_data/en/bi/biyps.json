It recognizes the University's overarching commitment to educating health care professionals who preserve life and protect patients, and it is the distinguishing identification of Rush University. Its two colors, green and gold, merge the tradition of the past with the custom of the present, as old gold was the single historical color of Rush Medical College and green is used for the modern Medical Center. The motto, \"ministrare per scientiam,\" translated from Latin means to \"minister (care for or serve) through scientific knowledge.\" It was adopted by the Board of Trustees in September 1993 to reflect the commitment to educate caring professionals whose practice is based in knowledge. The shadow in the background is the anchor cross, a symbol of hope and steadfastness, which became the emblem of the merged Presbyterian and St. Luke's hospitals in 1957 and the foundation that created the vision for Rush University. Superimposed on top is the stylized version of the anchor cross that was adopted in 1971 during the merger of Rush Medical College and Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital. The final elements are Chicago, the University's home city, and the date of the University's founding, 1972. The Rush University Board of Overseers adopted the seal in 1999. Rush University commemorates its 50th Anniversary with the new RU50 logo beside the official Rush University Seal. With deep roots in Chicago and a rich tradition of service, the University has continually evolved, raising the standard of education to better serve our community and improve health. We look forward to an exciting new era of growth, building on our legacy of innovation to help the next generation of health care leaders thrive. History of Rush University Medical Center Rush University Medical Center is one of Chicago's oldest health care organizations Its heritage extends back to 1837, when Rush Medical College was established. St. Luke's Hospital, founded in 1864, and Presbyterian Hospital, founded in 1883, merged in 1956 to form Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital. The subsequent incorporation of these pioneer institutions in 1969 created Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, which was renamed Rush University Medical Center in 2003. Rush is an academic health system comprising Rush University Medical Center, Rush University, Rush Copley Medical Center and Rush Oak Park Hospital.

History of Rush University Rush University is the academic component of Rush University Medical Center . Founded in 1972, the University has expanded from one college and fewer than 100 students to four colleges and more than 2,700 students . It includes Rush Medical College, Rush University College of Nursing, the College of Health Sciences and the Graduate College . Rush Medical College is named for Benjamin Rush, a physician from Pennsylvania, and signer of the Declaration of Independence . Rush Medical College was chartered in 1837 and opened officially on Dec . 4, 1843, with 22 students enrolled in a 16-week course . During the first century of operation, more than 10,000 physicians received their train- ing at Rush Medical College . Rush Medical College was affiliated with the University of Chicago from 1898 until 1942, when the medical college temporarily suspended its educational program, though it continued its corporate existence . Its faculty continued undergraduate and graduate teaching of medicine and the biological sciences as members of the faculty of the University of Illinois . The charter of the medical college was reactivated in 1969, when it became part of the Medical Center . Rush Medical College reopened in 1971 with a class of 66 first-year students and 33 third-year students . First- year class size reached its projected maximum of 120 in 1976 . Rush University College of Nursing represents a com- bined heritage dating back to the late 19th century when its first antecedent, the St . Luke's Hospital School of Nursing, opened in 1885 to offer diploma education to nurses . In 1903, the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing accepted its first students . From 1956 to 1968, nurses were taught at the merged Presbyterian-St . Luke's Hospital School of Nursing . Before the establishment of the College of Nursing in 1972, more than 7,000 nurses had graduated from these three schools . The College of Health Sciences, established in 1975, traces its origins to the School of Medical Technology sponsored by Presbyterian-St . Luke's Hospital from 1959 to 1972 . This school was the second largest of its kind in the city of Chicago . During its operation, it provided a one-year profes- sional internship program to more than 200 baccalaureate students in medical technology . Today the College of Health Sciences offers doctoral programs in audiology and health sciences, 10 programs at the master's level, and bachelor's programs in health sciences, imaging sciences and vascular ultrasound technology . The Graduate College was established as a separate aca- demic unit in January 1981, having previously been orga- nized as the Graduate School within the College of Health Sciences . The Graduate College is responsible for educa- tional efforts in the basic sciences and offers three master's degree programs and one doctoral degree program .4 5 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogStudent Characteristics Statistics below are based on fall 2021 enrollment figures .

As essential as academic honesty is to the trust that is fundamental to the educational process, academic dishonesty violates one of the most basic ethical principles of an academic community and will result in sanctions imposed under the University's disciplinary system . Examples of conduct that would subject a student to disciplinary action include but are not limited to the fol- lowing: all forms of academic dishonesty including but not limited to cheating; plagiarism; collusion; gaining or seeking unfair advantage in relation to any work submitted; helping others to gain an unfair advantage; removing examination materials from a secure examination area; the unauthor - ized downloading or copying of examinations that are given online; fabricating assigned academic work, including clinical assessments and presenting them as authentic; facilitat - ing academic dishonesty; and unauthorized examination behavior . Academic Misconduct refers to any academic behavior that is in violation of the policy stated below . Plagiarism refers to any attempt by students to use the work, words or ideas of others without proper attribu- tion, or any attempt to pass off the work, words or ideas of others as their own . Such acts are considered plagia- rism whether they occur intentionally . Acts of plagiarism include but are not limited to the following: - Presenting any phrase or extracts, verbatim, without using quotation marks and without any reference to the author - Paraphrasing all or part of an author's work and presenting it without any, or with inadequate, reference to the author - Copying or paraphrasing all or part of another student's work or otherwise presenting another stu- dent's work as their own Collusion is an agreement or cooperation in order to cheat or deceive for a fraudulent purpose . Collusion applies to students (past, present and future) who inten- tionally cooperate in order to gain an unfair advantage in the gaining of an award, qualification or grade . Cheating is using unauthorized materials, including electronic devices, or obtaining unauthorized help from another person in any work submitted for academic credit . Fabrication is inventing information or citations in an academic or clinical exercise . Facilitating academic dishonesty is providing unau- thorized material or information to another person . Unauthorized examination behavior is, for example, conversing with another person, passing or receiving material to or from another person, temporarily leav - ing an examination site to visit an unauthorized site or without permission or manipulating the physical or elec- tronic testing environment to unfair advantage . These examples are not inclusive of all possible unauthorized examination behaviors . Disciplinary actions will be imposed by the program/ college, including but not limited to warning, probation, suspension or expulsion from the University on those members of the learning community who violate the Academic Honesty Policy . Student Code of Conduct Rush University provides outstanding health sciences education and conducts impactful research in a culture of inclusion, focused on the promotion and preservation of the health and well-being of our diverse communities . All students enrolled at Rush University are expected to uphold the I CARE values of innovation, collaboration, accountability, respect and excellence . The Rush University Student Code of Conduct sets the standards for expected professional behavior within the University and the Medical Center . Commitment to this code is a shared responsibility of all faculty, staff and stu- dents within the Rush University community to ensure the highest standards of behavior \u2014 whether in the classroom, the laboratory or in the clinical setting \u2014 and to ensure that education obtained at Rush provides a sound foun- dation for each student's future success as an academic, scientific or health care professional .

Each college will be expected to set standards for addressing Student Code of Conduct violations and cases of misconduct in a fair and consistent manner that best fits their respective student population . Adherence to the Student Code of Conduct is required upon matriculation . The Student Code of Conduct may also be enforced for off-campus actions when the student is representing themselves as a member of the University . Good Standing: A student who has upheld the guidelines of the Student Code of Conduct and has not been found in violation of the policy resulting in either probation, suspen- sion or expulsion . Student Conduct Sanctions In determining appropriate sanctions when violations of the Student Code of Conduct occur, the college will use the current case as well as any past disciplinary infractions that were upheld . Disciplinary sanctions will be determined by reviewing the statements and interest of the complainant, the respondent and the impact that the infraction may have on the University community . The college will take into consideration the severity of the complaint, the safety of the respondent, University community and any other relevant factors when imposing sanction . The following list of sanctions is not consid- ered an exhaustive list, but a guide to follow when determining the appropriate sanction for the violation . Warning: A written notification that a violation of the Student Code of Conduct occurred and that any further responsible finding of misconduct may result in more severe disciplinary action . A warning is noted for administrative purposes and is not considered a part of the student's disciplinary record . In addition, a warning does not adversely affect a student's standing . Probation: A written notification of reprimand that the mat - ter is serious and in violation of the Student Code of Conduct . Probation is for a designated period of time and may include more severe sanctions, if found responsible for additional violations of the Student Code of Conduct, including suspen- sion or expulsion from the college . Notification of probation is considered a change in good standing status with the college/ University and the student(s) may be restricted from participat - ing in other college or University activities . Loss of Privileges: Denial of the use of certain college facilities or the right to participate in certain activities, events, programs or to exercise certain privileges for a designated period of time .

Expulsion: Expulsion is the permanent separation of the student from the college and their academic program and all educational activities sanctioned by Rush University . Student Complaint Policy Rush University embraces a philosophy of respect and accountability as supported by the I CARE values (innova- tion, collaboration, accountability, respect and excellence) . Rooted in these I CARE values, the Student Complaint Policies and Procedures are meant to balance a supportive and equitable process to assist students with submitting complaints . According to the Higher Learning Commission Institutional Records of Student Complaints (HLC, 2018), \"An institution shall make available an account of the student complaints it has received, its processing of those complaints, and how that processing comports with the institution's policies and procedures on the handling of grievances or complaints.\" To this end, the University strives to provide a seamless complaint process experience by making available to the student body a convenient online complaint submission process and a toll-free hotline phone number through the NAVEX Global Student Complaint Portal* (hereafter \"Student Complaint Portal\") . The Student Complaint Portal and Hotline offers students a confidential as well as an anonymous mechanism to submit their complaints . The University's Student Complaint Policies and Procedures should: 1 . Provide clear instructions on how to submit a formal stu- dent complaint 2 . Distinguish the various types of student complaints, (i . e ., examples of academic versus non-academic complaints) 3 . Provide a list of external agencies to report student complaints *NAVEX Global is a third-party hosted resource with secured servers and is not hosted by Rush University. *NAVEX Global is a third-party hosted resource with secured servers and is not hosted by Rush University. Rush University endeavors to provide an environment where student concerns are addressed and resolved in a man- ner that fosters both respect and equality . The University encourages students to seek informal and formal proce - dures to allow students the flexibility to adjudicate their complaints, depending on the nature or seriousness of the complaint(s) . No retaliation or reprisal shall be tolerated against a student for submitting, in good faith, a complaint either on an informal or formal basis . All student complaint submissions will be kept confidential to the extent possible to provide thorough investigations, maintain campus safety and to ensure compliance with federal, state or local policies . Submission of complaints through the Student Complaint Portal are not meant to override any existing policies or procedures such as grade appeals, student professionalism code of conduct, Title IX, Discrimination and Harassment or any policy established by law or the university . The Student Complaint Portal is designed to work interdependently with existing student policies and procedures . Students are encouraged to file their complaint as soon as possible to ensure that all practi- cal information is collected and available to resolve and improve the student's experience . Student Complaint Portal: Process of filing a complaint 1 . When a student files a complaint through the Student Complaint Portal or through the Student Complaint toll- free call center, the student will receive a unique user - name and are asked to choose a password . Please see link to the Student Complaint Portal . 2 . Students can return to the Student Complaint Portal again either by internet or telephone and access the origi- nal report to add more detail or answer questions posed by a University representative to further help resolve any open issues . 3 . Once a complaint is filed through the Student Complaint Portal, the University will review or refer the complaint to determine the appropriate follow-up . At all times, the complaint will be kept confidential to the extent possible to allow for proper investigation . Only individuals with legitimate reasons will have access to the filed complaint . 4 . If the student complaint is required to be referred to a specific contact person or process (i . e ., Title IX or Grade Appeals), the student will be notified that the complaint has been referred to the appropriate area for further review and the complaint will be facilitated through that specific process . However, the student complaint ticket will remain open until the complaint has been finalized and closed . 5 . If a decision is not rendered after progressing through the appropriate steps, leadership of the specific area will be notified for additional review unless an existing policy dic- tates a different course of action . Students also have the right to file a formal complaint with external accrediting or regulating agencies affiliated with Rush University if they believe that this matter was not resolved in earnest . Links to these accrediting and regulatory agencies are listed in this policy . 6 . A submission of a formal student complaint can be anony - mous or non-anonymous . Anonymous complaints will be investigated to the degree that the institution has enough information to proceed with an investigation . 7 . All non-anonymous complaints should contain the follow- ing information: - The student complainant should include their name, student identification number and contact information, including telephone number and email address, on the form . 8 . All complaints should contain the following information: - The name of the alleged student, employee, faculty, department, etc ., involved in the complaint - A detailed written statement that describes the nature of the complaint, including the date, day, approximate time and location of the occurrence . - The date of submission of the complaint will be docu- mented in the Student Complaint Portal . Informal Resolution Students should begin the informal process by addressing their complaint directly with the staff, faculty or other stu- dents involved with the complaint . (Note: This requirement does not apply to alleged cases of harassment, violence, sexual misconduct, discrimination or situations that are gov - erned by the University Academic Honesty Policy) . Formal Resolution In the event the student is not able to resolve their com- plaint through informal means, the student should file a formal written complaint using the Student Complaint Portal or by reporting their complaint through the Hotline . The University will review all complaints submitted through the Student Complaint Portal . *Academic Complaints (non-exhaustive) Harassment and Discrimination Rush University is committed to the principles of equal opportunity and promoting and maintaining an environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member its community .

Implementation of the Honor Code This Rush University Honor Code (from now on referred to as the \"Code\") sets the standards for expected profes- sional behavior within the University and the Medical Center . Commitment to this Code is a shared responsibility of all faculty, staff and students within the Rush University community to ensure the highest standards of behavior \u2014 whether in the classroom, the laboratory or in the clinical setting \u2014 and to ensure that education obtained at Rush provides a sound foundation for each student's future suc- cess as an academic, scientific or health care professional . Code Enforcement Annually, all students have the opportunity to attest to their commitment of the Code during the completion of annual mandatory trainings within the learning management sys- tem . Any violations of this Code or suspicion of student or academic misconduct should be reported to the student's college for further review in accordance with the procedures specified by that college . Each college will be expected to set standards for addressing Honor Code violations and cases of misconduct in a fair and consistent manner that best fits their respective student population . Students refusing to sign the Code attestation must submit a letter to their dean's office explaining why . Adherence to the Code is required for matriculation, whether or not the document has been signed . The Code may also be enforced for off-campus actions when the student is representing themselves as a member of the University . Inappropriate Degree Usage A student may not indicate they have earned a specific degree or certificate from Rush University until the following have been fulfilled: All degree or certificate requirements have been success- fully completed Completed Degree Approval and Intent to Graduate forms have been submitted to the Office of the Registrar The official date of graduation for a particular term has been reached The degree or certificate has been officially conferred by the Office of the Registrar A student who disregards this policy will be referred to the committee that addresses professional ethics violations for that student's program or college .Continuous Enrollment/Active Student Status In order to maintain an active status, Rush University requires continuous enrollment in the majority of its academic programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation . Exemptions for the sum- mer term only include Health Systems Management majors . Students who are not officially enrolled each term or have not submitted a Petition for Leave of Absence or Voluntary Withdrawal form risk being administratively withdrawn from the University by the Office of the Registrar . A student enrolled in a noncredit residency or academic enrichment program prior to receipt of a degree must be registered for their program's Continuous Enrollment course to retain active student status . Any degree- or certificate-seeking student not enrolling in a new course but needing to replace an outstanding incom- plete grade must register for their program's Continuous Enrollment course until the grade is satisfied . A student who is auditing a course and is not allowed in other courses during the same term must register for their program's Continuous Enrollment course to be charged appropriately . Credit by Proficiency the discretion to offer credit by proficiency (e . g ., standard- ized examinations, such as ACT Proficiency Examination Program (PEP) Challenge or Advanced Placement (AP) exams and/or achieved prior learning (such as continuing education units) . Rush Medical College does not offer credit by proficiency . Credit awarded by proficiency and/or achieved prior learning is based on documented equivalence with courses offered by the program . The minimum standards and format for demonstrating proficiency are determined by program faculty . Formats for demonstrating proficiency may include departmentally developed examinations, licensure/certifica- tion exams, portfolios and competency demonstrations . Credit awarded by proficiency and/or achieved prior learn- ing will equal the credit value of the course(s) as listed in the Rush University Catalog under which the student matriculated . Information that is posted on the transcript for approved credit is the prefix, number and title of the course, the credits awarded and a K grade . Credit awarded by proficiency will appear on the transcript in the appropriate term the credit was earned . Credit for achieved prior learning will appear on the transcript in the student's term of matriculation . Credit earned by these mechanisms will not be used in calculating the student's grade-point average . The student's program reserves the right to assess a fee or partial tuition based on what the student would have been charged . Academic Credit Academic credit is awarded to a student upon the success- ful completion of an approved instructional course or by the demonstration of competencies, proficiencies, or fulfillment of learning outcomes equivalent to that provided by an approved instructional course . One unit of academic credit is the measure of the total time commitment a typical student is expected to devote to learning per week of study . Total time devoted to learning includes but is not limited to: classroom or faculty instruction in either a synchronous or asynchronous mode; time devoted to individual conferences with instructors; reading and completion of learning activi- ties and assignments; posting in online discussion folders; performance demonstrations; examinations; work associ- ated with completion assignments, thesis, or dissertations; laboratory work; clinical practica; or any other activity required of the student . One hour of credit is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that reasonably approximates not less than one hour classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or one tri- mester hour of credit or the equivalent of at least 37 .5 hours of work for one semester or one trimester hour of credit . In this context, an hour of work is defined as 50 minutes . Exceptions: Course credit hours are not calculated for Rush Medical College. Rush Medical College (RMC): Rush Medical College uses weeks of instruction to measure student credit, which can be converted to credit hours using the criteria below . The RMC medical program is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), an accrediting program review body for medical programs in the United States and Canada . LCME requires all accredited medical education programs leading to the Doctor of Medicine (MD) to include a minimum of 130 weeks of instruction . RMC's curriculum requirement of 164 hours of instruction over four years exceed those as outlined in the LCME Standards of Accreditation of Medical Education Programs leading to the MD degree . The conversion for instructional weeks to credit hours is as follows: Courses in the first two years of the Rush Medical College curriculum are a uniform structure for educational experi- ences and contact hours . These contact hours comprise small group learning experiences, laboratories, simulated and real patient encounters . The RMC curriculum is pre - sented in a flipped methodology with a minimum require - ment of two hours of outside-of-class preparation for each hour of classroom instruction . In the preclerkship curriculum, the average contact time for students each week is approximately 14 hours . Based on a 16-week calendar (eight weeks in the summer for M1) and a class time of 50 minutes, the equivalency of one preclerk - ship week is equivalent to one credit hour . Year 1 = 40 full-time weeks (equivalent to 40 credit hours) Year 2 = 32 full-time weeks (equivalent to 32 credit hours) Total = 72 credit hours In year three and four of the clinical experience, contact hours increase for clerkship and electives . Students earn the equivalent of one semester credit hour for each 40-70 contact hours of clinical experiences . Year 3 = 48 full-time weeks (equivalent to 48 credit hours) Year 4 = 48 full-time weeks (equivalent to 44 credit hours) Total = 96 credit hours Grade-Point Average Transfer credits from institutions outside of Rush University are not included in the grade-point average, or GPA, calcula- tion . Transfer credits internal to Rush University are included in the GPA calculation . Separate GPAs are calculated for a student's undergraduate and graduate records . The GPA is calculated using all grades in courses that could count toward the program . The GPA is reset from 0 .00 when a student successfully completes a program and matriculates into a new program at the graduate or professional level . Transcripts show the GPA for each term in which grade points are earned and show a cumulative GPA for all work taken at Rush University for each program degree level . When a course is repeated, only the most recent attempt is computed in the GPA, though all grades will display on the transcript .34 35 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogNo grade points are assigned for work taken on a pass/ no-pass basis, and therefore such work is not computed in the GPA . A GPA is not reported for Rush Medical College students . Undergraduate students who are required to enroll in courses that typically are taught at the graduate level will have these courses count toward their undergraduate programs of study; thus, the credits and grade points will be calculated as part of the undergraduate transcript .Grade Report Students can access their grade report/unofficial transcript via the Rush University Portal . Grade reports are not mailed to students . Copies of a student's grade report are unof- ficial and intended for the student's personal use and should not be accepted by another college/university in lieu of an official transcript . Grading and Numbering System Grade Points Description A 4 .0 Excellent B 3 .0 Good C 2 .0 Satisfactory for undergraduates, but may not be acceptable at the graduate level . D 1 .0Minimal pass for some undergraduate programs but may not be acceptable at graduate level; not used at the graduate level by the College of Nursing, the Graduate College or the Department of Health Systems Management . F 0 Failure P 0 Passing N 0 No Pass HP 0 High Pass (only used by Rush Medical College for third- and fourth-year clinical courses) H 0Honors (only used by Rush Medical College for third-and fourth-year clinical courses; discontinued for first-year basic science courses in 2017 and for second-year basic science courses in 2018) DE 0Deferred designation for medical students who do not yet meet the knowledge and performance components standards after the first attempt . W 0Withdrawal in weeks two through 13 of a term; also used by Rush Medical College when circumstances beyond students' control prevents completion of course requirements regardless of withdrawal date during the term . K 0 Credit earned through proficiency examination or achieved prior learning . T 0 Credit accepted in transfer from another college or university . CIP/IP 0 Course in progress or grade not yet reported . I 0 Incomplete CC 0 Course continues into the next term . Grade received at end of series is grade for entire course . AU 0 Audit XIP 0 Mandatory training course completion is in progress . XX 0 Participation in an ungraded course or residency . XC 0 Satisfactory completion of mandatory training course . XN 0 Administrative enrollment error . Student removed from mandatory training course . XS 0 Student separated from the University prior to completing the mandatory training course .Graduation and Commencement Only Rush University students who are candidates for a degree may participate in the commencement ceremony . Certificate candidates are ineligible to participate in com- mencement . Although Rush University has established a degree conferral date for each term, the University has only one commencement ceremony . Commencement is the offi- cial ceremony honoring the graduates of the academic year . Graduation is the official date on which the student's degree is conferred . All degree seeking students are invited to participate in the commencement ceremony if they graduated in the fall or spring term immediately preceding the current academic year's ceremony . Students who are not required to complete a thesis or dissertation may participate in the current academic year's commencement if they anticipate graduating at the end of the summer term that immediately follows the ceremony . Students completing a thesis must be prepared to defend, per their program director, by week 12 of the spring term in order to participate in the current academic year's cer - emony . Those students who will defend after this period or during the summer term after commencement are invited to participate in the following year's ceremony . Students completing a dissertation must have successfully defended during week 11 of the spring term and submit - ted a final copy of their dissertation to the Rush University Medical Center Library or Rush University Center for Academic Excellence during week 13 of the spring term in order to participate in the current academic year's ceremony . Those students completing their dissertations during the summer term after commencement are invited to participate in the following year's ceremony . PhD students completing a dissertation must provide the title of their work to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadline in order to have that title included in the commencement program . Publication of a student's name, academic credentials and dissertation/thesis title in the commencement program does not indicate that a degree has been officially conferred by Rush University . Students must be registered for the term in which they graduate . All students, including certificate seekers, who anticipate graduating must submit the Intent to Graduate form to the Office of the Registrar, via the Rush University Portal, by the published deadline or risk delayed graduation . College program directors/coordinators are required to complete and submit the degree approval forms to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadline for non-thesis/ dissertation students or risk delayed graduation of stu- dents . College program directors/coordinators are required to initiate the degree approval forms for thesis/dissertation students . Thesis/dissertation students will retrieve remain- ing degree approval form signatures and submit the forms to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadline or risk delayed graduation .

Degree requirements must be fully met before the next term officially begins; otherwise, the student will be required to register for the subsequent term and will graduate at the end of that term . The student's transcript, diploma and other notification of degree conferrals will be held until a student's financial obligation has been met . Outstanding financial obli- gations have no effect on the awarding of degrees . Latin Honors Candidates for the Bachelor of Science degree who have demonstrated academic excellence are honored at com- mencement by the Rush University faculty . Those earning a 3 .40 to 3 .59 cumulative grade-point average at Rush are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree cum laude; 3 .60 to 3 .79, magna cum laude; 3 .80 to 4 . 00, summa cum laude . Only Rush University courses are calculated into the GPA . Latin honors appear on the student's transcript and diploma and are typically announced during graduation exercises, including the commencement ceremony and at college/ departmental convocation/awards ceremonies . Latin honors also appear in the commencement ceremony program . Here, eligibility is as of the end of the fall term; prospective spring and summer graduates have their honors recalculated prior to their respective degree conferral dates . Thesis/Dissertation/Scholarly Project Requirements for Graduation Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates must complete a dissertation . The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program requires completion of a scholarly project . Some Master of Science (MS) programs, including Clinical Research and Integrated Biomedical Sciences, require a thesis to meet degree requirements . The thesis is optional for and Speech-Language Pathology students . Each thesis/dissertation/scholarly project must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university . Each student will have a committee whose role is to ensure that the student's thesis, dissertation or scholarly project is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the University for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation . Review of a thesis/dissertation/scholarly project will follow the sequence of steps as described by each college, includ- ing the prescribed preparation manual for each degree .Students must give a public presentation of the knowledge developed through the thesis, dissertation or scholarly proj- ect process to the academic community . Public presentation must precede the final approval by the student's thesis, dis- sertation, or scholarly project's committee . A copy of the thesis or dissertation must be approved by the Center for Academic Excellence for conformance to pub - lishing requirements and copyright compliance . Scholarly projects are not reviewed by the library . Health and Immunization Requirements All students present on the Rush University Medical Center campus at least once annually from Oct . 1 to Mar . 31 must be compliant with the influenza immunization program as defined by the Rush Infection Prevention and Control Department . Program-specific health and immunization requirements are determined by each college and/or academic program: Students are notified at the time of admission by the col- lege or program of the health and immunization require - ments for matriculation into the University . Students must comply with annual health and immuniza- tion requirements . Students who do not submit the proper proof of fulfilled health and immunization requirements by the designated deadline will be prohibited from registering for the next term and may be disengaged from the program until these requirements are met . Late registration fees may apply . Students should be aware that clinical sites outside of Rush may have additional immunization requirements . Students with medical and/or religious exemptions will be required to adhere to state and hospital policies concerning infection control . Incomplete Grades The grade of incomplete (I) is given only when circum- stances beyond the student's control prevent comple - tion of course requirements and the student has received permission to defer completion of these unmet course requirements . Students must be enrolled during the term in which course requirements are completed . Students enrolling only to complete requirements for a course in which a grade of incomplete was given must register for their program's Continuous Enrollment course . Upon completion of the course requirements, the incomplete grade will be replaced by the final grade earned in the course . A student receiving an incomplete grade in a course may not begin another course for which the incomplete course is a pre - requisite . A student who fails to remove the incomplete grade within the specified time period will receive a final grade of F or N in the course . It is the student's responsibility to pursue the completion of an incomplete grade Students in the College of Nursing, College of Health Sciences, the Graduate College and students-at-large typi- cally must complete the unmet course requirements within one term after the term in which the incomplete grade was assigned, and not to exceed one calendar year, unless an extension is approved . Students in the College of Nursing may not register for new courses if they have two or more incom- plete grades . Rush Medical College students will be informed by the course instructor and the Office of Medical Student Programs regard- ing the specific time frame in which an incomplete grade must be resolved . Additional college-specific policies may apply . Pass/No Pass Grading Option Designated letter grade courses may be taken as pass/no pass based on approval by the course or program director . The pass/no-pass option is college- and course-specific, as is the proportion of courses that can be taken as pass/no pass . The decision to take a course for a pass/no-pass grade cannot be changed after the first Friday of a term . Repeated Courses Some courses, such as research and clinical, may be repeated . These are usually indicated in the course description . All grades and grade points are counted in the GPA for these courses . For all other courses that are repeated, only the most recent grade is counted in the GPA . Both the original course and the repeated course appear on the student's transcript . Rush Medical College offers remediation opportunities for some courses; these attempts are reflected on the student's transcript, along with the original course . Room Reservations The Office of the Registrar is responsible for assigning academic space, including classrooms, collaborative learning spaces, small group/conference rooms, lecture halls, audito - riums, ballrooms, and testing labs, in the Armour Academic Center and Triangle Office Building . Space is limited and first priority is given to course-related activities .To obtain space, the date and times of student events must first be approved by the Office of Student Life and Engagement and be sponsored by the organization's faculty adviser or the Office of Student Life and Engagement . Students-at-Large Individuals who have not formally matriculated to a degree or certificate program, but who wish to enroll in a course, may apply to do so by completing the Student-at-Large applica- tion within the RUApplying Portal . Completing the application does not guarantee admission as a student-at-large . Each college determines which student-at-large applications are accepted or denied . Students applying to take graduate level courses must provide an official transcript from an accredited institution showing that they have earned a baccalaureate degree . Graduates of foreign institutions must have their transcripts evaluated by an approved evaluator of foreign transcripts (e . g ., ECE and WES) and have an equivalent of a baccalaureate degree . Representatives from each college will contact their applicants directly to communicate a decision . The Office of the Registrar will administratively register all SAL applicants approved by their respective colleges . Rush Medical College and clinical courses from all colleges are not available to students-at-large . A final, transcripted grade will be assigned to any course taken as a student-at-large . Prospective students are respon- sible for being academically prepared for requested courses . Current degree- and certificate-seeking students have enroll- ment priority over students-at-large . Students-at-large may be removed from courses if degree- or certificate-seeking students need to enroll in them . Refunds will be issued if pay - ment has already occurred . A student may accumulate no more than 12 credit hours of academic credit as a student-at-large . These hours may be taken within one term or over a period of time . Registration as a student-at-large that results in more than the allowable number of hours in the student-at-large status can only be authorized by the dean or designee of the college offering the course(s) . Credit earned as a student-at-large will not necessarily apply toward a Rush degree or certificate program . If a SAL wishes to be admitted to a degree or certificate program, they must complete the formal application process . Any incomplete (I) grade earned as a student-at-large will revert to a permanent failing grade (F or N) unless completed by the end of the next academic term . It is the student's 38 39 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalogresponsibility to pursue the completion of an incomplete grade . Each college determines the student-at-large application window for their courses being offered in a given term . Late applications will only be accepted if authorized by the dean or designee of the college offering the course(s) . If admitted and enrolled as a student-at-large, payment is due to the Office of Student Financial Affairs via the Rush University Portal by the end of the first week of classes of each term . Rush employees seeking to use internal educational assis- tance benefits (EAB) should apply for tuition assistance by the Human Resources-designated deadline . Students cannot be admitted to a Rush University degree or certificate program if they have a current probationary event as a student-at-large . Students who have already been admitted when a probationary event occurs will have their admission rescinded or be dismissed from the program . In order to be considered for admission, an applicant must be considered in good academic standing . Accounts Transcripts from Previous Institutions As a part of the admission application process, Rush University requires final and official transcripts from all accredited institutions of higher education that a student attended, whether or not a degree was earned . Rush University requires an independent evaluation of foreign credentials and transcripts, such as by ECE and WES, when a student completed coursework or a degree outside of the U .S . or Canada . Non-medical school graduates and attendees from foreign institutions require course-by-course U .S . equivalency reports . Evaluations of other types will not be accepted . Applicants should not submit foreign tran- scripts in lieu of a foreign credential evaluation . International medical school graduates and attendees can provide proof of certification from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) in lieu of a course-by-course evaluation . Individuals who apply using a Centralized Application Service, or CAS, should submit their final and official tran- scripts and/or foreign credential evaluations directly to the CAS . Individuals who are taking prerequisite or other coursework not listed on their CAS application need to submit their final and official transcripts to the Rush University Office of the Registrar . NursingCAS applicants should submit all final transcripts directly to the CAS system .Individuals who applied via CAS and did not have their degree conferred at the time of application must submit their final, official transcript, along with degree conferral information, to the Rush University Office of the Registrar . NursingCAS applicants should submit all final transcripts directly to the CAS system . Non-CAS applicants must submit their official, final docu- ments directly to the Rush University Office of the Registrar . Rush University Transcripts Copies of academic transcripts can be obtained at no cost to students . The transcript is released only with written consent of the student or as consistent with legal require - ments . Transcripts will not be released if the student has an outstanding financial obligation to the University or if the student has not completed their required annual mandatory training .

Paulina St ., Suite 440, Chicago, IL 60612 . Students can also fax requests to (312) 942-2310 . The letter or fax must include the handwritten signature of the student . Copies of transcripts issued to students will be stamped in red ink as \"Issued to Student .\" All transcripts bear the signa- ture of the Rush University Registrar . Unofficial transcripts are not produced by the Office of the Registrar . Transcript requests made by Rush Medical College students to support residency applications should be made to the Office of Medical Student Programs rather than to the Office of the Registrar . A Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) letter is included with these requests . Transfer Credit General Policies Rush University will not accept transfer credit from non- accredited institutions . Only letter-graded courses are eli- gible for evaluation as transfer credit; pass/no-pass courses will not be considered . An official transcript from the college or university where courses were taken must be available in the student's file to verify the course level and grade . Transcripts from foreign institutions must comply with the Transcripts from Previous Institutions policy . Undergraduate level courses cannot be transferred to meet the requirements of a course taught at the graduate level at Rush . Transfer credits can only be applied to satisfy the degree requirements of one program . Once applied, they cannot be used a second time for a new degree program . Previously earned program credits at Rush University may only be used to satisfy the requirements of another program if they are at the same level (e . g ., graduate) and if they meet the current curricular standards . The number of credits granted for a given course cannot exceed the number awarded for the course on the transcript of the school where the course was taken or the number earned for the corresponding course at Rush University . Credits earned on the quarter system will be converted into semester credits where applicable . A quarter credit is equal to two-thirds of a semester credit (e . g ., three quarter-system credits equal two semester credits) . Course information from originating institutions, includ- ing grades, is not recorded on the student's transcript . The Rush University transcript will note the internal course equivalency, the number of credits accepted as transfer and a grade of T . The number of transfer credits is added to the student's cumulative total credits . However, transfer credits are not calculated in a student's grade-point average, GPA, calculation . Continuing education units cannot be transferred in for credit . Undergraduate-Level Policies Rush University may accept up to 90 quarter hours or 60 semester hours of credit toward general education and other lower-level, undergraduate course requirements . General-education transfer credits are noted on student's Rush transcripts as blocks; one-to-one equivalencies are not presented . Undergraduate courses must be completed with a C or bet - ter to be awarded credit . Graduate-Level Policies Graduate-level transfer credit is subject to the approval of the major adviser, program or division director, or designated college administrator based on an evaluation of quality and equivalence . No more than one-third of the total number of required credits may be granted to a graduate-level stu- dent as transfer credit for work done at another graduate institution . Graduate courses must be completed with a B or better to be awarded transfer credit .Enrollment Enrollment Status Definitions Students working toward a degree or certificate and who are enrolled at least half-time may be eligible for student financial assistance . These students may also be eligible to have their federal educational loans deferred . Students are considered full-time or half-time each term based on the below credit criteria . Rush University students must be registered for one of the enrollment statuses below during any academic term to maintain an active student status . Students who are enrolled in externships or clinical work for less than nine credit hours may be considered enrolled full- time for credit hour purposes regardless of the amount of clinical work that is expected per credit hour . Full-Time Status for Select Populations PhD, professional doctorate, and master's students complet - ing dissertations, externships or theses, respectively, may be considered full-time if they meet the following conditions each term: Register for nine or more graduate-level credit hours Or register for a minimum of two credit hours of disserta- tion, externship or thesis coursework Students may register for additional courses as needed or as required by their programs . However, if registering for less than nine credit hours, the term's enrollment must include a minimum of two credit hours in dissertation, externship or thesis coursework to be considered full-time . Individual graduate programs may set guidelines on research enrollments, including which academic milestones should be passed before enrollment in dissertation or thesis hours are permitted . Once students successfully defend their dissertation or thesis, no further research enrollments are necessary .

Auditing of clinical courses is prohibited . Auditing of courses with a laboratory component may be permitted with program director approval .An auditing student: May participate in class discussion only at the invitation of the course director Is prohibited from taking examinations Is expected to attend class An audited course will appear on the student's transcript with the designation of AU upon successful completion; credit hours are not assigned . If the student does not attend the class, a grade of W will be assigned . Rush Medical College (RMC) does not allow students to audit RMC courses except with the permission of Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) . Course Schedule The course schedule is available on the Rush University Portal typically one week before the registration period begins . The Office of the Registrar will generally send an email announcement to students' Rush University email accounts regarding availability of the course schedule; new students will also receive this notification to their personal email accounts . Registration dates and deadlines are pub - lished in the academic calendar . Changes to the course schedule, including updates to meet - ing times, instructors, classrooms and added/closed/can- celed courses will be updated on the Rush University Portal . Independent Study To register for an independent study course, the student's program coordinator, adviser or program director will approve the proposed course and its objectives . The request to create the independent study course should be sent to University Scheduling and include the instructor/course director, course title, course description, number of credit hours and grading system . Once the course is created, the Office of the Registrar will contact the student's college to inform of the status of the course and the student's registration status . Nursing students complete an independent study contract form, which is available on the Office of the Registrar's webpage . The form is used to identify the objectives of the study and a plan to meet those objectives is described . This form should be completed and approved by the preceptor, department chair and the program director no later than the first day of the term in which the independent study is to be taken . The student's preceptor keeps the contract .Health Systems Management students also complete a separate independent study form, which is available in the Department of Health Systems Management . Registration Process Classes are filled according to the following priority order: 1 . Continuing students 2 . New students 3 . Students-at-large It is the responsibility of new and continuing students in programs not participating in batch registration to regis- ter using the Rush University Portal each term during the designated registration period . Late fees may be applied to students who register or who are batch registered during the late registration period . To register for any given term, no student can have a reg- istration hold (i . e ., missing transcripts, missing/out-of-date immunizations, insurance waivers, financial holds) . If the hold is removed before the end of the registration period, the student can register without penalty . If the hold is not removed by the end of the registration period, the student will need to complete an add/drop form with the Office of the Registrar as soon as the hold is resolved; a late registra- tion fee may be assessed . Registration is complete only when tuition and other charges for the term are paid or satisfactory arrangements for payment are made . Tuition is always due on the first day of the term . Students who register for a class and subsequently decide to withdraw without completing an add/drop, leave of absence or voluntary withdrawal form will receive a failing grade (F or N) for that course . Batch/Administrative Registration Some programs participate in batch, or administrative, regis- tration . Students in these programs do not register them- selves for classes in the Rush University Portal or utilize the add/drop form to make registration changes . Students should consult the portal to confirm the accuracy of their registrations . Withdrawal and Leave of Absence Administrative Withdrawal Administrative withdrawal refers to a student's permanent, University-initiated departure from the University without the expectation of the student's return .Rush University requires continuous enrollment in most of its programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation . Students are required to either be registered each term or on an approved leave of absence . If the student has decided to withdraw from Rush, voluntary withdrawal paperwork must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the voluntary withdrawal will become official . A student who is not registered, on an approved leave of absence or who has not submitted paperwork to volun- tarily withdraw will be administratively withdrawn from the University at the end of the term in which the student stopped attending . The administrative withdrawal is posted to the student's transcript . Students wishing to return to Rush in the future need to apply for readmission . Voluntary Withdrawal Voluntary withdrawal refers to a student-initiated, perma- nent departure from the University without expectation of the student's return . After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not arbitrarily cease registration . All students are required to maintain continuous enrollment or risk administrative with- drawal due to unexplained nonregistration . Any student withdrawing from the University must give formal notification by completing a petition for withdrawal or leave of absence form, which requires the student to obtain specific signatures . The Office of the Registrar is the designated office that a student must notify if withdraw- ing from the University . The petition for withdrawal or leave of absence form may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar or online . The date when the student begins the withdrawal process is the official date used in processing the form . Withdrawal forms submitted during the current term for the next term or during a break period will use the day after the end of the current term as the official withdrawal date that will be used for processing the form . A student may not withdraw from classes during the last three weeks of any term . A student who submits a voluntary withdrawal form during the last three weeks of the term will receive grades in the registered courses . Official withdrawal from the University entitles a student to a tuition refund from the first through the fifth weeks of the term . No other fees are refundable . The lower refund per - centage is valid beginning the next Monday at midnight .42 43 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogLeave of Absence After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not arbitrarily cease registration without notice . All students are required to maintain continuous enrollment or risk admin- istrative withdrawal after one unregistered term . A leave of absence, or LOA, is approved and granted for the term for which the LOA is desired or as otherwise approved by the college . It is the student's responsibility to communicate directly with their college regarding the disposition of the request for the LOA . Students who request a LOA may be displaced into a subsequent cohort, required to take a revised program of study upon return to the University or be delayed in their progression through the program based on availability of courses or clinical placements, or both . Students may be eligible for an LOA only after they have completed and submitting to the Office of the Registrar the petition for leave of absence required by each college . Failure to complete and submit the petition for leave of absence form will make the student ineligible for any refunds and obligated for the full term's insurance charges . The date that the student begins the process of applying for an LOA is the official date that will be used in processing the form . The day after the end of the current term will be the official date used in processing an LOA form submitted during the current term for the next term or during a break period . For all approved LOAs, the last date of actual class atten- dance will be the date of record for calculating financial aid disbursements and returns . A student who initiates a petition for leave of absence form after the first week of the term will receive a withdrawal grade on the transcript for any coursework . No classes may be withdrawn during the last three weeks of any term . A student who initiates a petition for leave of absence form on or after the Monday beginning the last three weeks of the term will receive grades in the registered courses and will be subject to an academic progression review based on the assigned grades . Each degree has a time limit for completion that includes LOA time . The decision to include the LOA in calculating the time limits for completion of the degree is within the discretion of each college . The maximum time that will be approved for a single LOA is 12 consecutive months . Each college may have a maximum length of accumulated LOA .Returning From a Leave of Absence Students are responsible for registering themselves for the term in which return from an approved LOA . This registra- tion must occur during the designated priority registration period . Registration outside of this period will result in a late registration fee . Students are responsible to consult with their adviser or program director regarding required courses for the term of re-entry . Rush Medical College students should consult with the appropriate assistant dean to determine required courses . Students must satisfy the conditions of the LOA before re-entering and must comply with all policies, requirements and course sequences in effect at the time of re-entry . A request to extend an LOA requires a new clearance form submission . A request to extend an LOA requires only the signatures of the student's program director, adviser or desig- nated administrator of the college . The completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the first Friday of the term for which the extension is requested . Students who cannot return and who do not have an LOA extension approved must withdraw from the institution . Students who don't return from their LOA on the originally approved date risk administrative withdrawal . Student Records Name, Address and Phone Number Changes Rush University requires that student academic records exist under the student's legal name . The Office of the Registrar maintains the current official listing of student names and addresses for Rush University . It is each student's responsibility to keep the Office of the Registrar informed of changes . Name changes require, at the time of the request, official documentation verifying the new name . Examples of official documentation verifying a new name include the follow- ing: Social Security Card, government-issued ID (passport, driver's license or state-issued photo ID) or court order . Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA Rush University takes seriously its commitment to protect the privacy of its students and their education records . In addition to upholding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, Rush University has taken further steps to protect privacy by extending similar ben- efits afforded to enrolled students under FERPA to individu- als who are applying for admission . If a specific privacy or confidentiality question is not answered in this text, please contact the Office of the Registrar . Nothing in this policy may be construed to prohibit the University from disclosing information provided to the institu- tion under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act concerning sex offenders who are required to register . Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of students' educational records . Educational records are those that contain information or documentation directly related to a student that is recorded in any way, including records produced by handwriting, computer, email, audio, video, etc . Educational records contain information directly related to a student and are maintained by Rush University or any party acting on its behalf . FERPA protects the privacy of students' educational records by setting strict instructions and limitations governing the release of information about students . Though FERPA contains exceptions for the release of directory information without a student's prior written consent, students have the right to request that even directory information be withheld from disclosure to third parties . Given the restrictions of FERPA, faculty and staff should assume all students must provide written consent that fol- lows the format specified in FERPA before any educational records may be released to anyone other than the student . Without written consent, information cannot be released to any third party, including students' parents, relatives and friends . Particularly sensitive information includes students' Social Security numbers, race or ethnicity, gender, national- ity, academic performance, disciplinary records, financial aid information and grades . Privacy During the Admissions Process Rush University has chosen to take additional steps to protect a person's privacy by extending to individuals who are apply - ing for admission similar benefits afforded to enrolled stu- dents . This privacy protection covers all applicants and their application materials throughout the admissions process . The application process exists between the applicant and a Rush University admissions office; therefore, any communica- tion about candidates and their application status to parties beyond these entities is not acceptable unless school officials have a legitimate educational interest to know this informa- tion in order to fulfill their professional responsibilities . All those involved in the admissions process (e . g ., admissions committee members, interviewers, admissions staff) must adhere to these guidelines .Directory Information Rush University may establish categories of information known as directory information and release this informa- tion without student consent, upon request . Rush University designates the following personally identifiable information contained in a student's educational record as directory information: Student's full name Address (local and permanent) Telephone number (local and permanent) Rush pager number (relevant to third- and fourth-year Rush Medical College students only) Rush email address Major and minor field(s) of study, including the college, division, department and/or program in which the student is enrolled Student's classification (e . g ., junior, senior) or by number referring to such Dates of attendance and graduation, and degrees received Date and place of birth Photograph or other electronic images* Honors and awards received Previous colleges/universities attended Degrees earned at previous colleges/universities Rush Medical College postgraduate appointment (program, institution and state) Students may restrict the release of their directory informa- tion by completing and submitting the directory information restrictions form available on the Office of the Registrar's webpage . The decision to restrict directory information will apply to all requests from third parties (other than those who already have legal access to these data elements), including prospec- tive employers . A student must formally rescind a restriction of directory information by submitting a subsequent directory information restrictions form . * Rush University records both visually and audibly many campus events and daily activities, such as classes, com- mencement, convocations, student events and other public occasions. These images, as well as other informa- tion about students, are published (e.g., print media; Rush website) regularly as part of the University's coverage of campus life and portrayal of the University to a variety of 44 45 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalogaudiences. The University's policy is to restrict the use of any photograph/electronic image to the representation, marketing or promotion of Rush activities only. Annual Notification of Student Rights Under FERPA Rush University notifies students annually of their rights under FERPA with respect to their educational records . These rights include the following: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's educa- tional records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. If an educational record contains information about other students as well, the requesting student may inspect and review only their specific information. Students should submit written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect to the University regis- trar, dean, head of the academic department or another appropriate official . The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place for record inspection . If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed . The University may deny a request for copies of edu- cational records when the requestor refuses to furnish proper identification and/or information required by the University . 2. The right to request amendment to an educational record the student believes is inaccurate. Students may ask the University to amend a record they believe is inaccurate . They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, specify why it is inaccurate and provide the accurate information . If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of their right to a hearing regarding the amendment request . Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing . 3.

Students returning to campus, engaging in learning experiences and participat - ing in Clinical Programs (referred to herein as \"Students\") knowingly and voluntarily subject themselves to certain risks related to healthcare education . In light of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, Rush and its Clinical Partners are taking certain new precautions and ensuring that all Students are aware of the potential risks inherent to returning to campus, attending classes or other learning experiences, and participation in Clinical Programs . Students voluntarily and willingly assume certain risks in returning to campus, attending classes, and participating in and completing Clinical Programs, which are completed for their own benefit . COVID-19 is a highly infectious, life-threatening disease declared by the World Health Organization to be a global pandemic . Aware of the foregoing, I am voluntarily returning to the campus of Rush and/or Clinical Partners . There is a potential risk inherent in returning to campus, attending classes or other learning experiences, and/or par - ticipating in Clinical Programs . Students may be exposed to and/or care for patients who are ill with infectious diseases, and as a result may be at heightened risk for contract - ing infectious diseases, including COVID-19 . Students may also be exposed to infectious disease, including COVID-19, through exposure from other members of the Rush commu- nity, including students, faculty, staff and patients . Students will be required to comply with any and all safety precau- tions and guidelines set forth by Rush, including the Rush University COVID-19 Vaccination Policy, and for Students who are participating in Clinical Programs (referred to herein as \"Student Participants\"), additional safety precautions and guidelines set forth by Rush and/or the Clinical Partner at which the Student is completing a Clinical Program . Such precautions and guidelines may be updated at any time . In particular, Student Participants who are working with or around patients who have or may have COVID-19 (e . g ., Student Participants who work in a \"COVID-19 wing\"), or who have been otherwise directed to do so by Rush or a Clinical Partner, are required to wear personal protective equipment 46 47 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalog(\"PPE\") . Student Participants are solely responsible for notifying the Clinical Partner and Rush (through the relevant Program Director or supervising faculty member) if PPE has not been provided . Student Participants are solely respon- sible for using PPE correctly, and for following any other requirements set forth by Rush and/or Clinical Partners . Student Participants are also required to comply with any best practices related to the provision of health care gener - ally (e . g ., hand-washing, mask wearing, and social distanc- ing), and related to the transmission of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, specifically, and are solely responsible for asking Rush and/or Clinical Partners for any further guidance necessary related to such best practices . PPE and other precautions cannot fully eliminate the risk of transmis- sion of infectious disease . Student Participants are required to report to Rush and the Clinical Partner, if relevant, known or suspected exposure to COVID-19, and to report any symptoms of COVID-19 (e . g ., acute respiratory illness; signs of a fever) . All Students are ultimately responsible for their own health . Rush stands ready to assist any Student, as requested, in complying with these requirements . All Students must acknowledge these responsibilities and the inherent risks of returning to campus, engaging in learn- ing experiences and attending class, and participating in Clinical Programs prior to resuming such participation . IN CONSIDERATION of being given the opportunity to return to campus, engage in and attend class or other learning experiences, and/or complete Clinical Programs at Rush University and its Clinical Partners, I understand and acknowledge the following: 1) There is potential risk inherent in returning to campus, attending classes or other learning experiences, and/or participating in Clinical Programs . I understand and acknowl- edge that I may be around and/or care for individuals that are ill and therefore may be exposed to diseases known or unknown, including but not limited to COVID-19 . I am willing to assume that risk . 2) My return to campus and/or participation in the Clinical Program is to benefit my knowledge, experience and improve my abilities and therefore purely voluntary on my part . 3) I acknowledge that Rush University has published a COVID-19 Vaccination Policy (the \"Vaccination Policy\") requiring all students returning to campus to be fully vac- cinated against COVID-19 unless they have an authorized exemption . I assume responsibility for complying with the requirements of the Vaccination Policy . 4) I assume responsibility for complying with any safety guidelines set forth by Rush University (and the Colleges within), Rush University Medical Center, and/or a Clinical Partner, including as related to the use of personal protec- tive equipment (\"PPE\") . I acknowledge that the use of PPE and other safety precautions, such as hand-washing, does not fully eliminate any risk inherent to returning to campus, attending classes or other learning experiences, and partici- pation in the Clinical Program . I acknowledge that I should not return to campus if I cannot comply with the safety guidelines set forth by Rush related to presence on campus and attendance in class, academic events, or other learning opportunities . I acknowledge that if I am participating in a Clinical Program, I am responsible for informing both Rush University (through the relevant Program Director or super - vising faculty member) and the Clinical Partner at which I am completing a Clinical Program if I lack the necessary PPE or cannot for any reason comply with safety precautions . I voluntarily assume this responsibility and the related risk . 5) If I experience symptoms associated with COVID-19, I understand that I should not come to campus, attend any classes or other academic events, or attend my Clinical Program until the symptoms dissipate and I am tested nega- tive for COVID-19 three to five days after symptom onset . The only exception to coming to campus is to seek medical care on the Rush campus . I understand that in the event I am injured or ill in relation to exposure to illness on campus, I am responsible for notifying the relevant Program Director or supervising faculty member at Rush University . I understand that in the event I am injured or ill in relation to the activities I engaged in during the Clinical Program, I am responsible for notifying the relevant Program Director or supervising faculty member at Rush University . I further understand that I will be responsible for the costs associated with any such exposure, illness, or injury, to include any follow up care that might be needed . I voluntarily assume this responsibility . 6) I understand that Rush is planning a flexible model of instruction and may provide fully online and/or remote instruction if necessary . Under this flexible model, Rush cur - rently intends that instruction will be a hybrid of in-person and online modalities; however, the model is designed to pivot to a fully online/remote modality if necessary to help ensure health and safety of the Rush community, in line with recommendations from public health entities .I understand that compliance with the expectations set forth in this document is an educational responsibility with which I, as a student at Rush, and a professional responsibility with which I, as a future licensed healthcare worker, agree to abide . I am freely and voluntarily entering into this assump - tion of risk . Drug and Alcohol-Free Campus Rush University and Rush University Medical Center (here - inafter, collectively referred to as Rush) comply with all state and federal regulations concerning drugs and alcohol . Violations of the Drug and Alcohol-Free Campus policy include but are not limited to the following: unauthorized use, possession or sale of drugs, alcohol or other controlled substances on Rush premises, including the smoking or vap - ing of cannabis . For additional information, please see Rush's Drug and Alcohol-Free Campus Policy HR-A 8 .00 . Tobacco-Free Campus Rush seeks to promote the health, safety and quality of life of all members of the Rush community . To that end, Rush is a smoke and tobacco-free campus . For additional informa- tion, please see Rush's Tobacco Free Work Environment Policy . Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Inclusion For over three decades, the Rush approach to equal opportunity, diversity and inclusion has not wavered . Our approach is that these are essential components of the best employment, educational and health care practices and must be furthered . This is a continuation of a policy that emanated from the hospital charters of 1865 and 1883 and the documents governing the establishment of Rush University in 1972 . In certain instances, the implementation of this policy and our goals in this area require the use of affirmative initia- tives . At Rush, these initiatives are focused on strong recruitment, development and retention efforts \u2014 not on quotas \u2014 and these recruitment and programming efforts will be continued, consistent with federal, state and munici- pal guidelines . Rush is committed to attracting students who will enable the student body to achieve the educational benefits of diver - sity and to providing services to all students, faculty and employees on a nondiscriminatory, equitable basis . Discrimination or harassment against any member of the Rush community because of race, color, religion, national origin, creed, age, ancestry or disability as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, gender, gender identity and/ or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, sexual orientation, veteran status or any other category or categories protected by federal or state law or local ordinance that excludes an individual from participa- tion, denies the individual the benefits of, treats the indi- vidual differently or otherwise adversely affects a term or condition of an individual's employment, education, living environment or participation in a Rush program or activity . This includes failing to provide reasonable accommoda- tion consistent with state and federal law to persons with disabilities .

Rush strives to have an environment that is free from unlaw- ful sexual harassment . Rush complies with Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulations, which prohibit sexual harassment that occurs within its education programs or activities . sexual harass- ment includes quid pro quo sexual harassment, hostile environment sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking . Rush has a legal duty to prevent and redress sexual harass- ment that occurs within its education programs or activities, as well as a moral and ethical duty to do so . Indeed, such conduct is contrary to Rush's values, represents profession- ally and socially irresponsible behavior; and can damage the trust, influence and reputation of Rush and the medi- cal profession . Moreover, because Rush's primary mission of furthering the public good relies on maintaining public 48 49 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalogtrust and confidence, it is essential that every member of the Rush community share in the responsibility for meeting our community's conduct expectations . It is equally impor - tant that members of our community appreciate the impact sexual harassment that occurs within Rush's education programs or activities can have on our environment, and the potential for severe consequences for such behavior . Policy Statement Members of the Rush Community who commit sexual harassment are subject to the full range of discipline including verbal reprimand, written reprimand, mandatory training or counseling, mandatory monitoring, partial or full probation, partial or full suspension, permanent separation from the institution (i . e ., termination or dismissal), physical restriction from Rush property, cancellation of contracts and any combination of the same . Rush will provide persons who have experienced sexual harassment ongoing remedies as reasonably necessary to restore or preserve access to the Rush's education programs or activities .

Rush values the fair, prompt and equi- table inquiry into allegations that arise under this Policy . sexual harassment will not be tolerated . It is central to the values of Rush that any member of the community who believes that they have witnessed or been the target of sexual harassment feel free to report their con- cerns for an appropriate response and investigation, without fear of retaliation or retribution . Rush will respond to reports, formal complaints, or information about incidents of sexual harassment by stopping the prohibited conduct, taking steps to prevent the recurrence of prohibited conduct and addressing its effects on campus or in any Rush programs and activities regardless of location . Rush expects that all reports made under this Policy will be brought in good faith .All reports and concerns about conduct that may violate this Policy (including retaliation for reports made pursuant this Policy) should be filed with Rush's Title IX Coordinator or the Office of Institutional Equity at Institutional_Equity@Rush . edu . Confidential reports can also be made through the Rush Hotline at (877) 787-4009 or via the Rush web reporting tool at rush . ethicspoint .com . Anonymous reporters do not need to identify themselves, but they are asked to provide enough information to enable an investigation . Upon receipt of a complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will evaluate the informa- tion received and determine what further actions should be taken .

In order to avoid a late-fee charge, students must make arrangements for payments of that portion of tuition and fees not covered with pend- ing aid by completing Steps 1 or 2 above . Failure to follow one of the steps above will result in a $100 late fee . A $50 late payment fee will be assessed for each missed payment to students who choose the deferred pay - ment plan contract and fail to make a payment on the speci- fied due dates . At the end of the academic term, students who still have outstanding Rush University balances that are not covered by pending financial aid will: Receive a hold on their student account Not receive transcripts/diplomas Not be allowed to register for the following term Student Health Insurance Rush University requires students to be covered by a health insurance plan in order to promote health and well-being while protecting the individual from undue financial hardship that a medical emergency could cause . Non-Rush Medical College students may opt out of the student health insur - ance by providing proof of existing coverage during their first term of enrollment (during the health insurance open enroll- ment and waiver period) and then every fall term thereafter . Students are required to take action during the Fall Open Enrollment and Waiver Period . All communication from the Office of Financial Affairs regarding student health insur - ance open enrollment and waiver periods are sent to Rush email addresses . Students are expected to check their Rush email account regularly and take action during those peri- ods regarding submitting waivers or enrolling in the student health insurance . Students who do not submit proof of alternate coverage will automatically be enrolled in the student health insurance plan and charged the premiums for the term . All students enrolled in degree programs are eligible for the student health insur - ance plan offered by Academic Health Plans and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois .For the 2022-2023 school year, the cost of the student health insurance plan is approximately $5,650 per academic year for single coverage . The total annual coverage amount is allocated and billed onto the student's account on a per- term basis . Coverage is also available for dependents at the rate of $5,650 annually per dependent . The total annual coverage amount for dependents is also allocated and billed onto the student's account on a per-term basis . This plan allows students to choose a primary care physician from a large list of members of the preferred provider organization, or PPO plan in the greater Chicago area . When using an in- network provider, there is an annual deductible of $500 and coverage of 80 percent for most patient services, including hospitalization and surgery, as well as outpatient services such as office visits, laboratory and X-ray . Preventative care services are covered at 100 percent . When using a pharmacy in the Prime Therapeutics network, there is a $20 co-pay for each generic prescription, a $50 copay for each brand- name prescription and an $80 copay for each non-preferred brand-name prescription . Student Plan Rates for the 2021-2022 Academic YearAdditionally, all Rush Medical College students are covered under a blood and bodily fluids exposure rider . This works as a supplemental policy to any health insurance and covers treatment or medications necessary as the result of a needle stick, splash or potentially contagious disease exposure . Together with the basic Rush University Health Insurance policy, the rider will completely cover prophylactic medica- tions or injections . Rush Medical College students will be assessed a fee for vaccinations, immunizations and documentation . This fee covers any necessary blood tests, vaccinations or updates, as well as costs associated with maintaining the documen- tation of students' compliance and communicating that information to the Rush System hospitals and any non-Rush locations that may request certification of immunization and vaccination status . Tuition Refund Policy The Student Refund Policy provides students an opportunity to formally withdraw prior to the start date of an academic term without being responsible for tuition . Students decid- ing to withdraw after the official start date of the term will be refunded according to the tuition schedule in the University Student Refund policy located in the Academic and University Policies section in this catalog . Students are responsible for any tuition or fee balances due until they are formally notified by Rush University in writing of their withdrawal status .

Office of Student Financial Aid Financial Aid Process Instructions for accessing financial aid information on the Rush University website are emailed to all newly accepted students prior to enrollment . The Student Financial Aid web - page contains in-depth information on policies, procedures and financial aid awarding methodology . Students starting in a term other than fall should submit financial aid application materials at least two months prior to their start date to allow sufficient time to receive their aid package . Students must be enrolled at least half-time 4 . 5 credit hours for graduate/professional students and 6 credit hours for undergraduate students and must be in a degree or approved certificate program to receive financial aid . To receive assistance, all appropriate forms and materials must be on file .Students should expect to receive the majority of assis- tance in the form of loans . Because of limited institutional funding, financial aid packages will likely contain loans that accrue interest while the student is in school . For Rush Medical College students and College of Nursing students in the Generalist Entry Master's program, need-based grant and scholarship assistance is available through the Office of Student Financial Aid; funds are limited, so students are encouraged to submit all required financial aid paperwork early . All Rush Medical College applicants who will be under 30 years old prior to the start of their program must pro - vide parent(s) financial information on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) at studentaid . gov and meet the institutional criteria for eligibility . Visit the Office of Student Financial Aid webpage for more details: www .rushu . rush . edu/office-student-financial-aid . Undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's degree may be eligible to receive grant assistance through federal and state need-based programs . Employment through the Federal Work-Study program may be possible through- out Rush University Medical Center and its affiliates . Federal Work-Study is awarded as part of the financial aid package . It is the student's responsibility to secure employment . The Office of Student Financial Aid is available to assist students with locating jobs within the University if requested . Financial Aid Determination Financial aid packages at Rush University are provided to assist students to pay for the cost of education . Financial need is the basic criterion for the awarding of funds and the student must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at studentaid . gov each year to deter - mine need and eligibility . Students and family members will be expected to contribute toward educational expenses . The level of the expected contribution is determined by using a standard set of criteria to determine eligibility from informa- tion provided on the FAFSA at studentaid . gov . Submission of Parent Information for consideration of need based institutional grants, scholarships and loans is required for Rush Medical College students and any dependent under - graduate students . Complete information about this policy can be found on the Office of Student Financial Aid webpage . Student financial aid counselors are available to consult and assist students and parents (with the student's authoriza- tion) with questions about financial aid packages and awards and services for a Rush University education . Students and authorized parents are encouraged to make use of these services .Financial Aid Awards After evaluating student and family resources in addition to assistance from outside the University, the Office of Student Financial Aid will award students the federal, state and insti- tutional funds they qualify for each academic year . In order to distribute available funds in the most equitable manner, the Office of Student Financial Aid establishes a formula that designates the sequence in which funds are awarded to stu- dents, as well as the maximum amount awarded under each program . These formulas are applied consistently during any given year among all students at a given class level and in a given college, pending availability of funds . The formulas may be adjusted annually due to differences in the avail- ability of funds from year to year and changes in eligibility requirements . Veterans Benefits Rush University participates in federal veteran's education benefits . Post-9/11 GI Bill\u00ae The Post-9/11 GI Bill\u00ae provides tuition, fees, books/supplies and housing assistance to eligible veterans . Tuition and fees are paid directly to Rush by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) . Tuition and fees assistance is capped at the national maximum of $26,042 .18 per academic year (Aug . 1, 2021 - July 31, 2022) . Benefit rates vary based on the veteran's circumstances . Some veterans may be able to transfer their benefits to a dependent . Yellow Ribbon Program Starting in the 2012-13 academic year, certain colleges at Rush University participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program . Veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate are eligible to apply for additional tuition and fee amounts if their costs exceed the $26,042 .18 cap . The amount of additional assistance available and the number of students able to be supported is limited and varies by college . Funds are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis . Students who have received Yellow Ribbon assistance will have preference for these funds in future academic years . Details are available on the VA's Yellow Ribbon Program information webpage .

More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U .S . govern- ment website at www .benefits . va .gov/gibill . VA Pending Payment Beginning Aug . 1, 2019, Rush University will not take any of the four following actions toward any student using VA Post 9/11 G .I . Bill\u00ae (Ch . 33) or Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Ch . 31) benefits, while their payment from the VA is pending to the educational institution: Prevent their enrollment Assess a late penalty fee to Require they secure alternative or additional funding Deny their access to any resources (access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities) available to other students who have satisfied their tuition and fee bills to the institution .However, to qualify for this provision, such students may be required to produce the following: The VA's certificate of eligibility by the first day of class Written request to be certified Additional information needed to properly certify the enrollment as described in other institutional policies (see our VA school certifying official for all requirements) . Satisfactory Academic Progress The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by Congress, mandates institutions of higher education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory progress for students receiving federal financial aid . These standards apply to all federal Title IV aid programs, including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS Loan and Federal College Work-Study programs . Accordingly, the Department of Education regulations require that Rush University's Office of Student Financial Aid monitor the academic progress of all financial aid recipients toward the completion of their degree . This process is called Satisfactory Academic Progress, or SAP . This SAP policy is enforced in conjunction with all other institutional policies and procedures, including the academic progressions policies of Rush University's colleges and aca- demic programs . For undergraduate and graduate students, the below criteria are checked at the end of each term . For medical students, the below criteria are checked annually at the end of spring term . The Office of Student Financial Aid will factor in rounding up to two digits (66 .67%) when calculating a student's eligibility for meeting the minimum pace of completion requirements . Enforcement The Office of Student Financial Aid has the primary responsibility in enforcing the SAP policy . The Office of the Registrar and other Rush University offices that maintain student information relevant to the SAP policy shall provide such information, as requested by the Office of Student Financial Aid . SAP Requirements SAP requirements vary by academic level (undergraduate, graduate and medical students) . Please refer to the appro - priate section to find the requirements that fit your aca- demic program .UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for undergraduate students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of comple - tion and cumulative grade-point average, or GPA . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150% of the credits it nor - mally takes to complete the program . The total allowable attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush (including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program) by 1 . 5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . For example, for a program that requires 107 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush (including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program), a student may attempt up to 160 hours . Pace of Completion (POC) Students must successfully complete at least 66 .667 percent of the courses they attempt . This will be measured cumula- tively over the course of the student's program . For the pur - pose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable: Successful completion is defined as a grade of A, B or C for a letter grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass/fail or pass/no pass . These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other grades, including incomplete grades, are counted in the attempted hours total but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete grade is later converted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalcu- lated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses prior to the close of the published add/drop period each term will not have those dropped courses counted in the total attempted hours . Dropped courses after the close of the published add/drop period will be counted in the total attempted hours . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . Transfer credits (including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program) that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours . Students who change majors at the same degree level will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade-Point Average Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum cumula- tive GPA of 2 .0 . Students who have a term GPA of less than 1 .0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension . GRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for graduate students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative GPA . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150% of the credits it nor - mally takes to complete their program . The total allowable attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush by 1 . 5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . For example, a student may attempt up to 169 hours for a program that requires 113 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush . Please note: Non-degree certificate programs are approved by the U .S . Department of Education for financial assistance at a specific number of credit hours . Regardless of a stu- dent's actual plan of study, maximum time frame is calcu- lated using the number of hours for which the program was approved with the U .S . Department of Education . Pace of Completion (POC) Students must successfully complete at least 66 .667% of the courses they attempt . This will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program . For the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable: Successful completion is defined as a grade of A or B for a letter grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass/fail or pass/no pass . These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other grades, including incomplete grades, are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete grade is later con- verted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses prior to the close of the published add/drop period each term will not have those 62 63 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalogdropped courses counted in the total attempted hours . Dropped courses after the close of the published add/ drop period will be counted in the total attempted hours . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . Transfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and com- pleted hours . Students who change majors at the same degree level will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade-Point Average Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3 .0 . Students who have a GPA of less than 2 .0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on finan- cial aid suspension . RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS SAP for Rush Medical College students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and grade requirements . SAP is measured at the end of each academic year once final grades are in and at the time of awarding . Maximum Time Frame Measurement The normal time frame for completion of required course - work for the MD degree is four academic years . Due to academic or personal difficulties, a student may require additional time . In such situations, the Rush Medical College Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) may establish a schedule for the student that departs from the norm and may require repeating a year of study . For the purposes of this financial aid policy, no more than three cohort years may be devoted to the first- and second-year curriculum and no more than three cohort years may be devoted to the third- and fourth-year curriculum, for a maxi- mum time frame of six cohort years . Summer enrollment, if required, is considered part of the academic year for the purposes of this measure . Terms under an approved LOA do not count in this measure . Pace of Completion (POC) 1 . First-year students must complete at least 66 .667% of their first-year curriculum with a grade of Pass (P), High Pass (HP), or Honors (H) during the cohort year . This includes repeated courses .2 . Second-year students must complete at least 66 .667% of their second-year curriculum with a grade of Pass (P), High Pass (HP), or Honors (H) during the cohort year . This includes repeated courses . 3 . Third-year students must complete at least 66 .667% of the clerkships they attempt with a grade of Pass (P), High Pass (HP), or Honors (H) during the cohort year . Grade Requirements Rush Medical College academic progress is measured in terms of Honors, High Pass, Pass and Fail grades . A student must complete each required course/clerkship with a grade of Pass or better in order to graduate . A student who fails a course must retake it and earn a grade of at least Pass . A student who receives an Incomplete in a course must com- plete the course and earn at least a Pass . Financial Aid Warning Undergraduate and graduate students are allowed a finan- cial aid warning period . Professional students enrolled at Rush Medical College are not allowed a financial aid warning period . Undergraduate or graduate students who fail to meet the requirements of this satisfactory academic progress policy will be placed on financial aid warning for one term, with the exception of undergraduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 1 . 0 and graduate students who have a first- term GPA of less than 2 .0 . In this case, that student would immediately be placed on financial aid suspension . Students will be allowed to continue on financial assistance during the warning period . Students placed on financial aid warning will receive a notification through their Rush email account . The notification will include SAP requirements, steps necessary to meet SAP in the upcoming term and the consequences for failing to meet SAP requirements by the end of the warn- ing period . Students will be placed on financial aid suspension if they fail to meet the standards of this SAP policy after the one- term financial aid warning period . Suspension of Financial Aid Eligibility Professional students enrolled at Rush Medical College who fail to meet the requirements of this SAP policy will be placed on financial aid suspension . Undergraduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 1 . 0 and graduate students who have a first- term GPA of less than 2 .0 will be placed on financial aid suspension . Students who still fail to meet the requirements of this policy after their single term on financial aid warning will be placed on financial aid suspension . Students who are suspended from financial aid eligibility will be notified through their Rush email account . Appealing Suspension of Financial Aid Eligibility Under extenuating circumstances, a student may appeal the suspension of their financial aid eligibility . Appeals from other parties on behalf of the student will not be accepted . All appeals should be submitted to the Office of Student Financial Aid in writing or by email to Financial_Aid@rush . edu . Each appeal should include the following items: Signed letter from the student indicating the reasons why the standards of this policy were not met and what has changed in the student's situation that will allow satisfac- tory progress during the next evaluation period An academic plan for the remainder of the student's studies Any supporting documentation the student feels would support the appeal (as appropriate) The Office of Student Financial Aid will review the appeal and notify the student of the appeal review results . Students whose appeals are approved will be placed on a financial aid probationary period for one term or for an appropriate dura- tion depending on the academic plan provided . If applicable, the probationary period will be defined to include checkpoints that must be achieved in order for the student to remain eligible for financial assistance . Students failing to abide by the terms of their probationary period will be suspended from financial aid after the one-term proba- tionary period or in the case of a multi-term probationary period upon failure to maintain the minimum requirements of the probationary period requirements . The decision of the Office of Student Financial Aid is final, binding and not subject to further appeal . Reinstatement of Financial Aid Eligibility A student's eligibility for financial aid will be reinstated when the standards of the SAP policy as outlined above have been successfully met .Educational Assistance Benefits (Tuition) As part of our commitment to employee development and education, Rush offers the following: Employee Enhancement Program Reimburses employees up to $1,000 for costs of profes- sional development seminars, conferences, etc .

Vision Rush Medical College will be the global leader in student- centered, future-oriented medical education . Diversity and Inclusion Statement Rush Medical College embraces the Rush University Medical Center Diversity Leadership Council vision for diversity and the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) commitment to increasing diversity in medical schools . As a member of the AAMC, we are further guided by the AAMC's Group on Diversity and Inclusion definitions:* *\"Diversity as a core value embodies inclusiveness, mutual respect, and multiple perspectives and serves as a cata- lyst for change resulting in health equity .\" Recognizing the importance of addressing the issues related to those histori- cally underrepresented in medicine and never losing sight of the ultimate goals of providing care to the underserved, promoting health equity and eliminating health disparities, Rush Medical College seeks to recruit, retain and develop a student body and physician workforce that will advance diversity across the entire professional spectrum of medical education . *\"In this context, we are mindful of all aspects of human differences, such as socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, language, nationality, sex, gender identity, sexual orienta- tion, religion, geography, disability and age . Inclusion is a core element for successfully achieving diversity . Inclusion is achieved by nurturing the climate and culture of the institution through professional development, education, policy and practice . The objective is creating a climate that fosters belonging, respect and value for all and encourages engagement and connection throughout the institution and community .\" Rush Medical College, appreciating that diversity and inclusion enhances the medical education environment and ultimately the overall health of our community, strives to create and support an environment where faculty, residents, fellows, staff and medical students combine their differing backgrounds, diverse perspectives and unique skills as they work with peers to solve problems, enhance their ability to work with patients and develop new, effective ways to man- age health, conduct research and deliver quality care . It is our goal to improve the health of the individuals and diverse communities we serve with a critical focus on the benefits of diversity in medicine and biomedical sciences . We believe this is an important factor in meeting our mission \u2014 not only by creating a diverse environment but also by influencing the potential for our students and physicians to succeed in our rapidly changing and diverse society . Utilizing information provided by the Office of Integrated Medical Education and other data, Rush Medical College's Faculty Council is committed to implementing institutional policies, procedures, programs and initiatives designed to meet these stated diversity goals . Program Objectives By graduation, a Rush Medical College student will achieve the RMC Program Objectives, which are key tasks essential to success as a physician . Our curriculum is designed to support these Program Objectives . The program objec- tives are key tasks that students will achieve by the time of graduation . They represent RMC's commitment to our students and are written as task statements deemed critical to becoming a successful physician . The program objectives inform curriculum development, as all session objectives are mapped to a course objective which is mapped to a program objective . The RMC Program Objectives are organized around six roles that a physician plays and the foundational role of medical knowledge that supports them: Advocate Identify and address social, political and cultural factors that affect the health of patients and populations to improve health equity . Communicator Establish strong therapeutic relationships with patients and their families to cooperatively provide care that reflects their needs, values and preferences .68 69 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogLeader Contribute to the improvement of healthcare quality by participating in a culture of safety and coordinating care between the various elements of the healthcare system . Practitioner Collect, interpret and document information to make clini- cal decisions and carry out diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to provide high-quality patient care . Professional Demonstrate a commitment to carrying out professional responsibilities and upholding the legal and ethical prin- ciples that support medical practice . Scholar Use evidence-based principles to continually enhance one's own practice, inform care of your patients and develop the skills to contribute to the scientific knowledge of the field . Medical Knowledge Demonstrate knowledge of established and evolving biomedical, clinical and social-behavioral sciences, and the application of this knowledge to patient care . Professionalism Statement and Standards Overview \"Professionalism is the basis of the medicine's contract with society .\" So begins the Preamble to the American Board of Internal Medicine's Physician Charter, a widely recognized and endorsed document detailing the roles and responsi- bilities of the modern physician in practice towards their patients, profession and society . It has been recognized for decades in American undergraduate medical education that not only does professionalism need to be modeled in the clinical setting, but taught and assessed throughout training, starting from entry to medical school . Developing and refining behaviors consistent with exemplary medical professionalism is an acquired skill, which requires teaching from the time of entry into medical school . The expectations for trainees, whether in the undergradu- ate medical program or graduate medical program, are closely aligned . Furthermore, the expectations of stu- dents should be similar, but level-appropriate, to those for attending physicians with regards to medical professional- ism and ethically sound behavior . This document specifically defines (1) the value of profes- sionalism in the Rush Medical College (RMC) curriculum, (2) professionalism standards for RMC students and (3) meth- ods for reporting concerns about student professionalism . Professionalism in the RMC Curriculum The Professional Role curriculum is designed to introduce students to both the fundamentals of medical professional- ism and medical ethics, as well as provide guidance on both exemplary professional behavior and unprofessional student behavior . The teaching in the four-year curriculum is parallel to the routine professional expectations RMC has of stu- dents in both clinical practice, administrative responsibilities and interpersonal interactions . Professionalism Standards for RMC Students The following expectations are based on medical profes- sionalism guidelines as set forth by the American Board of Internal Medicine Physician Charter . Students are expected to strive to model the highest standards of professionalism as members of the Rush community . Student profession- alism is regularly assessed throughout the curriculum in end-of-course evaluations, including narrative evaluations . Students are expected to demonstrate professionalism in the following ways as outlined in the RMC Expectations for the Learning Environment: Classroom/Clinical Experiences: Being adequately prepared for learning activities in the classroom, laboratory, research and clinical settings Attending and participating in learning activities in an engaged, punctual and reliable manner Completing all course and administrative requirements as defined by the Office of Integrated Medical Education (OIME), course directors and faculty in a timely manner Dressing and conducting themselves appropriately to the activity in which they are participating, in a manner becoming of a member of the Rush community Feedback and Evaluation: Actively and appropriately seeking feedback to improve their own performance, accepting constructive feedback openly and without hostility, accepting responsibility for missteps Reflecting on their performance and educational experi- ences to inform their self-directed learning and study Recognizing personal limitations in knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and seeking help from faculty and peers as appropriate Providing constructive feedback and evaluation about the learning environment and educational experiences Interpersonal Behaviors: Treating faculty, residents, staff and fellow students with respect and collegiality, both in person and via social media and other digital platforms Resolving conflicts in an appropriate and professional manner Patient Care: Treating patients with kindness, compassion and respect, both in person and via social media and other digital platforms Respecting and preserving patient confidentiality as appropriate for patient care through the electronic health record and other digital platforms, and in person Personal Integrity and Academic Honesty: Adhering to the RMC Honor Code, Rush University Honor Code, and the Rush University Medical Center Code of Conduct Adhering to the ethical standards of our profession as described by the American Medical Association Acting as models of honesty and integrity at all times, in all interactions with patients, faculty and colleagues Addressing witnessed errors, rule violations and unpro - fessional behavior in a direct and respectful manner, including the reporting of such behaviors to the appro - priate authority Refraining from use of illicit substances, in accordance with the law Avoiding use of legal or prescribed substances to the point of impairment or dependency Methods for Reporting Professionalism Concerns Various RMC personnel and committees work closely together in the evaluation and remediation of student professionalism concerns . Professionalism concerns can be reported through the following mechanisms: RMC Honor Code Council: The Honor Code Council is a group of peer-elected medical students who review reports of potential Honor Code violations and recom- mend action as appropriate . As per the Honor Code Council Policies and Procedures, reports cannot be anon- ymous; they must contain the name of both the reporter and the student named in the violation . If an Honor Code violation is found to have occurred, or if the Council is unable to reach a conclusion, the report is passed directly to the Committee on Student Evaluation & Promotion (COSEP) for further evaluation and the final decision on action . Special Committee on the RMC Environment (SCORE): SCORE is another student-run organization which evaluates a wide range of reports regarding the learning environment . SCORE reporting can be anonymous, as per the SCORE Policies and Procedures, although submitters are encouraged to identify themselves to the committee . Occasionally, students submit reports of unprofessional behavior of other students to SCORE . If SCORE deems appropriate, these reports may be passed on to OIME for further evaluation, and subsequently reported to COSEP . RMC Early Concern Note (ECN): Any faculty member may submit an Early Concern Note if they observe or learn of a minor professionalism lapse . ECNs are reported to the OIME and are reviewed by either the assistant dean of preclerkship or the assistant dean of clerkship cur - riculum . The relevant dean will discuss the issue with the student . If the professionalism lapse is significant or is considered to be a part of a pattern of behavior, it may be referred to COSEP for evaluation, as deemed appropriate by the relevant dean . Student Evaluations: Student professionalism is routinely assessed via clerkship director evaluations, narrative evaluations and student performance evaluations . If there are reports of unprofessional behavior on any of these evaluations, these reports will be evaluated and addressed in the same manner as ECNs . Rush University Student Complaint Portal: Any Rush University student can report complaints through the Rush University Student Complaint Portal . Rush University will review or refer the complaints submit - ted through this portal to determine the appropriate follow-up .70 71 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalog In addition to the above methods, faculty, staff and stu- dents are encouraged to report any concerns regarding professionalism to the relevant course/clerkship director or any OIME dean . Major lapses in professionalism should be immediately reported to any OIME dean . Conclusion This document stands as a comprehensive overview of the role of professionalism in the Rush Medical College cur - riculum and in student assessment and promotions . This document will be reviewed and updated periodically by the professional role leader of the Rush Medical College .

Kennedy, PhD, RN, FAAN John L . and Helen Kellogg Dean, College of Nursing Associate Chief Nursing Officer, Rush University Medical Center College of Nursing Description Rush University College of Nursing is a private, not-for- profit graduate college of nursing . It is currently comprised of three degree programs \u2014 Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing Science (PhD) \u2014 as well as a post - graduate certificate program . The College of Nursing faculty thoroughly prepare students to advance the quality of patient care and nursing practice in a multitude of health care environments and to be leaders focused on improving health outcomes, whether at the bedside, in a research set - ting or directing an organization . The education and preparation of students to meet the health needs of a culturally diverse society is facilitated at Rush by the integration of academic, research and clinical practice components . Rush students have the advantage of attending a private university that is a vital part of a nationally recognized academic medical center . This unique integration stimulates excellence in education, practice, scholarly activities, and professional leadership by the fac- ulty and the graduates of the College of Nursing . The MSN and DNP programs at Rush University College of Nursing are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education . College of Nursing Mission The mission of Rush University College of Nursing is to integrate nursing practice, scholarship and education throughout the communities we serve and to boldly lead health care transformation to ensure health equity across the continuum of care . College of Nursing Vision Our vision is to lead nursing practice scholarship while driv - ing health equity . Philosophy The College of Nursing philosophy expresses the beliefs of the faculty regarding the metaparadigm of nursing and nursing education . Person The faculty believes that a person is a unique being who possesses innate dignity and worth with the right to self- determination . Persons live as individuals and as members of families, communities, and national and global societies .Environment The environment includes the multiple systems in which per - sons interact . This environment includes personal, physical, family, community, societal, economic, cultural and politi- cal systems . Persons influence, and are influenced by, their environments . Health Health is a dynamic state of well-being that interacts with personal factors and the environment . It is perceived in the context of a multisystem environment . Nursing Nursing is both a discipline and a profession . The focus of the discipline is the generation of knowledge related to persons and their environments for the purpose of maximizing the well-being of individuals, families, communities and society through health promotion, restoration and maintenance . The focus of the profession is the care of individuals, groups and communities through application of discipline-specific and discipline-related knowledge . Nurses contribute both individ- ually and collaboratively with other professionals to promote positive health outcomes . Nurses apply a professional code of ethics and professional guidelines to clinical practice, and demonstrate compassion, advocacy and cultural sensitivity . Nursing Education The education of nurses is a process by which the knowledge, skills, values and culture of nursing are transmitted to the learner . The faculty believes that professional nursing educa- tion is accomplished in a university setting and in an environ- ment where nursing education, practice and research are integrated . Nursing education is built upon knowledge from the sciences, arts and humanities so students understand and value the human experience and its relationship to health . Nursing faculty members foster student growth by providing learning experiences in a variety of health care settings so students can understand the complexity of health care and learn the nursing role . The education of nurses is an interac- tive process whereby students are actively engaged learners who take responsibility for their education and practice . The curricula of the College of Nursing are designed to pro - duce nurses who are the following: Competent, caring practitioners; lifelong learners that value scholarship; and collaborative members of interpro - fessional teams and leaders in the profession Clinical scholars who contribute to the scientific basis of nursing practice, improve clinical outcomes through evidence-based practice, and positively influence the pro - fession and the health care system82 83 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogCollege of Nursing Diversity Statement The best future for nursing depends on our ability to prepare a broadly diverse student body to become nurse clinicians, researchers and leaders who will improve health care outcomes for all populations. The preparation of a diverse nursing workforce is paramount to the delivery of effective, culturally congruent and acces- sible health care in an increasingly diverse nation . A broadly diverse student body promotes an enriched environment and deeper learning for all students and a more capable health care workforce . Diversity is defined broadly and includes but is not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion and veteran status . Rush University College of Nursing uses a holistic admis- sions process where a student's experiences, attributes and academic performance all have merit in making an admissions decision . Each candidate brings a unique set of personal attributes, characteristics, culture and experiences, but all students can contribute to the creation of a diverse and inclusive learning environment . These important ele - ments are considered in combination with how the individual will contribute value as a health professions student and future nurse . The Rush community strives to be an intentionally inclusive setting where students will thrive in learning, cocurricular and community experiences . An inclusive environment empowers all participants to reach their highest potential, learn from one another and develop a thoughtfulness that values diverse perspectives .

This requirement may be waived if the applicant has completed a minimum of three years of higher education and received their baccalaureate degree in the United States . Student Progression in the College of Nursing Student progress in the College of Nursing is reviewed and evaluated in several ways . The progressions policies estab - lished by the faculty are interpreted and applied by the student's academic adviser, the Office of the Dean and the College of Nursing Progressions Committee . The College of Nursing reserves the right to request a leave of absence or the withdrawal of any student whose conduct, physical or mental health, or performance demonstrates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profession . Should a student's behavior come into question, policies and procedures to determine the student's continuing status in the college are delineated in the College of Nursing Student Guidebook . Since much of the work in nursing assumes that students will achieve a progressively higher level of understanding and skill, high academic performance is expected . The individual student is responsible for acquiring knowledge inside and outside of formal classroom and clinical settings . Academic Progressions Policy A student must achieve an A or B grade in all required clinical nursing courses . If a student receives a C grade in a single clinical didactic course or a single clinical practicum, the student must repeat the course prior to graduation . A student may repeat only one clinical didactic or clinical practicum in a program of study . An F or N grade in any required course places the student on academic probation and may result in dismissal from the program . A grade of F, N or a second C in a required clinical didactic or clinical practicum may result in dismissal from the program . Permission may be given to retake a course at the discretion of the Progressions Committee . If permitted, a student has only one opportunity to achieve a passing grade . An F or N grade in the repeated courses may result in dismissal . Students in all graduate programs must maintain a cumula- tive 3 .0 average in graduate coursework to remain in good academic standing . If a student's cumulative GPA drops below 3 .0, they will be placed on academic probation . A student may enroll for no more than two consecutive terms as a probationary student . Students may be dismissed from the College of Nursing upon failing to achieve satisfactory academic standing in the required period or if the student incurs a second probationary event . To be awarded a degree or certificate, a student must be in good academic standing at the completion of the program . Please refer to the College of Nursing Student Guidebook for a complete review of the college academic progression policy .

Rush University Academic Policies The Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains additional Rush University academic policies . Student Professional and Community Service Requirement Participation in service activities is an important attribute of the health science professional . A hallmark of out - standing Rush students and alumni is the desire and abil- ity to make meaningful service contributions . Community service activities may include volunteer activities (health fairs and clinics, health education, provision of health ser - vices to at-risk or disadvantaged populations, and other outreach education or clinical activities) and service on community boards, committees, work groups and other service activities that promote the health and well-being of the community and its members . Professional ser - vice may include participation in the provision of state, national or international activities to advance the quality, access and effectiveness of health care services provided by allied health professionals .Achievement of the College of Health Sciences Excellence in Service Goal is demonstrated in part through the following: 1 . Student and faculty participation in community service activities 2 . Student satisfaction with, and appreciation for, commu- nity service 3 . Students and faculty who provide leadership and support to professional associations, boards and committees 4 . Provision of community and professional continuing edu- cation to local, national and international audiences In order to support achievement of the college's service excellence goals and objectives, the college has developed a professional and community service requirement for all College of Health Sciences students as a part of their aca- demic programs . As a requirement for program completion, each academic degree granting program will establish a minimum service requirement for each student enrolled in the program of at least 16 contact hours of approved professional or commu- nity service . Examples of activities that may be used to meet this require - ment include participation in community health fairs; com- munity health screening and/or health services; provision of community health education; participation in approved professional service and/or continuing education activi- ties; and assistance with the delivery of seminars, lectures, workshops and related community or professional continu- ing education activities . Conduct and Ethics Students are expected to conduct themselves in a profes- sional manner at all times in a manner that conforms to the ethics of the health professions and instills confidence in their abilities as health care professionals . Each student is expected to conform to the professional code of ethics as outlined in their departmental student handbook . Irresponsible, unprofessional or unethical behavior may result in disciplinary action, which may include suspension or dismissal from the college . All clinical agency or hospital regulations are to be followed by students when undergoing clinical or other training in a facility . For additional informa- tion, students should refer to the Rush University Statement on Academic Honesty and Student Conduct and the Rush University Medical Center Code of Conduct .172 173 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogScholastic Dishonesty and Cheating The College of Health Sciences will not condone cheating in any form . Allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the departmental Committee on Progress and Promotions . Any student found to be cheating on an examination may receive a 0 for the examination and will be subject to formal disciplinary action, which may include suspension or dis- missal from the program . Failure to report incidents involv - ing scholastic dishonesty on the part of another student will be considered unprofessional conduct and may also result in disciplinary action . Students should refer to the Rush University Policy on Academic Honesty and Student Conduct for further information . HIPAA and Patient Privacy Rush University students have a legal and ethical respon- sibility to safeguard the privacy of all patients and pro - tect confidentiality and security of all health information . Protecting the confidentiality of patient information means protecting it from unauthorized use or disclosure in any format, including verbal, fax, written or electronic/computer . Patient confidentiality is a central obligation of patient care . Any breaches in patient confidentiality or privacy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the college . The laboratory component of some courses may use stu- dents as simulated patients . This is particularly true for the patient evaluation, medicine and patient education compo - nents . Additionally, the sharing of personal experiences can be a rich resource in the development of students' under - standing, knowledge and appreciation of disease, health care and impact on peoples' lives . Practicing the medical history and physical examination of patients places students in close contact and leads to the sharing of personal information and physical findings . Similarly, students may use personal experiences in patient role-playing exercises . All shared and personal medical information and physical examination findings are to be treated with utmost confi- dentiality \u2014 the same as for any patient contact . Failure to protect the confidentiality of any information related to the activities in a course or clinical rotation may result in disci- plinary action, up to and including suspension or dismissal from the college .

An institutional inci - dent report will then be completed following the policy of the health care institution or hospital in which the incident occurred . A duplicate of the hospital incident report, as well as a memorandum of explanation from the clinical instruc - tor or preceptor, will be placed in the student's clinical file, and the department chairperson, program director or clinical director will be notified immediately . Incidents involving gross errors in judgment or practice on the part of the stu - dent will constitute grounds for dismissal from the program . Criminal Background Checks and Drug Testing Programs offered in the College of Health Sciences often require that clinical rotations, practica, internships or other learning experiences be successfully completed in hospitals and other health care facilities to meet program require - ments . Because the use of these facilities is required, stu- dents must be able to successfully complete their assigned rotations in order to fulfill the academic requirements of their program . Hospitals and other health care facilities often have policies requiring criminal background checks for employees, stu- dents and volunteers . These facilities may refuse to accept individuals for clinical, practicum or other experiential rota- tions based on past criminal convictions . Students should be prepared to comply with the policies and procedures at any facility where they are assigned as part of their educational program and may not request facility assignments in an effort to avoid specific requirements . Students who have certain types of information in their criminal background checks may be ineligible to complete rotations in specific facilities . Students who are not allowed to participate at assigned facilities or who are terminated from rotations based on the results of a criminal background check will be unable to complete the program requirements for graduation and will be subject to dismissal on academic grounds . Students should also be advised that persons with certain types of criminal convictions may not be eligible for state licensure or national registry or certification, or both . In addi- tion, many employers perform criminal background checks and may not hire individuals with certain types of criminal convictions .Drug Testing Hospitals and other health care facilities often have poli- cies requiring drug testing for employees, students and volunteers . Some facilities provide that students who test positive for drugs are ineligible to complete clinical, practi- cum or work assignments in that facility . Students should be prepared to comply with the policies and procedures at any assigned facility and may not request facility assignments in an effort to avoid drug screening requirements . Students who fail to report for clinical or practicum assignments or who are terminated from rotations because they violate the drug-testing or drug-use policies of the facilities will be sub - ject to dismissal from the program .

For additional information, students should refer to the Rush University Policy on Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA . Student Academic Appeal and Grievance Procedures The College of Health Sciences student appeals and griev - ance procedures provide a mechanism allowing student to obtain a review of a complaint of unfair treatment . The student appeals procedures shall not be used to question a rule, procedure or policy established by an authorized faculty or administrative body . Rather, it shall be used to provide due process for those who believe that a rule, pro - cedure or policy has been applied in an unfair or inequitable manner, or that there has been unfair or improper treatment by a person or persons . Students who are appealing an academic decision that could result in a dismissal from the University may be allowed to continue to progress in the program until the issue is resolved . If the academic decision is upheld and the student is dismissed from the University, they will be withdrawn from their current classes . This withdrawal will be backdated to before the beginning of the term, and the student will receive 100% tuition reimbursement for that term . A student wishing to appeal an academic decision should follow the process summarized below in the sequence indicated: Step 1. In the academic community, the responsibility for course development, course delivery and the assessment of student achievement rests primarily with each course instructor . Any student who has a complaint of inappropriate treatment related to a course should first seek to resolve it informally with the course instructor . If the course instructor is the department chairperson or if the complaint does not pertain to a specific course, the student should seek resolu- tion with the department chairperson at the outset . 1 . A student with such a complaint must request reconsid- eration, in writing, of the application of a rule, procedure or policy, or unfair or improper treatment within five working days following the incident that forms the basis for the complaint (e . g ., five days after grades are posted) . 2 . The instructor will meet with the student or speak with the student via telephone for those students who are unable to come to the chairperson's office, if requested by the student . The instructor will notify the student in writing of the decision regarding the complaint within five working days following the meeting or discussion . Step 2. If resolution is not achieved informally, as described in Step 1, the student should seek resolution with the chairperson of the department in which the course is offered within five working days following notification by the instructor of their decision . 1 . The chairperson will meet with the student \u2014 or speak with the student via telephone for those students unable to come to the chairperson's office if requested by the student \u2014 following receipt of the student's request for resolution to discuss the problem or complaint . 2 . The chairperson will notify the student of their decision in writing following the meeting or discussion . Step 3. If the issue was not resolved in Step 2, the student may submit a written appeal, describing the nature of the student's complaint and reasons for seeking an appeal, to the student progress and promotion committee of the department within five working days following notification by the department chairperson of their decision . 1 . The student may appear before the committee in person, make an oral statement and answer questions from the committee . The student will not be allowed to be present during committee deliberations . 2 . The committee may request that the course instructor or faculty member named in the grievance appear before the committee to make an oral statement and answer questions . The instructor or faculty member named in the grievance may not be present during committee deliberations . 3 . Following review of information provided, the committee will notify the student of its decision .176 177 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogStep 4. If the issue was not resolved to the student's satis- faction in Step 3, the student may submit a written request seeking a hearing to the dean within five working days of receiving the department progress and promotion committee decision . The written request should include a description of the complaint and the reason the student is seeking an appeal . 1 . The dean will meet with the student for a hearing follow- ing receipt of the written request from the . 2 . Following the meeting with the student, the dean may ren- der a decision or choose to appoint a panel to investigate the grievance and make a recommendation to the dean . Following review of the information provided and any recom- mendations from the panel, should one be appointed, the dean will then notify the student of their decision . The deci- sion of the dean shall be final . Addendum to the Academic Appeal and Grievance Process When a student appeal reaches the level of the dean of the College of Health Sciences, the dean may refer the case to a committee for the purpose of investigating the appeal or grievance and making a recommendation to the dean . The purpose of this addendum is to describe the procedure fol- lowed by the committee . The College of Health Sciences has established a standing committee of 10 members of its Faculty Council . The com- mittee members will be determined each fall for the subse - quent year . Five members will be selected from the standing committee, as available and appropriate, to serve on an appeals hearing committee . The five members will include a designated chair of the committee, who will be the chair of the Faculty Council if available . If the chair of the Faculty Council cannot serve as chair of the committee, one of the five selected committee members will be appointed as chair of the appeals committee by the chair of the Faculty Council . If a member of the standing committee is in the same department as the student involved or has a conflict of interest related to the student, the committee member shall recuse from the hearing . Faculty who are also students in the College of Health Sciences program that the student is enrolled in may not serve on the standing committee . The hearing will be closed and confidential, all documenta- tion related to the appeal shall be kept confidential and its distribution limited to individuals on a need-to-know basis . Transcripts of a hearing are not required . Students may take notes but may not record the hearing .The steps for the appeal process are as follows: 1 . The dean will notify the chair of Faculty Council of a stu- dent grievance or appeal at the level of the Office of the Dean that permits a hearing . Within 24 hours, the chair will provide the dean with a receipt of the notice . 2 . Within 10 business days of the submission of the appeal to the dean, the student will submit a written summary that includes the following information: Action being appealed and course number and grade or evaluation, if applicable Action requested Justification for request Outline of effort and actions taken to date to obtain consideration of the request The dean reserves the right to ask for points of clarification that must be provided within five business days of the query . Within 20 business days of the submission of the appeal to the dean, a College of Health Sciences designee as des- ignated by the committee (someone from the student's progress and promotions committee) will submit a written account of the evidence against the student, along with a summary of the account and appendices providing the evidence . The dean reserves the right to ask for points of clarification that must be provided within five business days of the query . Formal rules of evidence shall not be applicable . Evidence presented should be reasonably related to the issue before the committee and shall not be overly repetitious . All evidence shall be admissible unless clearly redundant or irrelevant to the issue being reviewed . The student may call witnesses on their behalf . The chair of the appeals committee shall have the right to limit witnesses based on redundancy or relevance to the issue . 3 . The student appeal summary will be submitted to the chair of the appeals committee, who will then schedule a hear - ing for the appeal \u2014 to occur within 15 business days of the receipt of the written summaries . The appeal hearing will be scheduled for one hour and 30 minutes within one of the classrooms or conference rooms . 4 . The hearing will be convened by the chair of the appeals committee . At the hearing, the following people will attend: the five selected members of the standing committee, including the chair of the appeals committee, and the student . The dean or designee may attend as an observer during the hearing . The student may choose to have at the hearing a representative, who may be an attorney, serving in a non-speaking role in support for the student . The committee may have at the hearing a University attorney, who will serve only in an advisory capacity . 5 . The role of the committee members is to (a) hear the grievance or appeal, (b) consider all evidence, (c) ask clarifying questions as needed and (d) make a recom- mendation to the dean based on a preponderance of the evidence . 6 . The College of Health Sciences designee from the stu- dent's progress and promotions committee will present evidence concerning the student . 7 . The student will present their evidence in support of their grievance or appeal and shall have the burden of estab - lishing that their request should be granted . At the con- clusion of the hearing, the chair will excuse the student prior to the committee's deliberations . 8 . A designated committee member will take summary notes, including time, what evidence is presented by whom and final disposition of the committee . A decision will be reached by a majority vote of the five committee members . 9 . Following deliberations, the committee will provide a recommendation to the dean, which should include a summary of the evidence presented at the hearing . The dean will consider the committee's recommendation and render a final decision .Committees The senior administrative and policy body of the College of Health Sciences is the Chairs Council .

If employed by a clinical site in which the student is assigned a clinical rotation, the student must not complete clinical coursework while in an employee status . Scholastic Dishonesty and Cheating The division will not condone cheating in any form . Plagiarizing or copying others writing or work is considered cheating . Any allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care and, if merited, dealt with in a strict manner, including immediate dismissal from the program . Any student found to be cheating on an examination, test, quiz or assignment will automatically receive a grade of 0 and will be subject to dismissal from the program at the discretion of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . Plagiarism on drafts of assignments may result in a grade of 0 for the entire assignment . Failure to report incidents involving scholastic dishonesty on the part of another student will be considered unprofessional con- duct on the part of the student and may result in disciplinary action . Examination Review At the discretion of the course instructor, during review of any examination given within the curriculum, no other papers or books will be allowed on the student's desk . No writing implements of any kind will be allowed . NO note- taking or recording of any kind will be permitted . This includes written note-taking and/or any form of mechanical, electronic, audio, or video recording . Violation of this policy will constitute academic dishonesty and will be referred to the Committee on Progress and Promotions for review and possible disciplinary action . Examination Administration All examinations given by the division will be monitored by faculty or staff at all times . Students will be seated in such a manner as to minimize the opportunity for observation of other students' examination papers . No breaks will be allowed once an examination period has begun, and stu- dents may not leave the room during an exam until they are finished taking the examination, except in the event of an emergency, which will be judged by the faculty or staff monitoring the exam on a case by case basis . If a student turns in an examination without answering all questions, he or she will NOT be given an opportunity to fin- ish the examination after leaving the room . Only marks made on the Scantron sheet will be used to com- pute a grade on all Scantron-graded examinations . Even if a student marks the answer correctly on his or her examina- tion, but does not mark it correctly on the Scantron, only the Scantron answer will be used to compute the grade, not the answer marked on the examination . Calculators will be provided to students for examina- tions, thus personal calculators will not be allowed during examinations . Policy for Transfer Students Students who have completed coursework at other approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific coursework in the Rush University program . Students must submit a transcript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course syllabus for each course in which they desire transfer credit .

Some indi- viduals may acquire knowledge through experience and on the job training . When such persons apply for admission into the program, an attempt is made to grant academic credit for equivalent educational courses, equivalent knowledge acquired from experience and/or successful completion of the National Board for Respiratory Care's certification and registry examinations . All students graduating from the Respiratory Care program must meet the same standards for graduation; the award- ing of advanced standing does not signify a lesser quality education than that offered through regular course work . What it does, however, is attempt to exempt the student from those areas of the formal program where the student already has the knowledge and expertise in those skills that would be offered . The program has identified the minimum competencies that a respiratory therapist must have in order to provide safe, high-quality patient care . The identification of these competencies is a complex task, and a great deal of care must be taken to ensure a standard of excellence . The following policies and procedures are designed to ensure that those individuals who receive advanced stand- ing are qualified to do so, and that the screening process adheres to University and departmental policies at all times . It is not in the student's or program's best interest to allow individuals who are not qualified to receive advanced standing . To allow individuals who are not qualified, to receive advanced standing, is not in the student's or the program's best interest . Definition Advanced standing is defined as a special and individu- ally determined status granted to a student in a formal educational setting who has already gained professional experience through other sources or through non academic experiences, knowledge, skills and professionalism taught in the program courses . Purpose of Advanced-Standing Procedures The purpose of the advanced-standing procedures is to recognize and give formal educational credit for knowledge and/or ability gained through previous training or experience .Methods of Granting Advanced Standing 1 . Advanced standing can be awarded through transfer credit . 2 . Advanced standing can be awarded through the passing of an equivalency examination covering a certain area of knowledge . (An equivalency examination is an instrument or means by which a student accepted into the Respiratory Care program can demonstrate mastery of a knowledge area, content area or skill, and thus be exempted from a course in the program that teaches that area or skill .) 3 . Advanced standing can be awarded as credit for success- ful completion of national registry examinations (RRT/ RPFT) . Eligibility for Advanced Standing 1 . Transfer students who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care program may receive a trans- fer credit for equivalent courses within the Respiratory Care program curriculum . 2 . Credentialed students (RRT, RPFT) who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program may receive transfer credit and will also be eli- gible to take equivalency examinations in certain courses . Policy for Transfer Students Students who have completed coursework at other approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific coursework in the Rush University program . Students must submit a transcript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course syllabus for each course in which they desire transfer credit . The syllabus must contain the following: course objectives, lecture outlines, course content, evaluation procedures and related informa- tion . These courses will be evaluated on an individual basis for content and total contact hours and credit hours . The department reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in coursework transferred from other respiratory care programs and the right to disallow such transfer credit in such coursework in cases which the student cannot demon- strate acceptable proficiency . All transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . The student must also have a minimum grade of B (3 .0) for each course being transferred . A student cannot receive transfer credit for any respiratory care course - work if he or she left the previous program due to academic probation, suspension or exclusion . All University policies regarding transfer credit must be satisfied .190 191 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogPolicy for Individuals Who Hold the RRT Credential Advanced standing is available to individuals who have successfully completed the National Board for Respiratory Care's Respiratory Therapy Registry (RRT), who hold a bac- calaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university .

Academic Probation Academic probation is assigned to a student who earns a single-term academic grade point average (GPA) between 2 .5 and 2 .99 (A = 4 . 0), and/or whose cumulative academic GPA falls between 2 .5 and 2 .99 at any time . The academic GPA is calculated for all non-clinical coursework . A reme - diation plan to address probation will be developed by the student's academic adviser and the student and will be documented in the student's program file . A student must earn a single-term academic GPA of 3 .0 or greater at the end of the semester for which the student is on academic proba- tion and a cumulative academic GPA of 3 .0 or greater by the end of the first academic year to continue in the program . A student who incurs a semester academic GPA below 3 .0 after being removed from academic probation will be dis- missed from the program, even if the cumulative academic GPA is 3 .0 or greater . A student who earns a grade of D or less in a required course must repeat that course or an equivalent course that has been approved by the student's program and trans- ferred from an outside institution . In a repeated course, the new grade will replace the earlier grade in the cumulative academic GPA . Failure to receive a grade of C or greater in a repeated course will result in dismissal from the program . A student must receive a grade of C or greater in an approved transfer course in order for it to be accepted as an equivalent for the course for which the student received a grade of D or less . Credit for a transferred course is not included in the calculation of the cumulative academic GPA . The course for which the student earned the grade of D or less will remain on the student's transcript and will be used to calculate the academic GPA . This may impact the stu- dent's minimum GPA requirement for graduation . A student who earns a grade of D or less in two or more required courses, regardless of the grade earned in a repeated course and regardless of the cumulative academic GPA, will be dismissed from the program . A student who earns a single-term academic GPA of less than 2 .5 at any point during his/her course of study will be dismissed from the program . A student who fails to meet the stated criteria for the com- prehensive examination will be dismissed from the program . A cumulative academic GPA of 3 .0 or greater is required for graduation . Clinical Probation Clinical probation is assigned to a student who earns a grade of C or less in a clinical practicum, internship, or externship . Although the clinical contact hours may be used to meet the ASHA Council for Clinical Certification (CFCC) requirements, the student may be required to repeat the clinical education course before progressing further in the clinical sequence . A remediation plan to address clinical probation will be determined by the student, the student's academic adviser, and the clinical education manager; this remediation plan will be documented . Failure to achieve a grade of B or higher in any subsequent clinical education course will result in dismissal from the program . The faculty reserves the right to request the withdrawal of any student whose conduct or performance demonstrates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profession . Any such student not voluntarily withdrawing will be dismissed from the program . Clinical Progression In the AuD program, a grade of B or higher is required to pass a clinical course . Students receiving a grade of C or less in any AuD clinical course prior to the final externship semester will be placed on clinical probation and required to repeat and pass the practicum before progressing further in the clinical sequence . Any earned clinical contact hours may be used to meet the ASHA Council for Clinical Certification requirements .196 197 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogStudents receiving a grade of C in their final externship semester will be placed on probation and required to reg- ister for one credit of continuing enrollment in the follow- ing semester to complete remediation and achieve good standing before graduation . Students receiving a grade of D in their final externship semester will be placed on probation and required to repeat the course . Students receiving an F in the final externship semester will be dismissed from the program . For students placed on clinical probation at any time during the AuD clinical sequence, a remediation plan to address clinical probation will be determined jointly by the student, the student's academic adviser, and the clinical education manager; this remediation plan will be documented . Failure to achieve a grade of B or higher in any subsequent clinical education course will result in dismissal from the program .

Toward that goal, we teach the highest levels of competence and integrity in education, leadership and research, and provide professional development and research mentoring by estab - lished scholars across the continuum of health sciences . The underlying educational philosophy of the program is grounded in a triad of learner-centered thought: progressiv - ism in which the learners' experiences, needs and interests are explored and fostered; reconstructionism in which the learners see their growth applied to real-world problems; and existentialism by which learners are challenged to own their future and become leaders in the evolution of health care . Mission Our mission is to produce experienced health science professionals with a broad-based, interdisciplinary educa- tion who are prepared to lead, teach, practice clinically and perform research at the highest levels of competency and integrity . Vision To become the highest quality PhD in health sciences pro - gram in the United States . Curricular Design We offer a rigorous curriculum that emphasizes funda- mentals and advanced concepts in leadership, education, research and professional development . We provide high quality, asynchronous online courses in leadership, educa- tion and research . The role of the curricular design is to provide a logical progression to learner growth . The guiding principal of the curricular design is three-fold and presented in a continuum of foundations (theory), appli- cation (real-world problem resolution) and vision (synthesis and creative/critical forward thinking regarding the future trajectory of health care) . The curricular design first estab - lishes a foundation of past and current thinking (epistemo - logical framework) and theory associated with leadership, education and research . The curriculum challenges learners to address real-world applications through focused seminar courses and learner-centered projects . The curriculum progresses and challenges the learners' axiological consider - ations, encouraging the value of moving health care forward through research, demonstration projects, dissertation focus, ownership of learning and philosophical challenges to the status quo . The program director provides general academic sup - port and oversees the professional development courses . Transition to doctoral candidate occurs upon successfully completing most core courses, passing a comprehensive qualifying exam and passing a dissertation proposal pre - sented to the dissertation committee . Doctoral candidates conduct research and publish under the guidance and supervision of a research mentor . The dissertation committee consists of the research mentor, the program director and at least three additional qualified members . The dissertation committee ensures students are well-prepared to identify and fill important gaps in knowl- edge through the generation and dissemination of new knowledge, and endorses the awarding of the PhD degree . Program Overview The Doctor of Philosophy in Health Sciences program was launched by the College of Health Sciences in fall 2011 . The program is designed to prepare health science profession- als to assume major leadership, research and educational positions within their professions, as well as to foster career advancement opportunities . The program provides a broad-based, interdisciplinary education that prepares graduates to teach, practice and perform research across the continuum of health care . The program prepares individuals for careers in research, educa- tion and leadership within allied health and, more broadly, within health care and higher education . The program of study for the Doctor of Philosophy degree involves formal courses in leadership, education and research . It also involves mentored professional develop - ment within a health science specialty field . The publication of scholarly work in a peer-reviewed journal and the passing of a comprehensive oral examination are also required . In addition, students must complete and present a dissertation proposal that meets the approval of their advisory com- mittee prior to beginning a dissertation research project that culminates in the writing and oral public defense of a dissertation . The PhD degree demonstrates the capability for indepen- dent research and recognizes a unique contribution to sci- entific knowledge . The program may be taken on a part-time Health Sciencesbasis, however, in all cases must be completed in seven years or less . The program consists of five major core areas: leadership (12 credits), education (nine credits), research (18 credits), professional development (three credits) and dissertation research (12 credits minimum) . The professional develop - ment courses are based on learning contracts that provide opportunities for advanced mentored learning and skill development in the allied health profession matching the students' interests . Student learning objectives have been developed for each major core area and are mapped to individual courses . Students entering the program must have a master's degree in an area related to health sciences/health care adminis- tration or substantial professional experiences in a health sciences related field . Program Objectives 1 . Produce scholars who will generate new knowledge and innovative applications through research 2 . Produce scholars who will disseminate knowledge through education and publications 3 . Produce scholars who will shape the future of health sci- ences through leadership and cooperation 4 . Produce scholars who will uphold the highest ideals of health sciences Health Sciences (PhD): Admission Requirements Applicants must have completed a master's degree or higher degree \u2014 such as an MD, AuD or OTD \u2014 from a region- ally accredited college or university, provide official tran- scripts from each college or university attended and hold appropriate certification/licensure in their individual health profession by a major U .S . certification/licensing agency, as applicable .

A cumulative grade-point average of at least 3 .0 is required in the graduate programs . Cumulative grade-point averages will be reviewed after each term . No student will be permit - ted into the clinical rotation portion of the program unless they have the required GPA . The faculty reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a student whose conduct, health or performance demon- strates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profes- sion . Any such student not voluntarily withdrawing will be dismissed from the University . Academic Probation Academic probation is assigned to any student who receives a term grade-point average below 3 .0 or whose cumulative grade-point average falls below 3 .0 . Students placed on pro - bation have two terms to regain the status of good standing as follows: In the next term after being placed on probation, the stu- dent must attain a term grade-point average of at least 3 .0 . Two terms after being placed on probation, the student must have a cumulative grade-point average above 3 .0 . Failure to make the minimum term grade-point average one term after probation, or the minimum cumulative grade-point average two terms after probation, will result in dismissal from the University . Note that the receipt of financial aid may also be impacted when the grade-point average falls below 3 .0 .C, D, F or N Grades Students may not receive more than two grades of C or lower in the program . Students who receive a third grade of C or lower will be dismissed from the program . Students who receive a D, F or N grade in any course must repeat that course . If that a student is required to repeat a course that is a prerequisite for an advanced course, the advanced course may not be taken until the student successfully passes the prerequisite course . Thus, the student's progression in the program may be affected . Students who receive a second D or F grade will be dismissed from the program . All work in practicum courses must be at or above the B grade level . If a student earns a grade less than B in a clinical practicum course, the course must be repeated but may be repeated only once and must be taken within one year, with the new grade replacing the failing grade in the cumulative grade-point average . A second grade below B in any practi- cum course will result in dismissal from the program . Comprehensive Examination All students must take and pass a comprehensive exami- nation at the end of the second year in order to graduate from the Medical Laboratory Science program . Any stu- dent who fails the cumulative examination must retake the examination until passing . A diploma will not be given until the student has passed all sections of the comprehensive examination .

Occupational Therapy: Program Overview Professional Description The Department of Occupational Therapy offers a graduate program that prepares students for unique contributions to the field of occupational therapy . This professional-level program is designed for people with baccalaureate degrees in other fields who are seeking to become occupational therapists . Philosophy on Educational Occupational therapists recognize humans as complex beings engaged in and organized around occupations occur - ring within the social, physical, temporal, cultural, personal and virtual environments (AOTA, 2014; AOTA 2017) . When dysfunction or internal or external contexts limit or prevent participation, occupational therapists enable doing in a vari- ety of ways . The practice of occupational therapy involves individuals, groups or organizations, their attributes and the multiple environmental contexts that comprise occupa- tional performance . Occupational therapy interventions are designed to facilitate people to adapt and change in order to improve their engagement in occupational performance across the lifespan . Rush University Department of Occupational Therapy faculty members fulfill roles as practitioner-teacher and investigator, a combination that infuses the curriculum with contemporary and scholarly perspectives to prepare stu- dents to meet the occupational needs of society . Graduate courses and clinical experiences build on students' past knowledge and skills to encourage transformative and inte - grative learning . The critical self-reflection of the transfor - mative learning process encourages examining, questioning, validating and possibly revising prior knowledge so that new perceptions and meanings may evolve (Cranton, 2006) . Integrative learning expands on this process by facilitating Occupational Therapy240 241 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalogstudents' ability to connect ideas, concepts and experi- ences to better adapt to novel and complex issues (Huber & Hutchings, 2004) . The end result is a learner who is intel- lectually flexible to meet the needs of complex clients in a continually changing society . A program based on transfor - mative and integrative learning builds on a student's past, connects it to present activities and predicts a future in which they are competent and capable to respond to the ongoing needs of the profession and the clients we serve . The curriculum builds towards leadership in professional reasoning and meeting the needs of an increasingly dynamic profession . Self-directed learning and critical thinking using evidence-based research and practice are fostered through faculty mentorship, problem solving, collaborative activities and critical inquiry in the classroom, clinic and community to promote entry-level performance . The individualized doctoral experience establishes a trajectory that enables students to become an emerging leader in their professional practice . Rush occupational therapy graduates are prepared to work in traditional and emerging practice settings but, more importantly, are ethical, flexible, creative, autonomous and informed practitioner-teacher-investigators . Professional Orientation Since Rush graduate will be prepared to work in a variety of traditional and nontraditional settings, their practice base is the result of broad experiences within the many arenas of occupational therapy . Graduates have the ability to add increasing amounts of depth and validation to their interven- tion programs as a result of their involvement and experi- ences with problem-solving approaches to therapy . Given the combination of breadth and depth of knowledge and experience related to occupational therapy intervention, the primary strength of Rush University graduates will be their ability to function as highly resourceful practitioners . As in the past, and for the foreseeable future, the role of the practitioner is the core of all occupational therapy . The prac- titioner who is able to base intervention on established fact, use internal and external resources and engage in profes- sional reasoning and problem-solving is the practitioner who will contribute to the credibility and viability of the profes- sion . It is this type of practitioner who is expected to be the product of the Rush program . Graduates of the program are able to enter the clinical arena competently and confidently, applying their clinical skills and expanding upon those skills as situations require . This con- tinuous process of assessment and expansion contributes to the personal and professional growth vital to occupational therapists . The role of the clinician, as it is understood in this context, incorporates other major roles of the therapist . As the Rush program is designed, the students have the opportunity to explore the functions of the therapist as an educator, researcher and manager from the practitioner's perspective . The involvement of the student in these other roles is another major strength of the program . The addi- tional roles of educator, manager and researcher cannot be separated from the practitioner's role . Accreditation and Certification The Rush University Occupational Therapy Doctorate program is fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), located at: 6116 Executive Boulevard, Suite 200 North Bethesda, MD 20852-4929 Phone: (301) 652-AOTA www .acoteonline . org Graduates will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist that is adminis- tered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy, or NBCOT .

The Doctor of Philosophy is awarded in recognition of high achievement in a particular field of scientific research as evidenced by submission of a dissertation that demonstrates independent investigation and contributes new information to the body of existing knowledge . The PhD program integrated and research; ori- ented; it should culminate in a work of literary and scholarly merit, which is indicative of the candidate's ability to con- duct original research in a recognized specialty . Specifically, the program is composed of formal courses, guided indi- vidual study in a chosen field or discipline, cognate subjects recommended by the candidate's advisory committee, original research that serves as the basis of scientific publi- cation and a scholarly dissertation . A first-authored scien- tific manuscript of the student's original research is a degree requirement . Admission to Candidacy Admission to candidacy is evidence that the doctoral stu- dent has successfully completed all preliminary coursework and is prepared to move into the intensive research experi- ence . Depending upon the requirements of the program, these exams will test accumulated knowledge, scientific rea- soning and the ability to critically and analytically thinking . Admission to candidacy is a demonstration of confidence that the student will successfully accomplish the remaining requirements of the program . Students failing to achieve admission to candidacy may apply the coursework and com- pleted research toward a related Master of Science degree . Dissertation A doctoral student must complete a dissertation . This docu- ment is developed through faculty-guided independent research projects . The dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university . Each student will have a dissertation or advisory committee whose role is to assure that the student's dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the Graduate College for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation . The committee is also to assure that the student is making satisfactory progress toward 270 271 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalogcompletion of the degree . The committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with the student's primary adviser and should consist of at least five total members . The composition of this committee should be approved by the Academic Standards Committee and should comply with any specific requirements of the Graduate College . Advisory committee members must be members of the Graduate College . At least one member of the committee should be external to Rush University . Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson who cannot be the student's primary adviser . In addition to the five committee members, the program director will serve as an ex officio member of the committee . The public defense will be comprised of a public one-hour lecture attended by the dissertation committee and faculty and students of the University . The dissertation committee then meets in closed session to examine the candidate and approve the dissertation . Typically, the meeting immedi- ately follows the public lecture . The committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objections of a single committee member . Master of Science The Master of Science degree is designed to enhance the scientific and professional preparation of students aspiring for a career in the health professions or in a related field requiring graduate level biomedical sciences .

Students in the program will work with faculty and scientists to generate new knowledge in the fields of biomedicine using sophisticated research methods . As a part of the pro - gram, students are required to demonstrate their knowledge of core and concentration-specific courses and pass a com- prehensive preliminary examination based on their research proposal . Students will design and conduct research that culminates in a dissertation, and they will disseminate their scientific findings through scholarly publications and presentations . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Curriculum First Year The goal of the course work in the first year is to expose the student to the biomedical sciences to enable them to design and approach a research problem from molecular, biochemi- cal, cellular and organ system perspectives . This broad based approach to disease is the core of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences program . Students will need to com- plete 22 credits of core course work .280 281 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogSecond Year Credit Hours Fall Term GCC-699 Dissertation Research 1-9 Spring Term GCC-699 Dissertation Research 1-9 GCC-594 Introduction to Grant Writing 2 Summer Term GCC-699 Dissertation Research 1-9 Notes: Laboratory rotations are part of the core curriculum .

This broad based approach to disease is the core of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences program . Year 2 Research Experience, Qualifying Examination The selection of research adviser will significantly influ- ence the student's selection of a research area of inter - est . The goals of the second year are to learn the relevant laboratory techniques and to develop a research proposal in conjunction with their research adviser . The research project will advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield first-author scientific publications for the student . The student's research proposal should include specific aims and be written in the format of a NIH F31 grant proposal (See researchtraining .nih . gov/programs/fellowships/F31) . The student must select a dissertation committee and defend the proposal in front of the committee by the end of the second year . The written proposal and its defense in front of the committee constitutes the qualifying exami- nation . Passing the qualifying examination in front of the dissertation committee means the student is a candidate for the PhD . The student's assessment at this time relates to the follow- ing Student Learning Outcomes: The graduate will be able to acquire research skills, collect and analyze data, and inter - pret results in order to address an original research question . In addition, this step begins the continuing assessment of the following outcomes: A graduating student will be capable of independent critical thinking and writing as well as pro - posing, performing and effectively presenting their research . The student will be able to work collaboratively with other scientists, physicians and health care professionals to give and obtain feedback concerning the approach to research problems, data analysis and implications of research . The work environment in basic and clinical science is evolv - ing . Students should be aware of the many different types of opportunities available in the workplace and need to prepare themselves for the opportunities and challenges that they will encounter when they graduate . In addition to the research and the coursework, the student will create an individual development plan (IDP) each year to define their areas of interest, skills and values . Students will review their IDP yearly with their research mentor, program director or Graduate College designee to refine their career interests and define their gaps in knowl- edge or skills that can be pursued in the following year . By the time of graduation, students should have used the IDP, along with mentorship and experiential or other training opportunities to refine their career path . Student progress is assessed at the end of years two through five . At the end of year two, student progress toward meeting expected outcomes will be evaluated by the student's research adviser and program director . See section on Dissertation Proposal and Presentation . Qualifying Examination The goals of the second year are to learn the relevant laboratory techniques and to develop a research proposal in conjunction with the student's research adviser . The research project will advance scientific knowledge in a spe - cific discipline and yield first-author scientific publications . For the Qualifying Examination, the student's research pro - posal should include a hypothesis and specific aims and be written in the format of an NIH F31 grant (researchtraining . nih .gov/programs/fellowships/F31) . The student must select a dissertation committee and defend the written proposal as an oral defense in front of the committee by the end of the second year . All members of the committee or appropriate substitutes must be present at the Qualifying Examination and the dissertation defense either in person, on the phone or using electronic media . If the student does not complete the Qualifying Examination by the end of the summer of their second year, they will be reported to the Academic Standards Committee and placed on probation during the fall of their third year . If the student has not taken the examination by the end of the term of pro - bation the student will be again reported to the Academic Standards Committee for potential dismissal . Since the adviser shares in the responsibility to ensure student aca- demic progress, including completion of program milestones in a timely manner, advisers of students who do not take the qualifying examination by the end of fall term of their third year will not be allowed to take a new student into their laboratory for the subsequent two years . 282 283 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogFollowing the defense of their Qualifying Examination, students will submit their written proposal as an Individual National Research Service Award (F31) [researchtraining .nih . gov/programs/fellowships/F31] or a comparable grant appli- cation . While a student is conducting dissertation research the student will present their progress every six months to their committee in an identical format as the original proposal meeting until the committee has agreed that the student can write their dissertation . The advisory committee meetings will consist of an oral pre - sentation of research progress by the doctoral student to the committee . This oral presentation will be followed by a dis- cussion of progress and career development . A detailed writ - ten account of progress will be distributed by the student to their committee prior to this meeting . It is recommended that the Rush career development IDP (rushedu-auvic .form- stack .com/forms/idp) be used for IDP tracking . Year 3-5 Research Progress/Publications/ Dissertation For evaluation in years three through five, the student will submit a written report documenting their progress . The research adviser and program director will also submit their assessment of student progress for each year . A meeting with the student, research adviser and program director will take place at the end of each year to discuss the student's progress . The research adviser monitors the day-to-day progress of the student . The dissertation committee will meet at least every six months to monitor progress and to approve any changes to the proposed research project . They may meet more frequently, especially after the approval of the stu- dent's research proposal . The student is expected to attend national meetings, make presentations, posters etc . and become a part of the scientific community . Likewise, the stu- dent should be submitting research articles . The Integrated Biomedical Science PhD program requires that the research project yield at least one first authored research article accepted for publication in a scientific peer-reviewed journal . The publication requirement is necessary for graduation but not sufficient . The dissertation committee will continue to assess student progress on the aims and determines when the student has completed his/her dissertation . (See Dissertation Proposal and Presentation below) . The student's assessment continues on the outcomes listed above with emphasis on the growth of research and communication skills . Likewise, it is expected that the communication outcomes will also become more centered on written communication in the form of abstracts, peer- reviewed journal articles and the dissertation as the student begins to complete the following outcome: The graduate is able to contribute to the scientific literature in an area of expertise via published abstracts, a dissertation and by the publication of a first-authored research article in a scientific refereed journal . Dissertation Document, Presentation and Approval The student is expected to write a dissertation (format approved by the Center for Academic Excellence) and pres- ent the work in a public forum attended by the dissertation committee, and University faculty and students . The disser - tation committee will then meet with the student in a closed session to address any additional questions and to deliber - ate on approval of the dissertation . Typically, the meeting immediately follows the public defense . The student may be asked to make revisions before final approval of the dissertation by the committee . The student must notify the Registrar's Office of impending completion of the degree by the submission of an Intent to Graduate Form at the beginning of the final term . Prior to completion, the student should consult with the Center for Academic Excellence to ensure that the dissertation is formatted correctly . Qualifying Examination Dissertation Proposal and Presentation \u2014 For the Qualifying Examination, the student will write a research proposal in the style of the NIH F31 fellowship, including a hypoth- esis, specific aims, and a detailed research strategy (see researchtraining .nih . gov/programs/fellowships/F31) . The stu- dent must select a dissertation committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the second year . Experiential Learning Opportunities (ELOs) Experiential Learning Opportunities (ELOs) are part of the foundation upon which students develop knowledge and skills from direct or hands-on experiences outside of their own laboratory and didactic training . An ELO encompasses a vast array of activities including, but not limited to, intern- ships, service learning, workshops, specialized courses and other creative career and professional experiences that promote interdisciplinary learning and career preparedness . ELOs provide students with the opportunity to understand and explore potential career paths with minimal risk . ELOs provide experiences that can be referenced (e . g ., on resumes, curriculum vitas, etc .) and are valued in a high-stakes, com- petitive market . ELOs provide students a practical way to apply and lever - age their skills and knowledge and solve problems outside of their major research project . ELOs provide students with the opportunity to collaborate with non-specialists and poten- tially to engage intellectually and socially in an area outside of the biomedical sciences . Once a student has successfully completed their candidacy exam, an ELO is an annual requirement until completion of the program . Program requirements can be found www . rushu .rush . edu/graduate-college/career-development-office/ experiential-learning . Minimal Credit Hours Required for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD) Degree The PhD in Integrated Biomedical Sciences should be com- pleted in five years and requires completion of 80 credits distributed as follows: core courses (22), concentration spe - cific cognates (four) and dissertation research (54) . Students must also pass the Qualifying Examination, complete an annual Experiential Learning Opportunity (ELO), and publish a first-authored, scientific, peer-reviewed manuscript on their research project . The core curriculum, which is common to all students, builds knowledge and skills in research theories and methodology, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applications and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . These courses provide systematic exposure to the contemporary process of scientific discovery and will serve as the basis for the remainder of the curriculum . Advanced students entering with a Master of Science (MS) degree in a biomedical science or a Doctor of Medicine (MD or DO) degree may have satisfied the requirement for some of the core classes based on their prior records . Therefore, some core course requirements may be waived . The requirement of core course hours can be compensated by taking extra hours of laboratory rotations or pre-dissertation research . These students may be able to complete the degree in a shorter time period providing that they progress through the other program requirements . IBS MS students who enter the IBS PhD program will be on a separate plan of study which requires fewer cognate and elective credits based on the number required for the IBS MS program .All students will be required to complete a minimum of 54 credits of Dissertation Research following admission into candidacy for the PhD . Dissertation credits in the Graduate College typically involve laboratory-based research required for completion of the dissertation, and include training in various types of skills including: analyzing published data; developing a research proposal; learning and apply - ing advanced methodologies and statistical data analyses; developing skills to write and submit a pre-doctoral training grant application; practicing presentation skills to dissemi- nate one's own research findings in national conferences; writing a research publication; and developing and defend- ing a dissertation project . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Academic Policies Research Adviser Selection During the first year the student will select up to three laboratories for research rotations . These laboratory rotations will expose the students to a range of research environments . Rotations should be undertaken with mentors who hold a faculty appointment in the Graduate College . Students are expected have a project with a hypothesis and aims, to learn techniques and attend all lab meetings . Based on these rotations, the student will identify their labora- tory of interest and submit the name of the adviser to the Academic Standards Committee . The committee, in consul- tation with the potential adviser(s) will approve the adviser- student matches . Students who are already committed to a particular laboratory (funded by the research adviser's grants) are required to perform a minimum of two laboratory rotations . Exposure to other laboratories and research will give the student a greater breadth of knowledge . Students are expected to select a research adviser and an area of research interest by the end of their first summer term . All advisers must meet the criterion established by the Graduate College . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Research Opportunities The research areas of interest for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD program are translational cancer research; cardiovascular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflamma- tion and infection; functions and disorders of the musculo - skeletal system; and functions and disorders of the nervous 284 285 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University Catalogsystem . These include qualified faculty from Rush University Medical Center who have an interest in research in these areas . They come from academic departments as well as clinical departments, which enables students to select a variety of individuals with basic and clinical expertise to serve on their advisory committees and guide them through their projects . Advisory Committee By the end of the summer term of the first year the student should have selected a research adviser and begun to col- lect preliminary data . The research adviser is required to hold a faculty appointment in the Graduate College . Once a research adviser has been selected, a dissertation commit - tee must be selected by the end of the following term . This committee advises the student and serves as the Qualifying Examination committee and the dissertation committee . The Graduate College requires that the committee is comprised of five members . One member will be the student's research adviser . A majority of the committee (at least three mem- bers) must be faculty at Rush University who are members of the Graduate College . The chair of this committee, who cannot be the student's research adviser, will be chosen at the first committee meeting and will preside at all subse - quent meetings and arrange for a timely completion of the dissertation work . The dissertation committee strives for consensus in all its actions . A majority vote of the commit - tee's membership, however, is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the dissertation . In addition to the five committee members, the program director will serve as an ex officio member of the committee . The ex officio member can participate in the meetings but cannot vote . The purpose of having an ex officio member is to monitor the quality of the examination experience . The ex officio member will ensure that the Graduate College rules are followed . The first committee meeting should take place within six months of its selection and approval . Data Defense and Dissertation In the candidate's final year, a dissertation data defense will be presented to their dissertation committee demonstrating that satisfactory progress has been made on the project to justify development of a plan to complete all experiments and to start writing their dissertation . If determined, the dis- sertation committee will submit the request to Defend form . The data defense should be considered the final committee meeting .Upon completion of the data defense and writing of the dis- sertation, the student will provide the dissertation to their committee at least two weeks prior to their public defense . The public defense will be comprised of a public one-hour lecture attended by the dissertation committee and faculty and students of the University . The dissertation committee then meets in closed session to examine the candidate and approve the dissertation . Typically, the meeting immediately follows the public lecture . The committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objections of a single committee member . However, if two or more committee members disap - prove of either the written dissertation or its oral defense, then the dissertation is not approved . The awarding of the PhD degree requires the demonstration of a capability for independent research and a contribution to scientific knowl- edge . Similar to the qualifying examination, all members of the committee or appropriate substitutes must be present at the dissertation defense either in person, on the phone, or using electronic media . Since a scientific peer-reviewed first-authored research article is required for the degree, the dissertation is not considered complete until the publication of at least one peer-reviewed first authored publication . If publication is pending, the Committee may approve the dissertation, but the Graduate College will not sign the Degree Approval form until the paper is accepted or published as verified by appearance in the U .S . National Library of Medicine . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Tuition Scholarship and Stipend Acceptance into the doctoral program is limited by the availability of stipends . Accepted doctoral students receive a competitive University supported stipend and tuition scholarship, are supported by a faculty member, or have sti- pends from external sources . University funded stipends are awarded to US residents . The stipend and tuition scholar - ship are renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress towards the degree . Outside employ - ment is not acceptable without prior Graduate College approval as it interferes with the time and effort necessary to complete the program .

Based on this rotation, the student will identify an area of interest and submit the name of a potential adviser to the Academic Standards Committee for approval . Master's Thesis Research Committee After the student selects a research adviser and begins to collect preliminary data, the student and adviser will select a thesis committee . The research adviser must hold a faculty appointment in the Graduate College . This committee will advise the student and evaluate their proposal and thesis documents . The committee will consist of the adviser and two additional Graduate College faculty members . Committee members should be familiar with either the research area or crucial technical aspects of the student's project . Committee members are intended to be a resource for the student and their adviser to enhance didactic and technical knowledge towards the completion of the student's project . The program director (or designated representative) will serve as an ex-officio non-signing member of the thesis committee to oversee the procedural aspects of the commit - tee meetings and student progression through the program . The thesis committee will strive for consensus in all its actions; however, a majority vote of the committee's mem- bership is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the thesis, in which case only one member may disagree with the final decision . The first committee meeting should take place within six months of its selection and approval .Rush University Course Descriptions 288 289 2022-2023 2022-2023 Rush University Catalog Rush University CatalogRush University Course Descriptions ANA - 7EI Basic Science Individualized Elective Students may receive credit for an individually arranged elective with a Rush faculty member .
