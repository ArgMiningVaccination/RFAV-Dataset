Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can get pregnant, your doctor may do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before starting this medicine. Women should use an effective form of birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Men should use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 1 year for Droxia\u00ae and Hydrea\u00ae and at least 6 months for Siklos\u00ae after the last dose to prevent pregnancy in a sexual partner. If a pregnancy occurs while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away. Hydroxyurea can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood which increases the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding: - If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination. - Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin. - Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done. - Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime. - Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters. - Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur. Check with your doctor right away if you have back, leg, or stomach pains, bleeding gums, chills, dark urine, difficulty breathing, fever, general body swelling, headache, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, nosebleeds, pale skin, sore throat, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellowing of the eyes or skin. These may be symptoms of a blood problem called hemolytic anemia. Using this medicine for a long time may increase your risk of developing leukemia (cancer of the blood) or skin cancer. Use a sunscreen and protective clothing to protect your skin. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk. If you had radiation treatment in the past, Hydrea\u00ae may cause your skin to become very red when you have radiation again. Tell your doctor right away if you have darkening or reddening of the skin. While you are being treated with hydroxyurea, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Live virus vaccinations (eg, nasal flu virus vaccine) should not be given while you are using hydroxyurea. This medicine may increase your risk of having lung or breathing problems (eg, interstitial lung disease). Check with your doctor right away if you develop a fever, cough, or trouble breathing while using this medicine. Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine several days before you have medical tests. Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children. Some men who use this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children). Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
