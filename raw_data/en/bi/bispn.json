Tai Ji 'Tai Chi' is a centuries-old Chinese martial art that descends from qigong, an ancient Chinese discipline that has its roots in traditional Chinese medicine. Its history dates back as far as 2,500 years. Tai chi has evolved into a graceful form of exercise that can be used for stress reduction and a variety of other health conditions. It is meditation in motion, low impact and puts minimal stress on muscles and joints, making it generally safe for all ages and fitness levels. As in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tai Chi helps the body's Qi to flow in balance. When the flow of Qi is smooth and balanced, good health is achieved and our body can be free of disease. Tai Chi Moving For Better Balance In collaboration with UC San Diego Center for Integrative Medicine and California Department of Public Health, Sidnee Chong is trained and endorsed to teach Tai Chi Moving For Better Balance (TCMBB). Developed by Dr. Fuzhong Li of the Oregon Research Institute, it is one of the 3 fall prevention programs endorsed by Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Qi Qong 'Chi Kung' means cultivating energy. It is a system practiced for health maintenance, healing and to increase vitality. One of the more important long-term effects is that Qigong reestablishes the body-mind-soul connection. There are various styles but all involve a standing or moving posture, breathing techniques, and mental focus. Some practices increase the Qi and others circulate it. Other use includes to cleanse and heal the body. In our case, Qi Qong is practice to store and emit Qi to help heal others. Consistent practice of Qigong can help one to regain a youthful vitality, maintain health well into old age and helps speed recovery from illness. Yoga There are many forms and numerous benefits of practicing yoga. Sidnee Chong is a certified 200-hr yoga teacher and has been practicing for over 20 years.
