COVID-19 is a strain of coronavirus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Can I still breastfeed if I have COVID-19? If you have been diagnosed with or are suspected of having COVID-19 you and your baby can be supported to remain together while continuing to breastfeed or supply expressed breastmilk for your baby. Breastfeeding helps protect babies from a variety of illnesses and importantly keeps mothers and babies together. This is because breastmilk contains antibodies and other immune protective factors. If you have stopped breastfeeding there is help available to restart, speak with a [breastfeeding counsellor](/breastfeeding-helpline) for support. What if I am too unwell to breastfeed? If you are too unwell to breastfeed your baby, another option is to express regularly so that your baby keeps receiving your breastmilk and so is less likely to become unwell. Before expressing, it is important to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. If using a breast pump, it is important to ensure [proper cleaning](/resources/cleaning-expressing-equipment) is followed. Will my supply reduce if I have COVID-19? Some mothers notice a drop in their supply when they are unwell. If this happens to you, you can discuss it with a [breastfeeding counsellor](/breastfeeding-helpline). How can I reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others? Even if you don't have symptoms of COVID-19, there are things we can all do in order to minimise the chances of spreading COVID-19. For example, it is important to: - Wash your hands often using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. - Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately throwing away any used tissues. - Avoid close contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms. - See a doctor if you develop even the mildest of symptoms including a runny nose, cough, fever, sore throat etc. For the latest information about COVID-19 where you live, refer to your state health department website. Can breastfeeding women have the COVID-19 vaccine? Australia's [Department of Health](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-covid-19-vaccination-decision-guide-for-women-who-are-pregnant-breastfeeding-or-planning-pregnancy?fbclid=IwAR0CT2ix6CG3dENzOBPjnJFEc549DuLiKz9TKxKcdYvB7bmm61nB-Xucf3o) has indicated that breastfeeding women can get an approved COVID-19 vaccine and don't need to stop breastfeeding before or after. Each individual breastfeeding woman should consult with their doctor about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1) (WHO) has recommended that breastfeeding women be vaccinated against COVID-19 whenever they are part of a group of people for whom vaccination is recommended. The WHO also recommends that women continue breastfeeding after vaccination. Each individual breastfeeding woman should consult with their doctor about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. What happens when pregnant and breastfeeding women receive COVID-19 vaccines? One published study of outcomes for pregnant, breastfeeding and non-pregnant women who were vaccinated with either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines in the United States found that: - pregnant and breastfeeding women had similar antibody responses to non-pregnant women - all vaccinated women had higher levels of antibodies compared to antibody levels in pregnant women with natural COVID-19 infection - antibodies were found in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. Antibodies found in umbilical cord blood can transfer to the foetus and antibodies in breastmilk can transfer to the baby. These antibodies may protect babies against COVID-19 infection, but these studies have not been done yet.
