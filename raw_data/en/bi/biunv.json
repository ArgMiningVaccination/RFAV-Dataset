Chapter 30 Define and take notes on the following terms and topics: Models for End-of-Life Care oHospice: is a multidisciplinary team approach that focuses on patient care not cures. This approach meshes well with values in nursing. Physicians, nurses, chaplains, and social workers collaborate to navigate the questions, concerns, and decisions faced by those who are dying. The hospice care extends beyond caring for the patient to include caring for the family. Hospice care is often delivered in the patient's home. In addition, there are some freestanding inpatient facilities. Hospice services can also be delivered in nursing homes and even in hospitals. Hospice care both saves money and improves quality of life. oPalliative Care:is patient- and family-centered care that optimizes quality of life anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering.

Why not someone else?\" This phase is particularly difficult for the family and medical personnel to deal with because the anger is often projected unpredictably on to whomever happens to be around. The most important things the angry patient needs are respect, understanding, attention, and time. oBargaining: As the patient attempts to deal with overwhelming feelings of vulnerability and helplessness, they may secretly try to make deals with a higher power to prolong their life. Examples of this include, \"I'll stop smoking if I can just stay alive long enough to attend my daughter's wedding\" or \"If only I had "}
