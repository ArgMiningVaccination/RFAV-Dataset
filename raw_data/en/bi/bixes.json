Let's just find out the truth.\" OK, let's. But first, let's hear the man out. De Niro has an 18-year-old son, Elliot, with autism. His wife believes that Elliot changed immediately after having the MMR jab, which is why - despite reluctantly agreeing to pull it from his Tribeca film festival - De Niro has been promoting a controversial new \"documentary\" on the subject. Vaxxed is directed by Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced British doctor who first drew a link between autism and the combined vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. Wakefield's 1998 study was later found to be fraudulent, and he has been barred from practising medicine in the UK. He now skulks about in America, where his message - don't let the government trick you into poisoning your kids - plays well with both the paranoid libertarian Right and the detoxed, kale-weaving Left. As a result, measles - which in 2000 had been declared \"eliminated\" in the US - is now staging a comeback. In a single outbreak last year - traced back to one infected visitor at Disneyland, California - 183 people contracted the disease, which can cause blindness, miscarriage and even death. Wakefield's lie has become a sort of epidemic in itself: highly infectious, and almost impossible to stamp out. God knows, plenty of scientists have tried: 15 different studies have been conducted since 1998, involving thousands of children, and each found conclusively that the MMR vaccine did not cause autism. But even this is not enough to satisfy the doubters. As De Niro puts it: \"There are many people who say, 'No. I saw my kids change, like, overnight. I saw what happened and I shouldn't have done something and I did.' \" And here I find myself abruptly softened by sympathy. What De Niro is really expressing is guilt. All parents feel it, all of the time . But when disaster strikes, guilt is not just an idle habit: it's a survival mechanism. I have seen how it works at first hand. One of my nephews died of cot death at three months old; another was brain-damaged at birth and is now severely autistic. For my sister, both have been experiences of acute loss. And one way to manage loss is through guilt. Believing that you could have averted catastrophe if only you'd acted differently is an attempt to take back control. It feels less frightening than the truth, which is that sometimes awful things happen to people who've done nothing to deserve it. Death and autism are not, of course, equivalent. These days, indeed, we are encouraged to see disabled children as a blessing - or, at most, a challenge to be met. But the truth is, a diagnosis of autism is almost always accompanied by sadness, fear and regret at what might have been. The MMR theory taps straight into that vein of parental distress. It allows parents to blame both themselves and a malign external force. It provides an explanation - albeit false - for what otherwise seems an unbearably random injustice. This is the cruellest thing about Wakefield's lie: it spreads disease by feeding off grief. "}
