Box 703, Roswell Syndrome . . . and Pseudoskepticism The bread and butter of skeptical investigation is the critical analysis of spe- cific claims. Take some dramatic popular claim and subject it to all the tools of skeptical analysis. Dissect it, examine it, test it. Drill down narrowly and deeply to see if there's any substance. More often than not, the outcome is notably different from what had been claimed. We do that all the time. Sometimes, however, it is good to step back a bit and look at the larger pic- ture. Look for patterns and try to elucidate some general lessons or principles that can be a useful guide to our broader understanding. We also do that a lotin these pages. We have two such articles in this issue: Joe Nickell and James McGaha's \"The Trouble with Pseudo -skepticism.\" Nickell is a master of investigating specific claims, but here he teams with astronomer and retired Air Force pilot McGaha to take a broader look at theprototypical \"crashed saucer\" claim of our time, the notorious Roswell incident,to show how this and other prominent UFO myths develop. Roswell has nowbeen thoroughly debunked to the satisfaction of most critical-minded people, but it is still believed and beloved by UFO enthusiasts, filmmakers, local touristbureaus, and mythmakers everywhere. Looking at what happened at Roswell, Nickell and McGaha (very usefully, I think) identify a process they call the \"Roswellian Syndrome.\" Something triggers a UFO report (often something real, if not as dramatic as perceived), then it isdebunked, then it goes underground. We think it's forgotten, but it isn't. Thenbegins an intricate mythmaking process, and the (now much more elaborate)story reemerges as a conspiracy tale with more mythologizing and growing mediahype. (From my editorial perch here in Albuquerque, I witnessed this process unfold over the past third of a century with Roswell.) Nickell and McGaha takeus through this process, briefly describing the original incident, the original de- bunking, the story's submergence, the subsequent mythologizing, and then thetale's reemergence with the aid of mystery-mongering book authors and an oftennearly out-of-control media bandwagon effect. The Roswellian Syndrome can be seen playing out again and again in other key UFO cases. Nickell and McGaha apply it to the Flatwoods, Kecksburg,and Rendlesham Forest cases, also favorites of UFO enthusiasts. The processes of mythmaking, folkore, and fakelore are all readily apparent. They suggest that they have identified a genuine pattern, and they hope by doing so to promote more critical thinking regarding these and other sensationalized cases. In his article, Torcello, a bioethicist and philosopher at Rochester Institute of Technology, takes a philosophical look at both scientific and unscientific thinking. He notes that skeptical rigor is inherent in good science, and he reap- plies an older term, pseudoskepticism , tothe rejection of assertions already firmly established through the rigorous scientific process; nonexperts make a show of openly contradicting well-established scientific conclusions. Pseudoskepti- cism describes much of what we see in public discourse about some scientific matters\u2014from modern medicine to climate change\u2014that certain groups find objectionable. Identifying it as such is a start in distinguishing the real science from the bogus. \u2014K ENDRICK FRAZIERMay June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:00 AM Page 4Hot Dispute on Healing Claims: 'Persecution' That Isn't HAYLEY STEVENS Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 5I first saw the Healing on the Streets (HOTS) team on my way to a meeting through the city center of Bath in Som- erset, United Kingdom. I'd never en-countered the group before, and at firstI thought they might be psychic healers.Out of curiosity, I took one of theleaflets that were on display in a holder nearby. It's a habit. Ever since battling alife-threatening illness in my teens, I'vebeen very aware of people making un-substantiated claims about treating andhealing health conditions. I've been thevulnerable person who was temptedinto such treatments. I pick up leaflets, take business cards, and cut adverts out of magazines and newspapers on a reg- ular basis if I think the claims being made are spurious. It turns out it wasn't a group of psy- chic healers but Christians from localchurches who wanted to pray for thehealing of strangers on the street. Their intentions seemed good, but it was the wording on the leaflet that set alarmbells ringing. The group claimed thathealing triggered by prayer could cureconditions from multiple sclerosis, ad-diction, and cancer to asthma, arthritis,and paralysis. My gut reaction was that I should submit a complaint to the Ad- vertising Standards Author ity (ASA),an independent advertising regulatorybody in the United King dom, to see ifthey agreed that the ad was in breach ofCommittee of Adver tising Practice(CAP) codes. The ASA upheld my complaint and also expressed strong concern that the ads might discourage people from seek- ing essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. As a result, the ASA summa- rized, \"The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told HOTS not to make claims which stated or im- plied that, by receiving prayer from their volunteers, people could be healed of medical conditions. We also told them not to refer in their ads to medical con-ditions for which medical supervision should be sought.\" Healing on the Streets responded by claiming that they were being perse- cuted \"by a group generally opposed toChristianity.\" They also claimed that theASA's ruling was telling them to recant their faith. This wasn't the case, and thisclaim made me decide to come forward and explain in a post on my personal blog that I was the complainant and that I didn't make the complaint be- cause they were Christian but becauseof the specific claims they were making. The Bath Chronicle , whose editor read my blog post and thought it was newsworthy, was the first to publish thestory, which was then picked up by a news syndicate. The first I knew of thiswas when a local journalist told me thatit was likely the story was going to \"go national\" and that I might \"end up in the Daily Mail as the bad guy in this.\" He was right. I did end up as the bad guy: I became \"atheist Hayley Stevens\"who used ASA as a weapon to persecute and censor Christians. I ended up on the local news twice, defending my complaint to the ASA and explaining that I wasn't persecuting anybody but was simply challengingclaims made about specific illnesses that didn't appear to be evidence based. There were polarizing reactions to the story. Many people who didn't agree with the outcome of the ASA com- plaint shouted about religious freedomand censorship. However, the protests against the ASA adjudication seemed to miss the point. The ruling had nothing to do with religion but was actually about specific medical claims. Nobody should be exempt from being required[ NEWS ANDCOMMENT Ever since battling a life-threatening illness in my teens, I've been very aware of people making unsubstantiated claims about treating and healing health conditions. The Healing on the Streets group claims to be able to heal complaints ranging from arthritis to cancer through the \"power\" of prayer.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:01 AM Page 56Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerAccording to a story in the Suntabloid newspaper, a video surfaced that seems to show a live woolly mammoth\u2014an animal that scientists say has been extinct for about four millennia. The \"jaw-dropping\"footage, which shows a dark, blurry crea- ture crossing a river, was allegedly \"caught by a government-em ployed engineer lastsummer in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug region of Siberia.\" The video was an Internet sensation and made headlines around the world in early February 2012. Some Bigfoot believ- ers and Loch Ness monster lovers mur- mured their tentative ap proval, hoping it proved that large unknown (or assumed extinct) animals still exist in Earth's remote wilds. Discussions popped up all over the web, including on the Doubtful News blog and the Facebook page of the MonsterTalk podcast. While most people didn't neces- sarily believe that the blurry figure in the video was really a woolly mammoth asclaimed, viewers were sharply divided about what, exactly, it was. Some suspectedthe video was an outright hoax\u2014a com- puter-generated elephant or mammoth digitally inserted into a real river scene.Many others, however, were convincedthat the animal was real: not a mammothbut instead a bear with a large fish in its mouth crossing a stream. I investigated the video at the request of LiveScience.com and noted several sus- picious aspects, including its brevity and the fact that the man who posted thepiece, a paranormal enthusiast named Michael Cohen, has been involved withseveral other videos of questionable au- thenticity (if not outright hoaxes). I also consulted Hollywood visual effects artist Derek Serra, who concluded among other things that the video image \"appears to have been intentionally blurred.\" Several days after I posted my analysis of the video, I got an email from a mannamed Ludovic Petho, who directed me toCSI Helps Expose Woolly Mammoth Video Hoax Benjamin Radfordto provide evidence to back up their claims, religion-based or not. As I replied to one of my harsher online critics, it is fine to pray for the ill to recover if that is how you choose tocope; just don't tell strangers on the street their cancer might be healed that way. That steps over a line, and I refuse to stay quiet about it. After one of my appearances on the local news, somebody made a complaint to my employers in what I be lieve was a malicious attempt to terminate my employment. All that I know is that they were from the local church ward and asked my employerswhat they were doing \"employing someone like that.\" My boss repri- manded me that day for being \"irre- sponsible,\" a charge I believe is unfair, but luckily I didn't lose my job andwasn't officially disciplined in any way. I was advised by my employer not to write anything more about the ASA complaint and told not to do any more media appearances. However, I'm writing about my experience here because fighting for freedom of ex-pression is a more important job. The day after one of my local news appearances, a stranger recognized me in a shop because of the coat I had been wearing. He told me how he and his wife had been desperate for an an- swer before she died of lung cancer a few years ago. He said, \"It's good that we have people like you who stand up for those who can't stand up for them- selves.\" Those words will stay with me for a long time. I think my story demonstrates one very important thing: standingup for what we know is right and speaking out against what we know is wrong can result in a tangible achievement. One person can make a difference; all you have to do is act.Be that person. Make that difference. Hayley Stevens is a skeptical podcaster, writer, and public speaker. She is the founder of Project Barnum, an educational resource about psychic trickery, and also hosts the popular Righteous Indignation podcast. Being a reformed ghost hunter, she can often be found trying to educate people about the pseudoscience involved in the majority of ghost and monster research. Doubtful News Blog Launched Benjamin Radford The blog Doubtful News, whose slogan is \"Paranormal and pseudoscience news ... because people really believe this stuff, \" was recently launched. The Doubtful News feed provides links to original sources of Internet news stories about a wide variety of topics related to science, pseudoscience, and skepti-cism, including anti-vaccination, astrol- ogy, cryptozoology, UFOs, mass hysteria, ghosts, crop circles, hoaxes, psychics, superstition, and much more. Posts areprimarily written with a skeptical bent, providing brief commentary and some background while encouraging readersto seek out the source and inquire for themselves. Sharon Hill, comanager of the blog with Torkel \u00d8deg\u00e5rd, explained:The blog came about because there was no one-stop source of breaking news of interest to critical thinkers that was not primarily straight sci- ence offerings or opinions. Doubtful News delivers the fringe news that may not get attention right away. The theme woven through the stories is that critical thinking is essential for understanding what is going on in the world. The format, with multiple up- dates daily, allows for stories to be posted days ahead of their appear- ance in larger outlets, the skeptical literature and even before appear- ance in blogs and podcasts.

Gray, a professor of natural history at Har- vard for thirty-one years, met Darwin in 1851 and later boldly supported Darwinism in America against objections of religious lead- ers and others. Gray served as president of the American Association for the Ad vance - ment of Science from 1863 to 1873. Chemist Melvin Calvin, physicist Maria Goeppert Mayer, and biochemist Severo Ochoa are the other three scientists hon- ored on the 2011 \"Forever\" first-class stamps. Each stamp shows a collage fea-turing a photograph and a signature of the scientist along with equations, diagrams, or letters associated with his or her research. \"With these stamps,\" said a Postal Service statement, \"the Postal Service honors four Americans who, while dedicating their lives tounderstanding the fundamental pro cesses of nature, made extraordinary contributions to the advancement of science.\" The previous American Scientists issuances (four each)were in 2008 (SI, July/August 2008) and 2005 (July/August 2005). Here are the 2011 stamps and the short bios printed on the reverse side of sheets of twenty. Melvin Calvin (1911-1997) was the first scientist to trace in detail the process of photosynthesis and conducted pioneering research on using plants as an alternative energy source. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1961. Asa Gray (1810-1888), one of the first professional botanists in the United States, advanced the specialized field of plant geography and became the principal American advocate of evolutionary theory in the mid-nineteenth century. Maria Goeppert Mayer (1906-1972) developed a theoretical model that helped explain the structure of the atomic nucleus; for this work she became the only woman other than Marie Curie to win a Nobel Prize in Physics. Severo Ochoa (1905-1993), a biochemist, was the first scientist to synthesize ribonucleic acid (RNA) and com- peted in the race to decipher the genetic code. Ochoa won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959. footage he filmed at the Kitoy River in Siberia's Sayan Moun tains in the sum- mer of 2011. Petho filmed the riverscene during a ten-day solo hike in the mountains as part of a video projectabout his grandfather's escape from a Siberian POW camp in 1915. The footage was identical to the woolly mammoth video with one glaring dif-ference: \"I don't recall seeing a mam- moth; there were bears, deer, and sable,\" he told me, \"but no woolly mammoths.

The program, sponsored by the Main Street Baptist Church, consisted of a series of thirteen one-hour presentations delivered everyother Sunday morning. The curriculum was developed by a fundamentalist Chris tian ministry located in California (with an Austin chapter) called \"Reasonsto Believe\" (RTB). A Christian apolo- gist trained to deliver the RTB curricu-lum presented the course, and the syllabus was composed of chapter-by- chapter critiques of the arguments andevidence summarized in prominent evo- lutionary biologist Richard Dawkins'sbook The Greatest Show on Earth. There are many problems with the assumptions, rationale, and logic of the RTB curriculum. Supernaturalism and Circularity RTB promulgates a comprehensive agen - da of Christian apologetics that rejects all other belief systems and sacred texts. The RTB theology is premised on two primary faith-based doctrines consid- ered true beyond all doubt and immune from all criticism: the God of the Bible is the only authentic deity, and the Bible is his perfect word.It follows that RTB embraces super- naturalism as a valid mode of explana- tion of observed phenomena. Specific - ally, the Bible \"describes reality beyond the natural world,\" and it possesses \"su- pernatural accuracy.\" In plain language, God is responsible for everything. This position contradicts that of the entire scientific community, which acceptsonly natural causal mechanisms. RTB cannot be regarded as a legiti- mate scholarly endeavor, because it be- gins by asserting that the truth is known before any investigation is evercarried out. RTB does not propose hy- potheses derived from the Genesis cre- ation stories that can be tested and which are subject to empirical dis - confirm ation. The divine creation ex- planation cannot be refuted because itis assumed to be true a priori as an ar- ticle of faith\u2014a textbook example of circular reasoning. Atheism and Materialism The brochure that announced the RTB program and briefly described some features of the curriculum suggested an association between evolution and thephilosophy of atheism. Specifically, a reference to \"neo-Darwinian evolution as espoused by famed atheist Richard Dawkins\" and the assertion that \"Richard Dawkins is the face of atheism today\" imply this connection, which is repeatedthroughout the program. In fact, evolu- tion is not an atheistic doctrine. The strongest argument against this unwarranted insinuation is that the vast majority of people who endorse evolu- tion are religious believers. They are called \"theistic evolutionists,\" de vout Christians\u2014Catholics, Method - ists, Episcopalians, Lutherans\u2014but per- sons of other faiths as well who acceptthe scientific validity of evolution and re- gard the Genesis stories as possessingonly poetic or metaphoric truth. A related epithet creationist oppo- nents invoke to stigmatize evolution is that it is \"materialistic,\" meaning that spiritual factors are excluded from con-sideration. All scholarly disciplines arepredicated on the assumption of philo- sophical naturalism, which holds that nonnatural explanations are beyond the realm of empirical investigation. Inerrancy and Faith The foundational postulate of RTB theology is that the Bible is God's word and is therefore without error. Re-phrased, the Bible is absolutely accurate and truthful in every statement. This as-sumption is rejected by most Christian and Jewish denominations. The Bible contains hundreds of erro- neous assertions and contradictory state-ments, which have been catalogued in numerous books. Further more, the well- 8Volume 36 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer8Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer[SPECIAL REPORT A Feeble Challenge to Evolution from 'Reasons to Believe' Biblical creationism purports to be a legitimate alternative to evolution. This report outlines numerous problems with one Christian ministry's creationism curriculum.

Also, the inerrantists cannot agree among themselves, with young-Earth advocates promoting a lit- eral six-day creation and old-Earth pro-ponents conforming their beliefs to the geological time scale. The doctrine of inerrancy is accepted by adherents on the basis of faith, whichentails a commitment or allegiance that reflects personal conviction alone. Be - cause faith operates in the absence of ev- idence, or may even contradict evidence, it is by definition not a rational process. Hence, RTB's self-descriptors, \"scientific,\" \"rational,\" \"educated,\" and \"thought ful,\" arehardly warranted. Strategies The RTB program is predicated on the fallacies of false equivalence and argu- ing from ignorance. The curriculum'scriticisms of evolution are organized around the thirteen chapters in Daw - kins's book. The underlying strategy as- sumes that identifying problems with evolution will enhance the case for bib- lical creationism. This premise violates two basic logical principles. First, evolution and biblical cre- ationism do not constitute \"two sides of a debate.\" Evolution is a scientific fact that is supported by a monumental cor- pus of evidence generated by fifty dis- ciplinary specialties, whereas Genesis creationism consists of two stories that total about 1,400 words and wereadapted from two distinct Sumerian- Babylonian creation myths. Counter- poising evolution against creationism entails a false equivalence, specificallythat of equating and comparing evi- dence-based science with Bible-based mythology. To suggest that creationism is a legitimate theory is a woeful misuse of language. Second, the RTB presumption thatspecifying difficulties in some lines of evidence will weaken the multidiscipli- nary argument for evolution andthereby establish support for Genesis creationism commits the fallacy of ar- guing from ignorance. This tacticwould be valid only if there were just two acknowledged alternative explana- tions, only one of which was true. Nei- ther of these requirements of alternative and disjunctive syllogisms is satisfied by the creationists. Creationist Confusion Biblical creationism is one of many re- ligious creation myths that are sincerely believed by their adherents, including those from which the two Genesis sto- ries were derived. Further more, the biblical creationists do not even agreeamong themselves, arguing for two very different time translations that differ by a factor or multiple of almost one mil- lion.

Moreover, the stipulation that only one of the two alternative explanations can be true is violated by the position adopted by those Christians and Jews who are labeled theistic or God-di- rected evolutionists. These believers subscribe to the view that God imple- mented evolution as the process by which all life-forms developed overtime, including humankind. Clearly, this position accepts evolution as thor- oughly compatible with the Bible, find-ing different truths in each. By devoting their energies to an on- going attack on evolution, the propo-nents of biblical creationism also deflect attention from the major defect in theirunrelenting mission of political advo-cacy. This is of course the complete lack of empirical evidence supporting their belief in the literal truth of the Genesiscreation stories. More over, RTB nowunbelievably asserts that \"the appear-ance of design shifts the burden ofproof to evolutionists.\" How ludicrousgiven that evolutionists have generatedall of the evidence while creationistshave not presented one iota of experi-mental evidence in support of their folktales. Human Evolution The critical issue for creationists is their belief that God created man and woman as adults 100,000 years ago ex- actly as described in the Bible. They re- ject the overwhelming evidence that modern humans evolved from apelike ancestors over a span of several million years. Creationists deny that our closestliving cousins are chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. What explanation of human origins is favored by Bible creationists? They invoke their doctrine of \"special cre- ation\" of humans, presented in threebrief formulations in the two Genesis creation stories: 1. God created man and womanin his own image (Gen. 1:27). 2. God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed life into him (Gen. 2:7). 3. God removed a rib from the man and made a woman (Gen. 2:21-22). Do these declarations constitute a \"rational creationist belief\"? Have the RTB scholars provided the \"irrefut able, empirical, evidence\" that they demand of evolution proponents to support their Godly image/dust of the ground/woman from man's rib \"theory\" of human ori- gins? No, they have not done so. In their view they don't have to conduct re- search because their postulation of scriptural inerrancy guarantees that theGenesis verses are historically and bio- logically accurate. Of course, we know that humans are not exempt from thelaws of nature, regardless of what the Bible says. Undisclosed Information The RTB program is a carefully selected presentation of information and argu- ments designed to dispute the evidence supporting human evolution out of the erroneous belief that the case for Gene-sis creationism will be therefore en- hanced. Creationists have battled to have their views included in public school sci- ence classrooms for the past forty yearswith virtually despite refor- mulations as \"scientific creationism\" and\"intelligent design.\" Three factual conclusions not ac- knowledged by RTB put the creationist endeavor in concrete perspective. First, every scientific organization in theworld rejects creationist claims. Second, mainstream Christian and Jewish de- nominations reject biblical inerrancyand endorse human evolution. Third,eight U.S. Supreme Court, Federal Ap- peals Court, and Federal Court deci- sions have ruled that creationism can- not be taught in public school science classes because it is a religious doctrine. Finally, the relentless effort of bib - lical creationism advocates to ad duce reasons and assemble arguments to but- tress their views demonstrates that they do not possess authentic faith. True faith does not require any justification, because faith is the unquestioning jus- tification for all doctrinal beliefs. Ifthere were reasons or evidence that sup- ported Genesis creationism, then faith would not be necessary because cre-ationism would be a valid scientific the-ory. The creationists' dogged search for reasons to believe betrays their claimsof faith. n Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 11SPECIAL REPORT] Brian Bolton is a retired psy- chologist living in George- town, Texas.

Was it a real encounter or a hoax? Or is that a false dichotomy? JOE NICKELL Charles Hickson, the chief claim - ant in the Pascagoula, Miss issippi, UFO abduction case, died of a heart attack on September 9, 2011, at the age of eighty. Until his death he main- tained the truth of his alien en counter\u2014 part of the UFO \"flap\" of 1973 (Peebles 1995, 241-45). It has remained (after theBetty and Barney Hill case of 1961) \"thesecond most famous UFO-abductioncase in history,\" according to UFO his- torian Jerome Clark (1998, 714). Very Close Encounter Hickson, then forty-two, was fishing from an old pier on the Pascagoula River with a friend, nineteen-year-oldCalvin Parker Jr., on the night of Octo - ber 11, 1973. Hickson claimed they heard a \"zipping\" sound and en coun - tered a glowing object\u2014an elongated UFO\u2014hovering above the ground. Three robotlike aliens exited from the craft; although they were gray hu- manoids just over five feet tall, they were otherwise of a type not reported before or since (Nickell 2011): each en- tity lacked a neck, exhibited only slits for eyes and mouth, had a nose and ears that were sharply pointed protrusions,and possessed clawed hands. The legs were joined, pedestal-like, and the en- tity glided (see Figure 1). The two men claimed they were taken aboard the spacecraft, where they were examined, after which they were returned to their fishing site. Un nerved, they sat in a car to regain their compo- sure (with Hickson, at least, drinking whiskey), then reported their experi- ence to the sheriff. Although the UFO reported by the men had apparently not been seen by people on the heavily traveled nearby highway (Randle 2001), there had beenother UFO sightings in the area, includ-ing on the night in question. The UFOswere variously described\u2014some saw a helicopter-like object; one person re - ported a supposed \"experiment\" from an Air Force base; and so on (Clark 1998, 715; Blum with Blum 1974, 14-19). Controversy The pair's veracity was accepted by UFO believers J. Allen Hynek of theCenter for UFO Studies (CUFOS) and James Harder of the Aerial Phe nomena Research Organization (APRO), both of whom rushed to interview the \"ab-ductees.\" Harder tried unsuccessfully to hypnotize the men (Clark 1998, 717) but did conclude they had experienced \"an extraterrestrial phenomena [ sic].\" 1 Hynek believed the pair had at least had \"a very real, frightening experience\" (Blum with Blum 1974, 24-25). The sheriff's de partment also felt the men were telling the truth, and Hickson re-quested and passed a lie-detector test arranged by the agent with whom the men had signed a contract to promote their story. Parker suffered a breakdown and was briefly hospitalized (Clark 1998, 714-17). The men's fantastic report drew much skepticism. Famed UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass noted discrepancies in Hickson's account (for instance, oncereferring to the creatures as having a \"hole\" for a mouth but later calling it a \"slit\"). Klass also pointed out that the lie-detector test was conducted by an\"inexperienced\" polygraph operator and that Hickson refused to take another administered by an expert police exam- iner. Based on other evidence\u2014includ- ing the fact that Hick son had once been fired for improperly obtaining money from employees under his su-May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:01 12Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 concluded was a hoax ([1974] 1976, 347-69; 1989, 18-19). A Solution So which was it: a genuine alien abduc- tion or a hoax? Or is that a false di- chotomy? In reviewing the case, I thought there might be another possi-bility: the two men, who might have been drinking before the incident (as Hickson admitted he was after), might have dozed off. Hickson could then have entered a hypnagogic (\"waking dream\") state, a trancelike condition be- tween waking and sleeping in whichsome people experience hallucinations, often with bizarre imagery, includingstrange beings (aliens, ghosts, etc.). This state may be accompanied by what is called \"sleep paralysis\" (the body's in-ability to move due to still being in the sleep mode). In fact, Hickson not only reported the bizarre imagery but alsosaid that the aliens \"paralyzed\" him be- fore carrying him aboard the UFO in what sounds like a hypnagogic fantasy. The imagery might even have been triggered by Hickson actually sighting something\u2014almost anything\u2014that,while he was in the waking-dream state, appeared to be a \"UFO.\" During a recorded interview with Sheriff Fred Diamond (Blum with Blum 1974, 30-36), Hickson described the UFO as \"ablue light,\" adding: a bit.\" Heemphasized it saying, \"And you think you dreamin' about some- thing like that, you know\" (original emphasis). Hickson also reported that it made \"a little buzzin' sound\u2014 nnnnn - nnnnn, nnnnnnnnn\" (Blum with Blum 1974, 31). Bright lights and odd noises can also be part of the waking-dream The men's fantastic report drew much skepticism. Famed UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass noted discrepancies in Hickson's account (for instance, once referring to the creaturesas having a \"hole\" for a mouth but later calling it a \"slit\"). Figure 1.

Hickson stated, \"I just floated\u2014felt no sensation,no pain\" (Blum with Blum 1974, 32). These phenomena, coupled with the paralysis and fantastic imagery, corrob-orate the diagnosis of a hypnagogic ex-perience. Of additional corroborative value are other factors, including Hickson's de-scription of the aliens as speaking insidehis head (Clark 1998, 715), be cause afeature of hypnagogia is the sense ofperceiving \"with whole consciousness.\"This explains the bright lights and clar- ity of his experiences, since hypnagogic visions often seem particularly illumi- nated, vivid, and de tailed (Mavromatis1987, 14-52, 148). But if Hickson had a hypnagogic ex- perience, what about Parker? Actu ally,he need not have been in such a statehimself because, as he told officers, hehad passed outat the beginning of the incident and failed to regain conscious- ness until it was over (United Press In-ternational 1973). Later he \"remem- bered\" bits and pieces of the alleged encounter. This would be consistent with an example of folie \u00e0 deux(a French expression, the \"folly of two\") in which a percipient convinces another of some alleged occurrence (as by the power of suggestion, the force of a dominant personality, or the like) or the other person simply acquiesces for whatever reason. (Young Parker's posi-tion was vulnerable: he had recently joined the shipyard where Hickson worked and was residing with the Hick sons.) It would have been signifi- cant if Parker had himself been in a hypnagogic state, since \"suggestibility ishigh during this state\" (Goldenson 1970, I: 574). Interestingly, when thetwo men were left alone in a room at the sheriff's office, where they were se- cretly tape recorded (Clark 1998, 716), they did not make incriminating state-ments as they might have if perpetrat- ing a hoax but acted more like peoplecomparing notes to see if they were in agreement with each other. Still, some of Hickson's behavior is questionable. For example, he keptadding to his story. He claimed on a tel-evision show a month later that the in-terior lights of the UFO had been so in- tense as to cause eye injury lasting for three days, although an extensive hospi- tal examination the day after the inci- dent had shown no such eye damage (Klass 1974, 349-50). But this is a famil- iar story: even accounts of the truest oc-currences gain distortions and embell-ishments over time, so why shouldHickson's story be any different? UFOl-ogist Kevin D. Randle (2001) yond that.\"Specifically, he says, \"These changesseemed to be in response to criticisms and appeared to be an attempt to smooth out rough spots in the story.\" But to methat just signals Hickson's defensivenessbrought on by people ridiculing him\u2014not proof of initial hoaxing. When all the facts are weighed, the preponderance of evidence appears not only to favor the hypothesis involving the hypnagogic state but to provide corroboration as well. The realization may not benefit the late Charles Hick- son, but it could help others who hear of supposed alien abductions to rest in peace. n Acknowledgments I am grateful to Major James McGaha (USAF retired) and CFI Libraries Director Tim Binga for help with this article.

Curran of St. Louis, be - gan in 1913 to receive poems and novels, via Ouija board, from a seventeenth-century Puritan English woman named \"Patience Worth.\" Patience had suppos- edly been born in England in 1649 and immigrated to America, where she wasslain by Indians at the age of forty-five,although no historical record has everbeen found for her. Some 216 years later, \"Patience\" made her debut one July evening while Curran and a friend, who was a writer, were playing with a Ouija board. With their fingers pressing on the planchette, it began to spell out a strange message: Many moons ago I lived. Again I come \u2014 Patience Worth my name \u2014 The message unleashed a flow of Pa- tience Worth writings that eventuallyfilled whole volumes: The Sorry Tale , Hope Trueblood , and The Pot Upon the Wheelwere followed soon by Light from Beyondand Telka. By 1918, the phan- tom writer had her own Patience Worth Magazine, which lasted ten issues (Christopher 1970, 128-30). Historical Fiction Curran eventually abandoned the cum- bersome Ouija board, discovering that Patience Worth could guide her fingers while she typed and could speak through Curran's voice while a friend took dictation \"at a tremendous speed\"(Cavendish 1974). \"Go Ye to the lighted hall to search for learning?\" asked Pa-tience in a typical communication. \"Nay, 'tis a piddle, not a stream, ye search. Mayhap thou sendest thy men for bar- leycorn. 'Twould then surprise thee should the asses eat it.\" And so on, in her quaint, facile manner. A New York Times reviewer praised her style: \"Notwithstanding the serious quality and the many pitifulnesses and tragedies ... [there is] much humor of a quaint, demure kind ... [and] the plot is contrived with such skill, deftness, and ingenuity as many a novelist in the flesh might well envy\" (qtd. in Christo- pher 1970, 128). One Elizabethan scholar, a Profes - sor Shelling, was less impressed. As he stated: The language employed is not that of any historical age or period; but, where it is not the current English of the part of the United States in which Mrs. Curran lives, it is a dis- tortion born of superficial acquain- tance with poetry and a species of would-be Scottish dialect ... the borrowing of some dialect words and the clear misuse, misunderstanding and even invention of many oth- ers.... There is an easy facility of phrase almost wholly in our contem- porary idiom and showing nowhere the qualities of the language of Eliz- abeth's or any previous age. (qtd. in Christopher 1970, 129) I concur with this assessment. Moreover, as is now well known, the productions of the Ouija board are ac- tually due to \"the involuntary muscular actions of the players\"\u2014as the effect was described in toy maker Isaac Fuld's ap-plication for a patent on the device. Al- though Fuld added, \"or through someother agency,\" an explanation adopted by Spiritualists and other mystics, the truth can be easily demonstrated (as magician Milbourne Christopher has explained): when the board is out of sight and the alphabet scrambled, only gibberish isspelled out. (Curran rejected such \"con-ditions\" [1920, 399].) Fantasy Proneness Indeed, I find that Pearl Curran ex- hibits several traits consistent with hav- ing a fantasy-prone personality. Such persons are sane and normal but gener- ally enjoy a rich fantasy life, which may include experiencing a previous life-time. \"While they are pretending,\" state[ INVESTIGATIVE FILES J O E N I C K E L L Joe Nickell is CSI's senior research fellow.

A short au- tobiographical sketch penned by Cur- ran reveals her to have been an imagi-native child who played the piano at her uncle's Spiritualist church. Of her sup- posed communication with Patience Worth, she wrote: \"I am not a Spiritu- alist, but am in sympathy with the fur-therance of psychic facts and believe that the pioneers of today are but grop- ing toward fact. I am not a 'medium' inthe common sense. Am deeply inter- ested in the study of psychic phenom- ena, using myself as a study \" (emphasis added, Curran 1926, 15). \"Patience Worth\" seems to have been, according to philosopher Charles E. Cory (1927, 432), Curran's \"other self,\" a form of alter ego. He characterizes the phenomenon as follows (1927, 433-34): I accept the judgment that Patience Worth is a genius of no mean order. And, perhaps, there is in the genius of this writer a concrete illustration of what freedom a mind may achieve when released from the inhibitions that clog and check the normal con-sciousness. She is a dissociated self, and this dissociation has taken place in such a way as to free her from the burdens and concerns of life, from all the claims that split the will and bind the fancy. And perhaps in this fact, and all that it implies, lies the condi- tion of her genius. The division of the self has resulted in a division of labor. To Mrs. Curran falls the care of the needs of the body, and the in- terests of the social life. Their reac- tions and distractions are hers. ... But turn to this dissociated mind and the conditions have changed.The work of adjusting the organism to the environment being left to the other self, the inhibitions which per- ception places upon the imagination are removed. This sets free and un - fettered the mind of Patience Worth. In the realm of the idea she lives, and there she sustains herself without ef-fort. She acknowledges no tie or bond that might take her out of herdream. She is a dreamer that never awakens. And the conditions of this Figure 3.

With her our moments of abstraction, moments that life affords us the luxury of thought and imagi- nation, are prolonged indefinitely. They are, in fact, a fixed condition. In other words, she lives only in a world of thought. And so far she has shown no desire to displace the other self, and alternate with her in the role of action. To do so would result in es- sential modification of her con- sciousness, and put her under inhibi- tions from which she is now free. Although Curran refused to be hyp- notized, and it is said she did not go into a \"trance\" while writing (Prince[1927] 1964, 428, 431), her dissociated mode is clearly similar to what today would be recognized as \"self-hypno- sis\"\u2014a state she entered and left easily.Therefore she probably would havebeen an excellent subject had sheagreed to undergo hypnosis. Interest -ingly, Curran eventually discovered shecould write short stories of her own but emphasized that she could \"feel the dif- ference between the conscious effort of the ordinary manner of writing, asagainst the unconscious manner inwhich the Patient Worth materialcomes to me\" (1920, 403). Smoking Gun But Curran was not just receiving \"dic- tation.\" Like other writers (including me) before and since, she embarked onthe creative process and was carried tothat far-away place in the mind whenceinspiration comes, producing thingsthat often seemed quite mysteriously bestowed\u2014as if from one of those god- desses of art in Greek mythology, the Muses. Curran may have simply per- ceived her muse as a character named Patience Worth. I have researched the matter over the years. In 2010, after speaking to the Ra- tionalist Society of St. Louis on \"Hunt- ing for Ghosts and Spirits,\" I was able to study Pearl Curran's writings at the Mis- souri Historical Society Archives (which very graciously accommodated me on a day they were otherwise closed). For five hours I pored over the Pearl Cur - ran/\"Patience Worth\" papers\u2014numer-ous boxed documents and twenty-nine bound volumes of typescripts (Figure 2).Even though it is known that \"Patience\" could compose on demand (Prince [1927] 1964, 56, 281-300), I found evi- dence that some of the writings were the product of the creative process\u2014show- ing various revisions\u2014rather than, as al- leged, mere dictation from the supposed spirit of the nonexistent \"Patience Worth\" of the seventeenth century. For example, I found two versions of a 1920 poem, \"My Love Is Old.\" In thebound typescript, vol. 12, p. 2302, the last line of the poem reads, \"Who bending whispers forget, forget.\" But there is an earlier loose manuscript of that same page with the typed line originally reading, \"Who bending re- sponds forget, forget\"\u2014but the word respondshas been stricken and the word whisperspenned instead. Several poems had fold marks in the paper, indicating they had been mailed topersons for whom they were written\u2014 one \"For Grace Parrish,\" for in stance.When that poem appeared in the bound typescripts, numerous changes in punc- tuation and line divisions had been made,and stanza divisions had been added.More telling is another poem for Parrish containing some very different text in the typescripts, revised wording, a line added, and changes in punctuation and line di-visions. Quite revealing is a typed page of yel- lowed copy paper with penciled notation (\"3 carbons please\") that is rough ly typedand marked over. A few typed lines have been crossed out (having read, \"How could I know until you came how close God was/How could I comprehend the Cross and all the agony ...\"). There are also numerous penned edits and revisionsin Pearl Curran's handwriting, as well asa note to someone addressed as \"honey\"(presumably a typist) to \"break it up\u2014it will look better I think,\" apparently re- ferring to the line breaks (see Figure 3). 1 I suspect that there were once many more such drafts but that they were subsequently destroyed, replaced by what manuscript experts call \"fair copies\"\u2014that is, neat, final versions as preserved in the bound volumes.Conclusions The weight of the evidence\u2014the lack of historical record for \"Patience Worth,\" the fantasy proneness of Cur - ran (consistent with producing an imaginary \"other self\"), the writings'questionable language, and the evi- dence of the editing and revision process\u2014indicates that Patience was merely a persona of Curran's. I can relate to that: When I visited the archives I was accompanied by anumber of my own personas, including paranormal investigator, historical document examiner, poet, fiction writer, editor, literary critic, forensic linguist, handwriting expert, photographer, and more\u2014all of which played their role in my examination of the manuscripts. The century-old case can now be closed. It is about time. n Acknowledgments I am grateful to the many people who as- sisted with my research, including Kath leen Kelly and Larry Jewell of the Ration alist Society of St. Louis, the generous staff of the Missouri Historical Society Ar chives,CFI Libraries Director Timothy Binga, and my assistant, Ed Beck.

New BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:01 AM Page 17There seems to be an emergent con- sensus in philosophy of science that Freudian psychoanalysis has been degraded to the status of pseudo- science\u2014just as Karl Popper suggestedwhen he starting writing about the \"de-marcation problem,\" the question ofwhat separates science from non-science, at the beginning of the twenti-eth century. (Popper's other example ofpseudoscience was Marxist theorizingabout history.) Indeed, recently news- papers in both England and the UnitedStates commented on the departure ofFrank Cioffi, one of the leading criticsof Freud within philosophy of science. A colleague of mine, Maarten Bou - dry at the University of Ghent (Bel -gium), has recently added an interestingtwist to the status of Freudian psycho-analysis in a paper he cowrote with FilipBuekens that was published in the jour-nal Theoriain 2011. Boudry and Buekens have argued that psychoanaly-sis provides a good model of what sci-ence would be like if social constructivisttheories of knowledge were correct about the nature of science. They then turn around and use this suggestion as an indirect critique of the social con- structivist research program in the soci- ology of science. Social constructivism is the idea that science is, in a strong sense, a social ac- tivity that is \"constructed\" by its mem- ber participants\u2014that is, the scientists. In a weak sense this is obvious: science is indeed a social activity engaged in by a certain type of human being. But in the strong sense this amounts to theclaim, as sociologist Harry Collins in- famously put it, that \"the natural world in no way constrains what is believed to be.\" As another champion of social con- structivism, David Bloor, put it, \"[The sociology of scientific knowledge is] symmetrical in its style of explanation. The same types of cause would explain, say, true and false beliefs.\" In other words, scientific theories are accepted or rejected not because they do or do not match the empirical evidence, butrather for the same underlying socio- logical reasons that have to do with the social structure of science, particularly with the distribution of power within that structure. Social constructivism isn't taken se- riously either by scientists themselves orby philosophers of science, and for good reasons. Boudry and Buekens quote Andr\u00e9 Kukla as pointing out that the field is replete with \"reverse switch -eroos\": \"[You] put forth a strong version of the hypothesis [about how science works], and when it gets into trouble, you retreat to a weaker version, pre- tending that it was the weaker thesis that you had in mind all along.\" But, argue Boudry and Buekens, Freudian psychoanalysis does indeed fitthe description of \"science\" given by social constructivists. The above-mentioned Cioffi, for instance, pointed out that Freud (and his followers and eventual ri- vals) didn't seem to be aware of the fact that he was interpreting evidence refutinghis theory as yet another instance of con- firmation of the theory. For instance, Freud thought that his patients had an(obviously unconscious) desire to see his theories fail, which would naturally ac- count for the patients sometimes behav- ing in ways contrary to what the theory would predict. In essence, Freud was win- ning regardless of the evidence: if the lat- ter confirmed the theory, good; if it didn't, it was the result of his patients' uncon- scious resistance\u2014also \"predicted\" by the theory! This isn't very different from psy- chics who explain the failure of controlled experiments on their alleged abilities by invoking a negative effect on psi \"energy\" caused by the proximity of skeptics.Psychoanalysis and Social Constructivism 18 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer[THINKING ABOUT SCIENCE M A S S I M O P I G L I U C C I Massimo Pigliucci is professor of philosophy at the City University of New York-Lehman College, a fellow of the American Association for the Advance ment of Science, and author of Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk .

Again, this iswhat one typically observes in propo- of and Beuekens' conclusion is that critics of psychoanalysis have ex - posed the fact that the theory is, indeed, a social construction of psychoanalyststhemselves. There are no facts of the matter to be discovered about how theFreudian mental landscape works, because the very idea of a Freudian- type mental landscape is a (extremely flexible) figment of Freud's (and hiscolleagues') imagination. Collins's com- ment about theories being uncon- strained by the natural world\u2014while absurd in the case of actual science\u2014fits psychoanalysis (and any other pseu- doscience) perfectly well. But, one might object, psychoanaly- sis has made progress. For instance, theFreudian concept of penis envy was gradually abandoned during the second half of the twentieth century, to be re placed by new concepts like \"breastenvy\" and \"vagina envy\" (I kid you not) in a number of psychoanalytical schools. As Boudry and Buekens point out, however, this change is not at all anal- ogous to, say, the transition from New-tonian to relativistic physics. It wasn't the result of new empirical discoveries or theoretical insights but more obvi- ously the outcome of changed cultural sensibilities. Ironically, some psychoanalysts have themselves embraced social construc-tivism, perhaps (unconsciously?) aware that the sociological doctrine, if extended to real science, would provide a perfect shield for the respectability of their spec- ulations (hey, scientists do it too!). In the end, constructivist sociologists of sciencewould do much better in aiming theirtools at pseudoscience, all the while rec- ognizing that science is a very different kind of beast, one for which the natural world does a lot of the \"constraining.\" n May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:01 AM Page 1920 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer1) The Unsinkable Ship. One of the most often repeated claims is that the White Star Line, owner of the ship, had claimed that the Titanicwas unsinkable. In truth, the company never made thatclaim; however, at the time of the Titanic's fitting out, there was a special edition of The Shipbuilder magazine in which the ship was described as \"practically unsink-able\" due to its double bottom and sixteen watertight compartments. 2) A Predictable Disaster. Fourteen years before the Titanic disaster, the novel Futility by Morgan Robertson described the sinking of a gigantic ship called the Titan after it hit an iceberg in the Atlantic in the month of April. A case of prophecy? Not quite. Martin Gardner, in his The Wreck of the Titanic Foretold?, explains that if you were a sea writer like Robertson and wanted to write a catastrophic novel about thesinking of a ship during peacetime, an iceberg would be theonly thing that could do the job.The most likely place for ships tomeet icebergs was in the AtlanticOcean, and the month of Aprilwas the riskiest time becausewarmer weather causes bergs towander south. The risk presentedin the novel was actually very real,and other ships had also gonethrough such accidents in thepast. As for the characteristicsand the name of the ship, it hasbeen discovered recently that the White Star Line had told the New York Times in 1892\u2014that is, six years before Robertson wrote his book\u2014that they were plan- ning to build ships of the same exact kind as the one later de- scribed by the writer. They also told the Timesthat the first one might be named Gigantic. Not bad for a hint! 3) No Pope, Please. This one can be found repeated in most books dealing with strange omens related to the disaster. Rumors have it that the Titanic's hull number was 360604, which, when viewedthrough a mirror, spells the anti-Catholic statement \"NO POPE\" \u2014a heresy in the ultra-Catholic parts of Belfast, where the ship was built. However, it is just amyth; as every scholar of the Ti- tanicwill tell you, the hull number was a much less scary 401. 4) Curse of the Mummy. The story about the curse of the Mummy of Amen-Ra destroying the Titanicis pure fantasy as well. However, it stems from an actual story relatedby journalist and famous Spiritual- ist William T. Stead, a passenger on the ship who lost his life the night before the disaster. Steadtold it to some of his First-Class friends, who survived and related it to journalists, who in turn sensa- tionalized it incredibly. The story tells of the painted lid of a sar-cophagus that depicted a face so scary that many thought it meant bad luck. It was not a mummy, then, but only the cover of a sar- cophagus. It probably belonged to a priestess of the cult of the god Amen-Ra; Pearson's magazine had devoted a cover story to it in the August 1909 issue. It was quite a well known archaeological item, then, housed at the British Mu- seum. Despite the many legendslinked to it, the sarcophagus was just a beautiful relic from ancient Egypt, and it never left the mu- seum (it certainly never was on the Titanic), where it can still be seen in Room 62. 5) The Priceless Rubaiyat. It is claimed that the copy of The Rubaiyat,a selection of poems at- tributed to Omar Khayy\u00e1m(1048-1131), a Persian mathe- matician, astronomer, andphilosopher, present aboard the Titanicwas absolutely priceless. It's true that the book was adeluxe edition purchased at Sotheby's by an American collec- tor\u2014the cover had a peacock de- sign made from gold and studded with over one thousand rubies and emeralds. But far from the usually claimed fortune, the book had been bought for just \u00a3405 atthe auction. It would certainly notbe worth the millions of dollars needed to attempt a salvage expe- dition (many such missions so far have never found TheRubaiyat).[NOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD M A S S I M O P O L I D O R O Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, lecturer, and cofounder and head of CICAP , the Italian skeptics group.

Ten Myths about the Titanic The sinking of the Titanichas become a modern folktale; as such, its story has been clouded by many myths and misconceptions that are still flourishing a century after the disaster. Legends began spreading before the ship had even begun to sink in the Atlantic Ocean that terrible night in April 1912.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:01 AM Page 206) No Binoculars Aboard Ship. This is partially true; the lookouts of the Titanicdid not have any binoculars, which were on theship but inaccessible. The originalsecond officer, David Blair, wasdischarged right before departurebecause a new chief officer, Henry Wilde, was brought on board by Captain Smith. The re- maining officers' ranks weretherefore changed, and Blair wasthe one removed to make way for Wilde. The binoculars were in- side a locker in the cabin thatBlair had originally occupied, butwhen he left the ship he mistak- enly took the keys along. Histori- ans, however, are of the opinionthat binoculars would have madeno difference in spotting the ice-berg on the pitch black night ofthe sinking. 7) Open Those Watertight Doors! According to one theory, if thewatertight doors had beenopened, the Titanicwould have sunk on an even keel and there-fore, perhaps, remained afloatlong enough for rescue ships to arrive. In reality, this would havebeen impossible. First, there were no watertight doors between thefirst four compartments\u2014thus itwas impossible to lower the con-centration of water in the bow significantly. Second, it has been shown that any significant amount of water abaft boiler room no. 4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanicabout thirty minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Addition- ally, the lighting would have been lost about seventy minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. 8) The Captain Shot Himself. A few days after the sinking, wildand contradicting stories about the final moments of Captain Edward Smith began circulating. It was said that he shot himself when he realized that the ship was doomed; it was also said that after the sinking he was seen swimming desperately in order to save babies from the icy waters. In truth, there is no evidence ei- ther that Smith committed sui- cide or that he tried to save ba- bies. Smith was certainly re sponsible in part for the disaster, having failed to slow the shipafter receiving many notices of icein the area during the day. How-ever, it is likely that Captain Smith died, like most of the other officers did, while trying to save asmany passengers as possible. 9) The Extreme Survivor. It is often reported that fireman FrankTower not only survived the sink- ing of the Titanicbut was also aboard the Empress of Ireland when she collided with the Storstadand later on the Lusitania when that vessel was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat in May 1915 off the southern coast of Ire-land. The truth, as usually happens with such unlikely legends, is thatno person by the name of Frank Tower appears in any crew lists for those three vessels. 10) The Double Ship Conspiracy. What about the story that it wasnot the Titanic that went down in the Atlantic but its twin sister, the Olympic, in order to scam the in surance company? First relatedby Robin Gardiner and Dan van der Vat in the book The Titanic Conspiracy, the idea was that analready-damaged Olympic (dis- guised as the Titanic) was pur- posefully sunk in order to collect insurance money. Apart from theabsurdity of the theory, it wasshown to be false when parts ofthe wreck were recovered. The Titanic's construction number 401 was found on all of them. The number of the Olympic was 400. n Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 21 The myth that a mummy's curse destroyed the Titanicstems from a story that William T. Stead (center) related to fellow First-Class passengers. Stead's tale may have been inspired by a 1909 cover of Pearson's magazine (right).May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 2:39 PM Page 2122 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerYou just can't make this stuff up. For the past few years I have been reporting from time to time on the absurd claims of a group of UFOl-ogists who call their study exopolitics\u2014\"political implications of the extra-ter-restrial presence.\" That there is an\"extra-terrestrial presence\" on Earth,they have no doubt. Alfred Lambre- mont Webre claims to have been the founder of exopolitics, al though in re- ality Michael Salla can probably claim that dubious honor; Webre's is exopolitics.com, and Salla has exopoli- tics.org. Lately Webre's claims have gotten so bizarre (e.g., a war between the An - dromeda Council and the Reptilians and Americans being teleported to a secret base on Mars to meet with aliens) thateven others in exopolitics have becomealarmed and begun distancing them-selves from him. As Salla recently wroteon his website, \"Webre is a marginal and controversial figure in the network of ex- opolitics researchers and activists that has formed around the world. Webre's writ-ing and behavior is seen as too bizarreand controversial for most credible ex- opolitics researchers to use\" (http://ex- opolitics.org/Exo-Comment-98.htm).Nonetheless, Webre's far-out articles on Examiner.com were being read by as many as 400,000 people each month\u2014 until recently, that is, when Exam - iner.com finally gave him the boot. Webre's colleague Jon Kelly, \"a world-famous expert in the application of voice-based disclosure technologyfor revealing UFO secrets\" (whatever that means), writes (http://tinyurl.com/ cgymy3p): Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Tribunal Judge and founder of Exopolitics Al- fred Lambremont Webre is calling for consumers to occupy an immedi-ate boycott of pay-per-impression advertising funded news website Ex- aminer.com. ...

Pieces on Examiner.com are pre- sented to make you think you're reading a news story. Once a colleague and I were discussing one of Webre's absurdcolumns on Examiner.com that claimed NASA was promoting (not de bunk -ing) fears of an \"extinction level event\"from Comet Elenin (http://tinyurl.com/ 3njgzfj). He asked me, \"What kind of newspaper is publishing crazy stuff likethis?\" I replied, \"I don't think it's actually a newspaper; it's more like this guy'sblog.\" In his feud with Examiner.com, Webre spelled out Examiner.com's busi- ness model: During 2009 many of the writers were receiving $0.01 per page view. Examiner.com later offered a variety of pay scale options to their writers. Examiner.com now bases compensa- tion on variables such as subscrip- tions, page view traffic and session length. ...Examiner.com derives the bulk of its revenue from consumer (reader) click-throughs. Every time you as a reader click through to read an article on Examiner.com, the company is paid a royalty by its ad- vertisers. Let's see, one cent per page at 400,000 pages per month gets you $4,000 a month, although Webre suggests that might be only in a good month.

It cannot be that they areconcerned about their journalistic cred-ibility, for they have none.

In Santa Ana, California, on August 3, 1965, highway worker Rex Heflin tookthree photos of a supposed UFOthrough the window of his van using hisPolaroid instant camera. NICAP andmany prominent UFOlogists have long touted this series of photos as \"classic.\"This object supposedly flew right overthe Marine Corps El Toro Air Stationand the Santa Ana Freeway (Interstate5) in broad daylight, but no one else saw it. (See my book UFO Sightings , Prome - theus Books, 1998, pp. 91-93.) In these photos, distant objects are hazy because of the Los Angeles smog, but the UFO is sharp\u2014probably because it is tiny and very close to the camera. For many yearsthe original prints could not be investi-gated because Heflin claims that an in- vestigator came to his house, flashing anID supposedly from NORAD, and con- fiscated them. (At least Heflin did notclaim that the Men in Black came forhis prints or that the dog ate them.) Soall we had left were copies made from the originals. The Air Force's ProjectBluebook listed the Heflin photos as a \"hoax.\" However, \"In 1993, Heflin's originals surfaced unexpectedly under mysterious circumstances\" (http://tinyurl.com/75bp7ba). had retired from busy and smoggy southern Cali -fornia to a small town in northern Cal-ifornia. He says that he received twocalls from a mysterious woman tellinghim to check his mailbox. When he did,he said he found his original three UFO polaroids in a plain brown envelope. Or Heflin just made the whole thing up\u2014the \"loss\" of the originals as well as their \"recovery.\" Heflin died in 2005. Skeptics have argued that Heflin's UFO appears to be a tiny model, just a few inches in size, hanging from some-thing like a fishing pole propped upover the cab of his van. William K.Hartmann, who investigated the case for the Condon Report (Case 52,http://tinyurl.com/7vup348), success- fully replicated Heflin's photos in ex- actly this manner by using a suspended lens cap. However, only in 2006 did a still- anonymous person, using the alias \"Enkidu,\" make an extremely impor- tant finding. In a discussion thread on the conspiracy-oriented website Above Top Secret (www.abovetopsecret.com/ forum/thread208479/pg1), Enkidu ar- gues that Heflin unintentionally cre-ated a 3D photo of his UFO. Assum - ing that the UFO was attached in someway to the truck, by moving the camera a few inches between the exposures, Heflin has produced a near-perfect stereo pair, as can be seen in stereo viewers. The photos in Figure 1 were reversed by Enkidu to allow easier viewing of the 3D effect without a stereo viewer by simply crossing one's eyes. When you do that, the UFO isseen to be tiny. It's clearly farther away than the truck's mirror but much closer than the roadside vegetation or the dis-tant trees. Responding to criticism, Enkidu writes, \"Yes, it's possible that the UFO moved between the time the first photo was taken and the second.But it would have to move exactly hor- izontal to the way the camera moved,because there's no apparent difference in the size of the top part of the ship. Itcould only tilt forward. It didn't go upor down, and it didn't get nearer or closer. The odds of that happening are pretty slim.\" Great work, Enkidu\u2014the Heflin photos are busted! n Figure 1. Internet commenter Enkidu argues that Rex Heflin inadvertently created a 3D image with two of his photos, supporting the argument that the UFO is actually a tiny model. May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:01 AM Page 2324 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerThe group Friends of Science in Medicine has recently formed in Australia, and they now have over 400 professional members. They felt theneed to come together over a disturbing trend\u2014the infiltration of rank pseudo- science into once respected universities. It is a sign of our times that we have to defend having standards of good sci-ence in the practice of medicine and the teaching of a science-based curriculum in universities. High standards of sci-ence in medicine are necessary in orderto ensure, as best as we can, that treat-ments and interventions are safe, effec- tive, and ethical. It is extremely compli-cated and tricky to determine safety andefficacy. Humans suffer from numerousmechanisms of self-deception, cognitiveflaws and biases, poor grasp of statistics,and perceptual failings that are likely tolead us astray. In fact our biases tend to systematically lead us to false conclu- sions that we wish to be true, rather than to the truth. These flaws, biases, and cognitive er- rors make it difficult to come to reliable conclusions in any area of exploration, but perhaps particularly so in the ap- plied science of medicine. This field is further plagued by placebo effects, which represent the above effects in ad-dition to a complex emotional andphysical response to the nonspecific as- pects of getting attention from an at- tentive practitioner. Science is the only system that we have developed that systematically con- trols for all of these biases and flaws to see through to reliable information. Science endeavors to be transparent,thorough, and rigorous. The applicationof scientific principles has demonstra- bly transformed medicine (and human knowledge in general) for the better. As a society we should not lightly abandon the principles of science or try to change them to meet the needs of the current fads.Universities in particular are supposed to be the exemplars of scholarship and intellectual legitimacy. People believeuniversities are intellectual leaders, not followers, and they are correct (or at least, they should be). Teach ing a topic in a university is absolutely an endorsementof the legitimacy of that topic. We candistinguish between teaching about something and teaching the thing itself. It is okay to teach about so-called com- plementary and alternative medicine(CAM) as a sociological phenomenon oreven as an example of pseudoscience.Practi tioners also need to learn about anymethod their patients may be using orabout which they are curious. Credu -lously teaching CAM, however, is an en-dorsement, the granting of the impri-matur of the university. It is tempting to cater to prevailing fads, to acquiesce to the vocal advocates and give them what they want, espe- cially when there isn't much protest. That is exactly what intellectual in- tegrity is about, however\u2014doing the right thing because it is right, not be- cause it is popular or expedient. I will acknowledge perhaps the only legitimate argument on the other side: that of academic freedom and diversityof opinion. I agree with the principle that a university should also be a place for the free exchange of ideas and should not easily impose censorship. Proponents ofnonsense, however, have taken this prin- ciple too far. Academic freedom needs to be tempered with quality control. Profes-sors should not be allowed to teach ab- solutely anything they want withoutlimit. The university has a duty to ensurethat the minimal standards of academic legitimacy are met. This duty includes ensuring that sci- ence is taught in science classes. This de-bate has come up with reference toteaching creationism as science as a mat- ter of academic freedom. Such freedomdoes not extend to the point of teachingdemonstrable pseudoscience as if it werea legitimate science. The exact same thing can be said about teaching home- opathy, for example, as if it were legiti- mate science-based medicine. The argument above should not be difficult to make and should resonatewith academics. It has worked well inthe United Kingdom, spearheaded mostly by David Colquhoun, who has used freedom of information requests to obtain the CAM curricula at univer- sities teaching CAM, and then simply sent them to the dean and/or board of trustees of the university. This one act has led to the removal of CAM courses from universities in the United King - dom. Simply shining a light on what was happening was enough. In the United States we are having a harder time, although we have had some successes also. The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) has been infiltrated by CAM propo- nents who have managed to get re- quirements for CAM to be taught in American medical schools. Of course,we can still teach about CAM (which I actually advocate) rather than promote pseudoscience\u2014something that is not a subtle distinction but is often difficult for some to make. Australia is perhaps having the most difficult time with this issue, leading to the formation of the Friends of Science in Medicine. Their request is simple: no pseudoscience in universities. Theyhave helped bring the debate to the forefront. CAM's greatest ally in infil- trating universities is stealth. I have seen this infiltration occur deliberately under the radar with the stated goal of avoiding too much attention, whichmight draw criticism. This violates theprinciple of transparency, and it illus-trates why focusing attention on this trend is so useful. Of course, CAM proponents are not going to just lie down and go away.[ THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE S T E V E N N O V E L L A Steven Novella, MD, is assistant professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine, the host of the Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast, author of the NeuroLogica blog, executive editor of the Science-Based Medicine blog, and president of the New England Skeptical Society. Pseudoscience in Our UniversitiesMay June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:01 AM Page 24Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 25There have been many responses to the criticism of teaching CAM in medicalschools, none of which is valid. In Aus-tralia, the most frequently quoted de-fender of teaching on nonsense in uni- versities is Iain Graham, professor at Southern Cross University's School ofHealth. He is quoted in several articles,but this quote responding to criticismfrom John Dwyer, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of NewSouth Wales, is representative: Professor Dwyer's sweeping discus- sion about the issue are to do with quackery really, and the rooting out of poor practise. But if we look his- torically at the evolution of health care and the health professions, there are many similarities with where things started. He mentioned homeopathy for ex ample, well homeopathy is as old as Greek Hypocrates in terms of prac- tising medicine. (Australian Broad - casting Company 2011) Here we have a blatant misstate- ment of fact combined with a logicalfallacy. Graham probably (if I am beinggenerous) did not mean to state thathomeopathy can be traced back to an- cient Greece, just that some CAMtherapies can. Homeopathy was in -vented by Samuel Hahnemann about 200 years ago (Novella 2009). But I wonder what CAM modalities he had in mind. Chiropractic? About 100 years ago. Therapeutic touch? A few decades ago. Acupunc ture is a complex question, but what passes for acupunc- ture today is less than 100 years old. Per-haps he was thinking about bloodlet-ting or trepanation. However, it is true that some basic concepts, like the notion of \"life energy,\" can trace their roots to ancient Greece and other ancient cultures. However, such notions are pre-scientific nonsense. Scientists abandoned the notion of life energy over a century ago because there was no evidence that such a force exists (and there still isn't). After figuring out all the basic processes of life, there was essentially nothing left for the alleged life force to do. For some reason, however, Graham believes that antiquity in science is a virtue\u2014the \"argument from antiquity\" logical fallacy. The unstated assumptionis that if an idea has survived for hun- dreds or thousands of years it must be le- gitimate. This is demonstrably false. Galenic medicine (bloodletting, purging, etc., based on the notion of the four hu- mors) survived for thousands of years,and yet it was based on complete and utter primitive nonsense. In fact its ten-drils still exist. There is still bloodletting, cupping (which is just another form of bloodletting), and similar practices going on in the world. It was replaced in theWest because of the advent of science in medicine\u2014a trend that Graham appar-ently wants to reverse. Graham's second swing and a miss: \"Eighty per cent of Australians seek al- ternative therapies,\" Graham is quoted as saying by Australian newspaper theNorthern Star . \"Obviously orthodox medicine is not working for everyone\" (www.northernstar.com.au/story/2011/ 12/12/alternative-therapy-course-not- magic/). I highly doubt that the 80 per-cent figure is correct. Most such figures are highly inflated by including all sorts of practices in the CAM category, suchas exercising and eating organic food\u2014 and sometimes prayer is included. U.S. surveys show the percentage of CAMuse is around 33 percent (NIH 2008),but this is mostly things like massage and chiropractic manipulations. Home - o pathy use is around 3-4 percent, and acu punc ture 6-7 percent. In fact, only manipulation and massage were in the double digits. This is all marketing deception. Cre- ate a false category (CAM), pad it out with commonly used methods, and then claim that the extreme fringes are there- fore getting more popular. I don't knowhow Graham got to 80 percent (I doubt such methods are that much more pop- ular in Australia than in the UnitedStates) but it is close to one survey from 2007 that found that 69 percent of Aus- tralians used one of the seventeen mostpopular forms of CAM in the last year (Xue et al. 2007). However, that study included in its list martial arts, yoga, mas- sage, meditation, and taking multivita- mins. I am not sure what taking multi - vitamins says about the popularity of homeopathy, but apparently Graham thinks it is significant. In any case, I will grant that CAM asa marketing concept has been somewhat successful\u2014and even that it has gained popularity recently (although not as much as advocates would have you think). Thatis entirely irrelevant, however, to the ques- tion of whether or not any particularCAM modality is science-based and ap-propriate for a university curriculum(which is the question at hand). Universities are supposed to be thought leaders with intellectual stan-dards that rise above the mere notion of popularity. They are supposed to uphold academic standards of scholarship, espe- cially in scientific disciplines with high standards in science. It is therefore very odd and disturbing to defend a university policy based upon popularity. Should we allow surveys of public opinion to deter- mine whether or not we teach creation- ism or astrology in our universities? It is good to see some organized backlash against the infiltration of pseu- doscience and nonsense into the very institutions that should be teaching against such things. It is good to see more and more articles written about this topic\u2014we want attention for the issue. We want a discussion of the mer- its of our position verses the pro-CAMposition. Let's have a very public debate about the facts, about what is science, and how we as a society should deter- mine what medical interventions are worth our public support. We will confidently stand by our position. CAM proponents, like crea -tionists, have nothing but weak and fallacious\u2014and long discredited\u2014argu - ments on their side. n References Australian Broadcasting Company. 2011.

Why are people so afraid of the idea that the minds of men and women are not identical in every way?\u2014Steven Pinker,The Blank Slate (2002) The mere suggestion that one group of people is cognitively or emo-tionally distinct from another can leave many of us speechless and squir -ming in our seats. The effect is intensi- fied, of course, in the regrettable event of historical discrimination, especially when the differences are alleged to be innate. Scientists of many stripes have bravely confronted, struggled with, and evidently resolved the issue as it per- tains to \"race.\" Such classifications lack sturdy biological bases, the current con-sensus holds, and their very existence relies on nothing more concrete or de- pendable than cultural convention and political expediency. 1 Genderor sex(I use the terms inter- changeably here) is similar in some re-spects, but it is clearly distinct in others. Some biological differences between men and women are both unmistakable and abundantly appreciated. Combat can erupt, however\u2014perhaps most furi- ously in intellectual circles\u2014over ques- tions involving mental differences and, assuming their existence, over their pro- posed causes. In a recent column (SI, July/August 2011), I investigated the origins of fe- male \"underrepresentation\" in high-end science, technology, engineering, and math. The latest analyses had suggested that rather than being discriminatedagainst, qualified women tended tochoose people-centered over thing- centered professions\u2014that is, the somewhat narrow mental trait exam- ined was interest. Other studies have explored broader gender differences in personality\u2014a re- lated and at least equally sensitive do- main. In a highly influential 2005paper, for example, Janet Hyde, Uni - versity of Wisconsin-Madison profes-sor of psychology and women's studies,rebuked the popular media and general public for their apparent fascination with an assumed profusion of deep psy- chological variances between genders (Hyde 2005). After reviewing forty-six meta- analyses on the subject, Hyde proposed a new model. The gender similarities hy- pothesis(GSH) holds that \"males and females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables.\" Because most differences are negligible or small, and because very few are large, Hyde con-tended, \"men and women as well as boys and girls are more alike than they are different.\" Physical aggression and sexuality were offered as exceptions. But in a new study, \"The Distance Between Mars and Venus,\" Hyde's renowned hypothesis was directly and expressly challenged by a trio of Euro - peans led by Marco Del Giudice, evo-lutionary psychologist at the University of Turin, Italy (Del Giudice et al. 2012). Having subjected a sample of 10,261 American men and women between ages fifteen and ninety-two to an as- sessment of multiple personality vari- ables, Del Giudice obtained results he and his team described as \"striking.\"The \"true extent of sex differences in human personality,\" he argued, \"has been consistently underestimated.\" DelGiudice now compares personality dis- parities to those of other psychological constructs like vocational interests and aggression. When properly measured, he reports, gender personality differ- ences are \"large\" and \"robust.\" Indeed,roughly 82 percent of his cohort deliv- ered personality profiles that could not be matched with any member of the opposite sex. So by what method should re - searchers measure these distinctions? The Europeans broke new ground by combining three techniques. First, to enhance reliability and repeatability, they estimated differences based on la-tent factors rather than observed scores. Second, instead of employing the so- called \"Big Five\" variables (ex tra version, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neu- roticism, and openness to experience), Del Giudice and company applied fif- teen narrower traits in order to assesspersonality with \"higher resolution.\" Fi- nally, ag variances\u2014tomore accurately reveal \"global\" sex dif- ferences. Hyde swiftly posted her response. Roundly disparaging Del Giudice's sta- tistical method, she charged that it \"in- troduces bias by maximizing differences.\" In the end, she continued, the Europeans' \"global\" result is merely a single and \"uninterpretible\" dimension that only \"blur[s] the question rather than offering higher resolution.\" The GSH stands in- 26 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer[ SCIENCE WATCH K E N N E T H W.

The true expanse be- tween genders, Hyde argued, is anything but astronomical: instead, it more resem- bles \"the distance between North Dakotaand South Dakota.\" Either way, a third researcher teased, \"you'll still have a mighty long way towalk.\" Richard Lippa, professor of psy- chology at California State Uni versity, Fullerton, proposed an attractive anal- ogy in the Italian's de fense. Con sidersex differences in body shape, he sug- gested. The ap proach underlying for exam- ple\u2014and likely declare that men andwomen have similar bodies. By contrast, Del Giudice's multivariate method would probably generate the much more intuitive conclusion that \"sex dif-ferences in human body shape are quitelarge, with men and women having dis- tinct multivariate distributions thatoverlap very little.\" The Italian offered a similar and equally effective analogy comparing male and female faces. Del Giudice finds Hyde's \"single di- mension\" criticism ironic indeed be cause his method's essential point, he says, was to integrate multiple personality factors rather than isolate them. Most dramat- ically in univariate terms, those traits in-cluded sensitivity, warmth, and appre- hension (higher in women), andemotional stability, dominance, vigilance, and rule-consciousness (higher in men). Nor does he see an interpretability problem. Del Giudice's \"weighted blend\" of fifteen personality traits, he argues,provides a concrete and meaningful de-scription of global differences informing us of a 10 to 20 percent overlap between male and female distributions. He denies as well Hyde's claim that his techniques were either controversial or prone to maximizing bias. To the contrary, he told me, his team simply \"thought hard about the various artifacts that can deflate sex differences in personality, and took steps to correct them.\" Steven Pinker's provocative query denouncing our fear of sex differences was largely rhetorical, of course. He an- swered the question soon after asking it: \"The fear,\" he acknowledged, \"is that different implies unequal\" (Pinker \"Contemporary gender re searchers, particularly those who adopt social constructionist and feminist ideologies, often reject the notion that biologic factors directly cause gender differences.\" \u2014 Richard Lippa, professor of psychology at California State University, FullertonMay June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:01 AM Page 272002). If we momentarily assume that gender personality differences are sub- stantial, the next issue to confront might be whether those differences are driven more by culture or biology. In either case, certain groups may be forced to re- think some much cherished ideas andpractices. Lippa recently probed the ultimate \"nature vs. nurture\" question in a review of two meta-analyses and three cross-cultural studies on gender differences inboth personality and interests (Lippa2010). In the end, he discovered that women tend to score significantlyhigher over time and across cultures inthe Big Five categories of agreeableness and neuroticism and, as others havefound since, that they gravitate more toward people-centered rather than thing-centered occupations. The Californian then described two basic sets of nonexclusive theoriesunder which such evidence is typicallyevaluated. Biological theories, of course, focus on genes, hormones, neural devel- opment, and brain structure, for exam-ple. These models are inspired by ourknowledge of evolution. By contrast, social-environmental theories concen- trate on stereotypes, self-conceptualiza- tion, and social learning. Here, culturalinfluences are thought to dominate. Supporters of distinct sub-theories would no doubt evaluate the evidence in varying ways. But significant gender differences that are consistent across cultures and over time, Lippa contends, are more likely to reflect underlying bi- ological rather than social-environmen- tal causes. Similarly suggestive, the au- thor says, is the fact that such divergences tend to be greater in rela- tively \"modern,\" individualistic, and gender-egalitarian societies. In his new paper, Del Giudice chose not to directly engage the difficult question of underlying causes. None - theless, he reminds us that evolutionary principles\u2014sexual selection and paren - tal investment theories, in particular\u2014 provide us with ample grounds to \"ex- pect robust and wide-ranging sex differences in this area.\" Most person- ality traits, says, \"have substantial ef-fects on mating- and parenting-related behaviors.\" Even so, Hyde answers, more than one evolutionary force may be at play here. Although sexual selection can produce sex differences, she admits, other forms of natural selection canrender sex similarities. \"The evolution- ary psychologists,\" she reckons, \"haveforgotten about natural selection.\" On these limited questions, truly common ground seems scarce indeed. Why should the authors interpret the evidence so differently? Of course no member of any group or human insti- tution is impervious to personal orphilosophical biases. One might rea- sonably expect academics to be more objective than others, but for what it's worth, that has seldom been my expe- rience as a science writer. In his review, Lippa argued generally that \"contemporary gender re searchers,particularly those who adopt social constructionist and feminist ideologies, often reject the notion that biologic fac- tors directly cause gender differences.\" And, more pertinent he claimsthat Hyde has long \"ignored 'big' dif- ferences in women's that the GSH \"is, in part, mo-tivated by feminist ideologies and Hyde denies the accusation categor- ically: \"The GSH not based on ide- ology,\" she told me. \"It is a summary ofwhat the data show ... data from mil- lions of subjects.\" However, one might note of the Wisconsinite's pioneering paper that a great deal of concluding space was consumed decrying the per- ceived social costs of gender difference claims, especially to women, rather than further illuminating or summarizing the data. Del Giudice appears to find the issue of bias somewhat less motivating. If sex differences are small, he suggests, we have little to explain and more time to discuss incorrect stereotypes\u2014\"this is the main appeal of the GSH.\" He agrees that \"ideology has played a part in the success of the GSH.\" Nonethe - less, he maintains that the aforemen- tioned \"methodological limitationshave played a larger role.\" In his closing comments to me, the Californian echoed much of what Steven Pinker has so courageously rec- ognized in recent years with regard to the broader subject of group diver- gences. The ongoing examination of sexdifferences in personality may or may not be tainted by feminism or otherideologies. But given the in quiry's great sensitivity and profound implications, Lippa's comments\u2014crafted in the finest tradition of true skepticism\u2014 bear repeating here: \"I believe this is not a topic where 'ignorance is bliss.' We have to examine the nature of sex differences objec-tively.... We should, as researchers, be open to all possible explanations. And then, as a society, we have to decide whether we want to let the differences be whatever they may be, or work to re- duce them.\" Words to inquire by. So let the re - search into gender differences continue,as the Europeans urge, unfettered by ir-relevant politics or pet, self-serving causes. I suspect we have little to fear. But let science characterize our differ- ences objectively, whatever their nature and degree. Then, if necessary, we'll de- cide together\u2014as an open and in-formed community\u2014how best to cope with them. n Note 1.

Beyond that, how you deal with them depends largelyon what role they have in the investiga- tion\u2014typically as either claimants orcoinvestigators. Believers as Claimants Believers who actually saw the ghost, UFO, or other unexplained phenome-non should be treated primarily as eye-witnesses. They have information aninvestigator needs to understand thephenomenon and potentially solve themystery, and there is no benefit to beinganything but courteous and polite. Your job is to get as much information fromthem as possible and try to understandwhat they experienced\u2014in other words,to establish the claim. During investigations, you will be talking with people who are approach- ing the topic from a different point of view (or who are already convinced of the validity of only one interpretation of the event they experienced). Good investigation is about finding the facts and revealing the truth; it is not about attacking a person's intelligence, credi- bility, or motives. The question of whether an eyewitness truly saw a ghost is a factual issue, not a personal one. You must make a clear distinction between criticizing a person's logic or evidenceand attacking him or her as a person. Ridicule and mockery of sincere people has no place in skeptical para- normal investigation. Not only will it tarnish your reputation and that of other skeptical investigators, but it is counterproductive and will sabotage the investigation. With the rare exceptions of frauds and hoaxers, most people who experience and report paranormal phe- nomena are sincere, honest people who simply didn't understand somethingthey experienced. Your job as an inves- tigator is to understand and explain what happened to the best of your abil- ity\u2014not necessarily to convince the be-liever that you're right and they'rewrong. Believers as Coinvestigators On the other hand, sometimes the be- lievers are not making the original claim but instead are coinvestigators (not necessarily working together but at least in the same place at the sametime). Ghost hunters are usually so busy anomaly hunting that they neglect (orforget) to address the original paranor- mal claims (see my recent \"Skeptical Inquiree\" column on anomaly hunting, May/June 2011). I often encounter this scenario during TV shoots where producers have assem- bled a team mixed with believers andskeptics (usually in about a 10:1 ratio). Other times when I'm at a supposedly haunted location, less-skeptical ghost hunters are there doing their own thing.In these situations I'm typically doing two things at once. The main objective is, of course, trying to understand the original claims and solve the mystery. But the second goal is watching the other in- vestigators to examine (and sometimes document) their methods. A lot of times watching others \"investigate\" teaches me how not to do it. Criticizing their methods or gear (such as pointing to their blinking, beeping EMF detector and saying, \"You know that doesn't really detect ghosts, right?\") is unlikely to be produc- tive. They have their own investigationtechniques (usually copied directly from pseudoscientific TV shows like Ghost Hunters) and are rarely interested in a skeptic's perspective. While I'm there it's not my job to teach the ghost hunters how to do theirjob (if they ask my advice, that's anotherthing). Now and then I'll ask polite questions about their premises and as- sumptions, but for the most part I don'tchallenge them at the time. I've actually had some really interesting, productive, respectful discussions with believing ghost hunters and psychics that have greatly helped me understand their worldviews and approaches. It sounds like you can approach it from two routes: as an investigator or as an observer. The main difference is research and preparation: If you'regoing in as an investigator, you should research (and be fully prepared to inves- tigate) the claims. If you're just going to watch what happens, that's a lot less work and can be both fun and funny. My advice is to enjoy the investigation,and if you're going to explain to your friend what he (or the other ghost hunters) are doing wrong, either wait until you're asked and respond diplo- matically or bring it up later. n[SKEPTICAL INQUIREE BE NJA MIN R A DFOR D Benjamin Radford is a research fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and author or coauthor of six books, including Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore.

Defined by the Roswell Incident (1947), this syndrome is repeated at Flatwoods (1952), Kecksburg (1965), and Rendlesham Forest (1980).

In the sections that follow, we describe the process as it occurred at Roswell and then demonstrate how the same syndrome developed from certain other famous UFO incidents: at Flatwoods, West Virginia (1952); Kecksburg, Pennsylvania (1965); and Rendlesham Forest (outside the Woodbridge NATO base) in Eng- land (1980). Between us, we have actually been on-site to investigate three of the four cases (Joe Nickell at Roswell and Flatwoods, and James McGaha\u2014a former military pilot\u2014at Rendlesham). Roswell (1947) Here is how the prototype of the Ros wel lian Syndrome began and developed: Incident.On July 8, 1947, an eager but relatively inexperienced public information officer at Roswell Army Airfield issued a press release claiming a \"flying disc\" had been recovered from its crash site on an area ranch (Berlitz and Moore 1980; Korff 1997). The next day's Roswell Daily Recordtold how rancher \"Mac\" Brazel described (in a reporter's words) \"a large area of bright wreckage\" consisting of tinfoil, rubber strips, sticks, and other lightweight materials. Debunking. Soon after these initial reports, the mysterious object was identified as a weather balloon. Although there appears to have been no attempt to deceive, the best evidence now in- dicates that the device was really a balloon array (the sticks and foiled paper being components of dangling box-kite-like radar reflectors) that had gone missing in flight from Project Mogul.Near the very beginning of the modern UFO craze, in the summer of 1947, a crashed \"flying disc\" was reported to have been recovered near Roswell, New Mexico. However, it was soon identified as simply a weather balloon, whereupon the sensational story seemed to fade away. Actually, it went underground; after subsequent decades, it resurfaced as an incredible tale of extraterrestrial invasion and the government's attempt to cover up the awful truth. The media capi- talized on \"the Roswell incident,\" and conspiracy theorists, persons with confabulated memories, outright hoaxers, and others climbed aboard the bandwagon. May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:02 AM Page 3132 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerMogul represented an attempt to use the airborne devices' instruments to monitor sonic emissions from Soviet nucleartests. Joe Nickell has spoken about this with former MogulProject scientist Charles B. Moore, who identified the wreck- age from photographs as consistent with a lost Flight 4Mogul array. (See also Thomas 1995; Saler et al. 1997; U.S. Air Force 1997.) Submergence. With the report that the \"flying disc\" was only a balloon-borne device, the Roswell news story ended almost as abruptly as it had begun. However, the event would linger on in the fading and recreative memories of some of those involved, while in Roswell rumor and speculation con- tinued to simmer just below the surface with UFO reports apart of the culture at large. In time, conspiracy-minded UFOlogists would arrive, asking leading questions and help- ing to spin a tale of crashed flying saucers and a government cover-up. Mythologizing. This is the most complex part of the syn- drome, beginning when the story goes underground and con- tinuing after it reemerges, developing into an elaborate myth. It involves many factors, including exaggeration, faulty mem- ory, folklore, and deliberate hoaxing. For example, exaggeration played a large role in the Roswell case. Major Jesse Marcel, who had helped retrievethe wreckage, often made self-contradictory and in- flated assertions, giving, for example, grossly exag- gerated statements about the amount of debris, its supposed imperviousness to damage, and other matters. It is now known that Marcel made claims about his own background\u2014that he had a college degree, was a World War II pilot who had received five air medals for shooting down enemy planes, and had himself been shot down\u2014that were proved untrue by his own service file (Fitz gerald 2001, 511). Kal Korff (1997, 27), who uncovered many of Marcel's deceptions, found him \"exagger- ating things and repeatedly trying to 'write him- self' into the history books.\" As he described the debris, Marcel said the sticks resembled balsa but were \"not wood at all\" and had \"some sort of hi- eroglyphics on them that nobody could decipher\" (apparently referring to the floral designs). As well, there were \"small pieces of a metal like tinfoil, except that it wasn't tinfoil\" (Berlitz and Moore 1980, 65). Faulty memory was another problem. For example, Curry Holden, an anthropologist from Texas Tech, claimed a student archaeological expedition he led had actually come upon the crashed flying saucer and the bodies of its extraterrestrial crew. Holden's wife and daughter, however, insisted that he had nevertold themof such an event; neither was there any corroboration in his personal papers. Holden was ninety-six when he provided his account to UFOlogist Kevin Randle, at which time his wife told Randle her husband's memory \"wasn't as sharp as it once had been. He sometimes restructured his life's events, moving them in time so that they were subtly changed\" (Fitz gerald2001, 514). Roswell mortician W. Glenn Dennis, who providedinformation on alien \"bodies\" at the Roswell AAF Hospital,also seriously misremembered and confabulated 1events. Ac- cording to James McAndrew's The Roswell Report: Case Closed (U.S. Air Force 1997, 78-79), Dennis's account \"was compared with official records of the actual events he is believed to have described\" and showed \"extensive inaccuracies\" that included \"a likely error in the date by as much as twelve years.\" The processes that create folklore also played a role in shaping the Ros well legend. As reported in Leonard String- field's book Situation Red: The UFO Siege (1977), a great It is now known that Marcel made claims about his own background\u2014that he had a college degree, was a World War II pilot who had received five air medals for shooting down enemy planes, and had himself been shot down\u2014that were proved untrue by his own service file.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:02 AM Page 32Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 33number of tales proliferated about an alleged crash of an extraterrestrial craft and the retrieval of its humanoid oc- cupants. The many versions of proof of the legend-making, oral-tradi- tion process at work. The aliens were typically described as little, big-eyed, big-headed humanoids, a type that began to be popularly reported after they were described by \"ab- ductees\" Betty and Barney Hill in 1961 (Nickell 2011, 184- 86). The pickled corpses were secretly stored\u2014mostly anonymous sources claimed\u2014at a (nonexistent) hangar-18 at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, or some other location subsequently supposed to be Area 51 (the U.S. govern ment's secret test facility). From a folkloris- tic point of view, the crash/retrieval stories seem to function as \"belief tales,\" that is, legends told to give credence to afolk belief\u2014in this instance a burgeoning one (Nickell 1995, 196-97). Roswell folklore was obviously fed in part by deliberate fakelore. Related hoaxing began in 1949 when\u2014as a part of the forthcoming sci-fi movie The Flying Saucer (1950)\u2014an actor posing as an FBI agent avowed its claim of a captured spacecraft was true. In 1950, writer Frank Scully reported inhis Behind the Flying Saucers that the U.S. government pos- sessed three Venusian spaceships complete with humanoid corpses. Scully got his information from a pair of confidence men who were hoping to sell a petroleum-locating gadget al- legedly derived from alien technology. By 1974, a man namedRobert Spencer Carr was giving talks in which he claimed firsthand knowledge of where the preserved aliens were hid- den; however, the late claimant's son reported that his father made up the entire yarn. Other Roswell hoaxes in cluded the ineptly forged \"MJ-12 documents\" (that continue to fool UFOlogist Stanton T. Friedman); a diary that told how a family came upon the smoldering crashed saucer and injured aliens (but was written with an ink not manufactured until1974); and the notorious \"Alien Autopsy\" film, showing the dissection of a rubbery extraterrestrial who appeared to be from the distant Planet Latex (Nickell 2001, 118-21). Reemergence and Media Bandwagon Effect. In 1980 the story resurfaced in the media with publication of the bookThe Roswell Incident. Its authors were Charles Berlitz (who had previously written the mystery-mongering best seller The Bermuda Triangle, containing \"invented details,\" exag- gerations, and distortions [Randi 1995, 35]) and William L. Moore (who was a suspect in the previously mentioned\"MJ-12\" hoax [Nickell with Fischer, 1992, 81-105], as well as author of The Philadelphia Experiment ,an expanded ver- sion of another's tale that itself proved to be a hoax [Clark1998, 509]). The Roswell Incident 's book jacket gushed: \"Re- ports indicate, before government censorship, that occu- pants and material from the wrecked ship were shuttled to a CIA high security area\u2014and that there may have been a survivor!\" It adds that \". . . Berlitz and Moore uncover as- tonishing information that indicates alien visitations may actually have happened\u2014only to be hushed up in the in- terest of 'national security.'\" The book is replete with distortions. Consider rancher Mac Brazel's original description of the scattered debris he found on his ranch\u2014strips of rubber, sticks, tinfoil, tough paper, and tape with floral designs (Nickell 2009, 10)\u2014the same as shown in photos (U.S. Air Force 1997, 7) and con- sistent with a Mogul balloon array with radar reflectors. However, Berlitz and Moore impose a conspiratorial inter- pretation, saying that in a subsequent interview Brazel \"had obviously gone to great pains to tell the newspaper people exactly what the Air Force had in structed him to say regard- ing how he had come to discover the wreckage and what it looked like.\" In fact, Brazel quite outspokenly insisted, \"I am sure what I found was not any weather observation balloon,\" and he was right: the debris was from a Project Mogul array, much of it foiled paper from the radar targets (Berlitz andMoore 1980, 40). Berlitz's and Moore's The Roswell Incident launched the modern wave of UFO crash/retrieval conspiracy beliefs, promoted by additional books (e.g., Friedman and Berliner1992), television shows, and myriad other venues. Roswell conspiracy theories were off and running, typically linked to strongly anti-U.S. government attitudes. The Roswellian Syndrome would play out again and again. Roswell folklore was obviously fed in part by deliberate fakelore.

Running to anearby home, they ob tained a flashlightand were joined by a beautician, her twosons, and a dog. As the unlikely groupwent up the hill toward a pulsating light,one boy aimed a flashlight at a pair of eyes shining through the dark. The group saw a tall \"manlike\"entity with a round face surrounded by a \"pointed hood-likeshape.\" Suddenly the monster emitted a high-pitched hiss-ing sound and swept at them with \"a gliding motion as ifafloat in midair,\" while exhibiting \"terrible claws.\" The groupran in panic, and the next day skid marks and a black gunkwere found at the site (Nickell 2000). The incident attracted journalists, writers (like paranor- malist Ivan San der son), and apparently two Air Force in-vestigators in civilian clothes. Soon, the UFO was identified as a meteor; seen in three states, it had only ap pearedto land when it disappeared behind the hill. The pulsating light was obviously one of three airplane beacons in view at the site. The tall \"monster\" was believed to have been a large owl on a limb (since then, more evidentially determined to have been a barn owl [Nickell 2000]), and a local man identified the ground traces as caused by his pickup truck and its leak- ing oil pan. The case soon slipped into obscurity. Fifteen years elapsed, then Sander son included the case as Chapter 3 of his Uninvited Visitors (1967). The credu- lous Sanderson (once fooled by a rubber Sasquatch frozen in ice [Nickell 2011, 87-90]) opined that the Flat woods incident involved multiple UFOs\u2014citing contradictory ac-counts of, in each instance, a singleobject. Instead of sus-pecting that witnesses were mistaken or that the meteor might have broken apart, he insisted that \"to be logical\" we should believe that there was \"a flight of aerial machines\" that were \"maneuvering in formation.\" For some reason they lost control, but one managed to land at Flatwoods. Its pilot emerged \"in a space suit\" but, observed, headed back to the craft, which\u2014like two others that \"crashed\"\u2014soon \"vaporized\" (Sander son 1967, 37-52). Sanderson was followed in 2004 by Frank C. Feschino Jr., who published\u2014with an introduction and epilogue by Stanton T. Friedman\u2014 The Braxton County Monster: The Cover-Up of Revealed . Feschino interviewed elderly wit- nesses, who, according to the book's promotional copy, \"wanted to talk about the story for the first time in fifty years.\" For example, Kathleen May, the beautician who was with the boys when they encountered the \"monster\" in 1952, recalled a mysterious \"government\" letter that had been shown her by local reporter A. Lee Stewart Jr. She claimed it told of experimental craft the \"Navy Depart ment\" op- erated in the area the evening of the incident. Feschino huffs: \"The test ship explanation told to Mrs. May in the mysterious letter was not even remotely possible in 1952. The Air Force knew that Mrs. May did not see a meteor in Flat woods. So they convinced her that it was some- thing explicable, like an experimental ship. But there were no experimental ships in 1952!\" (Feschino 2004, 336). Actually, according to reporter Stewart, what he had shown May was only a press release for an issue of Collier'smagazine with an at tached photo of a moon ship (Feschino 2004, 323-36). Kecksburg (1965) About forty miles southeast of Pitts burgh, in Kecksburg, Pennsyl vania, on December 9, 1965, a boy playing outdoors saw an object plummet into nearby woods. In fact, a brilliant aerial object had been seen by numerous observers over a large area. The Greens burg Tribune-Review reported in its county edition of December 10, \"Unidentified Flying Object Falls Near Kecksburg\" and \"Army Ropes Off Area.\" However, that newspaper's city edition headlined its story \"Searchers FailTo Find Object\" (Gordon 2001, 288). From photographs of the cloud train from the object, Sky & Telescope magazine (February 1966) identified it as a very bright meteor (a type of fireball known as a bolide). The story went underground. The Kecksburg incident remained ob scure until Septem- ber 19, 1990, when it became the season opener for NBC's Unsolved Mysteries . The show launched the story as one of a May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:02 AM Page 34Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 35crashed UFO, its secret retrieval, and a government conspir- acy to hide the truth. Nearly a quarter of a century after the original incident, two local men had begun to claim that be- fore authorities arrived they had entered the wooded area and encountered a large metallic object, shaped like an acorn, partially embedded in the earth. At the back of the object, the witnesses said, using wording that is curiously similar to that of the Roswell incident, were markings like ancient Egyp tian \"hieroglyphics.\" And, also like the Roswell case,the UFO was allegedly transported to Wright-Patterson AirForce Base near Dayton, Ohio, where it was kept in a sealed building (Gordon 2001, 288-90). Such shared motifs (as folklorists call story elements) suggest the Kecksburg inci-dent was influenced by the Roswell story. One source even claimed bodies were recovered at Kecksburg but subse-quently retracted the claim (Young 1997). The various later claims do not fare well, and more than fifty residents of Kecksburg sent a petition to Unsolved Mysteriesattempting to forestall the broadcast. These in- cluded the fire chief in 1965, Ed Myers, and a couple, Va-lerie and Jerome Miller, whose home the TV show wrongly claimed had served as a \"military command post\" during the UFO recovery. Actually, both the Air Force and the state police reported the day after the incident that nothing had been discovered and that all that had been carried from the site was search equipment (Young 1997). Rendlesham Forest (1980) For three days in late December 1980 in East England, a series of UFO close-encounter incidents occurred in Ren - dle sham Forest, located between two British NATO bases\u2014RAF Bent waters and RAF Woodbridge\u2014thatwere at the time being leased by the United States Air Force. The incidents began in the early morning of Decem - ber 26 (although sources disagree, some giving December25 or December 27) and lasted for three successive days. Security patrolmen witnessed a bright streaking light that appeared to crash into the forest. Investigating, the mensoon saw lights they attributed to a UFO\u2014a bright whitelight plus an apparent vehicle with \"a pulsing red light on top\" and \"blue lights underneath.\" As the patrolmen pro- ceeded closer, the object \"maneuvered through the trees and disappeared\" (Halt 1981). The following day, three seven- inch-diameter depressions were found at the site. That night \"burn marks\" were seen on trees, and radiation read- ings were also obtained. On an audiotape made by Deputy Base Commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt that same night, one hears an unidentified person call out regarding the bright light, \"There it is again ... there it is,\" with a five- second interval (\"Rendle sham\" 2011). Later that night\"three starlike objects\" were seen in the sky; one to the south, Halt (1981) said, \"was visible for two or three hours and beamed down a stream of light from time to time\"(Butler et al. 1984; Ridpath 1986; Hesemann 2001). As we now know, a bolide (a brilliant meteor) streaked over southern England at the time of the first Ren dle sham sighting. Subsequently, the Suffolk police investigated the initial sighting and determined that the only light visible from the area was that of the Orford lighthouse (Ridpath 1986).The Orford Ness beacon stood in the very direction airmen were looking and flashed at the same five-second interval reported for the UFO. Later, other claims were convincingly de bunked: the red and blue lights were froma police car; the \"landing\" depressions were rabbit diggings; on pines were axe blazings oozing resin; thelow radiation readings had been taken with equipment not intended to measure background radiation and were there- fore meaningless; and the starlike lights were probably in- deed stars, namely Sirius, Vega, and Deneb (\"Rendle sham\" 2011; Ridpath 1986). Mean while, the Rendlesham story remained unpublicized for almost three years. In October 1983 the story leaked out and made head- lines in the British tabloid News of the World: \"UFO Lands in Suffolk\u2014and That's Official.\" It was followed by a book,Sky Crash: A Cosmic Conspiracy (1984), written by Brenda Butler, Jenny Randles, and Dot Street and based in part on hypnosis sessions with \"Art Wallace\"\u2014actually former U.S.Airman Larry Warren who was the News of the World 's in- Shared motifs (as folklorists call story elements) suggest the Kecksburg incident was influenced by the Roswell story. One source even claimed bodies were recovered at Kecksburg but subsequently retracted the claim.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:02 AM Page 3536 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirerformant. Warren's claim to have been a witness to the Rendlesham incident has been disputed by others, including Halt (\"Rendle sham\" 2011). By this time bizarre rumors had surfaced that a com mander had met three little humanoid extraterrestrials who had emerged from the landed UFO, but the alleged contactee denied it (Butler et al. 1984, 86). In time, Jenny Randles, who helped hype the Rendle- sham incident, came to doubt the extraterrestrial connec- tion, stating, \"While some puzzles remain, we can probably say that no unearthly craft were seen in Rendle sham Forest. We can also argue with confidence that the main focus of the events was a series of misperceptions of everyday things encountered in less than everyday circumstances\" (qtd. in \"Rendle sham\" 2011). * * * No doubt other instances of the Ros wellian Syndrome could be given (even beyond UFO encounters), but the ones we have presented here are major examples of the type. Of course, each is different in its own way (for example, the Rendlesham Forest case had a much briefer period of sub- mergence than did Roswell). And some famous UFO in- cidents\u2014the Phoenix Lights of 1997, for instance (Daven - port 2001)\u2014have not followed the same course. (For oneapparent reason, it did not involve a specific site on theground visited by investigators.) Nevertheless, we believe we have identified a genuine pattern in cases in which, during a period of submergence,the mythologizing tendency has been at work followed bya reemergence\u2014rather like a new, more virulent strain of a virus. It appears that UFOlogists are always looking for a Holy Grail case to verify their belief in extraterrestrial vis-itation, and when that does not pan out (most UFO reportsprove little more than misidentifications, ambiguous sight- ings, fake photos, and the like) they seek out the old cases and are rewarded with much more sensational testimony. By identifying and analyzing this process, we hope to pro- mote more critical thinking regarding these and other sen- sationalized cases. n Acknowledgments Special thanks are due Timothy Binga, director of CFI Libraries, and Lisa Nolan, CFI librarian, for their repeated help with this report.

May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:20 AM Page 36The Trouble with Pseudoskepticism The continuing rejection of anthropogenic global warming by nonexperts despite overwhelming scientific consensus is rationally untenable and best described as \"pseudoskeptical.\" It is akin to AIDS denialism, advocacy of intelligent design, and anti-vaccination movements. LAWRENCE TORCELLO own biases. The integrally skeptical nature of science is most evident in the fact that science advances through ef- forts to disprove hypotheses, even when hope is held for their confirmation. This is described well by philosopher Karl Popper: The point is that, whenever we pro- pose a solution to a problem, we ought to try as hard as we can to overthrow our solution, rather than defend it. Few of us, unfortunately, practice this precept; but other peo- ple, fortunately, will supply the criti- cism for us if we fail to supply it our- selves. Yet criticism will be fruitful only if we state our problem as clearly as we can and put our solution in a sufficiently definite form\u2014a form inwhich it can be critically discussed. (Popper [1959] 2002, xix)Whatever else might be argued about the nature of science, genuine scientific research inherently in- volves skeptical rigor. Discrete scientific disci- plines approach topics of study in ways unique to the dis- cipline's methodological needs. A paleoclimatologist cannot conduct her investigations in the same manner that a pharmacological chemist working in a laboratory will conduct hers. Nevertheless, science does have at least one reliable component: the skeptical analysis of data. To be studied scientifically, a hypothesis must be testable. Inother words, science, regardless of its particular field, is a fundamentally skeptical endeavor involving the testing of hypotheses coupled with efforts to protect test results from confounding variables, including the researchers' May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:03 AM Page 3738 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerThe efforts Popper describes are re- flected in standard scientific practices, such as repeated and controlled experi-mentation, the publication of findingsonly after peer-reviewed critique, andthe requirement that such findings bepresented openly so that other re-searchers may attempt to replicate andindependently confirm or reject themunder the same rigorous constraints. In-deed, all of this is a necessary prerequi-site for any findings to take on a mean-ingful level of scientific acceptance, let alone consensus. A scientific theory be- comes accepted as such only once the laws observed, findings predicted, and facts organized under that proposed theory have been so rigorously tested and confirmed over time that it be- comes highly implausible (if neverthe-less logically possible) that the stated theory should ever be refuted. Any sci-entific theory as a whole will represent the accumulated and organized ex-planatory force of numerous repeatedly tested data points. Thus skeptical cri- tique is necessarily and inextricably partand parcel of the scientific process. However, as contrasted with science, the most evident characteristic of pseu-doscience is its utter credulity\u2014indeed itsdependence on credulity as a method-ological aspect of investigation. Simplyput, while scientists are busy attemptingto disprove a favored hypothesis andguarding themselves against the ever-pre-sent danger of confirmation bias, pseudo- scientists actively seek confirming evi- dence for what they have already deemedto be the case. This is so even for pseudo-scientists who eagerly attempt to appear skeptical. Paranormal investigators of thepseudoscientific stripe provide excellentexamples of this pretense. To call oneself a \"paranormal investigator\" (as opposed to an investigator of paranormal claims \u00e0 la Joe Nickell) is to already confess a belief that there is something paranormal to in- vestigate; the pursuit itself begs the essen-tial question. We do not fault the biologist for her well-warranted and uncontroversial be -lief in biological life, but we very well can fault the paranormal investigator for so eagerly believing in the paranormal. Yet pseudoscientists strive to appear skeptical, perhaps in part to win for themselvessome of the mandate or regard many people reserve for genuine skepticism. In their at tempts at wearing the garb ofskepticism, pseudoscientists often assert the shortcomings, failures, or dangers of some given well-established scientific consensus. When a pseudoscientist lack- ing expertise in a particular scientific do-main makes a show of openly contradict- ing well-established claims of scientific consensus, as is often the case with so-called \"alternative medicine,\" the pseu- doskeptical component of pseudoscience is made manifest. The word pseudoskepticism was coin - ed by the late sociologist and founding member of CSICOP (now CSI) Mar- cello Truzzi. The term, as originally used by Truzzi, is meant to identify a failureamong self-identified skeptics to remain in the face of extraordinary or supernat- ural claims. Truzzi's concern was that skeptics not abandon reasonable agnos- ticism in favor of a dismissive cynicism. Instead, Truzzi would have us remain true to the spirit of scientific inquiry by proportioning our beliefs to thestrength of evidence available. And when there is no supporting evidence available for a claim, Truzzi would have us call that claim unwarranted, rather than disproven (Truzzi 1987). Since it was introduced by Truzzi, the term pseudoskepticism has commonly been misused by promoters of the para- normal (and offended magical thinkers) as an ad hominem repudiation of theirWhen a pseudoscientist lacking expertise in a particular scientific domain makes a show of openly contradicting well-established claims of scientific consensus, as is often the case with so-called \"alternative medicine,\" the pseudoskeptical component of pseudoscience is made manifest. Global warming pseudoskepticism is on the rise in the industrialized nations most responsible for climate change.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:03 AM Page 38Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 39scientifically minded critics. Perhaps be- cause of this misappropriation, the term has failed to play a prominent role in theskeptic's lexicon. This is unfortunate,because it is a useful term; there is no compelling justification for associating it exclusively with the obstinate denial of paranormal claims. 1Dogmatic rejec- tion of reliable evidence, regardless of what that evidence supports, is always misguided. Of course, given the nature of most paranormal claims, and certainly those of the supernatural variety, it is improb- able if not impossible that sufficient sci-entific evidence could ever be gathered to justify warranted assertion. To admit this is not a sign of pseudoskepticism as Truzzi promoted the term but rather recognition that some types of claims, even if true, are beyond the scope ofwhat can be scientifically supported. Incontrast, pseudoskeptical cynicism is on display whenever nonexperts dogmati- cally deny the scientific explanationsheld in consensus by legitimate ex- perts\u2014for pseudoskepticism is precisely the skeptical artifice used by pseudosci-entists when marching in parade againstthe alleged oppression or conspiracy ofmainstream science. Since scientific consensus is reached through the organized skepticism in- herent to the scientific process, the termpseudoskepticism is most appropriatelyidentified as the negligent and unwar- ranted denial of established scientificconsensus. Thus, for the sake of clarity and ap - plication, I want to reconvene Truzzi's useful designation and expand upon the concept of pseudoskepticism to include that well-known pseudointellectual per- formance that involves the rejection of assertions already firmly established through the rigorous scientific process. Pseudoskepticism is a form of cynicism posturing as skepticism. It is fatuously premised on the assumption that doubt for doubt's sake is inherently rational\u2014 call this the \"cynic's fallacy.\" Such is ob- viously not the case when there is strongsupporting evidence in favor of a given claim. This form of cynicism tends to generate hostility toward scientific con- sensus or a misunderstanding of what is entailed in such consensus. Of course, this is not to argue that one cannot legitimately question scientific consensus; indeed, without constant test- ing and questioning, science would be indanger of stagnation. Scientific inquiryflourishes in the context of open intellec- tual contest, as evidenced by its skeptical nature. 2In scientific endeavors, a consen- sus only exists because all attempts to discount a given claim have insteadserved to strengthen the evidence for it.Pseudoskepticism, alternatively, can be understood in relation to three proposi- tions put forth by Ber trand Russell in\"On the Value of Skepticism\" ([1928]2005). As Russell puts it: There are matters about which those who have investigated them are agreed; the dates of eclipses may serve as an illustration. There are other matters about which experts are not agreed. Even when the ex perts all agree, they may well be mistaken. Einstein's view as to the magnitude of the deflection of light by gravitation would have been rejected by all ex-perts not many years ago, yet it proved to be right. Never theless the opinion of experts, when it is unani- mous, must be accepted by non-ex- perts as more likely to be right than the opposite opinion. The scepticismthat I advocate amounts only to this:(1) that when the ex perts are agreed, the opposite opinion cannot be held to be certain; (2) that when they are not agreed, no opinion can be re-garded as certain by a non-expert; and(3) that when they all hold that no suf-ficient grounds for a positive opinion exist, the ordinary man would do well to suspend his judgment. The identification of pseudoskepti- cism is consistent with Russell's in sights regarding the value of expertise. When- ever those outside the realm of active re- search into a particular topic willfully and without justification contradict estab-lished scientific consensus on that topic, they are acting as pseudoskeptics. Thus pseudoskepticism is most often, if not al- ways, displayed by those who lack expert- ise in a particular field and therefore most reasonably ought to proportion their be- lief to the accepted scientific consensus,when such consensus exists. Accordingly, when experts hold a consensus, skepticism or denial of that When mainstream science\u2014such as the efficacy and importance of vaccination\u2014comes under pseudoscientists' criticism, pseudoskeptical cynicism is on display.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 1:03 PM Page 3940 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirerconsensus on the part of laypersons is unreasonable and is therefore properly identified as pseudoskepticism. Afterasserting his skeptical propositions,Russell goes on to argue that if thesesimple propositions were to be ac -cepted, they would have positive, evenrevolutionary implications for human life. Russell therewith suggests that hisskeptical principles have certain moraland social implications. I submit thatagreeing with Russell in this regard re-quires only minimum reflection uponthe ethical responsibilities attached toinquiry and on the harms that threatensociety when superstitious and pseu-doskeptical think ing are accepted as thestatus quo. Prime examples of pseudoskepti- cism and its dangers are found in AIDS denialism, anti-vaccination advocacy,and\u2014perhaps most prominently in our current political mainstream\u2014the de- nialism of anthropogenic global warm- ing. It is worth dwelling on the latter form of pseudoskepticism for a mo- ment, for global warming pseudoskep- ticism is on the rise in the industrialized nations most responsible for climate change. 3At the same time, those who are most vulnerable to climate change are those least responsible for it and least able to adapt to it. As such, the moral hazard involved in this form of pseudoskepticism compounds its global dangers. Much can be said about the scientific facts of global warming, andall of it is available for anyone who wants to put the effort into learningthose facts. 4Rather than rehearsing the facts here, I want to focus on the rea- sonableness of sticking with expertconsensus, when such consensus exists, as the most practical method of avoid-ing pseudoskepticism. Regularly, in the course of teaching critical thinking to college students, Ifind that when informal logical fallacies are first encountered at the conceptuallevel, students tend to see them every- where\u2014like a kind of ideological parei- dolia. However, as I tell my students, aninformal fallacy is a fallacy because of what is not presented with it: namelywell-reasoned arguments, precise defini- tions, and supportive evidence. It is notthe case, as Russell points out so effec- tively, that every appeal to expertiseought to be considered a fallacious ap - peal to authority. This is not to say that experts cannot be wrong, but it is alwaysmore reasonable to appeal to an expert than a nonexpert when one lacks appro-priate expertise. It stands to reason that the more experts agree on a particulartopic, the more cause there is for nonex- perts to defer to their consensus. 5 Now again, in the case of well-estab- lished scientific consensus like the oneregarding anthropogenic global warm- ing, the denial of expert opinion by non-experts is pseudoskeptical. It is thereforea misleading folly for us to agree to call global warming deniers \"skeptics\" or toblithely ignore this designation of their denialism in the popular media or else- where. Skepticism implies the critical analysis that is the hallmark of science,and skepticism is precisely what has es-tablished the overwhelming consensus among working climatologists for an- thropogenic global warming. To denythe legitimacy of this consensus whileclaiming to be a \"skeptic\" would requirean unjustified double standard regard- ing one's appreciation of the scientific process. Global warming denialism is no longer a tenable position to be held by those who consider themselves to be ra-tional skeptics. Predictably and increasingly, the de- nial of anthropogenic global warming is taking on the hallmark trappings of pseudoscience, including conspiratorialclaims about climatology and climatol-ogists, irrelevant appeals to nature (\"if it is consistent with natural cycles, then it is not a threat\"), truly fallacious appeals to authority, the elevation of dissenters to romantic levels of heroism, and theunwillingness to proportion belief to ra- tionally considered evidence. To call such obdurate denialism \"skepticism\" is a gross misnomer that undermines sci- ence as well as the potency of genuine skepticism. It is high time the skepticalcommunity as a whole call out global warming denialism for the pugnaciouspseudoskepticism that it is, and that we attack it with the same gusto and criticalsavvy heretofore reserved for intelligent design proponents and anti-vaccinationquacks. 6n Notes 1. The concept of false skepticism is occasion- ally applied more usefully, and still consistently with Truzzi's use of \"pseudoskepticism,\" against those who support dubious forms of denialism on dogmatic or ideological grounds (as is the case, for example, with AIDS denialism). (These are the same dubious forms of denialism identified in this essay.) See especially Richard Cameron Wilson's article \"Against the Evidence\" (online at www. newstatesman.com/ideas/2008/09/evidence-scep- tic-hiv-bogus) as well as his book Don't Get Fooled Again(2008). I maintain, with Wilson, that pseu- doskepticism is most often a product of ideologi- cal motivation rather than of balanced inquiry. Be- yond embracing the dogmatism of ideology, the pseudoskeptic can be identified by a misguided, cynical, and fallacious \"doubt for doubt's sake.\" However, my emphasis is exclusively on the de- nialism of well-established scientific consensus,Prime examples of pseudoskepticism and its dangers are found in AIDS denialism, anti-vaccination advocacy, and\u2014perhaps most prominently in our current political mainstream\u2014the denialism of anthropogenic global warming.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 3:56 PM Page 40because that type of denialism occurs outside of the legitimate scientific process. I place emphasis on such denialism again here, as I have elsewhere (see Torcello 2011), in order to provide a more consistent criterion by which to identify pseu- doskepticism and in order to attach moral culpa- bility to it in the context of political discourse. 2. In the course of normal scientific investi- gation, a scientific consensus may be challenged by researchers actively investigating the relevant topic; however, the burden is upon the researchers to demonstrate their alternative hypothesis within the standard parameters of the scientific process (i.e., empirical research, peer-review, re- peated independent replication by other re- searchers, etc.). To be clear, doubt of established consensus in so far as it plays a role in legitimate research guided by the scientific process is not pseudoskeptical, but ignoring established scien- tific consensus is pseudoskeptical. 3. Much of the increasing pseudoskepticism regarding global warming is attributable to a well-organized, and well-documented, campaign against legitimate climate science on the part of corporate polluters\u2014and politicians under the fi- nancial influence of such corporate interests. See George Monbiot's Heat: How to Stop the Planet from Burning (2007) and Chris Mooney's The Republican War on Science (2007). 4. A good place to begin learning about anthro pogenic global warming is by turning to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was created to serve as an authoritativesource for disseminating information on the sci- entific findings regarding climate change (www. ipcc.ch/). Another extremely valuable source, and perhaps even more valuable than the IPCC reports for those who are just beginning to learn about the science of climate change research, is the website RealClimate: Climate Science from Climate Sci- entists(www.realclimate.org/index. php/archives /2007/05/start-here/). Another informative source is the website Science: Get ting Skepticalabout Global Warming Skep ticism (www.skepti-calscience.com/). I would prefer, for obvious rea- sons, if the subtitle read \"Getting Skeptical about Global Warming Pseudo skepticism.\" Finally, the National Center for Science Education (http://ncse.com/climate) has made the defense of climate science a part of its mandate, a move that ought to be applauded widely by all advocates of science and skepticism. 5. Massimo Pigliucci provides a very useful discussion of expertise and how to sort through expertise, along with an important exploration of how politics can thwart the public's proper un- derstanding of science in cases like climate change in his recent Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk (2010). 6. Elsewhere, I have argued for an ethical duty among academics, politicians, and journalists to publicly confront and counter pseudoskeptical claims against scientific consensus when such claims are made in the context of public policy debates.

But PTSD does not meet the criteria for a real psychiatric- medical disease. PETER BARGLOWMay June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 1:07 PM Page 434 4 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer Today, 400,000 war veterans obtain financial assistance for this medical condition. Of two million Iraq andAfghan istanveterans, 10 percent are es-timated to have PTSD. It is the topicof hundreds of psychiatric and psychol-ogy articles per year and absorbs largeannual national expenditures for treat- ment and re search. Out of $3.8 billionawarded as a result of U.S. Congres - sional funding bill HR2638 to the U.S.Veterans Admini stration (VA) in 2009for mental illness, the single largestmental disease category funded wasPTSD. Between 2004 and 2009, 20percent of the estimated half a millionIraq-Afghanistan war veteran patientswere treated for PTSD. The first year ofthis health care cost was 1.4 billion dol-lars (U.S. Congres sional Budget Office2012). How did it come about that thediagnosis of PTSD became so widelyaccepted by the Veterans Health System(VHA), the American Psychi atric As-sociation, and the American public? This question first was raised in my mind when two decades ago I did a psy-chiatric evaluation of a fifty-year-oldVietnam veteran, a Purple Heart recip-ient with a voluminous official historyof treatment for PTSD. A few weeksearlier he had threatened to kill bothhimself and his therapist in her office at a VA outpatient psychiatric clinic. Hewas disabled by use of a Taser gun by police, who had stormed the building. They seized him while he was un - conscious, and transported him to a prison. The patient was an unemployedmarried Hispanic man, wounded during the war's Tet offensive. His record indi- cated that he had suffered for many years from PTSD symptoms such as hyper-arousal, insomnia with night- mares about Viet Cong snipers, and paranoid fears; these increased during binges of alcohol use. I had anticipated a confrontation with a huge, menacingfigure but found the man to be a mild- mannered little guy who resembled Woody Allen. He said that he hadnoted none of the above PTSD symp- toms for many months, but he was deeply concerned about retaining max-imum VA compensation for this diag-nosis. My surprise at the apparent cure of this former soldier's mental disease prompted me to review several dozen medical-psychiatric records of Vietnam veterans diagnosed with PTSD by meor other VA and military psychiatrists. I also reinterviewed over a dozen pa-tients. PTSD symptoms listed in DSM-IV are memory loss or distress- ing flashbacks referring to battle events, hyper-vigilance, poor sleep with recur- rent nightmares, irritability, startles, and episodes of emotional numbness. (This last symptom appears to be the single most important one in verifying thePTSD diagnosis [Pietrzak 2009].) Thecurrent APA diagnosis re quires appear- ance of characteristic symptoms after alatency period of time subsequent to a specific severe precipitating traumatic event\u2014constituting \"Criterion A,\" dis- cussed below. Several patients also shared with me considerable discomfort with the labelof PTSD, which to them signified an emasculating weakness or dishonestyrather than a genuine illness. A search for financial benefits did appear to be one important factor in shaping thenarratives of both patients and clini- cians. This suggested the advantages for veterans (\"secondary gain\") of re porting typical PTSD symptoms, but it also re-flected compassion of VA evaluatingstaff toward patients who clearly hadsuffered severely during and after war- fare. The record review showed consid- erable co-morbidity (when a disease category overlaps with one or more other major psychiatric diagnoses, suchas Major Depressive Disorder or AcuteStress Disorder), and many of the pa- tients used addicting drugs (alcohol,marijuana, pain killers, or amphetamine stimulants). Substance dependence was almost impossible to disentangle fromPTSD symptoms. Unlike my patient whom I de scribed earlier, few veterans with PTSD im -proved very much during the many years that had elapsed since their initial clinical assessment. Often DSM-IV clinical criteria for PTSD had beenSince 1980 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been a major mental illness category of the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In this article I critically examine the use of this diagnosis to treat soldiers suffering from the aftermath of physical and emotional war trauma. The term PTSD, referring to a psy- chiatric disease or disorder, appeared in the New York Times 19,000 times in the ten years between August 14, 2000, and August 15, 2010, compared to only 450 times during the prior twenty years. Several patients . . . shared with me considerable discomfort with the label of PTSD, which to themsignified an emasculating weakness or dishonestyrather than a genuine illness.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:04 AM Page 44Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 45carelessly applied to veterans whose post-war lives had been dominated by poverty, unemployment, homelessness,and family disruptions because of vio-lence, drugs, or divorce. A Brief History of PTSD The DSM classification system was created in 1952. Its first two editions (I [1952] and II [1968]) were based upon Freud's psychoanalytic formulations.The etiology of mental disorders wasthought to originate in early-life trau-matic experiences. However, a major change in thinking about the conceptof a mental disorder and its etiology oc-curred in the 1970s, reflected in DSM-III (1980). There was a marked shiftaway from attention to early childhoodhistories. Valiant attempts were madeto mimic mainstream medicine and surgery using their ancient etiological categories\u2014trauma, cancer producing,infectious, toxic, degenerative, genetic,metabolic, and endocrine. But psychiatric disorders proved dif- ficult to classify with quantifiablechemical findings or specific identify-ing clinical signs. The revised DSMsystems (in an effort to establish reliableguidelines for diagnosticians) still had to rely substantially upon self-reported descriptions of symptoms, not on meas-urable data. DSM I-III systems' cate- gorical decisions reflected literature re- views, some data analysis, periodic field trials, and the outcome of verbal de- bates between experts. That complex decision-making process used patients' clinical information but had to relyupon fallible doctors' judgments. A bet- ter approach to diagnosis creation wasclearly needed, and so psychiatric re- search in the early 1990s was increas-ingly devoted to the human brain. PTSD was first listed in the 1980 edition of the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) and modified later in DSM- IV and DSM-IV-TR. Its ap pearance in the official APA nomenclature followed years of intense lobbying effort by Viet-nam veterans' organizations, activist so-cial workers, psychologists, and anti-war psychiatrists. Advo cates for the PTSD diagnosis asserted that traumatic mem-ories of war experiences were being re- vived in contemporary time, producinga new serious men tal illness. Soldiers should be treated and compensated for A 1889 line drawing of the Greek hero Herakles, afflicted with something akin to PTSD brought on by the violence of his twelve labors, by the artist August Baumeister. It originates in a Greek-Sicilian vase painting signed by the artist Asteas (350-320 BCE), depicting a theater performance in which the Herakles of the dramatist Euripides is about to immolate the first of his three children while his wife attempts to escape his psychotic wrath.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:04 AM Page 4546 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirera disorder attributable to events that took place many years earlier. This un-derstanding necessitated a shift in at- tention away from the psychodynamicsof individual veterans, and other risk variables, to a heavy emphasis upon a single major factor\u2014the negative after-effects of war trauma on later mentalhealth. The leaders of the American psychi- atric profession who became midwivesto the official birth of PTSD duringthe 1970s shared today's almost univer- sal belief that large-scale suffering ofothers matters universally and that itdemands to be recognized and amelio- rated. This moral value probably ac- counted for the diagnostic inclusion of Criterion A, which has generated heated debate since its original inclu-sion in the 1980 DSM-III. Criterion A for PTSD states that a patient diag- nosed with PTSD was confronted with \"events that involved actual or threat- ened death or serious injury...\" and re- sponded with \"intense fear, helpless- ness, or horror.\" Criterion A made PTSD the only DSM mental disorderthat required a subjective appraisal of an external environmental stressor aspart of its diagnosis. Retention of the trauma criterion has been supported bythe observation that studies of symp-toms unconnected to a specific precip- itant have failed to identify any \"char-acteristic set of symptoms\" (North et al.2009). Also this position is consistentwith the conclusion that treatment con-centrating on specific trauma memoriesand their meaning is more effective than nontrauma-focused therapy (Ehlers et al. 2010). But the criterion does have many problems. One statistical piece of evi- dence against inclusion of documenta-tion of a quantitative trigger to facilitatemaking a diagnosis is that most soldiers do not develop an anxiety disorder or any major psychiatric disorder even when exposed to the most horrifictrauma. The widespread application ofCriterion A ignores vast individual variations in patients' resilience and ca- pacity to adapt. Its reliance upon sub- jective reports rather than objective eyewitness evidence further weakens itsscientific status. For the preceding rea- sons, Criterion A does not appear in the PTSD diagnosis category of the In-ternational Classification of Mental Diseases (ICD-10). The importance of this diagnostic criterion in determining the size of dis- ability benefits for veterans with PTSDhas been diminished by new VA stan- dards issued by the Obama admini -stration in 2010. The VA policy nowstates that VA psychiatrists need not re- quire proof of the quantitative impactof a traumatic precipitant. This VA pol- icy change was inspired by a deep con-cern for the suffering of victims and largely ignored the APA's PTSD Cri-terion A, which may be deleted from DSM-V's definition. Does PTSD Meet the Criteria for a Valid Psychiatric Diagnosis? The diagnosis of PTSD has always had many critics, ranging from McHugh and Treisman (2007), who boldly consider PTSD to be a \"faddish postulate\" that \"creates a medical condition out of nor- mal distress,\" to the meticulous scholars Rosen and Lilienfeld (2007), who con-cluded that the disorder's \"core assump- tions and hypothesized mechanisms lack compelling or consistent empirical sup- port.\" Robins and Guze (1970) proposed five research areas in which a psychiatric diagnosis might be validated: (1) clinicaldescription including precipitants and diagnostic stability over biolog- hormonal, and radiological quanti- the disorder's characteristics andother psychiatric conditions; (4) familyor genetic statistical connections be tween patients in the diagnostic category; (5) treatment relevance and success related to precise diagnosis. Schizophrenia, major depression, and alcohol depend- ence are examples of mental disorders that have achieved considerable legiti-macy through this process, but PTSD as a diagnosis for war veterans has not yet attained comparable validity. The above five research domains con- stitute fertile ground for further re-exam- ining PTSD's diagnostic weaknesses and generating potential remedies: Source: McClatchy analysis of VA data Graphic: Judy TreiblePTSD benefits for vets vary How two VA offices differ in their assessments of disability ratings for PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) cases and benefits for recent veterans*: Lack of consistency in disability ratingsBenefit awarded Annual amount awarded at each disability level at current rates**How ratings at two regional offices compare Louisville, Ky. 1%7%Sioux Falls, S.D. 0%11%25% 47%29%21% cases 1,623 No. of cases 428 *Left active duty in 2003 or later **Rates increase each year; for single veteran with no childrenMay June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 3:57 PM Page 46Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 47Clinical Description and Precipitants. The VA patient I described earlier is an example of diagnostic instability. The weakness of Criterion A suggests aproblematic relation between PTSD and specific precipitants. These days it is obvious that patients suffering fromthe emotional aftermath of warfare havenot demonstrated consistent symptom patterns. Perhaps, then, we can better comprehend the emotional toll of recentAmerican wars by applying the sociolog- ical concept that throughout history powerful professional and political com-munities have constructed truth, estab- lished definitions, and generated rules for the interpretation of trauma's impact. This viewpoint provides insight into the history of emotional war trauma and explains its massively varying conceptu-alizations and manifestations. Like \"Historical Critical Psychopathology\" (Bald win et al. 2004), it emphasizes\"his - torically situated and contingent aspectsof mental disorders.\" Using such a framework of under- standing, the earliest PTSD portrayalmay be the fourth-century character Herakles, created by the dramatist Eu- ripides. Driven insane by a Greek god-dess, he suffered a transitory murderousfrenzy precipitated by the violence of his twelve labors. A messenger inquires of him, \"Has the blood of the men you recently killed driven you out of yourwits?\" Over two millennia later, emo- tional victims of American Civil War trauma were said to be afflicted with \"Soldier's Heart\" (1864-1868), and 1886) showed psycho- logical and physical characteristics quite different from those used currently to identify PTSD. Such patients in the latter half of the nineteenth century experienced bodily shaking and tremors of arms and legs, stuttering, and limping, but they did not report anger, numbing sensations, or flashback symp toms as contemporary PTSD victims often do. Civil War victims' clinical presenta- tions resembled those reported during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), when emotional casualties began to betreated with considerable respect. Many Russian psychiatrists argued that af- flicted soldiers had a \"real illness.\" Eng- lish and German \"shell shock\" victims and Russian \"contusion\" casualties dur- ing World War I (1914-1918) also demonstrated a quite different symp- tom constellation from that character- istic of PTSD in twenty-first-century America. European patients manifested multiple sensory-motor signs such as deafness, muteness, and blindness. Such striking historical dissimilarities in the psychological clinical phenomena of post-war emotional syndromes suggest they resemble cultural constructionsmore than disease categories. Cultural factors may also influence treatment outcome; PTSD victims in Kenya found help in their religious commu- nity, in contrast to Okla homa City bombing survivors who received benefit from medical treatments (North 2009). Brain Structure and Neurophysiologic Studies. Since DSM-IV appeared in 1994, there has been a massive increase in U.S. research efforts to demonstrate that an organic central nervous system disturbance causes PTSD. This cam- paign was named \"embodiment\" by skeptics who deplored the use of inap- propriate comparison groups and the contaminating role of \"cultural ex -pectancy\" in the studies mobilized to create a more precise and useful PTSD diagnostic category (Baldwin et al. 2004). The search for organic brain changes as the source of PTSD symp- toms was fueled by the belief that war's emotional stress could affect brain physiology and chemistry negatively, producing permanent and characteristic post-trauma symptom patterns. The first major effort to argue this position originated during the 1905 Russo- Japanese war through studies of soldiers who suffered from \"contusion,\" a puz- zling nervous breakdown during or after combat. The psychology versus brain change etiological debate became even more active during World War I (1914-1918) in Europe with research about \"shell shock.\" Since the Korean War (1950-1953), multiple research efforts in English- speaking countries have sought distinct patterns of psycho-physiological arousal in PTSD. But measurements of neuro- transmitter levels across most popula-tions with the disease showed marked differences of quantity, including a com- plete failure to show heightened re - sponses in a quarter of cases. Acute stress has been shown to activate the centralnervous system to release catechola - mines, norepinephrine and epinephrine, into the bloodstream. But patients withacute PTSD symptoms have normalplasma concentrations of these sub-stances. Only those with chronic PTSD have increased cerebrospinal fluid nor- epinephrine levels that correlate with the severity of PTSD symptoms.

Malfunction of the hypothalamus- pituitary-adrenal hormonal axis hasbeen postulated in those PTSD victimswho have lowered blood cortisol who demonstrate enhanced cortisolsuppression with dexamethasone andexaggerated cortisol secretion during stressful exposure. But findings havebeen inconsistent or subtle, and manyhormonal studies lack hormone leveldata pre-exposure to stress. Recentprospective longitudinal studies have shown that low cortisol levels in PTSD patients may actually have preceded, notfollowed, a traumatic event. Finally, cor-tisol levels vary dramatically secondaryto numerous biological, temporal, andpsychological variables, making them anunreliable biological marker. Another major effort to find a neu- robiological correlate to PTSD scanning. Extrapo latingfrom animal stress models, it was sug-gested that elevated corticosteroids(adrenocorticotropic hormone, or corti-sol) in patients with PTSD could pro- duce toxic damage to the hippocampus. The function of memory is thought to reside there, and the structure's compro- mise might be related to flashbacks and nightmare symptoms. But there is only weak evidence for this link in humans.Also, most human studies have failed to control for other psychiatric disorders associated with hippocampal atrophy, including alcoholism. Smaller hip- pocampal volume is a relatively nonspe-cific finding that also has been reportedto be associated with depression and even borderline personality disorder.Statistical associations between emo- tional war trauma, PTSD, and size of brain structures remain highly specula- tive and unproven. PTSD Boundaries with Other Psychiatric Disorders.The diagnosis of PTSD today is made by the use of standardized tests, such as the self-report PTSD Symptoms Checklist, the Clini cian Ad- ministered PTSD Scale, and a Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders. But still,PTSD is poorly separated from other major psychological disorders, and its diagnostic stability is low, as illustrated by my patient vignette in the introduc- tion of this article. Using current diag- nostic criteria, PTSD has consistently been found to overlap other major psy- chiatric disorders. Kessler et al. (1996) found that 88 percent of a large sample of U.S. patients with PTSD met DSM- III or IV clinical-case data criteria for at least one other major mental disorder,most often chemical dependence. PTSD does have convergent validity with major depressive disorder (95 percent lifetimeand 50 percent co-occurring) in combatveterans. Further research on the central-ity of \"numbing\" may help establishPTSD as an independent diagnostic en-tity (Pietrzak 2009). The medical condition traumatic brain injury (TBI) is also difficult to dis- tinguish from PTSD. TBI is a brain concussion caused by a blow to the head that changes a soldier's consciousness, resulting in amnesia and neurological abnormalities. TBI can result from dam-age sustained from bullets, bombs, falls, or vehicle accidents. TBIs may be con-ceptually related to the above historicalconcepts of English \"shell shock\" and Russian \"contusion\" traumata. Genetic Studies Related to Emotional Consequences of Battle Trauma. Such re- search remains suggestive rather than convincing. Molecular genetics has yetto identify specific genes that confer a vulnerability to PTSD. Although ge- netic research does support a biologicalcomponent of PTSD, it has failed todistinguish it from other related (co-morbid) psychiatric diagnoses. One study showed that shared genetics ac- counted for 30 percent of the variancein PTSD symptoms in Vietnam War veteran twins, even after taking into ac- count different levels of combat expo- sure. Stein et al. (2002) proved in 1999 that genetics contributes to both the tendency for a subject to be exposed to traumas involving assault and a vulner-ability to develop PTSD after exposure.Such results have led to the theory that a combination of genes and environ-ment are necessary to develop PTSDsymptoms, a proposal that contradicts the assumption that trauma is the coreetiological agent. The preceding obser-vations are consistent with the idea thatPTSD may be distinguishable fromother common disorders. The PTSD Diagnosis Used to Guide Treat ment of the Illness. Experts today do not yet know if the prolonged emo- tional suffering following physical oremotional war trauma can be amelio- rated, let alone cured. The Institute of Medicine carefully evaluated fifty-three drug studies and thirty-seven psy- chotherapy studies (National Acad emyof Sciences 2008). Their team of aca- demic specialists examined the evidence (or lack of evidence) for the success of anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, MAOIs, SSRIs and other antidepressants, and other remedies such as Eye MovementDesensitization and Reprocessing (EM -DR). Their summary concluded thatthere was insufficient scientific evidenceto determine that any treatment (except possibly Prolonged Exposure Therapy) Statistical associations between emotional war trauma, PTSD, and size of brain structures remain highly speculative and unproven. May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 3:59 PM Page 48Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 49had beneficial long-term effects for PTSD. Their report noted that drugmanufacturers had funded many stud-ies, possibly biasing their outcomes, andthat too many research patients haddropped out of experiments to allow ro- bust conclusions about efficacy. Little isknown about what kind of patients ben-efit from which treatments. On April 26, 2010, the New York Timespublished an article that de scribed the plight of veterans who were physicaland emotional casualties, slated for dis- charge, temporarily hospitalized at FortCarson's Warrior Transi tion Battalionunit. Inmates and their close familymembers depicted absent or poor psychi-atric treatment, overmedication, bureau-cratic delays, and prescription of drugsthat fostered ad diction to heroin. Poly-pharmacy treatment anti-anxiety, antidepressant, agents)recently has been associated with acci- dental death in U.S. veterans with thiscondition ( New York Times , February 14, 2011). Such reports are painful remindersthat neither the U.S. military establish-ment nor the Veterans Administrationhas learned quite enough to treat victimsof emotional war trauma effectively. \"Prolonged Exposure Therapy,\" orig- inated and proven efficacious by EdnaFoa, remains the most evidence-sup-ported successful intervention. It helpstraumatized soldiers to approachtrauma-related thoughts, feelings, and situations previously avoided becausethey cause distress. The technique useseducation, breathing exercises, safe re- exposure to painful avoided or un - avoidable war experiences, and \"talking through\" a patient's individual history of trauma. A couple of my own PTSD pa- tients who tried this method felt that it reawakened and reactivated traumatic memories that appeared to have been forgotten, making their emotional dis- tress even worse. This possible disadvan- tage for a portion of the war-trauma- tized population may be comparable to the reaction that some alcoholic addicts have experienced during Alco holics Anonymous meetings. The ex plicitsharing with others of vivid ex periences associated with the ravages of the disease stimulates them to drink right after a seemingly successful meeting. Also evi- dence for effectiveness of exposure ther-apy is not as strong for veterans as it isfor civilians. Recent empirical research studies in- dicate that cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is also often effective in treating the emotional aftermath of warfare. Themethod tries to modify perceptions of aspecific war trauma and its reproduction. Conclusions Currently there is little benefit in direct- ing treatment interventions toward pa- tients diagnosed with PTSD, an amor- phous disease category with indistinct conceptual boundaries and without afirm biological foundation. Money might be more prudently spent on im mediatepost-trauma intervention ad dressing in-dividual patients' symptoms. Treatmentof concurrent depression, addiction, andother anxiety conditions may be far more valuable than targeting chronic symp-toms and decades-later psychological af-termaths. All ap proaches must amelio-rate and marital and familial friction. Acute post-traumatic symptomsmust not be transformed into a chronic compensated disability, set in stone by its designation as an official major DSM disease syndrome. The use of the PTSD diagnosis may contribute to treatment failures becauseit fabricates a spurious invalid categoryof illness, rather than seeing a uniquesufferer. A humane society must com- pensate and reward all military victimswith generosity, but strict application ofCriterion A of the PTSD diagnosis does not accomplish this purpose. PTSD appears to be more of a socialconstruction than a medical brain dis-ease, and as of this date can best be con- sidered \"as encompassing a broad rangeof possible reactions to adverse events\" (Rosen and Lilienfeld 2007, 858). Fi- nally, the stigma associated with this di-agnosis of a mental illness may keepsome veterans from seeking care. Theshortcomings of the current PTSD di- agnosis jeopardize the treatment of the terrible aftermath of war's emotional trauma. n Acknowledgment I thank Dave Wilson, MD, (an internal medicine resident at Stanford Medical School) for assistance with review of the bi- ological substratum of PTSD.

ELIE A. SHNEOURMay June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:04 AM Page 50There remain in the world today sev- eral other orthodoxies, led by religious fanatics, that torture and kill in the nameof religion. Some of them use animaland human sacrificial rituals. On theother hand, to have one's virtual ticket toheaven punched one must pay for theprivilege granted religion by exacting anumber of conditions in return. They in-clude strict adherence to specific rules of conduct and financial sacrifices by thewilling believer. By contrast, the wicked(comprising those born or raised outsidethe faith, unbelievers, nonbelievers, cheats,murderers, thieves,and the like) are likelyto be condemned to eternal damnation, which usually involves a hellish existencein some underground sea of eternalflames ruled by the Devil. The miscre-ant's fall from grace, however, need not be fatal if he or she recants the behavior in time. He or she may yet be pardoned by taking on burdensome obligations for the remission of sins. This is how reli- gions have dominated man kind since time im memorial. They offer a collective vision of a benevolent eternity for the price of remaining an integral, potent part of human society. But today, life on Earth is more rapidly becoming gratify- ing while the possibility for a supernat-ural life after death is becoming increas-ingly problematic and distant. The cornerstone of almost all estab- lished religions rests on ancient texts claimed to have been divinely inspired, although an argument can be made thatall of them qualify as heavenly hearsay. Many have been translated into the common spoken and written language.They include the Septuagint, an earlytranslation of the Hebrew Old Testa - ment into Greek. Then there is theComplutensian Polyglot, the Old and New Testament of the King James Biblerendered in quintessential Eng lish, theRamayana, the Bhagavad Gita as part of the Mahabarata, the Book of Mormon and the Pearl of Great Price, the Koran and the Hadith, the Torah and the wis-doms of the Midrash with the Babylon-ian and the Jerusalem Tal muds. These texts are usually grounded on a set of ar- chaic dogmas, implausible beliefs, and fallacious precepts, such as the golden tablets as one of the divine sources forthe Book of Mormon. These texts inevitably clash against the coherent, rational, scientific ad vances that increasingly overwhelm religious histories, dictates, and dogmas. In all se- riousness, some advanced religions still dispense such improbable yarns as anaked Eve in the Garden of Eden speak- ing with a snake. They allege the immac- ulate conception of Jesus by Marythrough the intervention of the Holy Ghost. They assert that the Red Sea parted to allow Jews dry passage fromEgypt to the Holy Land. More generally,these religions have been generatingmiraculous happenstances for which re- liable evidence is never likely to be found. For the rational person, it is increas- ingly difficult to accept these religious tenets. Indeed, to belong to most reli- gions one must suspend wholesale mon- umental disbeliefs of the modern world and instead accept supernatural magical explanations. With scientific advances expanding the human view of the uni-verse, it is understandable why so few major religions have emerged in the pastthousand years. Given these wide-rang- ing impediments, it is not surprising that religions in almost all their formsare neither willing to deal with the modern world nor capable of doing so. This explains, in part, why the atten-dance at churches, synagogues, and mosques for religious events is slowly but palpably decreasing. Religions over Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 51The Roman Catholic Church's remarkably concise statement of its core beliefs, the Credo, includes this pivotal article of faith that sustains and justifies most religions: \" Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum et vitam venture seaculi\"\u2014\"[I believe] and await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.\" Surely, life on Earth was truly miserable for nearly everybody until fairly recently. Through the ages the promise of comfort and im- mortality after earthly demise has been a powerful incen-tive for religious adhesion. In fact, failure to belong in toto to the Church, for example, was harshly punished by the ecclesiastical Roman Inquisition tribunal (1542-1908), which dealt out severe questioning thatincluded torture to coerce the victim to recant and return to the fold. Those judged guilty of heresy incurred harsh penalties including death by fire. In all seriousness, some advanced religions still dispense such improbable yarns as a naked Eve in the Garden of Eden speaking with a snake.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:04 AM Page 5152 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirerthe longer term seem doomed to even- tual irrelevance. They appear to be wellon the way to eventually turning into mere historical curiosities, but that willnot happen effortlessly or soon becausereligions still carry considerable sway in the world. Among the active religions of today, Judaism is one of the oldest and is con- spicuous for its remarkable survival inthe face of brutal existential assaults. Ju- daism covers a gamut of conflicting fac- tions, many of which are based on fierce resistance to change. The scholars of old wrote many religious texts by borrowingliberally from other mythological tradi- tions. For example, the four-thousand-year-old Babylonian Epic of Gamesh originated the story of a heavily animal- laden ark enduring a torrential rainfall and then ending up stuck on a mountain top. The Roman Catholic Church waseventually divided as a result of the six- teenth-century Refor ma tion intoProtestant denominations, which in turnwere still further divided. Islam emergedfrom the dictates of the prophetMuham mad, who preached an uncom-promising form of monotheism in theseventh century. Although there is a the- oretical Islamic underpinning of belong- ing to a single community, Islam also fragmented early into a number of sects, some of which continue to fight each other in a murderous frenzy to this day. Hinduism emerged from bloody sacrifi- cial cults brought in by Arian invaders in India around 1500 BCE. Buddhism began as a revolt in the sixth century BCE against orthodox Hinduism through the influence of Siddhartha Gau tama, uni- versally known as Buddha. Confucius in China did not preach the existence of a deity but of a mandatory system of goodconduct that he introduced 2,500 years ago. Jainism was also introduced in the sixth century BCE, as yet another religion that taught nonviolence in revolt againstHinduism. Shinto in Japan was once a sect with reverence for Kami, a polythe- ist sacred power that eventually became distorted in order to sustain the brutal militarism of the 1930s and early1940s\u2014but its origins are lost in the early folklore of the country. The central conclusion about religion has to be that it has not made any lasting impact on human ethics, the primary en- gine for its existence. In this respectalone, religion has failed dismally, as the world remains today at the uneasy threshold of a worldwide nuclear threat, looking helplessly at the hecatomb thatwas the twentieth century. The single most significant element discrediting religion is the inexorably growing impact of science. That pro cess began in earnest in sixteenth-century Europe and received a dramatic boost that had far-reaching implications not only for science but for the Roman Catholic Church as well. It was Coper- nicus (1473-1543) who mathematicallydethroned Earth as the center of thePtolemaic universe and postulated a he- liostatic solar system, degrading theEarth to a much lesser position in the firmament. His work was confirmed byGalileo (1564-1642), who not only ex-perimentally confirmed and supported the heliocentric theory developed by Co pern icus but is actually considered the pioneer of the experimental method. This did not sit well with the Roman Catholic Church of the time, and stern opposition to Galileo's helio- centric system by the Church did not fully end until 1922. Now the Churchhas issued restrictions to human repro- duction and stem cell research. Manyother religions also have concerns aboutwhere scientific research is going and the risk it is posing to their beliefs. In the long run these restrictions are not likelyto be effective. There can be no doubtthat science will eventually triumph. What makes the advance of scien- tific work possible is that there is an easy and fruitful give and take betweenscience and technology; neither of these can possibly have an intrinsic fruitful relationship with religion. There is a major difference between science and technology: science is a way of thinking while technology is a way of doing.Technology provides no clear contribu-tion to the eventual doom of religion because it dwells on an entirely differ- ent logical platform from science. Thatdifference between them is important.Technology is an altogether distinctconcept from science, although these two terms are almost always used inter- changeably and indiscriminately. Theextraordinary example is China, which was a veritable fountainhead of major technological inventions. These in- cluded the compass in the third century BCEand the development of medi- cine\u2014the use of the pulse for diagnosiswas recorded in the remarkable Book of Titles, dating back to the eleventh cen- tury BCE. Gun powder was first used for fireworks in the second century BCE; writing paper was available from 105 CEonward, and printing with movable type was developed in the seventh cen- tury CE. These were truly remarkable techno- logical fruits of the human mind that Europeans didn't recognize and adopt until much later. Not surprisingly, there is no whiff of religious chicanery in them because religion is blinded by\"having the word\" that transcends sci- entific thoughts and technological pur-suits, intentionally resisting change to protect its wobbly edifice of dogma. This is what makes every attempt toreconcile religion with science and/or technology a virtually unattainable goal. One of my sometime mentors was paleontologist and Jesuit priest PierreThe central conclusion about religion has to be that it has not made any lasting impact on human ethics, the primary engine for its existence.May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 4:01 PM 52Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 53Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955). We encountered each other in France,where I lived, and later on in New York,where he died. He tried but failed toconvince me to consider a Jesuit frame-work for my life, but I learned the cat-echism in the interim and sang untilfairly recently exquisite masses and re-quiems by a variety of composers\u2014from Gregorian chants and early musicto contemporaries\u2014in a number ofchurches and secular venues. Much of that music is awesomely beautiful in the main, but it neither subverted me nor provided me with a coherent conver- gence between religion, science, andtechnology, just as Pierre was unable todo so. This discouragingly futile effortto achieve consistency between scienceand religion is broadly ongoing today.A dominant factor is individuals' re- peated but failed attempts to seek atleast a rational link between religionand ethics. Ethics is a major factor in science but plays no discernible role intechnology. Ethics consists of wiseguides for human behavior that are vi-tally important to civilizing pursuits.They ensure the survival and prosperityof the human society. By contrast, reli-gious precepts and prohibitions usuallyimpose a hostile burden on outsidersand infidels who reject adherence totraditional and ancient norms, most ofwhich long ago reached obsolescence. It was Voltaire (1694-1778) who ex - claimed in disgust as he left one ofmany interminable religious disputa-tions of his time, \"There are no sects ingeometry!\" By contrast, here is one shin-ing example among many that illumi- nates how science and technology com- plement each other to advance both: In 1928 Karl Jansky, a newly minted MIT graduate engineer, was hired by the then-prestigious Bell Tele phone Labo-ratories. He was as signed the difficult task of tracking down all sources of noise that interfered with telephone communications. By 1931 Jansky had systematically detected and identified all sources of telephonic noise, with one glaring exception. It took him many ad-ditional months to finally pinpoint that finicky last source of noisy interference.It originates in deep space from the di- rection of Sagit tarius, located at the cen- ter of our own galaxy. Although Jansky published the results of his seminal work, he perplexingly didn't followthrough on it but went on to do other things. It fell to an amateur astronomer, Grote Beber, to pursue this spatial mys-tery further; thus was born the scienceof radio astronomy, emerging as it didfrom technology rather than from sci-ence. Such fortuities are the bread andbutter of science and technology, where no quarter is ever taken or given toclaims that are beyond the realm of ra-tional inquiry. The one central position that distin- guishes science and technology from re- ligion is the tradition of unrelenting at-tempts to falsify the observations beforethey are accepted by the community ofscientists and engineers, a demandingstandard that religion could never ac- complish or even consider. Religion is in-capable of granting believers the thought that there may perhaps be errors in its tenets that might contradict any part of the platform on which they stand. Nonetheless, religion has to ration- alize its usually convoluted dogmas bygiving them ethical dimensions\u2014as al-ready noted, an ultimately futile exer- cise. For example, the \"Right to Life\"has long been a dead letter in the Roman Catholic Church. Even Vaticanscholars of the Scriptures no longer up- hold the erroneous reading of Genesis 38:9. Among the Ten Com mand ments \"Thou shalt not kill\" does not even begin to encompass all human life-forms, and the human construct is open to wide interpretation; consider the re-sulting dogma that \"life begins at con- ception.\" That is an utterly false asser- tion on its face because spermatozoaand ova cells are vibrantly alive long be-fore they meet. Life most assuredlydoes not begin at conception. There are no discontinuities here as life just per- sists and inexorably continues and ma-tures. Thus the inevitable conclusion embraced by religion is that the sacred status of an individual and his society isdependent on properties possessed by human cellular tissues. This has a startling consequence that is rarely if ever invoked by religion. Indeed, if all forms of human life weretruly recognized as sacred down to the unicellular form, religious authoritieswould be compelled to insist on the ceremonial burial of every human cell, every strand of hair, every bit of skin, and every tissue removed from surgery. From the formal religious assertion of the sublime value of a single fertilizedhuman cell, we are, alas, left with a pre-posterous notion that is not enforceable in the real world. Sooner rather than later these concepts will determine at some point in the future that all human life is sacred in fact as it is in theory. The quoted Roman Catholic Credo dogma that begins this essay is based on the proposition that life on Earth is as- sumed to be unlikely to improve and will remain irretrievably miserable.Only in life after death can one begranted perpetual solace in one of sev- eral forms. This precept has no place in science or technology, but it still finds a declining refuge in religion. The ulti- mate contradiction is the pro-lifer whosupports the death penalty. H.L.

May June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 4:01 PM Page 5354 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerCan skeptics and scientists learn anything from reading a Deepak Chopra book? In this case I think they can. It helps that this book is coau- thored with Leonard Mlodinow, physi- cist, screenwriter, and coauthor with Stephen Hawking of the best seller The Grand Design. (He also received the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's Balles Prize for his book on random- ness, The Drunkard's W alk .) The book is formatted as a debate, each author set-ting out his side and responding to theother. It covers all the big questions:cosmology, life and evolution, the mindand brain, and God. Chopra advocateshis own brand of spirituality, claimingthat the universe is conscious and evolv-ing. He presents his spirituality as the reasonable alternative to the soullessmaterialism of his critics. Mlodinowacts as the spokes man for science, coun-tering Chopra's expansive claims andgiving very clear explanations of con- ventional scientific knowledge. The title invites us to read the book as documenting a struggle between sci- ence and spirituality, but Chopra clearlyloves science and vies with Mlodinow to explain topics like the history of the cosmos and the role of DNA. In some cases Chopra misstates the content of scientific knowledge and Mlodinow corrects him, but in many cases Chopra and Mlodinow agree on the content of our scientific knowledge of the world. Their disagreement is over a ques- tion that is not itself scientific: What deep truth does science tell us about the world? Does it tell us that there is a universal consciousness that we can ac- cess by going to a special place where itwill be \"drawn to your side'' (Chopra, p. 251)? Or does it tell us that under- standing one's essence means \"to thinkof myself as a biological machine gov-erned by the same laws that govern Pluto\" (Mlodinow, p. 133)? This is adifference of two worldviews, but theyare both metaphysical extensions ofwhat science itself tells us. The proper skeptical answer, I would argue, is a third view: \"none of the above.\" Science doesn'ttell us deep truths about the world. Chopra goes beyond science in one direction, usingit as a springboard to launch his inspi- rational metaphysics. In his statementquoted above, Mlodinow jumps in an-other direction by espousing \"philo- sophical\" materialism, which, as Chopra says, is also a form of metaphysics. Theskeptic rejects both spiritualistic and materialistic metaphysics. We don't have evidence that there is a universal consciousness with which we can com-mune, nor does science tell us the\"essence'' of anything. From this point of view, the crucial division is not a battle line between sci-ence and spirituality but rather a differ-ent line, more like a geographicalboundary, that separates science from metaphysics. Mlodinow steps over this line when he argues against Chopra'smetaphysical castle-building by offer-ing a competing metaphysical picturethat says \"No, the evolution of the uni- verse isn't guided by a universal con- sciousness: it evolves through physical law, and has no guiding purpose\" (p. 62). The problem with this is that itgoes beyond what science tells us. Sci-ence does not measure the amount ofpurpose in the universe. I found myself agreeing with Chopra when he de- scribed such claims as philosophical materialism. By representing metaphys- ical overstatements as being part of the\"scientific worldview,\" one puts real sci-ence in danger of being discredited. The proper \"scientific\" response to Chopra's spiritualistic metaphysics is to confine oneself to Laplace's admirably minimal comment, \"We have no need of that hypothesis.\" To be fair to Mlodinow, his meta- physical overstatements are much rarerthan those of other popular writers such as Richard Dawkins.

He acknowledges that \"science does not address the meaning oflife ... and science will never be able to explain why the universe follows laws\" (p. 256). Concerning the soul, he says that science does not claim to have proved that there is no such thing, only that there isno credible evidence for it (p. 131). Henicely summarizes the role of science as follows: \"When [a] particular belief doesnot lead to conflict with what we observe in the physical world, there is nothing sci- ence says to oppose it,'' (my emphasis). The crucial point, which he doesn't state explicitly, is that there may indeed be ar-guments against it, but rather than beingscientific they will be of a more general logical or philosophical nature. Chopra's central claim provides an im- mediate example. What he advocates is a form of panpsychism, the proposition that mind is a fundamental feature of the worldand exists throughout the universe. There is a lively ongoing debate concerningpanpsychism, not among scientists but among philosophers. Reputable figures such as Galen Strawson and TimothySprigge argue in favor of panpsychism,though not anything like Chopra's ornateversion, while others such as John Searleand Colin McGinn refute it (see \"Panpsy-chism,\" The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philos- ophy, Fall 2010 edition). Chopra and Mlodinow's book is a wide-ranging and stimulating read. Thepresence of two perspectives, of an insider and of an outsider, gives stereoscopic depthto the explanations of the science. But by framing the debate as \"science vs. spiritu- ality,\" I think the book blurs an essential point. The counterpoint to Chopra's spec- ulations is not science, with its complicated structure of facts, theories, and hypotheses, but something much more basic.

Since his first book, The Self- ish Gene (1976), Dawkins's popularity has grown among adult freethinkers.Now, with The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, he expands his focus to include \"kids from twelve to one hundred.\" I guess that includes me,a wheezing octogenarian, and my bril-liant pre-teen great-granddaughter in Arizona.

It will in- troduce her to a world quite differentfrom the one described in Sundayschool. It's fun to read, but it isn't just a fun book. While Dawkins doesn't givemyths credence, he doesn't ignore them. Chapter after chapter begins with bothan illustration of what people often chose to believe in the past and an ex-planation of why they likely believed it.Then he carefully takes us through thescience that illuminates the topic. The book couldn't come at a better time. Election year always brings a plethora of religious ideas touted to \"put America back on the right track.\" Oh sure, we have always been awash with credulous thinking. Now, thanksto the Internet, credulity and misinfor- mation come at the speed of fiber op- tics. No longer do we have to depend on the local village idiot to keep us be- lieving in the little green men withpointy heads; today that village idiot is probably a popular blogger. I was almost a witness to an invasion of little green men in 1950. I was ayoung sailor finishing up my first hitch at Bainbridge Island in Puget Soundwhen the story broke. Three or four (sometimes a dozen or so) flying sau -cers buzzed around Mount Rainier, justsouth of Seattle. I didn't see the firstwave, but the visitations continued untilother news moved them off the front page. On the second or third day of the brouhaha, one of my shipmates pointedthe saucers out. I saw nothing unusualat first. Then, after a lot of help from my shipmate, I could make them out but had a hard time distinguishing theflying saucers from the ever-changing shapes of the clouds. But they were real. Everybody said so, although nobody knew what they were. When I receivedmy discharge and got back home againto Sevastopol, Indiana, I was the village expert on the phenomenon, which was sweeping the country. Of course, seeing something that isn't there doesn't do much harm unless we goto war over it. We nearly did that several times during the Cold War, once when some NORAD operators mistook the moon rising for incoming missiles. In chapter after chapter, Dawkins treats us to myths and specious think-ing without soft-pedaling the message to placate religious beliefs.

He writes: Why tree trunks, I wonder? Why not icicles or sand dunes? Isn't it fascinating to wonder who made such stories up, and why? Presum- ably the original inventors of all these myths knew they were fiction at the mo ment they made them up. Or do you think many different people came up with the different parts of the stories, at different times and in different places, and other people put them together, perhaps changing some of them, without realizing that the various bits were originally just made up? Elie Shneour, a noted San Diego scientist and my very good friend, tells me, \"It is very difficult to change peo-ple's opinions. Sometimes the best wecan do is plant a seed of doubt.\"Richard Dawkins does that very well.He does concede he enjoys good sto-ries; indeed, when asked by an inter-viewer to name his favorite myth,Dawkins named the book of Genesis. The Magic of Reality continues with the scientific understanding of our ori- gins. Dawkins suggests that we are de-scendents of fish, some 185 million generations ago! Thus he leads us through twelve chapters, each startingwith a question such as \"What is real-ity, What is magic?\" \"Are we alone?\"\"What is an earthquake?\" and \"Why do bad things happen?\" The reader will certainly not learn all the answers; Dawkins didn't. On page 180 he writes about how, with the big bang, time itself and space it-self began: \"Don't ask me to explain that, because, not being a cosmologist I don't understand it myself.\" The reader, even a pre-teenager, will not learn all the answers either, but looking for answers beats believing in impossible things. n Keith Taylor is a retired Navy officer and the for- mer president and program chair for the San Diego Association for Rational Inquiry. He can be reached at krtaylorxyz@aol.com.These days it seems difficult to open a newspaper or listen to a podcast without hearing about the latest discovery concerning \"theneuroscience of X,\" where Xis any- thing from mystical experience to free will, from moral decision making totaste in wine. As fascinating as thistype of research is, far too often weread largely unsubstantiated claimsabout neurobiology having \"explained\" X, with the implication that all thereis to know about Xis what neurobiol- ogy tells us. For instance, Sam Harris, in his much celebrated The Moral Landscape , argues that neuroscience can answer moral questions, but at the same time he entirely avoids engaging with the hefty philosophical literature on eth -ics\u2014particularly the is/ought gap, the idea that facts about the physical world do not automatically translate into moral judgments. Or consider theeven more recent The Atheist Guide to Reality , in which Alex Rosenberg claims that \"physical facts fix all thefacts,\" a questionable starting point (2 + 2 = 4 is a fact, but it's not physical) from which the author derives a thor-ough and thoroughly bleak form of nihilism. It is trivially true that if people en-gage in, say, moral reasoning, they have to do so by using certain parts of their brain rather than others. Every thing we think and do has to imply a \"neural cor-relate\" of some sort. But to confuse this observation with the strong claim that therefore we have an \"explanation\" ofwhat's going on is to seriously short-change the meaning of explanation. It is therefore most refreshing to read Michael Gazzaniga's latest book, Who's in Charge? Free Will and the Sci- ence of the Brain , on what neuroscience has to say about fundamental human behaviors, such as our ability to engage in deliberate decision making (\"free will\"). Gazzaniga certainly has the cre- dentials for the job, having spentdecades on the front lines of neurobi- ological research\u2014particularly study-ing so-called split brain patients, indi-viduals whose right and left cerebral hemispheres are disconnected, allow- ing scientists to peek at what the two regions are doing when they functionin isolation. Gazzaniga is also well- read in philosophy, which is a must fora scientist venturing into territory where philosophers have treaded for centuries, and where there exists a so-phisticated literature accompanied by its own technical jargon.

TitledUnnatural Acts: Critical Thinking, Skepticism, and Science Exposed! ,it is es- sentially a primer on how to think. The \"unnatural acts\" of the title are the acts of critical thinking, which don't come naturally to our imperfect human brains. Our brains evolved an instinctive, intuitive, quick-and-dirty way of think- ing that served our forebears well in their environment. A slower, more systematic, more critical way of thinking developed later and brought us science. It serves us better in today's world but is more diffi- cult to achieve. It requires education and concentrated effort to overcome the nat-ural tendencies imposed on us by our evolutionary history. The brain is an illusionist. It works by taking shortcuts, deceiving us into seeing things that aren't there and be- lieving things that aren't true. We see the sun apparently moving across the sky, and it takes sophisticated under- standing to overcome our first assump-tions. Nature has programmed us to in - crease our chances of survival and re- production, not to seek the truth. Reli- gious literalists, New Age philosophers, and other true believers prefer magical thinking to science because we are hardwired to think that way. So cre-ationism is often preferred over evolu-tion, and fanciful medical quackeriesmuch more cautious than other authors about the reliability and scope of brain scans and other techniques of modernneuroscience. He knows that scientistscan measure brain activity only indi-rectly, that they can obtain largely cor- relational data, and that colorful (and impressive) brain scans are actuallycomplex statistical compounds of anumber of individuals, accompanied by various possibilities for error and over interpretation. Gazzaniga doesn't buy the idea that there is no moral responsibility just be- cause \"the brain makes us do it,\" sincemoral responsibility emerges from the interaction of brains with particular so-cial environments, the latter being the result of historical and cultural forces. The brain is certainly a crucial nexus, but \"responsibility\" isn't located any-where within it. He also doesn't thinkthat consciousness is an \"illusion,\" aconclusion that, ironically, others derivein part from his own experiments onsplit-brain patients. Rather, conscious-ness emerges from a systemic dynamicnetwork operating inside the intactbrain, a network that we can partially disrupt and study under special circum-stances, such as those offered by Gaz-zaniga's patients. You may have noticed that I have used the word emergemore than oncein describing Gazzaniga's take on things neuroscientific. Emergentism refers to one of two positions in philosophy of mind: on the one hand it encapsulates the (strong) claim that there are truly novel (i.e., irreducible to lower levels)properties of matter when certain con- ditions of complexity and organizationapply. On the other hand it refers to the (weak) claim that some phenomena are so complex that our only hope at rea- sonable scientific descriptions rests on focusing on the proper level of analysis rather than attempting a reduction to the basic principles of physics, even if this were possible in theory. I cannot tell from the book whether Gazzaniga is an ontological (strong)emergentist, but he is at the very least anepistemological one. Epis temo -logical emergentism is rather uncontro- versial, as it is true as a matter of prag- matism that we need different theories and concepts to understand different types of phenomena (try, for instance, to build a quantum mechanical model of the Brooklyn Bridge and see how far you get). Ontological emergentism\u2014just like its chief rival, ontological reduction- ism\u2014is a metaphysical thesis about which it is best to remain agnostic. Who's in Charge is a must-read for anyone interested in the broader impli- cations of modern neuroscience not wishing to fall for easy sensationalism or for philosophical claims masquerad-ing as science. In the end, as Gazzaniga puts it: \"We are people, not brains. ...Go have a dry martini, put your feet up, and read a good book.\" A wise suggestion indeed. n Massimo Pigliucci is professor of philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and author of Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk .

Critical thinking is hard. We must learn that we can't trust our perceptions,memories, and intuitions. This requires education and practice. It's frustrating to accept that our most cherished be-liefs might be wrong. And it's frustrat- ing to know that success is elusive: the truths we learn will always be provi-sional, and we can never be certain whether we have looked at all the rele- vant data objectively. In successive chapters, Carroll ex - plains: Critical thinking is unpopular: you will lose friends and alienateyour neighbors. Trust no one, not even yourself: you, too, are subject to perceptualdistortions and cognitive biases. Language is often used to ma- nipulate thought and behavior. Groupthink\u2014communal rein- forcement\u2014seduces groups of people into bad decisions. It is becoming increasingly difficult to identify reliable infor-mation amid all the hype, propa-ganda, advertising, and misinfor- mation. Anecdotes are compelling: a good story trumps a dozen scien- tific studies. Scientific studies aremore reliable in the search fortruth but are also subject to bias. Fallacies in reasoning are wide- spread and natural; man is an ir- rational animal. Natural factors conspire to lead us into error, but there is hope that we can learn to overcome our natural tendencies and be- come critical thinkers. In the final chapter, Carroll provides practical advice: fifty-nine ways to de- velop your unnatural talents in critical thinking, skepticism, and science. This list will be enhanced by the blog Un- natural Acts (www.59ways.blogspot .com), where he will be offering com- mentary and examples of the fifty-nineways (plus a few more). Five appendices round out the banquet with detailed discussions of cell phone radiation, in- terstellar travel, acupuncture, what it re-ally means to think critically, and step-by-step instructions on how to createyour own pseudoscience. Refreshingly, he admits to errors of his own in The Skep- tic's Dictionary and corrects the record. I laughed out loud at Carroll's ac- count of his first attempt at teaching logic as a newly minted philosophy PhD. \"If I remember correctly, about twenty-five students signed up for theclass and three finished. One of the three stayed because he liked me. An- other stayed because he didn't know how to drop a class. The remaining stu- dent understood the material in the text...\" Over time, he progressed from teaching traditional logic to offering more useful courses in critical thinkingas a way of life, emphasizing an under- standing of the psychology of bias and other sources of error and embodying an attitude of intellectual humility, confi- dence in reason, intellectual curiosity, and intellectual independence. Since critical thinking is important to every aspect of human life, he illus-trates his points with examples drawn from every imaginable field: religions,UFO cults, psychology, alternative med-icine, politics, parapsychology, martialarts, criminology, climate change, news media, vaccines, cell phone radiation, cancer clusters, and more. Some of his examples will be familiar from other skeptical writings, like Clever Hans (the horse that responded to its owner's unconscious body language) and the basketball/gorilla video illustratinginattentional blindness. Others were new to me, like the example of audio pareido- lia where a Bob Dylan song lyric is heard as \"throw my chicken out the window.\" There can never be too many books on critical thinking. Carroll's is a wor- thy contribution to the skeptical litera- ture: comprehensive, easy to read, andpacked with entertaining examples that vividly illustrate the concepts. For thosenew to skepticism, it can serve as a valuable textbook for learning how to think. It will be useful to even the mostjaded skeptics among us who think wealready know how to think; we all stillmake mistakes, we need to be reminded anew of old lessons, and there is alwaysmore to learn. n Harriet Hall , MD, also known as \"The SkepDoc,\" is a retired family physician who writes about pseu- doscience and questionable medical practices.

These days, a lot of people are doing just that. Witness the tendency toemploy the creature as a mascot for a va-riety of products that includes beef jerky,snack pastries, and sodas. Alongside his career as a pitchmon- ster, sasquatch/Bigfoot/Yeti has en joyedstarring roles in numerous films. Mostlylow-budget affairs, these movies includeboth fictitious tales of a blood-thirstymonster on the loose and pseudo-docu-mentaries that purport to examine thepossibility that such a creature exists. The importance of these films and television programs should not be over- looked. If you ask Bigfoot hunters what got them interested in the legendary man-beast, many will cite a film, perhaps 1972's The Legend of Boggy Creek or the 1976 \"schlockumentary\" The Mysterious Monsters(where the only thing scarier than the dramatic recreations of encoun-ters with Bigfoot was the plaid sport coatworn by host Peter Graves). Screenwriter David Coleman offers a comprehensive roundup of what he calls \"Cin\u00e9 du Sasquatch\" in his excel- lent and entertaining new book, The Bigfoot Filmography: Fictional and Doc-umentary Appearances in Film and Tele- vision. Coleman takes no position on the existence of the beast; that's not thepoint. Real or not, Bigfoot has capturedthe imagination of filmmakers and has earned a place in American popularculture. Bigfoot hunters may not be successful in bagging the beast, but Coleman has doggedly tracked down perhaps every Bigfoot appearance on celluloid, including big-studio films, indie efforts, shorts, television ap - pearances, and even commercials. The book, profusely illustrated with movie stills and poster art, is great for aquick dip or a page-by-page read. But it's not just fur and fun. Coleman opens the book with a highly erudite twenty- seven-page essay he titles \"Cin\u00e9 du Sas - quatch as a Genre Convention.\" Cole - man traces the evolution of the genre,citing King Kongand various \"wild ape on the loose\" movies as early influences. Abominable Snowman movies in the 1950s and 1960s inspired Bigfoot films in the 1970s, most of which were \"beasts and breasts\" fare for drive-ins. The 1980ssaw the rise of direct-to-video blood-baths, but the decade closed with Harry and the Hendersons , in which Big foot was a nonthreatening overstuffed teddy bear. The success of that film (and subsequentTV spin-off) led to a rash of Bigfoot kiddie flicks, in which the hominid is a gentle giant who helps little Jimmy have the best summer ever. But few adults want to see a Bigfoot obsessed with peace, love, and under- standing, so even though there are few alleged instances of Bigfoot getting vi- olent on record, most films depict him as a killer\u2014often without cause. Coleman excels with the sheer a - mount of data he provides about thesefilms. For each movie he provides a list of actors, a plot summary, and an often- meaty interpretive essay that gives infor- mation about the film's background and its (possible) larger significance. Anyone who grew up watching a Sat- urday-night program with a name like \"Chiller Theater\" will find plenty to rem- inisce over while leafing through The Bigfoot Filmography . Horror film buffs might recall Shriek of the Mutilated , fea- turing a white, prancing Yeti who bizarrely resembled a bipedal dog, or The Capture of Bigfoot , a 1979 offering set in the wilds of Wisconsin involving a juve-nile Bigfoot whose imprisonment en - rages daddy Bigfoot. And who could for- get Rives and Pahoo's epic showdown against a Louisiana \"skunk ape\" in 1976'sCreature from Black Lake ? The rise of computer effects pro- duced better-looking Bigfoot monsters in the 1990s and beyond, but alas, muchCin\u00e9 du Sasquatch is still plagued by cheap monkey suits, flat scripts, and bad acting. It's to Cole man's credit that he sought out so much of this stuff. Anyone who sits through dogs like Search for the Beastand Suburban Sas quatch deserves our thanks. Coleman is also good at uncovering the range of films within this genre. Readers will note that many of these movies feature randy sasquatches who are fond of abducting nubile maidens.

The cover article for Janu- ary/February 2012, \"Measuring Mythology: Startling Concepts in NCCAM Grants,\" elated me with its open, detail-stuffed ex- pos\u00e9 and, at the same time, sad-dened me with the evidence thattoo many people do not think ra- tionally. I've known that complemen- tary medicine \"treatments\" are unproven fear-abatement at- tempts pressed upon the gullible by the gullible and nefarious, but I didn't dream that it is that pervasive. I guess it's like that (in)fa- mous curmudgeonly, acerbic wit Mark Twain is said to have said: \"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble, but what you know for sure that ain't so.\" Philip Kuchuk Hamden, Connecticut I would like to add a statistical perspective to Eugenie Miel-czarek and Brian Engler's reviewof NCCAM grants. Fundamentally, studies of al- ternative health therapies make an inappropriate assumption ofequipoise. Results are said to be statistically significant if they are positive at p=0.05, but scientific treatments are tested for human efficacy only after an arduousprocess in which biologic plausi- bility animal studies, and human dose-ranging and toxicity work. For ethical drugs the pretest probability of utility is quite high before any phase III studies are done. Treatments with their rationale based on pre-Columbian usage or current popularity have a far lower pretest probability. For therapies, such as homeopathy or prayer- at-a-distance, that violate basic laws of chemistry and physics the probability approaches zero. Sim ple Bayesian statistics shows that interventions with a low pretest probability are still likelyto be useless after a positive test result. Using standard statistical criteria for deciding clinical usefulness is grossly inappropri- ate when analyzing alternative remedies. These studies are unethical because patients are subject to risk of harm without significantchances for benefit; any effective treatment changes some physio- logical processes and could causeharm. How NCCAM has managed to avoid meeting these elemen- tary scientific and ethical require- ments is a bit of a mystery. That behavior would not be acceptableat any of the other NIH Centers.

Although vitamin E and selenium supplements do not lower the incidence of prostate cancer, the long-term study continues. John H. Chalmers Rancho Santa Fe, California Eugenie Mielczarek and Brian Engler's picture of fraud and waste for complementary and al- ternative medicine (CAM) in NCCAM grants should beviewed in perspective. The annual NIH grant port- folio is $31.2 billion. The CAM portion of NIH is $531 mil- lion\u2014about 1.7 percent. NC - CAM's budget is $127 million. Total U.S. healthcare spending is more than $2.5 trillion, of which between 20 percent and 30 per-cent is wasted according to Dr. Berwick, departing head of Medicare and Medicaid. Na- tional consumer spending on CAM was $33.9 billion (2007survey\u20141.4 percent of totalhealthcare spending). Some 50.7 million people in the United States do not have health insur- ance. When compared to Britain, Canada, Ger many, the Nether-lands, Australia, and New Zea - land, the Commonwealth Fund report found the U.S. ranked dead last in quality of health care. In perspective, CAM spend- ing and impact is pretty small. CAM is folk medicine, which fills a gap when people lack access to or are failed by conven- tional medicine. If mainstream medicine were available to all and treated patients like customers, CAM might fade away. Until then this country cousin has a small willing market and,strange ly enough, often works. Robert D. VeitchMinneapolis, Minnesota Eugenie V . Mielczarek and BrianD. Engler e Messrs. Kuchuck, Haus - wald, Chalm ers, and Veitch for their interest in our study. Regarding Mr. Chalmers's com ment: The authors stand bytheir inclusion of the SELECT study in the article. While screening of study participants continues as a follow-up, the use of the supple- ments by clinical trial participants was terminated by a safety panel in 2008. Indeed, subsequent to writ- ing our article a paper was pub- lished stating that \"the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee has found that participants who took the study supplements of vitamin E (400 IU per day) and a placebo for selenium have a 17% higher risk of prostate cancer than those who took two placebos\" (http://select.crab.org/). Mr. Veitch's conclusion that CAM should be supported by fed- eral funding because it might workis what we tested by studying all the grants from NCCAM for the last ten years. Our conclusion that NCCAM should be defunded was based on the lack of evidence of any successes for medical uses of CAM. A willing market is the hallmark that fosters belief in these cultural mythologies. Promotion of un- proven CAM therapies prevents needed medical care from reaching the poor and uneducated, some of whom, desperately ill and mytholog- ically persuaded by marketing, delay appropriate care until it's too late. There are significant factual er- rors in the article by Eugenie Mielczarek and Brian Engler in the January/February issue of the S kEpTICAl INqUIRER . The arti- cle erroneously states that the American physical Society (ApS) Division of Biological physics (DBIO) has endorsed a state- ment on distance healing. This is completely incorrect\u2014DBIO has not endorsed such a statement. Furthermore, while a draft state-ment is currently under consider- ation, it does not include the sen- tences quoted by Mielczarek and Engler in their article. Mark Reeves, ApS Councillor for DBIO lawrence krauss, former chair, physics and the public Sub- committee, ApS pOpA The authors reply to Mark Reeves and Lawrence Krauss: The American Physical Society hasexpressed concerns that our article implies that the American Physical Society and/or the Division of Bio- logical Physics has \"endorsed\" an of- ficial \"statement\" on energy healing protocols. Our use of the word state- ment was in the colloquial sense as it was used by the Division's sub- committee in its deliberations and edits of its wording. W e advise the reader that no inference should be made as to the endorsement or pub- lication of an official position \"statement\" by the Division or the Society. In the interest of full trans- parency: On October 1, 2010, the Division of Biological Physics pre-sented before the Panel of Public Af- fairs (POPA) of the American Physical Society a motion from its subcommittee.* On October 21 an edited version** of its motion was sent from the POPA to the Execu- tive Council of the American Phys- ical Society for review. This matter is under consideration by the Exec- utive Council of the AmericanPhysical Society. The members of the Division subcommittee, charged with bring-ing this motion before The Panel ofPublic Affairs of the American Physical Society, were Eugenie Mielczarek, of Subcommit- and Herb Levine, Chair of Divi- sion of Biological Physics. The sub- committee was required by ApS to include how the statement should be used before it could be considered as a motion from the di- vision before POPA. All public \"statements\" are available on the website of the Society. Minutes of POPA meetings are available on its website. *Request: addition to the agenda for the October 1 meeting of the Panel On Public Affairs APS: a consideration of the following statement passed by the executive council of DBP needed as an ed- ucational outreach for the public understanding of science at the frontier of physics and biology. Practitioners of several types of Alternative Medicine such as Therapeutic Touch have argued that human beings can affect bi- ological processes at a distance via the creation of \"healing energy\",thereby positively impacting pa- tient health. The Biological Physics division of the APS has ascertained that there is no known biophysical mechanismthat could reasonably support such effects and that the \"energy\" being referred to cannot be connected to the precise notion of energy as it[is] used in physical science. Spe- cific claims that humans can gen- erate biomagnetic fields at the milligauss level are not credible,as typical measurements deter- mine this field strength to be three orders of magnitude lower. Sim- ilarly, there are no known mech- anisms whereby a typical cell orits components could respond re- liably to a human-generated elec- tromagnetic field at the distances in question, in the presence of thermal fluctuations of much higher magnitude. Appeals to a more general \"human biofield\" which is not connected to known phenomena and cannot be di-rectly measured are inherently nonscientific. Be cause of its lack of any basis in our current physical understanding, we are skeptical of published claims that Thera- peutic Touch can give rise to sta- tistically significant modifica- tions of biological behavior. In accordance with APS's Web post - ed \"In ternal Policy subsection 'POLICY ON STATEMENTSBY APS UNITS,'the Division requests that this statement be recorded as coming from the Di- vision of Biological Physics, inthe Washington Office of APS and made available to all whorequest it. **Practitioners of several types of alternative medicine have argued that human beings can af- fect biological processes at a dis-tance via the creation of \"healing energy\" to improve patient health. There is no known biophysical mechanism that could support such effects, and the \"energy\" being referred to cannot be connected to the concept of energy as it is used in the physical sciences. Specific claims that human beings can generate magnetic fields at the milligauss level are not credible.Typical measurements of thesefields have shown them to be a thousand times smaller, muchsmaller, in fact, than the magnetic fields generated by thermal fluc- tuations. There are no mecha-nisms for a typical cell or its com- ponents to respond to the fieldscreated by hypothesized healing energy.

McDonnell was the founder of the McDonnell Aircraft Cor-poration, which merged with Douglas in 1967 to become Mc- Donnell Douglas (which was it- self taken over by Boeing in 1997). Despite McDonnell's suc- cess in a very concrete technolog- ical field, he was a believer in the paranormal, especially the sur- vival of bodily death. In 1979 he gave $500,000 to Wash ington University in St. Louis to foundwhat became known as MacLab to investigate claimed paranor- mal powers, and it was this labo- ratory that was the victim of James Randi's brilliant ProjectAlpha hoax. However, the labo- ratory director was a physicist, Peter Phillips, not McDonnell himself (who in any case died in 1980). Ray Ward London, England Smith's whimsical article, \"Laugh - ing Goats and Scowling Sheep,\" makes some good points, espe- cially if one's aim is to engage in dialogue rather than simply criticize. I sincerely hope no one mis- understands his reference to the\"traditional Biblical (Matthew 25:31-46) groupings of sheep (blessed believers) and goats (condemned skeptics).\" Smith,though presumably well-inten-tioned, has made up the paren- thetical application and quite warped the original point in theprocess. As even a quick glance at the passage in question will re- veal, it is not about believers andskeptics but about those who care for their fellow human beings and those who ignore them. The blessed are those who have made efforts to improve life for all. The condemned are the proud, selfish, and indifferent. From my perspective, believ- ers and skeptics should join in ef- forts to feed the hungry, comfort the distressed, and make the world a better place. I can only hope that the followers of the In- visible Pink Unicorn feel the same way. Ralph A. MarinoValley Falls, New Y ork Jonathan C. Smith replies: I remember enjoying and eagerly anticipating Firesign Theatre re - cordings four decades ago. I've never recovered. Thanks, Phil (check out my \"Pastafarian Quatrains\"). I thank Ralph Marino for his kind and thoughtful comment. However, let me note that I did not create the \"parenthetical applica- tion\" of \"goats and sheep.\" This was invented in 1942 by Gertude Schmeidler, professor of psychology at the City University of New York. She used the term sheepto refer to paranormal believers and goatsfor disbelievers. Perhaps she was un-aware of the biblical source of the metaphor (readers, please let meknow otherwise). In the Bible, goats and sheep are hardly neutral crea- tures. Goats receive scorn whereas sheep are blessed (after all Jesus was described as a \"shepherd\"). In my piece I simply pointed out thisBible-based bias applied to barn- yard animals and subtly suggested that this reflects the scorn many be- lievers have toward skeptics. Obvi- ously, nowhere do I claim that the Bible is referring to believers, skep- tics, James Randi, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Indeed, theBible has precious little to say about questioning and objective, dispas- sionate, skeptical analysis as a path to \"truth\"; it is very much the holy book of blind belief and obedience. But that's another point. Information Illiteracy Relating to Kristin E. Harley's article, \"Information Literacy and Conspiracy Theories\" (SI, January/February 2012), I would like to comment on the loss of the analog video data containing Neil Arm strong's first steps on the Moon. Stanley Lebar, the Westinghouse Program manager for the Apollo Lunar TV Pro - gram, searched for those mag- netic tapes for several years. The video data was mixed with thenormal telemetry data when transmitted from the Moon and was received by the NASA sta- tion in Australia. It was then re- layed to NASA at Goddard. The video data was copied from the telemetry data in Australia, to be fed to the TV networks. The camera frame rate was 10 frames per second, so it had to be con- verted to the 30 frame/second interlaced format used in the United States. Stanley Lebar left no stone unturned in his search, which involved NASA at Goddard, NASA at Houston, the National Air and Space Museum, and theNational Archives. He foundthat several boxes of tapes in theNational Archives system mostlikely had contained the tapes with the video, but they had been returned to NASA Goddard. In the meantime, budget shortages resulted in reusing magnetic tapes for later projects. The most probable cause for the loss of tapes was that they were amongthose that were overwritten to support later projects. If the original data could be retrieved, they were to be pro - cessed with modern technology, which would eliminate the ghostly shadows and poor im-ages for preservation of history. This was not in response to con- spiracy theories; the legacy of a much higher-quality videoMay June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:05 AM Page 6364 Volume 36 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer[LETTERS TO THE EDITOR would have been great for histor- ical records. One of the surviving cameras is at the National Electronic Museum (www.nationalelectron icsmuseum.org). The camera was successfully operated a few yearsago for a celebration honoringthe engineers that developed it. Ralph StrongRetired, Westinghouse, Project Manager Volunteer, National Elec- tronic Museum Fabricating History I have just become aware of your series of articles on \"CivilizationsLost and Found.\" I would like to congratulate you re: Part Two(November/December 2011), aworthy summary of the problemsof provenance, historical fact, and objective evidence, which the ex- amples you cover have demon-strated. I would, however, like to make two points: 1. I think you should be more explicit in your \"disclaimer\"; to put the matter more bluntly, I think you should state outrightthat the journal Ancient American (and its editor, Wayne May) are fundamentalist Mormons, thusdedicated to trying to prove that the Book of Mormon and asso-ciated texts are true with respect to the origins of Native Ameri- cans, African Amer icans, etc. (despite the DNA and material evidence that overwhelmingly demonstrate the falsity of Mor- mon claims). I think your readers should be apprised of this, and you should not hide behind your bland \"disclaimer.\" 2. My one caveat is your ten- dency to treat all those who either suspect or maintain the existence of pre-Columbian contacts as \"diffusionists\"\u2014allequally irrational, etc. This un- fortunate generalization wouldinclude the Viking presence atL'Anse aux Meadows, a clear ex-ample of a pre-Columbian pres- ence in North Amer ica, and any other possible future examples, which should not be excluded apriori. (Personally, I think there may well have been other trans- Atlantic connections; if the Vikings could manage it, why not others?) M.W. Wenner Prescott, Arizona The article series \"Civilizations Lost and Found: Fabricating History\" did a good job assessing the claims of the Lost Civiliza- tions of North America documen- tary and its claim that there was a pre-Columbian migration of Israelites to the Americas. Why is it that so much pseudo-history is obsessed with the ancient Israelites? At tempts to prove that present-day popula- tions, often in unlikely locations, are de scended from this group ofpeople still occurs. The classic example is British Israel theory. In the United Kingdom groups like the British Israel World Federation promote the claim that the present-day inhabitants of Britain are the de- scendants of the \"lost\" ten tribesof northern Israel. The belief that Anglo-Saxon and Celtic (i.e.,\"white\") nations share a common heritage with the Jewish tribes of the Old Testa ment peaked in Britain in the 1920s at the height of the British Empire. That such ideas continue today is worri-some. Well done for publishing in- depth articles that deal with such historical topics. Graeme Kemp Wellington, Shropshire United Kingdom Kenneth L. Feder, Bradley T. Lep-per, Terry A. Barnhart, and Debo-rah reply: In response to M.W. Wenner: Con- cerning the Mormon affiliation of some of those interviewed by the producers of the Lost Civiliza tions of North America documentary, we intentionally crafted our analy- sis of the diffusionist claims made in the video to tightly focus on the claims themselves and not the reli-gious perspectives of the individuals making the claims. The \"history\"presented in the documentary is plainly false, regardless of whether that history was informed by reli- gious doctrine. Wenner also makes the valid point that not all claims of pre- Columbian contact between the Oldand New World are \"equally irra- tional,\" specifically citing the case of the Norse. We agree. In fact, in the second article (November/December 2011, pp. 53-54) we discussed the clear archaeological evidence for a Norse presence in northeastern Canada and used it as a model for the kinds of material evidence that must be found\u2014and has, to date,not been found\u2014before archaeolo-gists accept claims of other ancient New World visitors . Potato for Christ? Massimo Polidoro provides a ra-tional explanation of a \"strange\" phenomenon a woman found in her potato slice in his article\"The Case of a Weeping Ortho-dox Icon\" (SI, January/February 2012). A couple of years ago, I took a photo of a similar potato I grew in my garden. However, because I studied plant pathology nearly fifty years ago, I did not find it strange. In-stead I wondered what the reac- tion might have been if this hadbeen found in Ireland. It is, after all, a fair facsimile of a Chris tian symbol. Jim Ring Tahunanui, Nelson New Zealand What's Human? What's Behaviorism? In his review of The Most Human Human (\"Turing Test for Hu -man Beings,\" SI, January/Febru- ary 2012), Massimo Pigli ucci maintains that computers lack \"'understanding,' let alone con- sciousness,\" and that a program like Deep Blue, which de feated the world chess champion, \"wasn'tthinking in anything like the way a human being does.\" Pigliucci is undoubtedly right, and we will never attribute under- standing, let alone consciousness, to anything made out of metal instead of meat. This is an obser- vation only about our use of lan- guage, however, and tells us nothing about computers. Theinteresting question is whether there is a fundamental limitation that forever prevents computers from doing some tasks that hu -man beings can do. We will never have a defini- tive answer to this question, buton all available evidence, the an- swer is no. In 1978 Hubert Dreyfus predicted, on funda- mental philosophical grounds,that computers would never play master-level chess. Since then, critics of artificial intelligence have been careful to concentrate not on what computers can do, which would be discredited \"be- haviorism,\" but on what they are, which is, well, not human. Some tasks, of course, are quite beyond what computerscan currently do. Even here,however, there are surprises. Even an enthusiast like me would have said two years ago that a computer winning on Jeopardy was decades away. Charles HaspelMiami Beach, Florida Professor Pigliucci has the motto \"Ignor ance, the root and stem of all evil\" posted at the head of his website, but apparently he still prefers to remain ignorant about contemporary behaviorism; at least, that is my conclusion after reading his review of The Most Human Human by Brian Chris- tian. His comments on behavior- ism suggest a second- or eventhirdhand knowledge of the field. In \"Skepti cism of Caricatures: B.F. Skinner Turns 100\" (SI, June pages BOX_SI new design masters 3/29/12 9:05 AM Page 64Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2012 65 2004), Scott T . Gaynor presented and thor- oughly refuted three myths about Skinner's variety of behaviorism: the Blank Slate Myth, the Emp - ty Organism Myth, and the Only Overt Behavior Myth. Un- fortunately, Pigliucci seems not to have read this article, although he was a contributor to the same issue. If he had, it should have dispelled him of the Only OvertBehavior Myth, which he stillseems to hold so dear. Pigliucci also has a rather skewed understanding of what gave rise to the behaviorist move - ment. He thinks it was a reaction to psychoanalysis. A reading ofthe seminal works of J.B. Watson and B.F. Skinner will reveal how totally out in left field this inter- pretation is. Freud and psycho- analysis are barely mentioned by Watson and Skinner in passing. Pigliucci seems to think be- haviorism as a psychological the- ory has gone extinct. While it is certainly true that you won't hear much mentioned about it in cog- nitive psychology circles (or should I say buildings) except perhaps in the same way that Professor Pigliucci does\u2014derog - atorily\u2014it would be closer to the truth to say that the experimental analysis of behavior continues to be an active research field with well-established empirically bas - ed principles that continue to ex- tend their reach into linguistic and cognitive domains. It also in- forms much of the activity beingcarried out by clinical practition- ers. If these principles were not solid, the successes the practi- tioners have had and continue to have would not have been possi- ble, making behavioral theory not only explanatory but also ef-ficacious. Raymond S. Weitzman, PhD Professor Emeritus California State University, Fresno Massimo Pigliucci replies: Charles Haspel correctly points out that the real question concerningartificial intelligence is whetherthere is some fundamental reason why computers will never achieve anything like human-type intelli- gence. The jury, as he says, is still out and will remain there for a while. However, it is fair to say that the strong AI program has largely beena failure in that respect over the past few decades, Big Blue and Watson notwithstanding. It is increasingly clear that human intelligence isn't a matter ofsimple computational power or memory storage\u2014since in both of these areas computers have already surpassed what a human being can do, yet they don't show any sign of consciousness. I suspect that con- sciousness requires more than com- putation, and indeed requires more than just brains. I am most cer- tainly not advocating any form of mystical dualism, only suggesting that perhaps we ought to take seri- ously the fact that consciousness is a biological trait and that the pro -cesses that make it possible may be bound up in the specifics of the bi- ology of organisms, not just the re-sult of logical symbol manipulation (which is all computers do). Professor Weitzman chastises me for not knowing enough about behaviorism, and I am certainly no expert in that area. However, re- cent attempts at reinterpretingwhat behaviorists were trying to do always remind me of what Alan Sokal wrote about postmodernism: \"One often finds radical-sounding assertions whose meaning is am- biguous and that can be given two alternative readings: one as inter- esting, radical, and grossly false; the other as boring and trivially true.\" Either Skinner and Watson pro- posed a radically new approach to psychology, which ended up not working, or they simply tweakedcommonsensical scientific methods that are hard to distinguish from what others have been doing. Which one is it? As for the connection with psy- choanalysis, all I suggested was that Skinner and Watson, among others,were reacting to the fuzziness and clear lack of scientific rigor in psy-chology of the decades precedingthem, which were largely dominated by psychoanalysis. Iron ically, thiswas actually the most positive aspectof behaviorism, in my opinion. Finally, of course modern prac- titioners study behavior experimen- tally, but \"behaviorism\" refers to a specific theoretical and empirical approach in psychology, not just to the empirical study of behavior. To characterize much that currently goes on in psychology's daily practice, and especially in research, as behav- iorism is to play on the ambiguity of the term. Medicines from Herbs The article on herbal medicines (\"Medi cines Derived from Herbs,\" SI, January/Feb ruary 2012) got me thinking about the way we use and sometimes abuse words. Drug , for example, is a highly charged word that con- jures up images of illegal or tightly controlled substances, often with dangerous or un- known side effects. Officially, medicines made from artificially synthesized substances are clas- sified as drugs. Herbal or \"nat- ural\" medicines are not. This dis- tinction allows the sellers of natural remedies to market their products as \"drug-free\" or \"not a drug.\" They do this to im - ply safety and the absence of side effects. But for a substance to re- ally treat or cure an illness, it must bring about a physiological change in the human body, and isn't that the common definition of the word drug? To me, this seems like the kind of deception that George Orwell wrote about: manipulating public perceptions by redefining words. Fred Filbrich Rochester, New Y ork Edzard Ernst replies: It is true that the term drugis being used in several ways. For scientists, it usually means a pharmacologi- cally active therapeutic agent. If we apply this definition, we see that some herbal medicines deserve thename, while many other herb-de- rived remedies do not. We also real- ize that \"pharmacologically active\" means the drug can cause harm.A Russian Yeti? I was smiling softly while reading Benjamin Radford's news article, \"Russians Confirm Existence of Y eti\u2014But for How Long?\" (SI, January/February 2012), when I came to the sentence \"In fact, the event seemed more of a media circus than a scientific expedition when former Russian heavy-weight boxer Nikolai Valuev re- cently toured the cave 'searching' for the Y eti, to great media atten- tion.\" Here is a picture of Nikolai Valuev, who stands 7'2\" and weighs 320 lbs.
