Think beyond the building, and learn how to create solutions that transform the way we live, creating spaces, places and communities that improve our quality of life. Learn to make places that are both inspiring and sustainable. You'll study architecture from day one in this hands-on, studio-based degree. More than half of your time will be in the studio, collaborating with your peers in small groups to develop design responses to a wide range of social and spatial issues, just like you would in an actual architecture firm. You'll also learn how to effectively communicate these ideas to others - whether they're clients, communities or policymakers - through drawings, models and live presentation. In second and third year, you'll be introduced to architects and designers from across Melbourne and around the world as they pitch ideas for projects you can work on together. Maybe you'll want to go 'urban' and come up with a way to create community spaces, or look at ways to revitalise informal settlements in Southeast Asia. You might choose to focus on new and emerging building technologies. Or you could explore speculative architecture, imagining what 'punk buildings' or 'inclusive architecture' might be like. Whatever you choose, you'll graduate with a portfolio of work that's unique to you.Entry requirements 2021 ATAR for international students 75 GCE A Level 8 All India Senior School Certificate 70% Indian School Certificate Examination 65% Advanced Placement, America 6 ACT, America 25 SAT, America (Total score out of 1600 ) 1160 High School Diploma, Vietnam 8.14 Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education 17 International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma 26 Ontario Secondary School Diploma - Grade 12 78.50% SMA3, Indonesia - 100% scale (60% Malaysia 7.9 UEC, University Foundation Year (commencing MUFY in 2021)76.25 UNSW Foundation Studies 7 University of Melbourne, Trinity College Foundation Studies72% Monash College Diploma Part 1\u00b2 75% Monash College Diploma Part 2\u00b2 65% For information on 'How to calculate your entry score for the listed qualifications in this guide' go to page 82.

Bachelor of Architectural Design COURSE CODE: F2001 CRICOS CODE: 059372G I fell in love with Australia and chose Monash because my high school mentor recommended the University to me because of its teaching and culture. One of my favourite aspects of studying architecture at Monash was the range of architectural practices I had the chance to learn about and work with on projects that dealt with real-life issues. Throughout my studies I worked on a few landscape and water-sensitive projects which allowed me to graduate with a job at a landscape architecture firm.\" JEAN-CHRISTOPHE OLIVIER PETITE Bachelor of Architectural Design and Master of Architecture 22 23 2021 INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE COURSE GUIDE 2021 INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE COURSE GUIDE DID YOU KNOW? Upon graduation, you can choose to move directly into Monash's Master of Architecture course - which you'll need to complete in order to become a registered architect - but there are also lots of other creative careers Architectural Design can lead to. ?ART, DESIGN AND ARCHITECTUREDESIGN Learn how to think like a designer to solve complex problems with curiosity, agility, experimentation and creativity. When you enrol in Monash Design, you don't have to decide right away whether you want to study communication design, industrial design or spatial design. You'll explore all of them in your first year - later you can choose one to focus on. It's not the only way, though. If you decide you're interested in elements of all three, you can custom-create your own combination to graduate with a degree in collaborative design. Communication Design Become a bold, imaginative communication designer who shapes the visual language of contemporary society through creative visual storytelling. The Australian government forecasts strong growth in the demand for designers and illustrators over the next few years (Australian Department of Jobs and Small Business, 'Employment Projections' ). In a single degree, communication design brings together digital and interactive design, graphic design and visual communication so that you graduate as a future- focused design professional, ready to work across a wide range of industries. At Monash, half of your studies take place in the studio - a hands-on, creative environment where you'll be working side-by-side with your peers under the direction of Monash's award- winning designers and industry professionals. The studio is equal parts 'design-thinking' and 'design-making'. It's not just about creating work that looks good, but making a real contribution to visual culture, social engagement and economic futures. Within the degree you'll be encouraged to experiment with image-making, typography, analogue and digital media, UX and more, as tools and techniques to solve specific design challenges. Whether your interest lies in helping a company develop its look and feel, designing a great website or mobile phone app, becoming a commercial illustrator or creating cutting-edge publications, this degree can help you become a communication design professional.Industrial Design Create beautiful, functional objects by combining your knowledge of materials, manufacturing and human-centred design with innovation and aesthetics. From innovative transport solutions, to furniture and lighting design, to medical equipment, to products that aid developing countries - the work of industrial designers can advance the human experience, making a better life for us all. In this Design Institute of Australia 'Recognised Course', you'll be guided by Monash academics, practising industrial designers and top researchers as you learn to use design as a problem-solving tool in hands-on, practical studios. You'll also learn the tools and techniques to transform your ideas into prototypes with moving parts and realistic details, and have access to the latest 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC milling tools, thermoformers and a wide range of traditional wood and metalworking facilities.

Monash has long been considered the leading pharmacy program in Australia. In 2019, we ranked No.3 in the world for pharmacy and pharmacology - only Oxford and Harvard ranked higher. In part, this is because we believe the world doesn't just deserve more pharmacists; it deserves better pharmacists. That's why we offer Australia's only combined Bachelor of Pharmacy (Honours ) and Master of Pharmacy. Our graduates go out into the world equipped not only with the knowledge but also with the skills needed to improve healthcare. You'll learn about how the body works, how medicines work, what pharmacists do, and how to provide comprehensive care as part of a team of health professionals. You'll practise this during experiential placements in community pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare settings, mentored by some of the best practitioners in Australia and the world. Same duration, higher qualification The pathway to registration as a pharmacist in Australia generally takes five years. Traditionally, this has been structured as a four-year bachelor's degree plus a one-year paid internship. At Monash, our program takes the same amount of time, but instead you'll earn two degrees - a bachelor's and a master's. And when you arrange your (paid) internship, this will be supported by the network of our prestigious Intern Foundation Program and Intern Training Program. This intensive combination of learning and working prepares you for registration as a pharmacist and opens doors to you in a wide variety of pharmacy fields.

What's a double degree course? Monash offers two types of double degrees: a double undergraduate degree, and an undergraduate/graduate double degree. A Monash double undergraduate degree course allows you to study towards two degrees at the same time. This means you can keep your options open, develop expertise in different but complementary areas, or simply pursue two areas of interest in greater depth. You'll be awarded with two testamurs, one for each course completed. More than 140 double degree combinations are available. Double undergraduate degree How long does it take? A double undergraduate degree course takes two years less to complete than studying the two degrees separately. This is because the required units in one course count as electives in the other. For example, if you decide to take a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours ) and a Bachelor of Commerce, it will take you five years instead of seven. Therefore, you would take all the common core units for engineering as well as your 18 units of specialisation. You'll also take all the prescribed core units in commerce as well as eight units that make up your commerce major. So not only will you save two years of time, you'll also save two years of course fees.

After five years you'll graduate with both a bachelor's and a graduate master's degree. These courses are: Bachelor of Medical Science and Doctor of Medicine Bachelor of Pharmacy (Honours ) and Master of Pharmacy. In addition, the Bachelor of Arts (page 28 ) and the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours ) (page 48 ) offer accelerated master's pathways that enable you to complete an expert master's course with only one further year of study.

The final fourth year is the standard full-fee master's program. Entry requirements Some double degree courses may require you to study across two campuses in order to complete your course. To be eligible for admission to a double degree course you'll need to meet the academic entry requirements for both single degree courses. For example, if you're applying for the Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Music double degree course, you'll need to satisfy the subject prerequisites for both courses as well as any range of criteria requirements that apply for either of the courses. The back tables in this guide provide a guide to the overall score, or an estimate, required for admission in 2021. All scores are to be used as a guide only.

Where there's a range of criteria for one of the component courses, these criteria will still apply to the double degree course. In each case you should expect to meet the entry level of each of the single degree courses. Some double degree courses may require you to study across two campuses in order to complete your course.

If we're not able to make you a full offer immediately, you may receive a conditional offer.

We'll explain what's needed in the ISCA. Please submit the documentation to us as soon as possible, or contact us if you need any help.

So to make sure nothing is lost in translation, we've put together a list of explanations. Prerequisites Previous study or other criteria required to gain admission into a particular course or unit. Undergraduate course The first level of tertiary studies at university, including diploma or bachelor degree courses. Units Subjects that make up your course are known as units. Elective A unit where you choose what unit to study. The choice may be from a specified list of units, or it may be a free elective where you can choose any unit within Monash providing you have the necessary entry requirements and there are no restrictions on enrolment in the unit. Degree The academic title you get when you complete a course of study. For example: Bachelor of Arts, Master of Business. Double degree courses Two courses studied concurrently with required units in one course being counted as elective units in the other. A double degree takes fewer years to complete than if you studied one after the other.Comprehensive course These courses allow you to select from a wide range of subjects within a broad field of study. You have the option to choose your major immediately or later, and you'll try a range of subjects in your first year before narrowing your focus in year two - while still having the opportunity to try new things - before finally committing to your major area of study. Major The main area (s) of study chosen in a comprehensive course, study in a single discipline, totalling 48 credit points (eight units ) taken sequentially over three years. You don't need to declare your major when you enrol. Extended major An extended version of your major requiring you to study 72 credit points (12 units ) over three years. Minor Study in a single discipline, totalling 24 points (four units ). Specialist course A structured course usually focused on developing the knowledge and skills needed for professional practice in a specific field or profession. Specialisation Taken in specialist courses, a specialisation is a minimum of 12 units in a particular discipline, and provides an in-depth education in your chosen field. You must choose your specialisation when you enrol. Honours Honours may be an extra year of study at the end of your undergraduate degree. All of our four-year undergraduate courses include honours in their structure. Graduate courses Further study completed after you graduate with a bachelor's degree. The Sound Shell, Caulfield campus.
