For every suggestion - diet, heredity, chemical toxicity - there's a counter-argument. Some, like vaccines or gluten, have become social and political issues, saying a lot about our healthcare, social, and political systems. Part of the problem, on both traditional and holistic sides of the fence, is the Silver Bullet Syndrome - find a single cause, find a single, miraculous solution. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There's no guaranteed, linear path for the progression of any disorder, disease, or discomfort - even, say, exposure to a virus. Some \"catch\" it, some don't. Your body's systems are way too complex to call every shot. A lot of autism factors are identified anecdotally, but get shot down by \"no direct causal relationship has been proven...\" arguments. (Tell that to a parent who cut gluten from their kid's diet and saw a complete turnaround in behavior, until the next bite of wheat. Be ready to duck, in case a dinner roll comes sailing your way.) Want hard research? One recent study indicates Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy can contribute to autism. Another promises to be even more conclusive, and the lead-in to it doesn't require any cautious wording. Mercury isn't good for your brain. It's the second most potent neurotoxin on the planet, right after plutonium. It's showing up in a lot of unexpected places in the environment, and some that are expected, since we put it there. Thimerosal, a preservative that's 50% mercury by volume, has been used in multiple-dose vials of vaccines (including flu shots) for around eighty years, and mercury amalgam fillings have been used in dentistry since before the Civil War. (Fair warning - don't dive into the vaccine autism debate without a wetsuit and tanks. It's a deep, dark, sinkhole of craziness.) Instead, dive into a series of recent studies, including one published in 2016, indicatinga direct correlation between mercury and autism, using research conducted by good scientific standards and published in reputable journals. Get a flu shot that doesn't come from a single-dose vial or syringe, chances are you might get an injection of mercury-based preservative. Have amalgam fillings? Chance isn't involved - you have a neurotoxin in your mouth, inches from your brain. Same for your kids, but even if they don't have a single filling they can still theoretically be exposed to heavy metal toxicity if you or your spouse had them. One filling-free Austin holistic practitioner, confused by tests revealing high blood levels of heavy metal toxicity, realized both parents had mouthfuls of decades-old amalgam fillings, and one was having them removed and being treated for toxicity. A caveat, however. If you have amalgam removed, get it done properly. Dr. Matthew Carpenter, of Austin's Transcend Dental Health, points out simply grinding them out, rinsing, and spitting exposes you - and dental professionals in the office, including receptionists - to mercury vapor, and flushes mercury into water systems. Carpenter uses state of the art testing, removal, recovery, and disposal systems for heavy metals, combined with IV Vitamin C, safe, needle-free chelation, and other supportive therapies. He's also researched (and offers) testing for hereditary susceptibility to heavy metal poisoning. Oh, and those studies about Vitamin D and mercury? None of them were from this country. The mercury research was done in Egypt, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has something to say about that: [ Why can a chaotic society in a war-torn and relatively impoverished nation produce high quality science on... autism, while the science on environmental triggers of autism in the U.S. is stagnant, despite the NIH spending more than $1 billion on autism research since 2010? ] Why, indeed? The official CDC position is that mercury in medical products is \"very safe. Data from many studies show no evidence of harm...\" Right - and to quote Levon Helm's crusty gunsmith in Shooter , WMD's were in Iraq and Anna Nicole married for love. In the case of neurodevelopmental conditions - autism, ADHD, Alzheimer's - could mercury and other heavy metal exposure be a tipping point, after diet and heredity and such have set up the fall? The mechanisms that should answer such questions and protect you and your family from balance-tipping toxins probably won't be improving anytime soon. It's up to you to learn, make decisions, and find practitioners. [ Dr. Matthew Carpenter ] of Transcend Dental Health uses drill-free air abrasion, ozone therapy, natural alternatives to antibiotics, non-surgical treatment of gum disease, and consultations regarding the Detox Qube from Quicksilver Scientific to lower existing metal loads, including a panoramic x-ray for visualizing remaining metals in the oral cavity.
