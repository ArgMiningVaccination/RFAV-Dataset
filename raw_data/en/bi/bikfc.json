It was my curiosity about plant-based therapeutics, coupled with my interest in pharmacology, that led me on my journey from pharmacist to naturopath. There are many reasons why herbs can be a valuable therapeutic addition for our general health and for the management of medical conditions. Herbal actions Herbs have a wide variety of therapeutic actions such as: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immune digestive, diuretic, hypotensive, hypolipidemic, the list goes on and on (1). Generally, the actions of herbs tend to be gentle and the effects are usually a result of modulating activity. There are many herbal actions for which there are no pharmaceutical equivalent. My absolute favourite type of herb is an adaptogen. An adaptogenic herb is one that increases the body's resistance to all forms of stress, including physical, environmental or biological, and encourages normal physiological function. Adaptogen can increase energy levels and improve stamina. Other herbal actions that amaze me are: Trophorestoratives - which is a substance that helps restore the integrity of body tissue e.g. a 'hepatorestorative' herb promotes the healing and regeneration of liver cells and helps normalise declined function Immune modulating - is a substance that helps regulate and balance the immune system Nervine tonic - is a substance that supports nervous system function, with actions that both relax and energise (1). Herbs have many actions Not only is there a vast array of herbal actions, any one herb can have multiple actions. In fact, it would be rare for a herb not to have more than one therapeutic effect. Some examples include: Ginger - which is anti-inflammatory, stimulates digestion, helps with circulation and can be used to treat nausea Turmeric - has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, it can decrease blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and it also helps with liver detoxification Licorice - can be used for respiratory and digestive ailments, as well as an adrenal tonic (1). Knowledge on these multiple actions of each herb, is so valuable when choosing which herbs to prescribe for patients. You can provide multiple benefits and address several ailments using the one herb. Herbal medicine is versatile Herbal therapeutics can be used in many forms. Herbal teas are useful for digestive issues, promoting relaxation and is beneficial for increasing fluid intake. Think about peppermint, chamomile, dandelion and green teas. Herbs can be ingested as food, such as using spices to cook with, such as cinnamon, garlic, ginger and turmeric. Other plant-based therapeutics, such as psyllium husk, oats and slippery elm can be added to porridge or smoothies. There are many herbal products available in tablet, capsule and powder formulations. But my favourite way of prescribing herbs is in a herbal mixture. Using liquid herbal extracts allows me to devise a unique formulation for the patient. The result is a mixture that consists of herbs specifically chosen to address the health needs of the individual. It also means that one therapeutic product can treat multiple concerns due to the multiple actions one herb may have, as well as the ability to mix herbs together in one formulation. Herbs are effective There are many pharmaceutical drugs that have been derived from herbs. Digoxin was made from the plant Digitalis Metformin from a herb called Goat's Rue (Galega off.) and Aspirin from Willow Bark (Salix alba) (2). It has been shown that some herbs can have similar actions to pharmaceutical drugs without the side effects. The side effects of some pharmaceuticals that have been derived from plants, may result from the isolation of the active constituent. This process takes away protective mechanisms that the other constituents in the whole plant may have provided. For example, aspirin was derived from the plant Willow Bark. The use of aspirin can increase the risk of gastric ulceration in some patients (3). Willow bark is a herbal medicine that also anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, yet it does not damage the gastrointestinal mucosa (4). While there are never any guarantees for the effectiveness of herbal medicine, nor is there any guarantee of the effectiveness of pharmaceutical medications. I have seen many drugs prescribed that have not worked for patients. There is always a percentage of patients for which medications do not work well or fully for. The same applies for herbal therapeutic agents, there will inevitably be patients who do not respond with the desired effect. But I have seen herbal medicine work wonderfully to alleviate patient's ailments and improve health outcomes. I am an evidenced based healthcare practitioner, which means I prescribe treatments that has research to support its use. There continues to be an ever-growing body of quality research that assess the effectiveness of herbs. And we cannot ignore traditional evidence which consists of hundreds, if not thousands of years of plants being used as medicine. Herbs are safe One of the naturopathic principles is \"do no harm,\" and this is at the fore front of naturopaths' minds when treating their patients. When prescribed and used appropriately, herbs are overall safe and effective options. But herbs still have cautions, contraindications, side effects and interactions. Always consult with a healthcare professional before taking any herbal supplements, preferably one that specialises in herbal medicine. It is important to ensure any treatment is compatible with any medical conditions, other medications (both medically prescribed and over the counter), allergies, as well as making sure of appropriate dosing for age, gender and reason for use. In summary: There are a multitude of therapeutic herbal actions, with a majority of those that don't exist as pharmaceutical drug actions. Not only are there many herbal actions, herbs can each have multiple actions. Herbal medicine can be used in many forms, such as food and supplementation. Herbs have been shown to be effective. Overall herbs are safe when used appropriately (always seek advice). If you would like to find out how herbs could help with your health goals, get in touch! References: 1. Bone, K. (2003).
