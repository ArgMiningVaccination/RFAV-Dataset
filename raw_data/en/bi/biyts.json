They are designed to provide information and assist decision -making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. This Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence. Developed by a panel of mu ltidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. These guidelines are not intended to represent TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic intervent ions within these guidelines does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care.

Individuals who have been classified with CMI often suffer from multiple symptoms , such as fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, concentration and attention problems, and gastrointestinal disorders. Their health problems hav e not been attributed to any other diagnosable medical condition s and are not satisfactorily explained by stand ard evaluation s or diagnostic testing . The symptoms must be present or frequently recur over more than six months and should be of sufficient severity to interfere with daily function. The clinical spectrum of CMI overlaps with symptoms of other diseases and ill -defined conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) /myalgic encephalopathy, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . Other terms that have been used to describe CMI include medically unexplained symptoms, unexplained illnesses , or me dically unexplained physical symptoms. Estimates of the prevalence of a comparable set of symptoms in the general U.S. population provide some context for the relative extent of medically unexplained symptoms in the military and Veteran populations. 1 Based on a prospective cohort study of 500 consecutive patients presenting to a primary care clinic with physical symptoms, a 2005 publication reported that approximately one -third of cases were unresolved and remained unexplained after five years. [1] This is consistent with findings from a study published in 1993 that was based on data for 26 physical sympt oms from a broad multi- community survey of more than 13,000 people in the U.S. That large survey reported that approximately one-third of symptoms were not clearly explained by a diagnosed condition .[2] CMI imposes a significant burden of illness, disability, and decreased quality of life on a number of military Service Member s, families, and Veterans. Therefore , diagnosis and effective therapy and related management of CMI have great importance for Veterans Affairs (VA) and DoD. After every modern military combat deployment, some Service Member s have report ed illnesses characterized by multiple chronic symptoms upon their return . [3] Systematic studies have demonstrated that CMI is similar to many historical postwar illnesses. [ 4] Among these, population -based studies have consis tently demonstrated a higher prevalence and severity of symptom reporting in Gulf War Veteran s than in non - deployed Veteran s or other control groups. [5-7] While these symptom -based illnesses have been described after military deployments, the experience of CMI is not unique to those who served in the military, to any specific combat era, or to those who were deployed to either combat or non -combat environments. A 2014 report of an Institute of Medicine (IOM) c ommittee concluded that, d espite decades of research, there is no validated cause of , or case definition for either CMI or CMI in Gulf War Veteran s. [8] The committee a lso found that two existing definitions capture the spectrum of multisystem symptoms most 1 The reported set of physical symptoms includes: pain (e.g., headache, chest, abdominal, joint), respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, ear or nasal symptoms), and other (e.g., fatigue, dizziness, palpitations), as defined in: Kroenke K, Rosmalen J. Symptoms, syndromes, and the value of psychiatric diagnostics in patients who have functional somatic disorders. Med Clin N Am . 2006;90 :603-26. October 2014 Page 3 of 89 c ommonly identified in Gulf War Veteran s: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition [7] and the Kansas definition. [ 6] The CDC definition requires one or more symptoms in at least two of the fatigue, pain, and mood and cognition categories to identify a cas e. The Kansas definition requires symptoms in at least three of the domains of fatigue or sleep, pain, neurologic or cognitive or mood, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and skin to identify a case. The CDC case definition, which has been widely used by resea rchers, identifies 29 -60% of US Gulf War-deployed Veteran s as CMI cases depending on the population studied, whereas the Kansas definition identifies CMI in 34% of Gulf War Veteran s from Kansas who were the subject of th at study. The committee also stated that each definition had particular strengths, including the CDC definition's inclusion of severity indicators and the Kansas definition's exclusionary criteria. The IOM recommended, with reservation, the use of the two existing case definitions from the C DC and Kansas studies , as they are the best reflection of the symptom complexes and provide the VA and DoD with a foundation for clinical treatment and further research. Although the character of medically unexplained symptoms appears similar after modern wars, at this time there is insufficient evidence to determine if the excess symptoms reported after these deployments share a common precipitating factor or pathophysiology. The authors of this CPG define d a working case definition of chronic multisympto m illness with the goal of enhancing the health care and ultimately improving the health status for all the populations cared for in VA and DoD. The two case definitions recommended by IOM were intended for the 1990 -1991 Gulf War Veteran population and may not be generalizable to other conflicts. In developing this VA/DoD clinical practice guideline, the Work Group reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews on treatments for the symptoms commonly associated with CMI , including studies on related conditions with overlapping symptoms such as fibromyalgia, CFS, and IBS. It is likely that treatments found to be effective for one of these related or comorbid conditions are beneficial for some patients experiencing CMI ; however , the generalizability of the findings of the studies of these conditions to CMI has not been definit ively established. While other chronic conditions were not specifically included in the literature review during the development of this CPG, the CMI guideline may be relevant to chronic conditions that manifest with multiple chronic symptoms and functional limitations. Chronic overlapping physical and cognitive symptoms are sometimes attributed to specific events or conditions such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI ) or post -traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ), when instead they may reflect contributions from multiple factors, and thus may be amenable to the recommendations contained in this CPG. Though not specifically studied, this CPG is likely to be a helpful adjunct t o the current VA/DoD guidelines for mTBI, PTSD, and major depressive disorder ( MDD ), especially when patients report multiple chronic symptoms not readily explained by these or other health conditions. October 2014 P age 4 of 89 About t his Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) The Veteran s Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence -Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the \"...Health Executive Council on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence to improve the health of the population across the Veteran s Health Administration (VHA) and Military Health System,\" by facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines for the VA and DoD populations. [ 9] This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) is intended to provide primary care clinicians with a framework by which to evaluate the individual needs and preferences of patie nts who may be experiencing chronic multisymptom illness or medically unexplained symptoms, leading to improved clinical outcomes. It is also likely to be used by other health care professionals, including specialty care providers. In 2001, the VA and DoD published a CPG for the Management of Medically Unexplained Symptoms: Chronic Pain and Fatig ue (2001 CPG), which was based on evidence reviewed through February 2001 . Since the release of th at guideline, a growing body of research has expanded the general knowledge and understanding of unexplained symptoms, including new findings regarding the prevalence of the condition among the ci vilian and military populations and strategies for managing chronic or unexplained symptoms . Recognition of the complex natur e of CMI has led to the adoption of new strategies to manage t hese patients, as well as the development and use of new pharmacotherapies. Consequently, a recommendation to update the 200 1 CPG was initiated in April 2013; this updated CPG will be referred to in this text as the \"2014 CMI CPG.\" The updated CPG includes objective, evidence - based information on the patient -centered approach to management of CMI , the benefits and harms of pharmacologic and non -pharmacologic th erapies, the management of comorbid conditions, best practices for care delivery, and emerging innovations in clinical research and care. The overall expected outcome of successful implementation of this guideline is to: Formulate an efficient and effectiv e assessment of the patient's condition Optimize the use of therapy to reduce symptoms and enhance functionality Minimize preventa ble complications and morbidity Emphasize the use of personalized, proactive, patient -driven care Working Definition of Chronic Multisym ptom Illness Chronic multisymptom i llness (CMI) is a label given to a diverse set of disorders including, but not limited to, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), and irritable bowel s yndrome (IBS). CMI encompasses military -specific medically unexplained illnesses , such as Gulf War Illness, Gulf War Syndrome, or post -deployment syndrome. The definition of CMI also includes patients without accepted labels , defined by generally accepted criteria , who exhibit persistent or frequently recurring symptoms negatively impacting daily function for a minimum of six months duration from two or more of the following six categories: fatigue, mood and cognition, musculoskeletal (including pain) , respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurologic (including headache) . Patients with symptoms lasting less than six months, or who experience only one of the listed symptoms, or with a disease with a well- October 2014 P age 5 of 89 e stablished pathoph ysiology that explains all/most of their symptoms were not covered in this report. Further consideration for inclusion should be given to symptoms affecting the following sy stems : genit ourinary, cardio pulmonary , and sleep. Individuals who meet the above descriptive criteria and also meet established criteria for specific symptom -based syndromes (e.g., fibromyalgia, IBS, CFS) may derive benefit from this guideline. Scope of this CPG This Clinical Practice Guideline is designed to assist primary care providers in treating and managing patients with chronic multisymptom illness. It addresses the following elements. Population The patient popula tion of interest for this CPG comprises all adult s who may be experiencing CMI. The recommendations within this guideline were developed with a focus on individuals who are eligible for care in the Veteran s Health Administration or the Department of Defense healthcare delivery system. It includes deployed and non- deployed Veteran s as well as active Service Member s. This CPG does not provide recommendati ons for the treatment of CMI in children or adolescents. Intervention This CPG provides information on potential risk factors for CMI, diagnostic technologies that may be used for screening and assessment of CMI, management of CMI, and pharmacologic and n on- pharmacologic therapies for the treatment of CMI . Risk factors that may be associated with predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating CMI include medical (e.g., comorbidities ), psychological (e.g., abuse history), and occupational/environmental (e.g. , chemical exposure). The categories of diagnostic technologies considered under this CPG include biomarkers (biological markers and neuroimaging studies), neuropsychological test batteries, and sleep studies. Some of the managemen t approaches considered include team -based approaches, core competencies of the treatment team, patient- provider communication styles, the role of occupational and other rehabilitative services, behavioral health services, and patient follow -up practices. Non -pharmacologic therapies include psychological (i.e., hypnosis), physiological (i.e., exercise) and complementary and alternative treatments (i.e., acupuncture, biofeedback, and nutritional supplements) while p harmacologic therapies include , among others, antibiotics, antide pressants, and pain medications. Methods The methodology used in developing the 2014 CMI CPG follows the \"Guideline for Guidelines,\" an internal document of the VA and DoD EBPWG . This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions October 2014 P age 6 of 89 ( Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the submission of an updated CMI CPG. The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence -based clinical practice recommendations and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthca re system. Specifically, the Champions for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions of greatest clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the management and treatment of patients with CMI . In addition, the Champions assisted in: 1.Conducting the evidence review, including providing direction on inclusion and exclusioncriteria; 2.Assessing the level and quality of the evidence; 3.Identifying appropriate disciplines to be included as part of the Work Group; 4.Directing and coordina ting the Work Group; 5.Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes. The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Medical Command of the DoD, identified four clinical leaders as Champions for the 2014 CMI CPG, Drs. Paul Ciminera, Drew Helmer, and Stephen Hunt from VA and Dr. Aniceto Navarro from DoD. The Lewin Team (Team), including DutyFirst Consulting and ECRI Institute , was contracted by VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the ev idence review. The Team held the first conference call in May 2013, with participation from the contracting officer's representatives (COR), leaders from the VA and DoD evidence -based guideline development program, and the Champions. During this call, the project team discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review about the management of CM I. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the treatment and management of CMI , from which the Work Group members were recruited . The specialties and clinical areas of interest included Clinical Dietetics, Family Medicine, Healthcare Systems Management and Policy, Internal Medicine, Gastroenterology, Neurology, Nursing, Pharmacy Benefit Management, Physical Therapy, Psychiatry, Psychology and Surgery. The guideline development proces s for the 2014 CMI CPG consisted of the following steps: Formulating evidence questions (key questions) Conducting the systematic review Convening a two and a half day face -to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members Drafting and submitting a final CPG on the management of CMI to the VA/DoD EBPWG Appendix A provides a detailed description of each of these tasks. October 2014 P age 7 of 89 Limitations At present, the treatment of CMI is as much an art as it is a science. While it is difficult to reduce the management of CMI to a simple paradigm or single algorithm, there is increasing agreement that effective, evidence- based treatment strategies have many common elements. Often, perceived differences in treatment approache s may largely reflect differing training traditions , terminology, or theoretical perspectives across clinical disciplines, rather than scientific research. It is important to note that the Work Group did not formally updat e all aspects of the 2001 CPG. The Work Group chose to broaden the scope of the updated guideline to encompass chronic multisymptom illness as a whole, rather than focusing on chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. The key questions chosen for this CPG are those of the highest priorit y that would be supported by a comprehensive evidence review. Due to resource limitations, k ey questions were prioritized based on relative importance and availability of literature to adequately address them. There is wide appreciation within the 2014 CM I CPG Work Group that the individual symptoms experienced by patients are part of a larger continuum. Often, there may be a lack of evidence regarding the best way in which to address different aspects of the condition . Therefore, the existing evidence for and against various therapies was used to suggest potentially effective approaches for the rest of the continuum. In some cases, evidence gleaned from clinical trials examining therapies for similar \"overlapping\" symptom syndromes (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, mechanical low back pain, somatization disorder, and other chronic pain conditions) were used to formulate treatment recommendations in the absence of more relevant evidence. Additionally, the systematic review conducted for this CPG examined literature that was published up to February 2014. The Work Group recognizes that several new studies have been published since that time. Consequently, the group reviewed and incorporated new evidence in developing and refining the recommendations, as long as the studies met all a priori inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Algorithm Format This clinical practice guideline includes an algorithm, which is designed to facilitate clinical decision - making for the management CMI. The use of the algorithm f ormat was chosen based on the understanding that such a for mat can inform diagnostic and therapeutic decision -making, and has the potential to change patterns of resource use. It allows the provider to follow a systematic approach to critical information needed at the major decision points in the clinical process, and includes: An ordered sequence of steps of care Decisions to be considered Actions to be taken A clinical algorithm diagrams a guideline into a step -by-step decision tree. Standardized symbols are used to display each step in the algorithm, and arrows connect the numbered boxes indicating the order in which the steps should be followed.

Ov als represent a link to another section within the guideline. October 2014 Page 9 of 89 T his CPG is not intended to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual case and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advances and patterns evolve. This CPG is based on information available at the date of publication, and is intended to provide a general guide to best practices. The guideline can assist care providers, but the use of a CPG must always be considered as a recommendation, within the context of a provider's clinical judgment, in the care of an individual patient.

Wea k Against October 2014 Page 14 of 89 Diagnosis and Assessment of CMI Chronic multisymptom i llness (CMI) is a relatively new label without generally accepted diagnostic criteria given to symptom -based disorders and challenging to diagnose definitively in clinical practice. Due to these factors, literature guiding the identification of CMI is severely limited. The recommendations on diagnosis and assessment in this guideline focus on addressing any urgent or serious threats to the patient including comorbidities, conducting a thorough evaluation of symptoms, identifying any predisposing, precipitating, or perpetuating risk factors, and using appropriate tests to diagnose CMI. Recommendation 1.The guideline panel recommends that all patients receive a thorough evaluation of symptoms based on clinical judgment . (Strong For) Discussion A thorough and early review of all sources of information can help in validating the patient's health concerns, while communicating care and understanding\u2014 the necessary building blocks to an effective patient -clinician partnership. Sources of information include the following: All medical records Medical history and psychosocial assessment Review of systems Physical examination and mental status examination (MSE) Review of prescribed and over -the-counter medications and supplements Routine test results Standard health assessments In obtaining a medical history, the clinician should focus on key symptoms that may suggest a well- defined disease expl anation. Patients with unexplained symptoms have often been examined several times in the past. However, important details may have been overlooked due to time constraints or the frequency with which clinicians encounter such complaints in the absence of objective findings. Review all medical records available and track down medical records that might offer important clues, particularly to avoid unnecessary repeat testing. Consider creating a timeline of the most important elements of the patient's history of present illness to clarify temporal associations and longitudinal features of the illness and important contextual factors. Setting aside time for a detailed and thorough examination is critical for the assessment and may also help in building an alliance with the patient, who in many cases has been seen by several clinicians. In addition to a thorough physical examination, clinicians shoul d perform a careful mental health status examination, including assessment of appearance, behavior, mood and affect, cognition, thought content and processes, and insight and judgment. A useful screen for cognitive impairment in elderly patients consists o f four questions from the Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Koenig, 1996) (i.e., October 2014 P age 15 of 89 orie ntation to time, orientation to place, memorizing and repeating three non- related items, and spelling \"world\" b ackwards). [ 11] A psychosocial assessment is also critical in evaluating the patient with multisymptom illness and should include a screening for suicidal ideation and substance use disorders. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is an excellent screening tool for assessing the presence of the most common psychiatric conditions associated with complaints of fatigue: depressio n, symptoms, and anxiety . [12,13] Table 1. Clarification of Symptoms Symptom Attributes Questions Duration Has the symptom existed for days, weeks, or months? Has the symptom occurred only intermittently? With regard to pain and fa tigue, can the patient define if these symptoms occurred only two or three days per month or constantly? Is the symptom seasonal? Are there times of the day when the symptom is worse? Onset Can the patient recall exactly how the symptom began? Were there triggering events, either physical or emotional? Was the onset subtle and gradual, or dramatic and sudden? Have the triggering events tended to be the same over time or are there changing patterns? Location Is the symptom localized or diffuse? Can the patient localize the symptom by pointing to it? If the pain is diffuse, does it involve more than one body quadrant? Co-morbidity Does the patient have any diagnosed co -existing illnesses? What is the time relationship between the onset and severity of the c o-existing illnesses and the symptoms of fatigue and/or pain? What are the symptoms other than pain and/or fatigue? Are there co -morbid diagnoses? Are there changes in the patient's weight, mood, or diet? Previous Episodes If the symptoms are episodic, wh at is the pattern in regard to timing, intensity, triggering events, and response to any prior treatment? Intensity and impact How severe are the symptoms (use the 1 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS))? Ask the patient to describe any new limitations they have experienced compared to their usual life -style, including limitations in physical endurance or strength (e.g., climbing stairs, shopping, and amount or quality of sleep). Previous treatment and medications Exploring this aspect of the history may be complicated and require obtaining prior medical records, or having an authorized telephone conversation with the prior treating clinician. Ask the patient to bring in his/her medication bottles on a subsequent visit and document the exact names of the medications. Find out which medications have/have not been helpful. Past medical, surgical, and psychological history This area includes chronic and major acute illnesses and injuries, allergies, surgical procedures, and hospitalizations. The psychologica l history may take several visits to clarify, depending upon the ease with which the patient can articulate his/her emotional status and past and present issues. Explore stressors such as occupational and family issues. Patient perception of Ofte n omitted from the history -taking are questions designed to gain some October 2014 Page 16 of 89 Symptom Attributes Questions symptoms understanding of what the patient believes is happening. Ask the patient about his/her hunches and fears. Ther e is little evidence to predict the impact that diagnostic labels will have on the clinical course of patients with these symptoms. However, clinicians should consider the following: Assigning specific diagnostic labels may have implications in the clinical course for an individu al w ith CMI A diagnostic label may sometimes unnecessarily cause a patient to define him or herself as ill, an effect that could be especially problematic in oc cupational health care settings. Other clinicians may shift their attention/prioritization of the individual's concerns in response to a label. The potential risks and benefits of applying a particular diagnostic label to symptom clusters should be weighed by the clinician and discussed with the patient prior to applying such a label The clinician should consider symptom -based approaches to managing CMI; such approaches may be useful, without having to rely on specific diagnostic labels. Recommendation 2.This guideline panel recommends against the use of any test for which there may be limited additional benefit to confirm the diagnosis of CMI. Testing for rare exposures or biologic effectsshould only be done in the presence of supportive history or physical findings. (Strong Against ) Discussion Clinicians who are diagnosing patients with CMI often find themselves conducting a battery of diagnostic tests on the patient. However, the studies reviewed on the value of specific tests in patients with CMI were primarily hypothesis generating and designed to detect d ifference s between symptomatic patients and other populations, and no t to support development of a diagnostic evaluation for an individual. The evidence shows little benefit for an individual patient, and sometimes indicates risk of harm , in conducting these diagnostic tests. When deciding whether or not to conduct addition al testing, consideration should be given for patient preferences, presence of population norms for test values, previously negative test results, and risk and benefit of test procedure. Providers should engage patients in shared decision -making on clinical appropriateness of testing (see management recommendations) . Given the lack of available research to support testing, care teams should discuss opportunities for patient participation in approved research studies of diagnostic tests and approaches. The e vidence review revealed 22 studies of assays and assessments that include cholinergic function assessment, cholinergic challenge, genetic testing, immune system testing, neurologic function testing, neuroimaging and muscle testing. Most of the studies revi ewed were hypothesis generating and designed to detect a difference between groups (i.e., symptomatic patients and other populations ), and not to support deve lopment of a diagnostic a pproach for an individual patient . The findings of these studies may be u sed to support future research efforts, but there is insufficient evidence to endorse any of these modalities for general clinical use at present. The harms and burdens were considered to October 2014 P age 17 of 89 o utweigh the benefits for all of these modalities. While some important factors (e.g. , complexity, availability of resources) could be qualitatively considered during the evaluation of the use of a diagnostic test for a specific individual with CMI, information regarding other critical factors (e.g., repeatability, accuracy, precision, generalizability to the different deployed populations, Veterans, and Service Members) are not available . Results were inconsistent or negative in distinguishing CMI patients from healthy Veteran s by physiologic measures to include chol inergic function, [14] immune , [15-19] and neuropsychological test performance . [16,20-22] Studies of genetic tests were limited in number and scope, so that no definitive test can be recommended. Neuromusc ular evaluations to include electrodiagnostic testing [ 23] and muscle biopsy [24] in UK Gulf War Veteran s did not demonstrate a diagnostic predictive value or pathophysiologic explanation for CMI symptoms. Studies employing neuroimaging modalities such as diffusion tensor imaging, [ 25] functional MRI, [25] and voxel based morphometry [26] show promising preliminary results, but require further investigation and replication before any of these modalities can be recommended. Arterial spin labeling to measure hippocampal blood flow also shows promising early results, but cannot be recommended at this time due to the poor quality of the evidence. [ 27] The authors of this guideline recommend continued research of neuroimaging methods for diagnosing CMI. Recommendation 3.This guideline panel suggest s discussing risk factors using principles of health risk communication within a therapeutic patient -provider alliance for those patients who wish to further understand factors that could contribute to their condition. (Weak For) Discussion The Work Group aimed to identify factors that may predispose individuals to developing CMI (e.g. , sex, history of abuse), precipitate the development of CMI (e.g. , recent trauma, unexpected military deployment), and factors that may perpetuate CMI (e.g. , divorce, unemployment). While there are no randomized trials studying causality, there are a few systematic reviews and cohort studies published since 2000 that either directly studied factors seen in individuals with CMI or indirectly in other medically unexplained illnesses. Studies that were case controlled with at least 500 subjects were included. Eighteen studies were identified that met the workgroup's criteria. The W ork Group believes that understanding and communicating risk factors for CMI with individuals who wish to understand factors that could contribute to their condition potentially enhances provider and patient awareness, engenders trust, and promotes discovery of potentially treatable issues that may reduce the severity of CMI . [28] It should be emphasized , however , that the evidence for the risk factors reviewed is not sufficient for determination of a causal relationship to the predisposition to, precipitation, or perpetuation of CMI. A patient may have CMI and few risk factors , or may not h ave CMI but have many risk factors. The low predictive value of these risk factors precludes their use for October 2014 Page 18 of 89 d iagnostic purposes and over reliance may adversely affect the therapeutic alliance with the patient. Multiple studies of symptom based disorders reported a strong association with prior abuse. Multiple studies of symptom based disorders reported a strong association with prior abuse. Although none of the studies we reviewed directly looked at abuse in CMI, there is a strong association with sexual abuse defined as rape and the lifetime diagnosis of fibromyalgia (OR 3.35), chronic pelvic pain (OR 3.27) and functional gastrointestinal disorders (OR 4.01) . [29] Hauser et al. published a meta - analysis of 18 studies that revealed a significant association between fibromyalgia syndrome and self-reported physical and sexual abuse in childhood and adulthood, but not between FMS and emotional abuse. [ 30] Precipitating Factors There were three papers that directly studied potential precipitating factors in individuals with CMI. Powel et al . studied 21 ,400 individuals deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan from 2004 to 2008 utiliz ing the Millennium Cohort Study. [31] After adjusting for sex, birth year, education, service branch, pay grade, smoking, alcohol problems, mental health symptoms (including those related to depression, anxiety and PTSD) and baseline CMI, they found no relationship between individuals deployed to areas three miles from a burn pit and CMI , compared with other locations . In 1991 a controlled detonation of the Khamisiyah Ammunition Storage Facility in Iraq was later discovered to have contained chemical weapons (sarin and cyclosarine ). The amount of nerve agent in the resultant plume is unclear but i t has been postulated that exposure to low-level s of chemical weapons may precipitate CMI. [31] Blanchard et al . using a cross sectional cohort compared 1,061 deployed Gulf War Veterans and 1,128 non - deployed Veteran s between 1999 and 2001 with the goal of identifying factors associated with CMI. [5] They found that combat exposure, PTSD, major depression, substance use disorder and anxiety disorders were strongly associated with CMI. On the other hand, the authors did not find a s tatistically significant association with CMI in 236 individuals who were deployed and likely exposed to Khamisiyah compared to non -exposed deployed Veteran s at that time. A systemic review by Gronseth studying Gulf War Syndrome was unable to find sufficient evidence to determine if exposure to toxin s encountered during the Persian Gulf War was associated with the development of Gulf War Syndrome. [32] Gronseth points out many limitations in the reviewed studies including a potential bias due to reliance on self- reporting and variations in exposure to a causative factor. Although CMI occurs in military and non- military populations and is seen in higher rates in deployed compared to non -deployed populations, Blanchard 's study is consistent with previous studies in reporting a higher prevalence (28%) of CMI in Gulf War Veteran s compared to Veteran s from other deployments and that the more combat exposure the stronger the association to CMI . The strong association of the Gulf War and CMI is not just a United States phenomenon. Kelsall et al. reported the strong relationship between CMI and Gulf War deployment , depression and PTSD in Australian military men when compared to individuals actively deployed to non-Gulf War or peacekeeping operations , and when compared to non -deployed military personnel. [ 33] An explanation of etiology for the increased prevalence of CMI in Gulf War Veteran s continues to eva de studies. October 2014 Page 19 of 89 There are other symptom -based disorders that share features of CMI with stro ng associations to deployment. Eisen et al . found that compared to non -deployed Veteran s, deployed Gulf War Veterans had a higher association with fibromyalgia (OR 2.32) and chronic fatigue syndrome (OR 40.6). Reporting bias was a major limitation to this study. [34] Dhillon and Boyd performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the prevalence of life stressors before , during and after the Persian Gulf War in Veteran s who reported ch ronic fatigue s yndrome. [35] They found that individuals who developed CFS after deployment were less educated, wounded in battle, had a traumatic event during war, were demoted two years after war, or unable to work due to an illness or injury. Interestingly a cross sectional survey study by Jamil et al. found that during the Gulf War, military Service Member s were more likely than civilians to develop CFS (AOR 6.99) and those living closer to the Kuwait border had higher rates of CFS. [36] Perpetuating Factors We were unable to find any studies directly addressing perpetuating factors of CMI that met our search criteria. One systematic review found that the severity of symptoms in medically unexplained symptoms, somatization disorder and hypochondriasis in the general population may be pr edictive of symptom persistence.

The nature of management strategies presents multiple challenges to conducting rigorous double -blind controlled studies. Most of the studies available follow relatively small cohorts of non-military, non -Veteran patients , outside the United States, and are generally rated as moderate quality or b elow. Drawing on published studies of management approaches from symptom -based and other chronic conditions, the panel extrapolated findings to CMI. Recommendation 4.The guideline panel recommends using a co llaborative, team -based approach, including a behavioral health specialist, for the primary care management of patients with CMI. (Strong For) Discussion Caring for the patient with CMI \"requires personalized care that is most effective when provided by a team of health professionals \". [38] Patients with CMI often have a complex medical history, ongoing comorbid symptoms and conditions, and psychosocial challenges requiring a variety of skills sets and expertise that extends beyond the competencies of any single individual or profession. CMI patients are at risk for having medication- related problems as well. While there are no clinical trials to provide evidence that patients with CMI should have team -based care, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in \"Gulf War and Health: Treatment for Chronic M ultisymptom Illness\" recommends that \"a team approach and specific expertise\" is im plemented for patients with CMI. [ 39] PCMH as a model of team -based care for CMI Patient care is enhanced by using a collaborative team -based management approach that emphasizes the relationsh ip between the pr imary care team and the patient and his or her social support network . [40] Historically, the concept of team -based primary care was first coined in 1967 by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) when they introduced the term \"medical home\" to describe the care that chronically ill children received in primary care pediatrics. The care delivered to these patients was accessible, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, family -centered and culturally sensitive . [41] Since that time, the concept of team -based health care has evolved into the p atien t centered medical h ome (PCMH), which reflects the pediatric medical home mo del and the chronic care model to promote comprehensive, continuous, accessible, coordinated, planned proactive health care and patient activation . [ 40] The patient care goal for the PCMH and PACT is to \"provide co mprehensive, integrated care including follow -up health care, education, and training\". [ 42] To be effective, the medical home requires enhanced access, team -based care, population management, care coordination, care management, systems -based approach to quality and safety, an d health information technology. [ 41] Team -based care is a foundational eleme nt of the medical home. It refers to the joint effort of various health care professionals from different specialties and training, and with different skills and knowledge. [ 41] Team -based care fosters an environment of collaborative, October 2014 Page 22 of 89 c omprehensive health care. A team approach optimizes the patient's outcomes by including members who see the patient from all angles, resulting in a shared appreciation for the patient as a whole. The multi -disciplinary nature of practice has to be integrated across the continuum of care activities from inquiry and data gathering, to decision making, education, and follow -up for reassessment. This ultimately works towards the common goal of improving patient care and quality of life for patients. A multi -disciplinary approach has been proven through many s tudies to be beneficial to the patient, including in home health programs. These programs see robust benefits such as reduced hospitalization and emergency room visits for their patients with complex conditions. In preliminary data provided by Reidt et al. , records showed that hospitalization and emergency room visits decreased by half after the implementation of their program to include more diverse professionals in a home health program. [ 43 ] Studies demonstrating benefit have included patients with complex, chronic problems such as short bowel syndrome, and neonatal care. [ 44,45] While it is optimal for patients with CMI to be cared for within a PCMH or PACT, patients with CMI may still benefit from a team -based approach that may not achieve full realization as a PCMH or PACT. [ 41] Regardless of the terminology used to describe it, the medical home concept has gained recognition as a model of primary care delivery, emphasizing the importance of a team approa ch to care. Medical home teams are multi-disciplinary in nature, providing a mix of expertise in medical care, mental health care, nursing, and social work. Team members for CMI team- based care Currently, the VHA and DoD have transitioned to team -based care in the form of PACT and PCMH respectively. The PCMH and the PACT serve as the military members' (and their beneficiaries') and Veterans' medical home. The core primary care teams consist of: Primary care providers (physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) Registered nurses Licensed vocational nurses Nursing assistants Enlisted health care specialists (68W, 4NO, corps man) or their civilian equivalents Medical technicians or assistants Extended members of the PCMH and PACT consist of the following as part of the multi- disciplinary team has been crucial in the management of advanced care for patients. [ 46]: Behavioral medicine c linicians Social workers Clinical pharmacists Dietitians Nurse case managers Health coaches October 2014 P age 23 of 89 C are coordina tors, including dietitians, clinical nurses, social workers, pharmacists and othe r allie d health professionals Chaplains Doctors and other medical providers have been trained to focus on biomedical aspects of health and ensuring involvement of allied heal th professionals may result in better outcomes for their patients. [ 47] Successful primary care requires a holistic approach and primary care providers may need to address patient issues for which they might not have enough time or appropriate skills. Other members of the medical home team who are engaged in the care of a patient may be able to catch issues of medication non-adherence (nursing staff), evaluate proper dosing and possible adverse interactions or effects (pharmacists), provide education and suggest co mmunity -based support (social worker), detect potential food -drug interaction (dietitian) and, thus, can improve overall outcomes for the patients they serve. [ 48] Front line case nurse managers and clinical nurses have great responsibilities which benefit the patient. Those nurses lead by example and support all members of the team to perform to the highest standards. [49] They often focus on developing a rapport with the patient and can inform the team members of changes which could affect the patient's care. An essential element in the success of the medical home is \"optimal co mmunication among team members\" which is often operationalized in the form of daily , or twice daily , staff huddles. The climate for taking care of the patient is positive when interdisciplinary care employs a heightened sense of team work and r esults in benefit for the patient. [ 49] Care coordination for patients with CMI Patients with CMI require ongoing care and need to have timely access to primary care and the appropriate multispecialty team of experts. At the point of separation from active duty military service, care coordination should occur within and between the DoD and VHA. Frequently, the Veteran/military members also receive care in the private sector and care coordination should incorporate care provided by civilian colleagues . The coordination should include: Establishment of lead care coordination responsibility among providers Notification of all providers involved in a patient's care in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Sharing of established VHA /DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) applicable to the specific patient Establishment of care -team membership for the patients who require specific expertise (i.e. , neurologists who specialize in traumatic brain injury (TBI) or acupuncturists' for painmanagement) Reiteration of access to consultation with or referral to Veteran or military medical centers Sharing of the patient -centered treatment plan and updates October 2014 P age 24 of 89 S haring of all test results and specialist opinions across healthcare systems to avoid redundant testing and consultation and promote a unified approach to management. Behavioral medicine expertise on the team As with any chronic condition, living with CMI can be stressful and compound other psychosocial stressors in an individual's life. There is little specific research on the integration of a behavioral health professional in the primary care team for treatment of CMI, but there is evidence to support th e use of specific psychotherapies in patients with CMI or specific symptom -based syndromes (see non - pharmacologic recommendations in this CPG). Professional experience tells us that many complex medical conditions benefit from a holistic approach and mental health providers are regularly integrated into the primary care model in both VA and DoD settings. The shared decision -making model takes into consideration patient preferences which , at times , may prohibit the involvement of mental health, often due to lasting stigma in this area. Embedding a mental health provider in the primary care setting streamlines care, expedites the multiple appointments which are often necessary for complex patients, and may reduce the stigma associated with visiting a mental health provider in an identifiable mental health care unit. The best method for integrating mental health into the primary care management of CMI patients has yet to be identified. A method involving the use of a \"consultation letter\" to better link mental health and primary care was studied by Hoedeman et al. [ 50 ] The study was deemed low grade and identified as having \"serious limitations,\" and did not yield significant improvement in the intervention group. A low grade study by Schaefert et al., also with serious limitations, utilized collaborative group intervention of the primary care team and a psychosomatic medicine specialist. This study yielded a statistically significant decline in use of specialty consultations and visits to emergency rooms at the one-year mark, but the improvement was n o longer present at the two -year mark. [ 51] The exact skills and training of the mental health provider have not been outlined at this time. The studies discussed above used a range of professionals including psychiatrists, psychosomatic medicine specialists, and staff experienced in biopsychosocial care. Possible disciplines include psychiatric nurse practition ers, clinical social workers, clinical or health psychologists, and psychiatrists. Further study in this area is needed to determine the ideal skill set of mental health providers for this population and best practices for delivery mental health care in a time - and cost -efficient manner. Recommendation 5.The guideline panel recommends that the healthcare team use shared decision -making principles to develop a comprehensive and personalized treatment plan in the care and management of patients with CMI . (Stron g For) Discussion The lack of diagnosis or effective cure can make the management of patients with unexplained symptoms challenging and cause frustration for both the patient and the provider. A high level of trust October 2014 P age 25 of 89 b etween the patient and clinician is requ ired to maintain continuity of care and continue management through regular follow -up appointments. The initial evaluation helps establish a collaborative partnership between the patient and clinician. To strengthen the partnership with th e patient, the clinician should: [ 52] Acknowledge and indicate commitment to understand the patient's concerns and symptoms. Encourage an open and honest transfer of information that will provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient' s concerns and medical history. Indicate commitment to allocate sufficient time and resources to resolving the patient'sconcerns. Avoid open skepticism or disapproving comments in discussing the patient's concerns. At each patient visit, the clinician should consider the following: Ask if there are unaddressed or unresolved concerns. Summarize and explain all test results. Schedule follow -up visits in a timely manner. Explain that outstanding or interim test results and consultations will be reviewed durin g th e fo llow -up visits. Offer to include the concerned family member or significant other in the follow -up visit. Explore referral to specialty services as clinically indicated. Patients have certain common hopes and expecta tions when they see a clinician. [ 53] Patients want to be listened to, be abl e to fully express their fears and concerns, and share their burden. They want the clinician to be interested in them as fellow human beings, in a compassionate and nonjudgmental fashion. They expect professional competence and to receive the best in medical science and technology. They want to be reasonably informed as to the probable cause of their concerns and what the future is likely to hold. The clinician's initial evaluation helps establish a high level of trust by demonstrating that the patient's symptoms will be taken seriously. Continuity of care is also essential for building a trusting therapeutic alliance and rapport. Continuity is achieved through regularly scheduled follow -up appointments Develop a Treatment Plan Ensure that the patient understands the meaning and impact of CMI on his/her life and the potential improvement a recommended treatment may offer. A final acceptable treatment plan should be negotiated with the patient and documented in the medical record. Prepare a summary of the problems and potential treatments prior to meeting the patient oDevelop a problem list with an assessment of problem severity and urgency for treatment. oDevelop treatment options for discussion with the patient. Educate the patient October 2014 P age 26 of 89 oDis cuss the general concept of CMI and how problems associated with this diagnosis apply to the patient. oEvalu ate the patient's understanding through teach back. oDescribe treatment options and the associated risks and benefits. oDescribe the prognosis of the illness. Collaborate with the patient and determine the patient's preferences oDetermine the patient's goals for recovery. oExplore and discuss the patient's beliefs regarding his or her illness. oDetermine if the patient agrees with the priority and severity of the problems and urgency for treatment. oDetermine the level of the patient's agreement with the recommended treatment or one of the alternative options. oDetermine the patient's readiness to begin treatment and identify barriers to treatment. oUse motiv ational interviewing techniques to encourage change talk. oObtain the patient's consent to the treatment plan. Empower the patient for self -management oRefocus the responsibility of patient improvement from the treatment team to th e p atient. oEncourage a chan ge in life -style, including exercise, diet, sleep , hygiene, stress reduction, relaxation training, leisure activity schedule, and pacing. Implement the treatment plan oCoordinate treatment plan activities. oEstablish a referral and interdisciplinary team approach, if indicated. Follow -up oMonitor treatment progress and patient improvement. oEstablish a regular follow -up schedule throughout and after treatment. Given the limited RCTs examining reflective interv iew/motivational interviewing, we recommend further research is needed in this population before a stronger recommendation can be made in support of this modality for patient care. A reflecting interview technique was studied by Rasmussen et al. with a small sample of mostly female patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (intervention group n=12 vs. controls n=12). [ 54] In terms of health care utilization the number of primary care visits did not vary between patients in the reflecting interview condition and the control condition at one year follow up, but t otal health care costs statistically significantly decreased in the reflecting interview condition. No significant differences were seen in physical health, mental functioning, or health care satisfaction at one year follow up. Recommendation 6.The guideline panel suggests that all providers involved in the care of patients with CMI enhance their knowledge of the following critical domains: a.Communication skills (e.g. active listening, risk communication/perception) October 2014 P age 27 of 89 b .Empathy ski lls c.Working with interdisciplinary teams d.The biopsychosocial model e.Risk factors for CMI and analogous conditions f.Military cultural competency g.Deployment related exposures (Weak For) Discussion \"A good doctor listens to you and then addresses what you're feeling...I may know a lot about your disease, but I don't know how you experience your illness.\" --- Thomas Delbanco, MD, Director of General Medicine and Primary Care at Beth Israel Hospital. The above quote by Dr. Delbanco nicely sums up the quality known variously as a therapeutic relationship, communication skills, rapport, empathy, and emotional intelligence. These qualities have long been prized in psychotherapy, but it is only recently that physicians and medical schools have begun to turn their attention to the role of relationship skills in medicine. Communication skills are oftentimes considered part of the \"art\" (rather than science) of medicine, and it can be difficult to operationalize emotional intelligence . One of the most powerful components of an effective communication style is the use of validation. The root of validation comes from the Latin valeo for \"to make strong or worthy.\" Validation of patient concerns has been found to im prove patient satisfaction and reduce both physical and emotional pain. Physician empathy has been found to increase both patient satisfaction and treatment compliance. [55] Remarkably, in one study by Hojat et al ., high levels of physician empathy even resulted in better control of hemoglobin A1c and improved LDL -C control. [55] It has been demonstrated that the physician -patient relationship is an emotional one. A lack of emotional intelligence has even been linked with higher malpractice claims. Communication skills such as active listening, validation, and empathy can be learned and practiced by both students and establishe d professionals. We do not have any evidence that there is a special need in this population for a higher level mastery of these competencies compared to the general population seeking medical care. It is possible that rapport, warmth, empathy, and active listening skills are basic human needs in any relationship, but they may be particularly important in one where the power imbalance is as pronounced as that of the physician and patient. Individuals with CMI may have a n even deeper need for validation because t heir illnesses are mysterious, misunderstood, and largely idiopathic. Although w e need more research to build the evidence base supporting the use of these core competencies with the CMI population , providers may consider skills building educational opport unities to elevate the level of care they provide to these patients. Use of the biopsychosocial model has found wide acceptance within the field as an important component in the treatment of a wide variety of complex conditions including pain disorders, irritable October 2014 P age 28 of 89 b owel syndrome, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and insomnia. [56] The biopsychosocial model provides healthcare providers with a means to consid er the whole person, integrating key pieces of contextual information that may better help the clinical team assess the patient, establish rapport, communicate treatment options, understand needs and discuss risk and benefits. When using chronic pain as a clinical challenge model analogous to CMI, it is important to observe that the assessment and treatment of pain has gained sophistication over time. The psychogenic pain model presumed that when \"a physical cause could not be identified for the pain, the pain was assumed to be psychologically generated\" [56]. The psychogenic pain mod el is no longer widely accepted . [56] The gate -control theory of pain [ 57] and the biopsychosocial model [ 58] have provided \"important frameworks for better understanding pain to help those experiencing pain find ways to improve their quality of life.\" [ 56] In addition, Guzman at el. led a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials and found strong evidence that \"intensive multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation with function al restoration improves function when compared with inpatient or outpatient non -multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatments.\" [ 59] Guzman at el . also went on to determine \"moderate evidence that intensive rehabilitation with functional restoration reduces pain when compared with outpatient non -multidisciplinary rehabilitation or usual care.\" [59] Healthcare providers entrusted to care for Service Members require a depth of facility and knowledge of military culture, occupational health and deployment related exposures and stressors. Approximate ly 30% of recent Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan reported one or more concern about an occupational or environmental exposure while deployed. These same individuals reported high er burden of symptoms, as well. [60,61 ] Training should be provided to healthcare providers in order to ensure an appropriate knowledge base of military culture, military occupational health and potential deployment -related exposures. [ 62] The VA and DoD h ealth care systems currently offer a range of training in military culture and occupational health and safety for healthcare providers. It must be noted that there is not rob ust research in the special population of Service Members in this regard, beyond patient satisfaction survey data collection. However, O'Toole et al. led a study, Building Care systems to improve access for high -risk and vulnerable Veteran populations, which concluded tailoring the medical model home to the specific needs and challenges facing high risk populations can increase primary care utilization and im prove chronic disease monitoring. [63 ] In the O'Toole et al. study the medical homes were divided into special populations clinic teams designed specifically for the needs of each group, for example, homeless Veterans, women with MST or PTSD, Veterans with mental illness and Veterans with cognitive impairments , and Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF ) Service Members . [ 63] Healthcare providers must also be aware of risk factors for chronic multisystem illness and analogous conditions. The panel noted actual knowledge of CMI and differential diagnoses were a core October 2014 P age 29 of 89 c ompetency of healthcare providers. See the discussion on assessment for more details about the prevalence of factors associated with CMI and attributed causality. Therapeutic Interventions for Global CMI Global CMI is roughly classified as CMI without a specific predominant set of symptoms (i.e., pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal). Patients categorized as having global CMI may present with a number of symptoms from various categories. The following recommendations are designed to be applicable for all patients with CMI, regardless of their predominant symp toms. Recommendation 7.The guideline panel suggests incorporating appropriate elements of physical activity as part of a c omprehensive and integrated treatment plan for patients with CMI. ( Strong For) Discussion Peters et al . conducted an RCT to examine the efficacy of aerobic exercise (n = 114) relative to stretching (n = 114) in the management of patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS ). All training sessions met for one hour twice a week for 10 weeks. Aerobic exercise was designed to meet a target heart rate of 60 -65% age -adjusted maximum; stretching training was designed to be non -aerobic (Max heart rate <50% age adjusted maximum). Overall, the age of participants was 44 years and 53% of participants were female. Follow -up was reported at six months after training. The primary outcomes considered by Peters et al. included primary healthcare use, changes on the Hospital Anxiety and Depre ssion Scale (HADS) depression and anxiety scales, SF -36 scales, and somatization scales. Use of healthcare did not differ between aerobic exercise and stretching. The number of physician visits and prescriptions decreased significantly over time for both exercise conditions and was inversely correlated with the number of training sessions attended. The more training sessions attended independent of activity type, the fewer physician visits were scheduled or prescriptions were obtained at six months follow u p. Symptom scores on the HADS depression and anxiety scales, SF -36 scales, and somatization scales did not differ as a function of exercise type. Scores improved over time for both conditions, but were not associated with attendance. [64 ] Nickel et al. considered the effects of bioenergetic exercises (BE) on the psychotherapeutic treatment results of Turkish immigrants with chronic somatoform disorders. [65] The patients in this study were receiving in -patient treatment in a hospital in Germany that specialized in treating patients with psychosomatic illnesses. Patients were randomly assigned to receive BE (64 patients) or the control condition (64 patients). Patients in the BE group participated in various mind -body exercises that included expression exercises, exercises in setting boundaries, vocal and breathing exercises, and body movement exercises. Patients in the control condition participated in light gymnastic exercises. Each group also received inpatient psychotherapy plus treatment with antidepressants. The exercise therapy in each study group was provided i n 60 minute group sessions twice a week over a period of six weeks. The mean age of patients in the BE group was 48.3 years, and 49.4 years in control group. The patients October 2014 Page 30 of 89 in each study group were predominantly female (68% female in BE group; 72% female in control group). The primary outcome in the Nickel et al. study was change in symptoms as measured by the symptom checklist (SCL -90-R, Turkish version) and Global Symptom Severity Index (GSI). Secondary outcomes included measures of anger expression. Somatization symptoms significantly improved among patients who received bioenergetics exercise therapy compared to patients in the control group (Mean Difference (MD) between groups: - 6.2; 95% CI - 8.5 to - 39, p<0.001). Significant differences were also observed for other symptoms, including feelings of social isolation, depression, anxiety, and hostility. Severity of symptoms improved from baseline to follow up in both groups, but the difference between groups for this outcome did not reach statistical significance. The authors noted that there was no difference in outcomes between men and women. [65 ] Two systematic reviews considered the use of exercise as treatment for patients with FMS. Brosseau et al. assessed the effectiveness of strengthening exercises (defined as isometric, isokinetic, or concentric/eccentric resistance exercise with the purpose of increasing muscular strength). The evidence base for this review consisted of five RCTs enrolling a total of 150 adult patients w ith FMS. The average and gender of the patients enrolled in the studies was not reported in the review. The duration of treatment ranged from 12 ( one study) to 21 weeks (four studies), and the strengthening exercises were performed twice a week in all stud ies. In four of the studies the control condition was not specified ; in one study the control group received flexibility exercises. [66] The primary outcomes considered in the Brosseau et al. review that focused on the efficacy of strengthening exercises were pain, disability, and quality of life. For the outcome of pain, strengthening exercises showed clinically and statistically significant benefits versus controls for general pain (measured using visual analog scale [VAS]; Relative Difference [RD] 117%). Strengthening exercises also showed clinically and statistically significant benefits in improving disability compared to cont rols (disability was measured using the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire; RD 46%). No clinical or statistical benefit for strengthening exercises versus controls was observed for quality of life (as measured using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire). In the one study that considered the comparative efficacy of strengthening exercises to flexibility training, the only outcome for which strengthening exercises showed a clinical and statistical benefit was quality of life (RD 23%). [ 66 ] The other review by Nuesch et al. focused on the efficacy of aerobic exercise (AEX). In this review, AEX was one of several treatments considered. The authors performed a comprehensive systematic review of several pharmacological and non- pharmacological treatments for the management of patients w ith FMS. Other treatments from this review include balneotherapy and multicomponent therapy. The evidence base for AEX consisted of 33 RCTs that enrolled 2,266 patients with an average age range of 34 to 53 years. The majority of the patients in the included studies were female (percent female range 77 to 100). The average duration of treatment across studies was 12 weeks. The controls included the following: non -intervention control (17 studies), minimally -active control (13 studies), and placebo (three st udies). In this review controls were classified as follows: waiting list or treatment as usual were classified as non- intervention control, drug placebo or sham intervention as placebo control, and interventions deemed as minimally active (e.g., education, relaxation)as minimally active controls. [67 ] October 2014 Page 31 of 89 T he primary outcomes considered in the Nuesch et al. review that focused on the efficacy of aerobic exercise (AEX) were pain and quality of life. Secondary outcomes in this review inc luded fatigue, sleep problems, and drop outs. Data for pain and quality of life were pooled in a network meta- analysis using the standardized mean difference (SMD) to calculate the summary effect size estimates. Network meta- analysis allows for simultaneous analyses of all randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological and non -pharmacological head -to-head or with a common control intervention, while respecting the full randomization of the included trials. The results Relative Difference is defined by the authors of the review as the absolute benefit divided by the baseline mean (weighted for the intervention and control) indicated a statistical benefit of AEX compared to placebo for improving pain (SMD - 0.61; 95% CI -0.88 to -0.337, negative SMD quality - 0.76; 95% CI -1.15 to -0.38). [67 ] Alternative Exercise Mist et al. conducted a review on the efficacy of land -based alternative exercises for adults ( 21 years) with FMS. The evidence base in this review consisted of 16 studies ( seven RCTs and nine single arm trials) enrolling a total of 832 patients. The mean age ranges across studies or percent female in studies of mixed gender were not reported. The authors did indicate that five of the included studies enrolled only women. The authors considered the evidence for Qigong ( six studies), Tai Chi ( five studies), Yoga (three studies), and other exercises (three studies, including Pilates, body movement therapy, and dance). The con trol conditions included waitlist/no treatment controls or inactive treatment controls (conditions in which a key element of therapy was not received). The duration of treatment across studies ranged from 4 to 28 weeks, and the duration of follow up ranged from 4 to 24 weeks. [68 ] Mis t et al. analyzed each type of exercise considered in their review (Qigong , Tai Chi, Yoga, and other [Pilates, body movement, and dance]) using the SMD to calculate an estimated summary effect size for the primary outcome of pain. In all but one study, pain was measured using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). In the other study pain was measured using the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The results of all the analyses indicated a significant benefit of the alternative exercise compared to the control condition in improving pain. The overall summary effect of the six studies assessing the efficacy of Qigong was an SMD of 0.472 (95% CI 0.250 to 0.693, p <0.001). Only one study assessing Qigong reported adverse events. Shoulder pain and plantar fasciitis was reported for two study participants. [68 ] Recommendation 8.The guideline panel recommend s offering cognitive behavioral therapy , delivered by trained prof essionals, for patients with CMI. (Strong For) Discussion For global CMI, the highest quality evidence reviewed supports the use of CBT. The highest quality studies include outcome measures for multiple symptoms such as pain, fatigue, cognition, distress and October 2014 P age 32 of 89 m ental health functioning. Donta et al. conducted a large scale multicenter trial comparing effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and exercise in Gulf War Veteran's Illnesses (GWVI). [ 69] They found CBT improved physical symptoms, and both CBT and exercise improved cognitive symptoms and mental health functioning. Kleinstauber et al. conducted a systematic review on the efficacy of short - term psychological therapies for the treatment of medically unexplained physical symptoms . [70] Short - term psychotherapy included CBT, reattribution training, interpersonal psychodynamic therapy, and behavioral medical intervention. For all forms of psychotherapy, intervention statistically significantly improved physical symptoms relative to comparators at the end of treatment. Subgroup analyses indicated that CBT, behavioral medical intervention, and reattribution training all statistically improved physical symptoms at the end of treatm ent, and at one year f ollow -up. Schroder et al. c onducted a RCT to compare the effectiveness of CBT o r progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) training in the management of MUPS. [ 71] Overall the age of participants was 48.02 years and 76.9% of participants were female. The interventions consisted of one 90 minute session per week of either group CBT (n = 49) or group PMR (n = 41) training for eight weeks (both treatments given with adherence to f ollow up was reported at 12 months after baseline. This study showed a reduction in symptom severity and symptom number for somatoform symptoms following CBT relative to waitlist control. [71] Guarino et al. conducted an RCT to examine the efficacy of CBT and aerobic exercise, alone and in combination, in managing Gulf War Veteran s' Illness (GWVI). [ 72] A total of 1,092 Veteran s with G WVI were enrolled in the trial. The study was designed in a 2 x 2 factorial design: CBT plus usual care (n = 286); aerobic exercise plus usual care (n = 269); CBT plus exercise plus usual care (n = 266); and usual care (n = 271). O verall, the average age of participants was 40.7 years, and 40.5% of the participants were female. Exercise sessions were 60 minutes weekly for 12 weeks and were designed to increase activity and allowed participants to choose the types of exercise they li ked. CBT sessions took place in groups of three to eight patients with one therapist. Sessions were conducted with the use of a treatment manual, and met for 60 -90 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. Follow up was report ed at 12 months after baseline. There is g ood evidence for the benefit of CBT in pain populations and there is an infrastructure in place within the VA/DoD system for delivery. For pain -predominant CMI the literature on the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of fi bromyalgia was reviewed. Bernardy et al. conducted systematic review with an evidence base consisting of 23 randomized controlled trials enrolling a total of 1,073 patients. [ 73 ] The average age of the patients across studies was 47.5 years, and the majority of patients enrolled in the studies were female (median percent female 96%). Nineteen studies provided traditional CBT (delivered by a trained professional), three studies provided self -managed CBT (provided by a lay person trained to delivery CBT), and two studies provided operant therapy (a modified form of CBT). The comparators included waitlist controls ( two studies), attention controls (two studies), ac tive controls ( eight studies), and usual care (11 studies). Overall, the median duration of all CBTs was 10 weeks and the median number of sessions was 10. The median follow up across studies was six months. The primary outcomes measured in the review by B ernardy et al. were pain, negative mood, disability, and withdrawal from treatment. [ 73] The authors of this review pooled data for these outcomes in October 2014 Page 33 of 89 s eparate meta -analyses using the standardized mean difference (SMD) to calculate the summary effect size estimates. The authors performed meta -analyses that combined all studies for each follow -up period (12 weeks and six months), and then conducted separate subgr oup analyses for each type of CBT (traditional, self- management, and operant). At 12 weeks, the SMD for pain in the analysis combining all types of CBTs (23 studies) was -0.29 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] -0.47 to -0.11), which indicates a statistically significant benefit of CBTs compared to controls in reducing pain. The SMD in the analysis considering only traditional CBT also showed a statistical benefit of CBT over controls for pain reduction (SMD -0.30; 95% CIs - 0.44 to - 0.15; 19 studies). However, n o statistically significant benefit was observed for self -managed CBT or operant therapy compared to controls. At six months, the SMD for all CBTs and for traditional CBT indicated a statistically significant benefit of CBTs for reducing pain compared to c ontrols (All CBTs: -0.40 [95% CI - 0.28 [ -0.43 to - 0.214]). The six month meta -analytic results for self- managed CBT and operant therapy were not considered because the analyses consist ed of fewer than three studies. For gastrointestinal (GI) predominant CMI the re is moderate quality evidence on the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. There is also an infrastructure in place for its delivery. CBT is efficacious in and conducive to group format. As with all interventions, CBT can be one component of care in a shared decision- making model and rep resents a key element of the bio-psychosocial conceptualiza tion of CMI, given the relationships between mental health, physical health, and GI symptoms. Zijdenbos et al. conducted a systematic review on the efficacy of several psychological therapies for the treatment of IBS. [ 74 ] The evidence base for the review of standard CBT consisted of 14 RCTs enrolling 1,135 patients. The mean age range was 30.9 to 49.2 years and gender of the patient s ranged from 66% to 96% female. The studies compared CBT versus usual care at two months of therapy ( five studies), two of which also included a placebo arm, or three months of therapy ( eight studies), three of which also included a placebo arm, or CBT vs . placebo at three months of therapy ( one study). Long- term follow up at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months was available for some studies and some outcomes ( three studies). The primary outcomes measured in the review by Zijdenbos et al. were IBS symptom scores, improvement in abdominal pain, and quality of life. [ 74] The autho rs of this review pooled data for these outcomes in separate meta- analyses using the SMD to calculate the summary effect size estimates. When looking at 3 months of treatment, CBT statistically significantly improved symptom scores relative to waitlist or usual care (SMD = 0.58; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79) but not relative to placebo treatment (SMD = - 0.17; 95% CI - 0.45 to 0.11). Similarly, when looking at three months of treatment, CBT statistically significantly improved quality of life relative to waitlist or u sual care (SMD = 0.92; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.77) but not relative to placebo treatment (SMD = 0.16; 95% CI - 0.22 to 0.54), suggesting a treatment expectation bias or placebo response in the patients in the studies with no placebo control. Abdominal pain was not affected by CBT relative to comparator, with the exception of two months treatment in comparison to waitlist or usual care (SMD = 0.45; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.91). At the longest follow up time points, CBT was not superior to waitlist or usual care for any outc omes measured. There were no follow-up data available for the placebo conditions. [ 74] Ford et al. conducted an RCT on self- administered CBT with a total of 28 patients (CBT n = 17; controls n = 11). The age and gender of the patients was not reported. This study compared self -administered CBT October 2014 P age 34 of 89 to u sual management. Treatment duration was five sessions undertaken over 10 weeks. The p rimary outcome measured in the study was 50% reduction in baseline symptom scores. The authors of this review pooled data for these outcomes in separate meta- analyses using the risk ratio (RR) of symptoms persisting to calculate the summary effect size estimates. The RR for reduction in symptom severity at the end of treatment was RR = 1.04 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.29), indicating that self- administered CBT did not affect symptom severity relative to usual care. [75] Recommendation 9.The guideline panel recommends considering mindfulness-based therapy, reattribution, behavioral medical intervention, and/or brief psychodynamic interpersonal psychotherapy, delivered by trained professionals, for patients wi th CMI. (Weak F or) Discussion Mindfulness-based therapy There is evidence that participation in a mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) results i n pain reduction, improved symptom severity and enhanced quality of life. Preliminary evidence suggests that MBT is more effective i f delivered in a structured eight-w eek group format as compared to eclectic/unspecified MBT approach. A meta-a nalysis by Lakhan et al. assessed whether an eight-w eek structured mindfulness intervention, either mindfulness-b ased stress reduction (MBSR), o r mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MCBT), was more effective than an eclectic/unspecified MBT approach. T he study analyzed the effects of structured MBT on pain, symptom severity, quality of life, depression, and anxiety for general somatic symptoms as well as for patients meeting criteria for fibromyalgia, c hronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. Six studies included patients with fibromyalgia, three included patients with IBS, one included patients with CFS, and two with included patients with general or nonspecific somatization disorder. In al l studies the participants were predominantly female. The results of the meta-a nalysis showed small to moderate effect sizes for MBT as compared to waitlist/s upport group controls for pain reduction (SMD -0 .23, 95% CI: -0 .40, -0 .07, p<0 .01), and enhanced quality of life (SMD = 0.39,95% CI: 0.19, 0.59; p<0 .001). [76] As with all interventions, MBT can be one component of care in a shared decision -making model and represents a key element of the bio-psychosocial conceptualization of CMI , given the relationships between mental health, physical health, and symptoms. Interpersonal psychotherapy There is good evidence for the benefit of interpersonal psychotherapy in GI populations and there is infrastructure in place for delivery. Further research utilizing group format and male Veteran populations with CMI are still neede d. Zijdenbos et al. conducted a systematic review on the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of IBS. [74 ] The evidence base for the review consisted of three RCTs enrolling 460 patients. The mean age range was 30.9 to 49.2 years and gender of the October 2014 Page 35 of 89 p atients ranged from 59% to 80% female. The efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy after three months of treatment was compared with usual care or waiting list. Long term follow up at 15 months was available in two studies. The primary outcomes measured in the review by Zijdenbos et al. were IBS symptom scores, improvement in abdominal pain, and quality of life. [ 74] The authors of this review pooled data for these outcomes in separate meta -analyses using the SMD to calculate the summary effect size estimates. Reductions in symptom severity (SMD = 0.75; 95% CI 0.35 t o 1.16) and quality of life (SMD = 0.39; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75) at the end of three months of treatment were significantly improved relative to control. At the 15 month follow- up, reductions in symptom severity (SMD = 1.20; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.62) and quality o f life (SMD = 0.58; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.95) remained significantly improved relative to control. Abdominal pain was not significantly affected by interpersonal psychotherapy relative to control after three months of treatment (SMD = 0.35; 95% CI - 0.75 to 0.05 ) or at the 15 month follow-up time point (SMD = 0.66; 95% CI - 0.69 to 2.00). [74] Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing Given the limited number of RCTs that examine eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), further research is needed in this population before a stronger recommendation can be mad e in support of t his modality for patient care. EMDR is used as a treatment for PTSD, but its utility in other disorders is less well explored. It is thought that, as with PTSD, the reprocessing of stored memories may reduce t he severity of somatic symptom s. Additionally, the quality of evidence is somewhat low at this time for EMDR in a CMI population. A systematic review on the efficacy of EMDR was conducted by Van Rood and de Roos, for treatment for the treatment of MUPS, including phantom limb pain (PLP ), chr onic pain, and war -related MUPS. [77] The evidence base for the review consisted of one RCT, two non - controlled clinical trials, and 13 single cases or case series enrolling a total of 102 patients. The average age of the patients was 43 years (range 22 to 73 years), and the percentage of female patients was 64%. The one RCT employed a pre-post crossover design comparing one session of EMDR with one session of hypnosis ; all non -RCTs used an EMDR intervention pretest -posttest design. The number of treatments varied from 1 to 72 sessions with follow -up times ranging from less than one month to over 10 years. The primary outcomes measured in the review by van Rood and de Roos 1 were pain intensity and overall health status. [77] Three studies reporting on chronic pain showed that mean pain intensity scores decreased b y 1.2 -2 points on a 10 -point scale (lower score indicates lower pain intensity) relative to the beginning of treatment. All three studies showed a statistically significant effect, but only one was rated as having a clinically significant effect. Four stud ies showed that mean pain intensity scores decreased by 4.7 \u00b10.69 points on a 10 -point sca le relative to the beginning of treatment. At long -term follow -up (between 3 weeks and 32 months), mean reduction in pain intensity was 4.5 \u00b10.8 points, and 52% of patients (n = 11) were pain -free (pain inte nsity <1). All studies showed a statistically significant effect, and three of four were rated as clinically significant. One single case study examined war -related MUPS, and showed improvement in health status on a n 11 -point scale (a higher score indicates better health status) from a score of 1 pretreatment to a sc ore of 6.5 post treatment and a score of 8 at six months follow up, which was rated as a clinically significant effect. Recommendation October 2014 Page 36 of 89 10.T he guideline panel recommend s considering complementary and integrated medicine interventions as a component of personalized, proactive patient-driven care in the managemen t o f patients with CMI. (Weak For) Discussion A range of complementary and integrated medicine ( CIM) modalities were assessed for global CMI. CIM modalities for global CMI have been studied for CMI unrelated to deployment, and have not specifically been studied in the setting of CMI subsequent to GW deployment or CMI subsequent to other deployments. The C IM interventions evaluated include the following: biofeedback, alternative exercise, carnosine, and St. John's Wort. CIM modalities for pain- predominant CMI have been studied for CMI unrelated to deployment, and have not specifically been studied in t he setting of CMI subsequent to GW deployment or CMI subsequent to other deployments. For pain predominant CMI, the literature on the efficacy of CI M for the treatment of fibromyalgia was reviewed. The treatments considered included acupuncture, alternativ e exercise, chiropractic care, hydrotherapy, massage therapy, nutritional supplements, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS ). CIM modalities for fatigue -predominant CMI have been studied for CMI unrelated to deployment, and have not specifically been studied in the setting of CMI subsequent to GW deployment or CMI subsequent to other deployments. Our searches identified two systematic reviews that met inclusion criteria and assessed the be nefits and harms of CIM treatments for adults with chronic fatigue syndrome. [78] Only those reviews published on , or after 2008 were cons idered to be part of the evidence base for this key question. In cases where more than one systematic review addressed the same treatment, we selected the more recent and/or comprehensive review. These studies provided meta -analyses of a total of five RCTs and 40 non -RCTs enrolling a total of 5,938 patients. The systematic review by Wang et al. examined acupuncture and/or moxibustion therapy in the management of CFS (40 non-RCTS). [79] The systematic review by Kim et al. considered a range of CIM therapies including dietary interventions ( three RCTs), distant healing ( one RCT); homeopathy ( RCT), ( one RCT), and herbal medicine ( two RCTs) in th e management of CFS. [ 78] Although the Kim et al. study reported on single trials of single treatments, Jadad ratings were available for each trial. A number of the studies were described as moderate to high quality and included more than 100 participants. Another review was available for the present key questi on. How ever, the review by Kim et al. provided more comprehensive data. In general, the studies included in the systematic review for acupuncture and/or moxibustion were rated as low qualit y by the authors of the review. No RCTs were included in this syste matic review . The studies included in the systematic review for other CI M treatments ranged from high quality to low quality, depending upon the intervention. The main methodological limitations in study quality cited by authors was risk of bias due to lack of clarity with respect to blinding, limited sample size, inadequate randomization, lack of reported allocation concealment, or intent -to-treat analysis. [ 78] Biofeedback was examined in a single RCT which examined the efficacy of biofeedback for treatment of patients with medically unexplained physical symptom s. [80 ] Patients were randomly assigned to 10 October 2014 Page 37 of 89 w eekly sessions of biofeedback plus a psychiatric consultation intervention (PCI) or to PCI alone. The PCI intervention involved sending a standardized psychiatric consultation letter to the primary car e physicians of all study patients with recommendations for the patient's ongoing medical treatment. The participants in the study were predominantly female (83.3% female in biofeedback group and 75.0% female in PCI group). The primary outcomes in the study on biofeedback plus PCI versus PCI alone were severity of symptoms and physical function. Secondary outcomes included depression and anxiety. Patients randomized to biofeedback plus PCI experienced greater reduction in symptoms (mean difference: -0.77, SE: 0.36, p = 0.04, e ffect size estimate: 0.8), and greater improvement in physical function (mean difference: 21.57, SE 6.02, p<0.001, effect size estimate not reported), as well as greater reduction in symptoms of depression (mean difference -5.70, SE 2.5 6, p = 0.03, effect size estimate 0.81). No significant between group difference was observed on measures of anxiety. [80 ] Recommendation 11.The guideline panel suggests considering a al sy mptoms of CMI . (Weak For) Discussion The Work Group suggested therapeutic trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) mirtazapine based on inferences from the results of studies conducted in patients with DSM -IV diagnoses of somatoform disorders, the symptoms of which overlap considerably with those of CMI. The mechanism of action of these agents in somatoform disorders is thought to be related to their serotonergic effects. Four short- term clinical trials showed promising improvements in symptom scores and relatively good tol erability in study populations consisting mainly of patients with somatoform disorders with or without depression or anxiety. One advantage of some agents in these classes of antidepressants is that they may treat co -occurring depression and anxiety disorders often seen in patients with CMI. [81-85 ] Of the SSRIs and SNRIs, only escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine were studied in our literature search. We are uncertain whether there is a drug class effect, although antidepressants are generally accepted to have little differences in efficacy for major depressive disorder and some differences in tolerability and safety profiles. For CMI, it is reasonable to take the same approach for drug selection that is used for major depressive disorder: base drug selection on symptoms, safety, comorbid conditions, concurrent medication, and response and tolerability to previous antidepress ants. All of the SSRIs have the theoretical potential to worsen cognitive and sleep symptoms of CMI, as they are known to be associated with sedation (which may impair cognition) and /or insomnia. Mirtazapine is associated with a high incidence of somnolence (which may theoretically worsen CMI -related cognitive and fatigue symptoms). It has not been associated with an increased risk of insomnia and has been used to treat insomnia; therefore, it has an advantage over the SSRIs if insomnia is a bothersome symp tom in CMI. October 2014 P age 38 of 89 P roviders should understand the limitations of the suggestion to consider trials of SSRIs, SNRIs and mirtazapine. Few agents have actually been studied. No pharmacologic agents have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials specifically for CMI, although some patients in the clinical trials may have met the definition for CMI used in this guideline. In the studies reviewed for global CMI, none of these antidepressants were evaluated for their effects on fatigue, sleep, and neurocognitive symptoms; their benefits in reducing these symptoms are uncertain. Only venlafaxine was evaluated for (and shown to improve) quality of life. [84] Escitalopram was the only SSRI compared against placebo in a small (N = 51), moderate -quality, double - blind, randomized clinical trial involving patients with multisomatoform disorder, 29.4% of whom had concurrent depression and 52.9% an anxiety disorder. Escitalopram (10 -20 mg/day; N = 25) was statistically and clinically beneficial in reducing somatic symptom scores on the PHQ -15. [85] Escitalopram had a large effect relative to placebo in terms of rate of responders with a number- needed -to-treat of two (95% CI, 2 -4). Results for clinician global impression of improvement and severity, psych ic, som atic, anxiety, depression, pain and disability also significantly favored escitalopram. The results may overestimate the true effect size of escitalopram therapy because of the small study population. Escitalopram was well tolerated in the study wit h one withdraw al due to side effects, no serious adverse events, and no increase in adverse effects relative to placebo. The results need to be confirmed in larger well- designed clinical trials that involve patients with CMI and that evaluate the patient's rather than the clinician's subjective global assessment of treatment benefits. Although not studied in patients with CMI or somatoform disorders, citalopram may be a reasonable substitute for escitalopram at equivalent doses. In the treatment of major depressive disorder, citalopram 20 mg/day and escitalopram 10 mg/day (and their corresponding maximum doses of citalopram 40 mg/day and escitalopram 20 mg/day) produce clinically similar effects. In patients with fibromyalgia, the efficacy of citalopram has been shown to be inconsistent , [86,87 ] and not recommended in one SRMA. [ 88] The effect sizes of fluoxetine and sertraline in reducing somatic symptoms are unknown because neither was compared against placebo; however, the two agents seem to be similar to each other in improving symptoms. Fluoxetine (10 -60 mg/day) and sertraline (25-350 mg/day) a 12 -week, fair-quality, open -label randomized trial in 45 patients with a DSM -IV diagnosis of undifferentiated somatoform disorder without depression, anxiety or other Axis I disorders. [ 83] Both agents reduced somatic symptom scores on the Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -15 from the high severity category (scores greater than 15) to the moderate severity category (scores 10 to 14). There was no statistically significant treatment difference. Large improvements in measures for depression and moderate improvement in measures of general health were seen; however, there were no statistically significant treatment differences. Both treatments were well tolerated, with neither one resulting in withdrawals due to adverse events. The efficacies of these agents in CMI need to be verified in placebo -controlled trials. Of the SNRIs, venlafaxine showed promising results and was well tolerated in a multicenter, double - blind, placebo -controlled pilot trial. [ 84] In the pilot trial, 117 primary care outpatients with DSM -IV October 2014 Page 39 of 89 d iagnoses of multisomatoform disorder (MSD), major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder were randomized to either venlafaxine extended -release (ER) capsules or matching placebo. [84] Those who received venlafaxine ER (75 -225 mg/day; mean 177 mg/day) showed improvement (from baseline to 12 weeks) in somatic symptom severity as measured on the PHQ -15; however, venlafaxine was statistically better than placebo only at week 8 and was no be tter than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 / end point. Venlafaxine ER was numerically but not statistically significantly better than placebo in terms of responder rates (percentages of patients with PHQ- 15 scores less than 10 / moderate severity; 51% vs. 37%; p = 0.08) and produced a faster median time to response than placebo (54 versus 71 days; p = 0.01). Secondary outcome measures showed statistically significant improvements in PHQ -15 subscores for pain, Hamilton Rating Scale for Psychic Anxiety, Clinical Gl obal Impression for Improvement, and the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire total score. There was no difference between treatment groups in terms of withdrawals due to adverse events. Therefore, venlafaxine ER was well tolerated and showed inconsistent and equivocal results; primary efficacy measures failed to show benefit whereas secondary efficacy measures showed some benefits, mainly in terms of pain, anxiety and functional outcomes. In a separate randomized, open -label clinical trial, venlafaxine was shown to be slightly inferior or similar in effect to mirtazapine. [82] This trial involved 95 outpatients diagnosed with DSM -IV undifferentiated somatoform disorder (USD) without depression, anxiety or other DSM Axis I disorders who were randomized to either mirtazapine (titrated, 15 -60 mg/day) of 12 weeks' duration. [82] Venlafaxine was statistically but not clinically inferior to mirtazapine in terms of reduction from baseline to 12 weeks / end point in s omatic symptom severity scores on the PHQ -15 survey (difference of - 2.3 on a 30- point scale; p = 0.046). The reductions in scores were of question able clinical relevance, as the total PHQ -15 scores remained greater than 15 (\"high\" severity category) despite the improvements from baseline scores. No statistically significant treatment differences were seen in the secondary outcome measures for depres sion and general health. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no statistically significant treatment difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Overall, venlafaxine and mirtazapine were similar in treatment effects. Mirtazapine showed promising effects but has not been evaluated against placebo. The Work Group also reviewed a clinical trial which showed that levosupiride (a benzamide dopamine D2-receptor selective antipsychotic with gastrointestinal prokinetic effects) reduced symptoms in Italian patients with somatoform disorder . [81] The agent is not available in the U.S. Antipsychotics are associated with significant extrapyramidal adverse effects, and the trial results may not be applicable to Americans because of cultural differences in somatization. The Work Group made no recommend ation for the use of antipsychotics in CMI. Recommendation 12.The guideline panel suggests against the use of doxycycline for the treatment of patients withclinical symptoms of pain- predominant CMI. (Weak Against) Discussion October 2014 Page 40 of 89 T he results of a VA- and DoD -sponsored, moderate- quality, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial showed that a 12 -month course of doxycycline in 491 Mycoplasma DNA -positive patients with Gulf War Veterans Illness was ineffective in improving physical function and symptoms. [105] The study did not exclude individuals wi th fatigue or chronic fatigue syndrome. The reductions in percentages of patients seropositive for Mycoplasma were similar in both groups. Doxycycline increased the incidences of nausea and photosensitivity; therefore, the harms outweighed the benefits of therapy. The study authors noted that it was possible that doxycycline-treated patients may have received less medical care because the antibiotic could have treated an undetected infection, and suggested that more studies were needed to determine whe ther infectious or noninfectious entities are causally related to Gulf War Veteran s Illness. The results of this study are applicable to a narrow subpopulation of patients. The use of other antibiotics and combination antibiotics may deserve investigation. Recommendation 13.The guideline panel recommends against the long- term use of opioid medications for the management of patients with CMI. (Strong Against) Discussion The use of long- term opioid therapy (lasting three or more months) should be avoided. There is no direct supporting evidence, and any potential benefits are substantially tempered by risks of serious adverse effects and the potential to worsen or confound CMI symptoms. There is also a growing concern about the adverse consequences of opioid misuse, abuse, addiction and diversion on patient, family and public health . The results of a retrospective study in U.S. Veteran s with moderate to severe chronic non- cancer pain also showed that, in the setting of a rehabilitative inter disciplinary pain program , patients who were tapered off of opioid therapy experienced similar or larger improvements in multidimensional clinical outcomes including pain, physical function and sleep compared with nonopioid -treated patients. [89 ] The results suggested that opioid therapy was not necessary for improving clinical outcomes and may have reduced physical function in some patients. There have been no published randomized clinical trials evaluating the short - or long -term efficacy and safety of opioid therapy in patients with CMI. In the related FMS, opioids have also not been studied as isolated drugs in clinical studies. Consensus expert opinion recommends against the use of opioids in FMS [90] as older trials demonstrated inconsistent improvement in pain . [91] In addition to a significant adverse effect profile , the lack of efficacy of opioid analgesics may be due to the inability to target the pathophysiologic processes involved in this central sensitization syndrome. [ 92] Since CMI is a heterogeneous condition, some patients may respond to opioid analgesic therapy; however, multimodal, multidisciplinary behavioral and physical therapies with adjunctive non -opioid analgesic therapies remain the therapeutic approach of choice for chronic pain in CMI. Providers considering opioid therapy for patients with CMI should manage opioid -treated patients in concordance with the VA/DoD CPG on Management of Opioid Therapy in Chronic Pain. As part of the opioid risk -benefit assessments, prov iders should evaluate patients on an ongoing basis for opioid -related adverse effects that may confound or worsen CMI symptoms. For instance, opioid - October 2014 P age 41 of 89 i nduced hyperalgesia may be confused with CMI -related pain; effects on sleep architecture and sleep - disorde red breathing (e.g., central sleep apnea) may contribute to non -restorative sleep; depression may add to CMI symptoms ; [93] sedation may worsen fatigue and interfere with physical rehabilitation; androgen deficiency may confound or worsen fatigue, depression, and weakness ; and constipation may worsen underlying gastrointestinal symptoms. The safety of opioids in patients with CMI has not been evaluated; this emphasizes the need to re -assess patients for potential harms that may be counterproductive to achieving treatment goals and to individualize opioid therapy decisions. Short -term, low- dose (less than 100 mg/day morphine milligram equivalents) opioid therapy may be considered in selected patients with severe pain that prevents them from participating in behavioral and physical therapies and who experience insuf ficient pain reduction from adequate trials of other evidence -based, nonopioid pain medications such as acetaminophen, tricyclic would be a good first opioid to try because of its SNRI effects. The treatment goal of short-term opioid therapy is to reduce pain sufficiently to allow the patient to adhere to his / her personalized treatment plan. S hort courses (less than two weeks in duration) of opioids may be considered adequate trials. Patients who respond may be continued on short -term opioid therapy until progress from behavioral and physical therapies is seen and preferably for no more than three months. At that time, opioids may be gradually tapered using a patient -centered care model and regular risk -benefit assessments. Tapering opioids may be facilitated by addressing the other dimensions of the patient's CMI and concomitantly optimizing both non - pharmacologic therapies and non -addictive medications for pain. Tapering off opioids in patients who perceive benefit from such therapy can be difficult; therefore, cautious and selective use of opioid therapy is important. Obtaining an informed patient -provider agreement about the plan to taper off opioids before starting therapy may be helpful. Therapeutic Interventions for Pain -Predominant CMI Recommendation 14.The guideline panel recommends considering acupuncture as part of the management of p atients with pain -predominant symptoms of CMI. (Weak For) Discussion Although the quality of evidence is low for acupuncture, there is some evidence of benefit for pain reduction. As with all interventions, acupuncture can be a component of a personalized proactive, patient -driven model of care, with shared decision making. Unfortunately, there is little evidence currently available on the use of complementary and integrated medicines for CMI. Furthermore, much of the current research on acupuncture discusses short -term rather than long -term effects. There is a lack of high quality e vidence on the long- term effects of acupuncture, along with some of the potential cost implications that this treatment can carry for both the patient and the health care system overall. The guideline panel emphasizes the need for more research in this are a. October 2014 P age 42 of 89 S tudies Comparing Acupuncture to Sham Acupuncture Langhorst et al. performed a review of the literature and meta -analysis on the benefits an d harms of acupuncture for FMS. The evidence base for this review consisted of seven RCTs enrolling a total of 242 adults. Most patients across the studies were female (median percent female 95%). All studies used traditional Chinese acupuncture points, with two studies utilizing standardized points and five studies utilizing an individua lized paradigm. Two trials performed electro -acupuncture and five trials performed manual acupuncture. The length of the interventions, excluding follow -up, ranged from 2 to 15 weeks with a median of eight weeks. The median duration of acupuncture treatmen t was nine sessions (range 6-25). The control condition across all studies was sham or simulated acupuncture. The standardized mean difference was calculated in order to estimate the summary effect size for the following outcomes: pain, fatigue, sleep dist urbances, and physical function. The findings demonstrated a small, but significant effect of acupuncture compared to sham for reducing pain ( -0.25; 95% CI [ -0.49 to -0.02 ]; p = 0.04) at post -treatment. The positive effect of acupuncture compared to sham was not observed at later follow -up times. No significant differences were observed between acupuncture and sham for fatigue, sleep disturbances, and physical function at post -treatment or at later follow -up times. Three studies reported on side effects suc h as discomfort at side of needle sensation, nausea, soreness and worsening of FMS symptoms. The frequency of the side effects reported ranged from 3% to 70% for all types of acupuncture. [94] Studies Comparing Acupuncture to Conventional Medicine Cao et al. performed a review of the literature and meta- analysis on the benefits and harms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapies for FMS. A total of three RCTs enrolling 73 patients compared acupuncture to conventional medicine. Two studies compared acupuncture to amitriptyline, and one study compared acupuncture to ibuprofen. The mean age range of the patients enrolled in the studies was 31 to 50 years. The gender of the patients enrolled in the studies was not reported. Duration of treatment ranged from four to eight weeks. The mean difference was calculated as an estimated summary effect size for pain, which was measured using the Visual Analog Scale. Data for other outcomes considered in the studies comparing acupuncture to conventional medicine (e.g., quality of life, depression, or anxiety) were not reported in a manner that allowed for a meta- analysis to be performed. The results of the analysis indicated that acupuncture was significantly better than conventional medication in reducing pain (MD, - 1.78; 95% CI -2.24 to - 1.32, p <0.00001). The reported adverse effects of acupuncture were bruising, nausea, fainting, discomfort at the sites of needle insertions or simulated needle insertions, and temporary edema of the hand. Lethargy, nausea, fainting, dry mouth, fatigue, blurred vision, hyperhydrosis, and constipation were reported adverse effects of conventional medications. [95 ] Recommendation s 15.The guideline panel recommend s considering non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAID) for treating certain peripheral pain symptoms associated with CMI, though they do not necessarily lead to global beneficial effect . (Weak For) October 2014 P age 43 of 89 16.T he guideline panel suggests considering tramadol for treating certain peripheral pain symptoms associated with CMI that fail to respond to other non -opioid analgesic medications o r n on-pharmacologic approaches. (Weak For) Discussion Non -opioid analgesics (i.e., non -steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be useful for treating certain pain symptoms associated with CMI (e.g., migr aine and tension headaches, non -cardiac chest pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and a variety of chronic pain conditions), though they do not necessarily lead to a global beneficial effect. Ibuprofen showed no benefit over placebo for pain, sleep disturbance , duration of stiffness, or fatigue . [96,97] Naproxen showed no significant effect on any outcome parameters (e.g., patient and physician global assessments, patient pain, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and tender points) when compared to placebo . [98] The evidence reviewed for a recommendation on non -opioid analgesics arose from the 2001 CPG and was limited to non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAID) for ch ronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. The guideline panel for the 2014 update did not explicitly assess literature from the year 2000 onwards ; however the group chose to carry forward the earlier recom mendation regarding non - opioid analge sics into the updated CPG as the historical evidence was acceptable and sufficient . Since the last set of guidelines in 2001 additional studies have been performed assessing the efficacy of tramadol in the management of FMS. Tramadol is recommended for the treatment of pain due to FMS. [90] A review of the treatment of FMS performed by the European League Against Rheu matism [90] identified two randomized controlled trials. One was a high -quality study of over 300 patients and was of 13 weeks duration. [99] The second was preceded by an open label study and only included responders . [100] Bennett et al . reported positive effects for pain and function, and Russell et al . reported improved pain levels but no change in function. There was no difference between placebo and treated groups for adverse event w ithdrawals . [90] Most common adverse effects were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and constipation. [ 91] Combination tramadol tramadol monotherapy. [ 101] Tramadol should be used with some caution due to the possibility of typical opiate withdrawal symptoms with discontinuation and the risk of abuse and dependence. [90] In addition, evidence suggests that tramadol increases the risk of serotonergic syndrome in patients. Providers should use caution and discuss with their patients some of the adverse events associated with the use of tramadol prior to prescribing this medication. Recommendation s 17.The guideline panel suggests a trial of serotonin -norepinephrine reu ptake inhibitor (SNRI) fo r t he treatment of patients with clinical symptoms of pain -predominant CMI. (Weak For) 18.The guideline panel suggests considering selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or pregabalin (PGB) the treatment of patients with clinical symptoms of pain- predominant CMI. (Weak For) Discussion October 2014 Page 44 of 89 F or pain predominant CMI, the guideline panel relied heavily on studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of FMS. The highest quality evidence supported the use of SNRIs, specifically duloxetine and milnacipran , though the treatment effect was small . Hauser et al. conducted a systematic review, which included 10 randomized placebo -controlled trials enrolling a total of 6,038 patients . [102] The majority of patients were female (median 95%) with a mean age of 49 years. Trials had a median duration of 17.5 weeks. SNRIs demonstrated a small incremental effect over placebo in reducing pain and showed insubstantial improvements in q uality of life and fatigue scores . [102] For a 50% reduction in pain, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) was 11. Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from a trial due to side effects when taking a SNRI with a number needed to treat to harm (NN TH) of 11. Reported reasons to stop the medication frequently included nausea, dry mouth, constipation, headache, somnolence/dizziness and insomnia. There was no statistically significant difference in serious adverse events with very rare reports of live r damage and suicidality. [102] Evidence for the remaining therapeutic regimens was lower quality due to failure to report adequate randomization, lack of reported allocation concealment, no intent to treat analysis, and selective outcome reporting. Other than trials of pregabalin, there were also no trials in other medications with more than 100 patients per group, contributing to increased heterogeneity among trials. A 2009 meta -analysis of six studies found that tricyclic antidepressants significantly, and substantiall y, improved pain, fatigue, and sleep in FMS . [103 ] The clinical benefit of TCAs was less clear in a subsequent network meta -analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1,026 patients that was mostly female with an average age of 42.5 years . [67] In this analysis, TCAs had a stat istically significant, but small, improvement in pain and fatigue in patients with FMS. These benefits were no longer statistically significant when the analysis was limited to studies with more than 50 patients per group, and there was also no difference in sleep or quality of life. Overall, 13 studies compared TCA to placebo, 1 compared TCA to SSRI, and 1 compared TCA to aerobic exercise. The median durat ion of all trials was 12 weeks. Rates of adverse events were not different between TCAs and comparator s. The same network meta -analysis also examined the use of SSRIs in the treatment of FMS, analyzing 10 randomized placebo -controlled trials with a median duration of 12 weeks and enrolling a total of 644 patients . [67] All patient s were female and with a mean age of 45 years. Use of SSRIs produced a small to moderate improvement in pain and quality of life but not fatigue. The benefits no longer remained when trials were limited to studies that had 50 patients or more in each arm. Rates of dropout due to adverse events were not different between SSRIs and placebo. Pregabalin has shown some potential in the treatment of FMS pain. Nuesch et al. conducted a meta - analysis of 4 randomized placebo -controlled trials with a median duration of 12 weeks and enro lling a total of 2,625 patients . [67] The majority of patients were fem ale (med ian 92.5%) and 49 years of age. Overall, use of pregabalin produced a small improvement in pain but not quality of life or fatigue . [67] When limited to studies with more than 100 patients per group, pregabalin showed a sm all benefit in pain, quality of life, fatigue and sleep. Rates of dropout due to adverse events were not different between pregabalin and placebo. A single randomized controlled trial of 150 patients has shown October 2014 Page 45 of 89 p reliminary potential for gabapentin in the treatment of FMS pain . [104] More research is needed to determine the comparative benefit to pregabalin. Therapeutic Interventions for Fatigue -Predominant CMI Recommendation 19.The guideline panel recommend s considering acupuncture as part of the management of patients with fatigue -predominant symptoms of CMI. (Weak For) Discussion Wang et al. conducted a systematic review on the efficacy of acupuncture and/or moxibus tion for the treatment of CFS. The evidence base for th e review consisted of 40 non- RCTs enrolling a total of 2,266 patients. The age and gender of participants was not reported. Out of 40 trials, 13 reported the use of a control condition. Four studies compared acupuncture and/or moxibustion to Western medica l treatment, six studies examined acupuncture and/or moxibustion as an adjunct to other therapies, and three studies compared one form of acupuncture and/or moxibustion to different acupoints or moxibustion materials. Generally, 30 -minute treatment session s were given three times a week for a total of 20 -30 sessions. The primary outcome measured was effective improvement in CFS symptoms. \"Effectiveness\" was defined as a patient reporting more than one third of initial symptoms remitting. No data analyses we re presented in this review. All studies included in the systematic review stated that the acupuncture and/or moxibustion treatments were effective, with treatment efficacy ranging from 78.95% to 100% effective in improving CFS symptoms. [79 ] Recommendation 20.The guideline panel suggest s considering a reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) or tricyclic antidepressants ( TCA) with clinical symptoms of fatigue - predominant CMI . (Weak For) Discussion Meta -analyses of RCTs of patients with FMS lend indirect support for therapeutic trials of TCAs and SNRIs in patients with fatigue -predominant CMI. Given the potential for adverse effects, the small beneficial effect shown in the available trials, and the absence of trials longer than 12 weeks, clinicians should continuously weigh individualized benefits and risks of treatment. Physicians and patients should both have realistic expectations. A small amount of patients may have substantial benefit, while man y will have little to no improvement that likely will not outweigh adverse effects. Patients should not be left on therapy after an adequate trial if there is not any noticeable improvement. SNRI SNRIs have been shown to have a slight reduction in fatigue in patients with fibromyalgia, but no benefit in sleep, according to a 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis by H\u00e4user et al . of nine randomized placebo October 2014 P age 46 of 89 c ontrolled studies with 5656 participants. [ 102] More patients in the SNRI group withdrew due to adverse events, though there was no difference in significant adverse events. On subgroup analysis, there was no difference between duloxetine and milnacipran in their effect on fatigue or in withdrawal due t o adverse events. There are no RCTs evaluating the use of SNRIs in CFS. TCA Two meta -analyses of TCAs in patients with FMS showed a significant, but not substantial, improvement in both fatigue and sleep relative to comparators . [67,103] The availabl e evidence was of lower quality than that of SNRIs. The randomized controlled trials generally had a small numbers of patients, no reporting of adequate randomization or allocation concealment, no intent to treat analysis, and elective outcome reporting. The duration of the trials was a median of 8 weeks. Dropout rates were not different between TCAs and comparator groups, though caution is prudent in patients with positive suicidal ideations due to the lethality of a TCA overdose. There are no RCTs of TCAs in CFS reported to date. Other Antidepressants Available evidence does not support the use of other anti -depressants for the treatment of fatigue predominant CMI. Meta -analyses have failed to show any significant benefit from SSRIs or m onoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) on fatigue in While one small RCT of a MAOI in CFS showed some mild improvement , [106] the remainder of RCTs of SSRIs and MAOIs in CFS has not found any sustained benefit . [106- 109] There was no benefit on fatigue in a randomized controlled crossover trial of mirtazapine in 72 patients with CFS . [110] Additionally, long -term benefits of all antidepressants are uncertain, and dietary restrictions and the risk of hypertensive crisis limit the clinical utility of MAOIs. Other Pharmacologic Therapies There is no evidence supporting the use of other agents for the treatment of symptoms of fatigue - predominant CMI. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), an over -the-counter drug that facilitates generation of adenosine t riphosphate, did not show any benefit compared to nutritional supplements and psychological therapy at 24 months in a small RCT of 31 CFS patients . [111] In a randomized, placebo -controlled trial (n=20) of CFS patients, no significant improvement was found with growth hormone . [112] In a double -blind RCT of chronic post infectious fatigue patients (n=326), no improvement was found with sulbutiamine , a synthetic thiamine derivative, compared to placebo. [ 113] No benefit has been demonstrated with the use of other psych otropic agents for treatment of CFS or treatment of fatigue in FMS. Meta -analyses have failed to show any significant benefit for pregabalin o n fatigue or sleep in FMS . [67] inhibitor galantimine in 434 patients with CFS found no benefit in the primary or secondary outcomes . [114] A randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind trial (n=67) in CFS patients found no improvement with ondansetron, which had been hypothesized to show benefit due to its effect s on the serotonin system . [115] An un -blinded study of 40 non -depressed patients compared amisulpride, a non -FDA approved atypical antipsychotic to fluoxetine for twelve weeks, with the amisulpride group showing significant improvement in self report and observer- based measures of fatigue and somatic complaints . [ 116] There have been no trials of FDA- approved anti -psychotics in CFS patients, and given the varying October 2014 Page 47 of 89 d egree of action and side -effect profile of the antipsychotics , it is impossible to extrapolate the results to other medications in the class. Since the last set of guidelin es in 2001 there have been no new trials assessing the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of FMS. Based on consensus expert opinion, glucocorticoids still do not appear beneficial in treating patient s with FMS. [90] Recommendation 21.The guideline panel suggests against the use of pharmacologic agents for sleep disturbances in CMI. (Weak Against) Discussion There is no evidence for the use of any particular sleep agents in ch ronic multisymptom i llness. Behavioral approaches to sleep disturbance are likely to be more successful than pharmacologic approaches, as the latter do not induce normal sleep. Studies in FMS have found no significant benefit of therapy. Two RCTs of benzodiazepine sedative -hypnotics for the treatment of FM showed no benefit over placebo . [97,117] A RCT of zoplicone, a non -benzodiazepine sedative -hypnotic, also showed no benefit over placebo in the treatment of FM . [118] There were no studies meeting inclusion criteria studying sleep agents in patients with CFS. Recommendation 22.The guideline panel suggests against the use of stimulants for the treatment of fatigue - predominant CMI. (Weak Against) Discussion Small studies have found some benefits with the use of 4 -6 weeks trial of stimulants in the treatment of CFS. Randomized placebo -controlled studies of 20, 26, and 60 patients showed improvement in fatigue using dexamphetamine (5 -15 mg twice daily), lisdexa mfetamine (30 - 70 mg daily), and methylphenidate (20 mg daily), respectively . [119- 121] Reduced food consumption was a prominent si de effect with dexamphatamine. Anxiety and insomnia caused two patients to withdraw from lisdexamfetamine treatment. Dry mouth was the only adverse effect noted from methylphenidate in the small, short- term trial. The benefits and risks associated with lon g-term stimulant treatment are not known, and the risks of misuse, abuse and withdrawal have to be considered. Without evidence for prolonged use of stimulants, it is currently unclear how short trials of stimulant medication fit into the long -term treatment of individuals with CMI. The guideline panel, therefore, currently suggests against their use, though acknowledging that the low-quality, small trials available do show some benefit over the short term. Recommendation October 2014 Page 48 of 89 23.T he guideline panel recommends agai nst the empiric use of antivirals or antibiotics for fatigue - predominant symptoms of CMI. (Strong Against) Discussion Since CFS can begin abruptly following a viral- like illness, anti- viral therapy has been evaluated for possible benefit in CFS patients. C ontrolled trials of amantadine and acyclovir showed no benefit with poor tolerability with amantadine, and 12% of acyclovir- treated patient developing reversible renal failure . [122,123] In a randomized clinical trial of 30 patients with CFS and IgG antibody titers against HHV- 6 and EBV, valganciclovir did not show statistically significant improvement in the Multi- Dimensional Fatigue inventory at 6 months . [124] Patients taking valganciclovir were more like ly to be labeled as a responder by their blinded physician, though. A pharmacy -funded study of valacyclovir in 32 patients with CFS and E pstein -Barr Virus infection claimed benefit from treatment but had nonstandard reporting, and a statistical difference between groups cannot be verified from the manuscript . [125] Recommendation 24.The guideline panel recommends against the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of fatigue - predominant CMI. (Strong Against) Discussion Therapeutic studies of corticosteroids were initiated based on the observation that some patients with CFS or FM manifested a slight decrease in urinary cortisol levels. Mineralocorticoids, in particular, could be beneficial in patients with fatigue since a subset of CFS patients may have neutrally mediated hypotension, with 22 of 23 patients with CFS having a positive tilt -table test in one study . [126] However, RCTs in patients with CFS have found no significant, sustained benefit in reducing the symptoms of CFS with low dose hydrocortisone (5 to 10mg/day), replacement dose mg/day) . [127-130] Adrenal suppression was also demonstrated in the 12 week trial of replacement dose hydrocortisone. [ 129] Glucocorticoids also still do not appear beneficial in treating patient s with FMS based on consensus expert opinio n. [90] Adverse effects are also a concern. Adrenal suppression was demonstrated in the 12 week trial of replacement dose hydrocortisone in patients with CFS . [129 ] Given the l ack of proven benefit, and the risk for adrenal suppression, we currently recommend against the use of corticosteroids for empiric treatment of CMI symptoms. Recommendation 25.The guideline panel recommends against the use of immunotherapy for the treatment o f the symptoms of fatigue predominant CMI. (Strong Against) October 2014 P age 49 of 89 Discussion Various immunologic abnormalities have been described in patients with CFS, such as depressed natural killer cells, an increase in activated circulating lymphocytes, and an increase in immune complexes. None are specific for CFS or abnormal in all CFS patients. It is unknown if any of these immunologic abnormalities may be linked to fatigue -predominant CMI. Immunologic treatments investigated in patients with CFS are still considered ex perimental. They cannot be recommended for patients with CMI due to the indirect and low quality nature of the available research and a lack of consistent and reproducible evidence that benefits o utweigh the harms of treatment. Some preliminary benefit has been seen with rintatolimod, a Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 3 agonist with immunomodulatory and antiviral properties. In an RCT of 92 CFS patients [131 ] and a subsequent Phase III multi center RCT of 234 CFS patients, rintatolimod given intravenously twice weekly for up to 40 weeks showed improvements in capacity to perform activities of daily living and exercise tolerance. However, the FDA did not approve rintatolimod for use in chronic fatigue syndrome in their 2013 review due to concerns over the drug's effectiveness and safety, specifically citing deficiencies in the manufacturer's new drug application in the areas of \"clinical, statistical, clinical pharmacology, nonclinical, product quality, and facilities inspection\" (FDA press release - see bibliography) . Staphylococcus toxoid injections were examined in a preliminary RCT of 28 patients and a follow -up RCT of 100 consecutive female patients who met criteria for both FMS and CFS . [132,133] The follow -up study showed improvements compared to placebo in the primary outcomes of proportion of responders based on global ratings and proportion of patients with a >= 50% symptom reduction . [133] Relapse occurred after the treatment was stopped at six months. Dropouts were equal in the treatment and control groups; local injection site reactions occurred in both groups. The findings need to be confirmed before treatment can be recommended for the general CMI population. RCTs of Immunoglobulin therapy in patients with CFS have reported mixed results, with two of the four RCTs showing no benefit over placebo . [134-137] Adverse effects included phlebitis ( ~50% ) and constitutional symptoms ( ~80% ), such as headaches, fatigue, and diminished concentration. Other immunologic therapies have shown no benefit. Dialyzable leukocyte extract (DLE), also known as transfer factor, showed no beneficial effects in a double -blind placebo controlled trial of 90 patients with CFS . [138] Alpha interferon showed no beneficial effects over placeb o in a study of 30 CFS patients. [139] Rituximab showed no benefit over placebo in a study of 30 CFS patients in the primary outcome of self- reported fatigue, though the study cited that there were more patients with lasting imp rovement in the treatment group. [ 140] Therapeutic Interventions for Gastrointestinal -Predominant CMI Recommendation 26.The guideline panel suggests treating patients with CMI and predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms, in accordance with recognized evidence -based care for IBS. (Weak For) October 2014 P age 50 of 89 Discussion Clinical practices for irritable bowel syndrome are well established and are applicable to patients experiencing predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms of CMI. The Work Group suggests that patients with these symptoms be treated according to the evidence- based practices that are currently available through the VA and DoD healthcare systems and other specialty clinical groups. Recommendation 27.The guideline panel recommend s considering minimal contact psychological therapies for treatment of GI predominant CMI . (Weak For) Discussion There is reasonable evidence to consider minimal in -person contact cognitive behavioral therapy care for an at -need CMI po pulation. Minimal- contact psychological treatments [10 -12] place a significant emphasis on self -management of symptoms. Contact with health care professionals varies but is generally limited to a small number of face -to-face sessions (or possibly, none at all), supplemented or replaced by computer -assisted therapy, telephone and/or online support. Pajak et al. conducted a systematic review on the efficacy of minimal contact psychological treatment for the treatment of IBS. [141] This review contained several types of minimal contact psychological treatment, with one or two studies each, but minimal contact CBT was examined in nine trials. Minimal contact was defined as fewer than four face -to-face sessions with a therapist. Th e evidence base for the review consisted of nine RCTs and one non -RCT enrolling a total of 734 patients (minimal contact CBT n = 367; controls n = 367). The average age of the patients was 40 years, and the percentage of female patients ranged from 71% to 91%. Five studies compared minimal contact intervention to waitlist, three studies compared minimal contact to treatment as usual, and one study compared two different minimal contact interventions. Some studies used a standard CBT treatment arm as an acti ve control, but data from traditional CBT were not used in data analysis and are not presented here. Treatment duration varied from 5 to 10 weeks. Follow -up information was available in a subset of studies for three to six months post -intervention. The pri mary outcomes measured in the review by Pajak et al. were severity of IBS symptom scores and quality of life. [ 141] The authors of this review pooled data for these outcomes in separate meta -analyses using t he standardized mean difference to calculate the summary effect size estimates. The SMD for reduction in symptom severity at the end of treatment was SMD = 0.83 (95% CI not reported; effect size: Large), indicating that minimal contact cognitive behavioral therapy is superior relative to comparator. Long term follow up at three to six months after the intervention indicated that minimal contact CBT is moderately superior to comparator (SMD = 0.56; 95% CI not reported; effect size: Medium). Quality of life ratings were moderate ly higher at the end of CBT intervention relative to comparator (SMD = 0.63; 95% CI not reported; effect size: Medium), but this observation became weaker three to six months after the intervention (SMD = 0.20; 95% CI not reported; effect size: Small). [ 141] Recommendation October 2014 Page 51 of 89 28.Th e guideline panel suggest against the use of acupuncture for treatment of patients with gastrointestinal-predominant symptoms of CMI. (Weak Against) Discussion Manheimer et al. conducted a systematic review on the efficacy of acupun cture for the treatment of IBS. [142] The evidence base for the review consisted of 17 randomized controlled trials enrolling a total of 1,806 patients. Age and gender of participants were not reported. Five studies compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture, five studies compared acupuncture to pharmacotherapy, two studies compared acupuncture to probiotics, four studies examined the efficacy of acupuncture as an add -on therapy to traditional Chinese medicine, one study examined the efficacy of acupuncture as an add -on therapy to psychotherapy or in comparison with psychotherapy, and two studies compared the efficacy of acupuncture to usual care/no specific treatment. On average, participants received four treatments per week (range from <1 t ime per week to seven days per week). Overall, the duration of all trials was 3 to 21 weeks (median four weeks). The primary outcomes considered in the review by Manheimer et al. were symptom severity and quality of life. In the review, four moderate quality studies compared the efficacy of acupuncture relative to sham treatment on symptom severity, three of which assessed quality of life. I n these trials, acupuncture did not significantly improve symptom severity (SMD = - 0.11; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.13) or quality of life (SMD = -0.03; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.22) relative to sham treatment. In five low-quality studies, the effectiveness of acupuncture was compared with pharmacotherapy for symptom severity. Acupuncture statistically significantly improved symptom severity relative to pharmacotherapy (RR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.45). It should be noted that all five of these trials were conducted in Chinese populations, and generalizability to Western populations may be limited. [142] October 2014 Page 52 of 89 Appendix A: Guideline Development Process The methodology used in the devel opment of the clinical practice guideline for chronic multisymptom illness (Version 2.0 - 2014) follows the Guideline for Guidelines, an internal working document of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence -based Pr actice Working Group (EBPWG). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, conduct of a systematic literature review and ultimately, submission of a new CPG. The Champions and Work Group members for this CPG were charged with developing evidence -based clinical practice recommendations and publishing a guid eline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare system. Champions were responsible for identifying the key evidence questions of greatest clinical relevance, importance, and interest for rehabilitation of a patient with an upper extremi ty amputation. In addition, Champions assisted in: Conducting the evidence review, including providing direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria Assessing the level and quality of the evidence Identifying appropriate disciplines to be included as part of the Work Group Directing and coordinating the Work Group Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the DoD, identified four clinical leaders as Champions for the 2014 CMI CPG. The Lewin Group (Lewin) and their sub -contractors ECRI Institute and Duty First Consulting, held the first conference call for this Guideline in July 2013, with participation from the contracting officer's representatives (COR), leade rs from the VA and DoD evidence -based guideline development program, and the Champions. During this call, the project team discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the appro ach for developing evidence questions for a systematic review on CMI. During this call, the team also established a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to CMI, from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties areas included dietetics, family practice, internal medicine, nursing, orthopedics, primary care, pharmacy and rheumatology. Methodology The guideline development process for the VA/DoD CMI CPG consisted of the following steps: Identifying evidence questions Conducting a systematic review of the literature Convening a three and a half day face to face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group Submitting a final CMI CPG on to the VA/DoD Evidence -Based Practice Working Group The following is a detailed description of each of these steps. October 2014 P age 53 of 89 Formulating Evidence Questions The Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) Champions were tasked with identifying key evidence questions to guide the systematic review of the literature on Chronic M ultisymptom Illness (CMI) . These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin Group's evidence review team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations. The k ey questions follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHR Q). Table A -1 provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology. Table A-1: PICOTS Patients, Population or Problem A description of the patients of interest. It includes the condition(s), populations or sub -populations, disease severity or stage, co -morbidities, and other patient characteristics or demograph ics. P I Intervention or Exposure Refers to the specific treatments or approaches used with the patient or population. It includes doses, frequency, methods of administering treatments, etc. Describes the interventions or care that is being compared with the intervention(s) of interest described above. It includes alternatives such as placebo, drugs, surgery, lifestyle changes, standard of care, etc. C Comparison Describes the specific results of interest. Outcomes can include short, intermediate, and long -term outcomes, or specific results such as quality of life, complications, mortality, morbidity, etc. O Outcome (T) Timing, if applicable Describes the duration of time that is of interest for the particular patient intervention and outcome, benefit, or harm to occur (or not occur). (S) Setting, of applicable Describes the setting or context of interest. Setting can be a location (such as primary, specialty, or inpatient care) . The Champions and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of intere st. Table A -2 contains the final set of key questions used to guide the systematic review for this CPG. Population(s) The key questions were specific to adults 18 years or older with CMI. Within the review, CMI is defined as patients with a medically unexplained syndrome such as fibromyalgia syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, functional gastrointestinal disorder, or with a military specific medically unexplained syndrome, such as Gulf War syndrome or post -deployment syndrome. The definition of CMI also include d patients without a formal diagnosis but who exhibit symptoms from two or more of the following six categories for a minimum of 6 months duration: fatigue, mood and cognition, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurologic. October 2014 P age 54 of 89 P atients with symptoms lasting less than 6 months, or those who experience d only one of the listed symptoms, or patients with a clearly organic -based disease that explained all/most of their symptoms were not covered in this report. Interventions The diagnostic technologies considered under Key Question 1 of the review f ell within the following categories: biomarkers (this include d studi es of biological markers and neuroimaging studies), neuropsychological test batteries, and sleep studies. Treatments covered in Key Questions 2 through 4 of th e review include d the following: pharmacological treatments, such as antibiotics, antidepressants , and pain medications; non -pharmacological treatments, such as psychological therapies, exercise, and hypnosis; and complementary and alternative medicine treatments, such as acupuncture, biofeedback, and nutritional supplements. Management approaches co nsidered in Key Questions 5 through 9 include d: team based approaches, core competencies of the treatment team, patient-provider communication styles, the role of occupational and other rehabilitative services, and patient follow up practices. Risk factors that may be associated with predisposing, precipitat ing, and perpetuating () CMI include d medical (obesity), psychosocial (abuse history), and occupational/environmental (chemical exposure) with CMI were considered for Key Question s 10 through 12. Outcomes For the treatment and management questions, the outcomes of interest in the systematic review were a reduction in the intensity or frequency of symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue), improved function, improved quality of life, health care use, and harm s. For the diagnostic question, the outcomes of interest were identification of organic disease patterns or a change in treatment/management strategy. For the risk factor studies, the outcome of interest was the degree of association with CMI. Conducting Systematic Literature Review The methods of the systematic review are described below. In part, these methods follow ed the guidelines for conducting a systematic review set forth by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in the \"Methods Guide for Effectiveness and -for-guides -reviews -and- reports/?productid=318&pageaction=displayproduct . Additionally, t he methods followed the guidance set forth by the VA/DoD in the Guideline for Guidelines document. For all key questions, the following external and internal databases were searched : MED LINE , EMBASE, (via the OVID SP platform using the one -search and de -duplication features), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Health Technology Assessment Database. Searches were designed t o identify unique reviews, trials, and technology assessments. Searches of the World Wide Web were also performed to capture relevant grey literature that had not been indexed to the databases listed previously. The searches covered the time period of October 2014 P age 55 of 89 Janu ary 2000 through October 2013. The search strategy was based on a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terminology and text key words, and can be found in Table A -3. The literature searches identified 6,624 citations potentially addressing the key questions of interest . Of those, 4,295 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion publication date, or not a full-length article). Overall, 2,329 abst racts were reviewed with 1,426 of those being excluded for the following reasons: not a systematic review or clinical study, did not address a key question of interest to this review, did not enroll population of interest, or published prior to January 2000. A total of 903 full-length articles were reviewed. Of those, 419 were excluded at a first pass review for the following: not addressing a key question of interest, not enrolling the population of interest, not meeting inclusion criteria for clinical study or systematic review, not enrolling sufficient patients for key question 1 or 10 -12, or being a duplicate. A total of 484 full- length articles were thought to address one or more key questions and were further reviewed. Of these, 381 were ultimately exc luded. Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A- 1 below. Overall, 103 studies addressed one or more of the Key Questions and were considered as evidence in the systematic review.

These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2001 CPG. Lewin prese nted findings from the evidence review of the key questions in order to facilitate and inform the process. Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review, and asked to retain, revise, or reject each recommendation from the 2001 CPG. In addition, members developed new clinical practice recommendations, not presented in the 2001 CPG, based on the 2013 evidence review. At this meeting, Work Group members were assigned to one of fo ur smaller subgroups depending on their area of clinical expertise. Grading Recommendations This CPG uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a grade for the strength for each recommendation . The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation: [143] Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Confidence in the quality of the evidence Values and preferences Other impl ications, as appropriate, e.g. ,: oResource Use oEquity oAcceptability oFeasibility oSubgroup considerations The following sections further describe each domain. Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes refers to the size of anticipated benefits (e.g., increased longevity, reduction in morbid event, resolution of symptoms, improved quality of life (QoL ), decreased October 2014 P age 72 of 89 re source use) and harms (e.g., decreased longevity, immediate serious complications, adverse event, impaired quality of life , increased resource use, inconvenience/hassle) relative to each other. This domain is based on the understanding that the majority of clinicians will offer patients therapeutic or preventive measures as long as the advantages of the intervention exceed the risks and adverse effects. The certainty or uncertainty of the clinician about the risk -benefit balance will greatly influence the strength of the recommendation. Some of the discussion questions that fall under this domain include: Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects? Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the evidence base and the certain ty in that evidence. This second domain reflects the methodological quality of the studies for each outcome variable. In general, the strength of reco mmendation follows the level of evidence, but not always , as other domains may increase or decrease the strength. The evidence review used for the development of recommendations for CMI, conducted by ECRI, assessed the confidence in the quality of the evidence base and assigned a rate of \"High\", \"Moderate\", \"Low\" or \"Very Low\". The elements that go into the confidence in the quality of the evidence include: Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? Values and preferences is an overarching term that includes patients' perspectives, be liefs, expectations, and goals for health and life. More precisely, it refers to the processes that individuals use in considering the potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience of the therapeutic or preventive measures in relation to one another. For some, the term \"values\" has the closest connotation to these processes. For others, the connotation of \"preferences\" best captures the notion of choice. In general, values and prefe rences increase the strength of the recommendation when t here is high concordance and decrease it when there is great variability . In a situation in which the balance of benefits and risks are uncertain, eliciting the values and preferences of patients and empowering them and their surrogates to make decisions consistent with their goals of care becomes even more important. A recommendation can be described as having \"similar values\", \"some variation\", or \"large variation\" in typical values and preferences between patients and the larger populations of interest. Some of the discussion questions that fall under the purview of values and preferences include: Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? October 2014 P age 73 of 89 A re the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Other implications consider the practicality of the recommendation, including resources use, equity, acceptability, feasibility and subgroup considerations. Resource use is related to the uncertainty around the cost- effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive measure. For example statin use in the frail elderly and others with multiple comorbidities may not be effective and depending on the societal benchmark for willingness to pay, may not be a good use of resources. Equity, acceptability, feasibility and subgroup consider ations require similar judgments around the practically of the recommendation. The framework below was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain . Table A -4: Evidence to Recommendation Framework Decision Domain Judgment Balance of desirabl e and undesirable outcomes Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects? Benefits outweigh harms/burden Benefits slightly outweigh harms/burden Benefits and harms/burden are balanced Harms/burden slightly outweigh benefits Harms/burden outweigh benefits Confidence in the quality of the evidence Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? High Moderate Low Very low Values and preferences Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Similar values Some variation Large variation Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations): Are the resources worth the expected net benefit from the recommendation? What are the costs per resource unit? Is this intervention generally available? Is th is intervention and its effects worth withdrawing or not allocating resources from other interventions Is there lots of variability in resource requirements across settings? Various considerations The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention o utweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which combines the four domains . [143] October 2014 Page 74 of 89 T he GRADE of a recommendation is based on the following elements: Four decision domains u sed to determine the strength and direction (described above) Relative strength (Strong or Weak) Direction (For or Against) The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, \"Strong\" or \"Weak.\" A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation. Similarly, a recommendation for a th erapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences. Using the se elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong For (or \"We recommend offering this option ...\") Weak For (or \"We suggest offering this option ...\") Weak Against (or \"We suggest not offering this option ...\") Strong Agai nst (or \"We recommend against offering this option ...\") Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed \"Conditional,\" \"Discretionary,\" or \"Qualified\". Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the reso urces available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary . Drafting a nd Submitting the Final CPG Following the face -to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments for the update of specific sections of the 200 1 CPG that would form the narrative text for the 201 4 CPG. During this time, the Champions also revised the 200 1 algorithms and identified the content for the guideline summary and pocket card, as part of the provider toolkits that will be developed by the Evidence -Based Practice Working Group ( EBPWG ) following the publication of t he 2014 CPG. The CMI CPG Champions and Work Group developed several drafts of the Guideline, submitting the final document to the VA/DoD Evidence-Based Practice Working Group in October 2014.
