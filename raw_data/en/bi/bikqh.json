Our cover story with Marilyn Moore is a tribute to a lifetime of giving to children and adults as an educator. She is beginning a second career after taking the summer to clean out some closets and drawers, she said during her recent interview on Live & Learn, Aging Partners program on 5 CITY-TV. When Marilyn received recognition in the Lincoln YWCA's Tribute to Women, she told a story I'll never forget. A teacher returned a paper she had written with many grammar corrections. The teacher wrote across the top, \"You will need to know these things when you work toward your doctorate degree.\" Marilyn said it was the first time she'd given thought to pursuing a doctorate and a catalyst for a wonderful career. We live up to the expectations of others. You can expect this to be an issue you read cover to cover.Planning Ahead Living Well 4Knowledge Is Power: Avoiding Senior Scams The old adage of respecting elders falls on the deaf ears of scam artists, who swindle more than $2 billion of hard-earned savings from older adults each year. A recent study of elder financial abuse, conducted by the Metlife Mature Market Institute, reported that the annual financial loss by elder victims is estimated to be at least $2.9 billion, a 12 percent increase from the $2.6 billion estimated in 2008. An astonishing 51 percent of cases were instances of fraud perpetrated by strangers. \"The largest audience of scam artists is the senior population,\" said Jim Hegarty, president/CEO Nebraska Better Business Bureau. \"They're often home, have disposable income and, depending on the individual, may be slightly compromised and not in the position to make the greatest decisions.\" The Metlife study noted that women were nearly twice as likely to be victims of elder financial abuse as men. Most victims were between the ages of 80 and 89, lived alone and required some level of help with either health care or home maintenance. Contrarily, nearly 60 percent of the perpetrators of elder financial abuse were males, most of which were between the ages of 30 and 59. In almost all instances, the goals of financial abuse perpetrators were achieved through deceit, threats and emotional manipulation of the elder. \"As our population continues to age, I predict the number of scams will continue to increase,\" Hegarty said. \"More people will become targets. As long as the schemes work, they're going to continue to propagate.\"Awareness is Key According to Hegarty, there are three basic types of scams in Nebraska that older adults should be aware of:1. Foreign lottery and sweepstakes scams Older adults receive mail notifying them that they have won an enormous prize. The mail often features legitimate logos from Reader's Digest and BBB that the scammer has stolen to lend legitimacy to the scam. These scams often originate in Jamaica, Costa Rica and Vancouver, where scammers send tens of thousands of mailings to ZIP codes in Nebraska in a \"fishing expedition.\" The piece of mail usually contains specific and sophisticated instructions on how to claim the prize and includes instructions to call an agent. The older adults are given a check to deposit in their bank account and then asked to wire a smaller amount to cover taxes and processing fees for the prize to be delivered to their home by courier. The end result is always the same: the prize never arrives, the check deposited by the older adult bounces and the money they wired was their own. \"Oftentimes, seniors who get on the hook of scammers continue to be engaged,\" Hegarty said. \"The scammer will call and say there was a problem with the courier and request more money for taxes. It can go on and on.\" Hegarty, who worked with one 87-year-old couple who spent $135,000 throughout a three-year period to collect an $800,000 prize, said scam artists look for people who have money, are vulnerable and want to believe they have won. \"No legitimate lottery or sweepstakes ever requires you to spend money to collect your prize,\" he said. \"That's the number one red flag.\"2. The grandparent scam This type of scam is prevalent in the Midwest. Hegarty said not a week goes by that the BBB doesn't receive a call from an older adult who witnesses this scam. The scam begins when the phone rings. When an older adult answers, they hear someone on the other end of the line asking for grandma or grandpa. \"The hope is that the grandparent will then say the grandchild's name,\" Hegarty said. \"Now, the scammer knows the name of the adult grandchild.\" The scammer will then tell a story about how the grandchild is on a trip out of the country and ran into trouble - either getting in an accident or breaking a law - and needs help. The person on the phone will then tell the grandparent a law enforcement official or attorney is next to them and hand the phone off to another individual, who will begin to convince the grandparent that their grandchild is in trouble in a foreign country and needs money to pay medical or legal bills before being released to the United States. \"Often, the phony grandchild will beg the grandparent not to Jim Hegarty, president/CEO Nebraska Better Business BureauSpring 2012 5Lwtell their parents, and many are eager to help them,\" Hegarty said. \"The grandparent will then wire thousands of dollars via wire transfer to rescue grandchildren, who are probably right in their hometown.\" In almost every case, he said it is impossible to recover these losses. The scam artists use prepaid cellphones, couriers have stolen I.D.s and money from wire transfers can be picked up at a variety of locations. \"This type of scam is escalating and becoming more sophisticated,\" Hegarty said.3. Fraudulent work from home opportunities The scam primarily focuses on offers to become a secret shopper. These types of offers typically come via email or are found on websites. Like the lottery and sweepstakes scams, these offers boast legitimate looking logos from well-known businesses and BBB to create the illusion of authenticity. Older adults apply to be a secret shopper for major retailers and receive notification that they have been accepted for the role. Their first assignment, delivered within a few days by courier, includes a check that appears legitimate. Shoppers are asked to deposit the check into their account, withdraw a smaller amount and evaluate the customer service of a wire transfer service by using their services. \"Ultimately, the consumer learns the check they deposited has bounced and the money they wired was their own,\" Hegarty said. \"Not only do they not have a work from home job, they often are out a significant amount of money.\" If in Lincoln, forward suspicious mail to: Better Business Bureau 3633 O St. No. 1 Lincoln, NE 68510 Residents elsewhere in the state can send materials to: Nebraska Better Business Bureau Headquarters 11811 P Street Omaha, NE 68137Advice Scams will continue to evolve. One of the best ways for older adults to protect themselves is to be armed with information. Don't trust strangers asking for personal information, including callers claiming to work for credit card companies. Hegarty recommends hanging up the phone and independently calling the organization back to verify authenticity, as caller I.D. is not always reliable. Never trust an email that appears to be from a legitimate source, such as a financial institution. To determine its legitimacy, hover the mouse over the email address; the actual name of the sender should appear. \"The most important item to remember is that if an offer sounds too good to be true, it's because it is,\" Hegarty said. \"It's appropriate to be extremely suspicious.\" Report Instances of Fraud It's the job of the BBB to issue alerts and warnings, and heighten awareness regarding the existence of schemes and scams. However, BBB can't do it without the assistance of older adults who face these scams each and every day. \"We consider them to be our partners in curtailing these schemes,\" Hegarty said. \"While we are on the front line trying to protect them, they're in the bull's-eye of receiving a lot of these solicitations.\" If you believe you may be the victim of a scam, contact BBB's toll-free senior line at 877-637-3334. The BBB has first responders available to assist older adults on the verge of falling prey to a scheme. If the call center is inundated with calls, leave a message and a responder will return the call. If you receive suspicious materials in the mail, forward them to the BBB to make it aware of the new and evolving scams targeting older adults. \"We are encouraged by the number of seniors who are on top of their game and forwarding all of the suspicious materials they receive on a daily basis,\" Hegarty said.Planning Ahead Living Well 6 www.loptonline.com aerobic, strength & balance programs for active aging population spinal care, balance/ vestibular/joint therapy for active agingHelping people improve the quality of their lives.

In 2012, the new income guidelines are $38,300 or less for a married couple and $32,500 for an individual. The income thresholds for disabled veterans and disabled individuals are higher: $41,300 for a married couple and $35,800 for an individual. Even though your income may be higher than what the guidelines indicate, you may be eligible to receive some property tax relief. Homestead Exemption is based on an adjusted income amount that allows older adults to deduct expenses such as medical transportation; medical insurance, including Medicare Part B premiums; and long-term care insurance premiums. In addition, Doan said it may be reassuring for older adults to know that even though they are receiving property tax relief, the county will be reimbursed by the state of Nebraska for those funds. \"If you take advantage of the Homestead Tax Exemption, county budgets won't suffer,\" he said. New forms were mailed the beginning of February. If you have filed for Homestead Tax Exemption before but not yet received a form from your county assessor, contact them or Aging Partners. Aging Partners provides assistance for individuals who have questions or need help filling out Homestead Exemption forms. Assistance typically begins in March, and the last day to file Homestead Exemption forms is July 2.

Enter palliative care, a \"comfort care\" program established at more than 1,000 hospitals nationwide, including more than a dozen in Nebraska. The Nebraska Medical Center launched its palliative care program in 2009 with a mission of providing intensive symptom management and improving the quality of life for patients and understanding of care options for them and their families. According to the Nebraska Hospice and Palliative Care Association, this care also helps identify and address social, psychological and spiritual issues that can impact both an individual's physical condition and the effectiveness of medical interventions. In a press release from UNMC, Todd Sauer, MD, medical director of the palliative care service at The Nebraska Medical Center, said palliative care is different than hospice. \"Hospice is restricted to people who have a prognosis of less than six months to live,\" he said. \"Palliative care does not have that restriction because it does more than just help people at the end of their life.\" Dr. Sauer partners with nurse practitioners to help patients' families understand their medical situation and available options. \"We are advocates for a patient and family,\" he said. \"We're not there to make decisions for them, but help show them what choices and options they have ahead of them. We discuss their goals, needs and wishes so that we can help them and their medical team make the right choices for their care.\" The importance of palliative care was made evident as the new department exceeded expectations in its inaugural year. Expecting to receive about 100 calls, the palliative care service was called 240 times. \"Our service helps support the nurses providing the intense hour-to-hour care to our patients,\" Sauer said. \"We work closely with the staff to provide holistic care for our patients' - body, mind and spirit.\" Spring 2012 7Caregiver Corner Take a Different Approach with Palliative Care Lw This publication was supported in part by Grant No. 1-470491233-D8 under a subgrant from the Administration on Aging and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.We're not there to make decisions for them, but help show them what choices and options they have ahead of them.

Fortunately, a variety of care plans, including hospice, exist to ease the transition. What Is Hospice? According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, hospice is considered the model for quality, compassionate care for people facing a life-limiting illness. Hospice provides expert medical care, pain management and emotional and spiritual support tailored to the patient's needs and wishes; it also provides support for the family's loved ones. Hospice aims to care, not cure. Care is typically provided in the patient's home, but can be provided in hospice centers, hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. The Hospice Association of America notes that though the concept of hospice care dates to ancient times, the first hospice in the United States, The Connecticut Hospice, began providing services in March 1974. \"The term can be traced to medieval Europe to describe a place travelers could find rest and shelter,\" said Sarah Baltensperger, community liaison for Pathways to Compassion Hospice. \"We try to help people think of hospice as a way to add life to their days by having that quality of life and rest at the end.\" A Growing Service A study shared by the NHPCO reports that of all Medicare decedents in 2001, 18.8 percent accessed hospice for three or more days; by 2007, that number had grown to 30.1 percent. The median total number of days a patient received care was 19.7 days in 2010. In 2010, the NHPCO estimates that 1.58 million patients received services from hospice. Of more than 2.45 million deaths in the United States that year, approximately 41.9 percent of them were under the care of a hospice program. \"The most important thing to remember is that it's never too early to start thinking about hospice,\" Baltensperger said. \"Often, we hear people wish they would have introduced it sooner.\" The Face of Hospice The NHPCO reports that, in 2010, 56.1 percent of hospice patients were female and 82.6 percent were 65 years of age or older. Cancer diagnoses accounted for 35.6 percent of hospice patients, followed by heart disease, 14.3 percent; debility unspecified, 13 percent; dementia, 13 percent; and lung disease, 8.3 percent.It's really important for families to do research and find out how they and their loved one can benefit from the service.\" - Sarah Baltensperger \"Typically, someone who is eligible for hospice has a prognosis of six months or less,\" Baltensperger said. \"Once a person is identified as being eligible for hospice, it doesn't take long to determine if they qualify.\" Choosing a Hospice Hospice programs are located in all 50 states, and the number of programs continues to grow. In 2010, the NHPCO estimated there were more than 5,000 hospice programs nationwide. To find the right care program for a loved one, Baltensperger recommends families do as much research as possible. According to the NHPCO, there are four general levels of hospice care, routine home care, continuous home care, general inpatient care and inpatient respite care. \"We encourage family members to interview many hospices to see who they are most comfortable with,\" Baltensperger said. \"It's really important for families to do research and find out how they and their loved one can benefit from the service.\" Caregiver Corner Living At Home Living Well 10LwT Affordable buy-in & monthly fee Includes utilities & basic cable Controlled entry Off-street parking Located in historic downtown Nearby bus stop Spacious lobby with large-screen TV, library and piano Exercise room Craft room Locked storage space for each unit Guest room and party room with kitchen PIONEER HOUSE Lincoln's Premier Housing Cooperative 1130 H Street, Lincoln, NE 68508 | 402-475-1454 http://pioneerhouse.org For persons 55+ interested in the benefits of home ownership without the responsibilities of home maintenance we offer: hanks to modern technology and prescription drugs, Americans are living longer and healthier lives. But when a large percentage of our aging population is polymedicated, it's important to understand what drugs are being taken and why. To prevent injuries due to medication side effects, adverse effects or medication errors, Rita Antonson, MSN, APRN, at the University of Nebraska Medical Center's College of Nursing, recommends older adults take more responsibility when it comes to monitoring their medications. \"To protect their health, patients need to know what medical conditions they are being treated for,\" she said. \"They also should know the importance of taking the medications, and the possible side effects and adverse effects their medications can have.\" The Facts According to the National Council on Patient Information and Education, older adults comprise 13 percent of the population but account for 34 percent of all prescription medicine use and 30 percent of all over-the-counter drug use. A recent survey of 17,000 Medicare beneficiaries found that two out of five patients reported taking five or more prescription medicines. Additionally, almost 40 percent of seniors are unable to read prescription labels, and 67 percent are unable to understand information given to them. When medications are not taken correctly, Antonson said it can slow both treatment and recovery. In some instances, medication mistakes can even harm or kill patients. \"Many older adults have more than one prescribing health care provider, which can lead to miscommunication and trouble,\" she said. And if trouble does arise, the NCPIE said older adults face an increased risk of serious adverse drug events, including falls, depression, confusion, hallucinations and malnutrition, all important causes of illness, hospitalization and death. Make a Plan of Action To keep prescription drugs organized and prevent potential problems, Antonson offers these tips: Know the name, dosage, purpose, possible side effects and specific directions for each medication you take. Keep a current list of all your prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines, along with a list of any allergies. Show it to your doctors at every visit. Take your medicine at the prescribed times. If you take more than one, set up a system so you remember to take them at the correct times. Only take medications prescribed for you. Do not share your medicines with others, as they may cause serious harm. Check the label to be sure you have the correct medicine. Never take medicine in the dark. Follow the directions on the label carefully. Pay attention to the pharmacist's instructions on food and alcohol. Store all medicines out of the reach of children. Stick with one pharmacy. Pharmacists are trained to look for problems with drug interactions or other problems and can help you get problems straightened out.Medication Safety: Know What You're Taking Being Well Living Well Spring 2012 11 Lweep wellness in the forefront of your life by tuning in to 10 Health, Lincoln's premier channel for the latest health and wellness related topics.

To keep feet in prime condition, Aging Partners offers foot clinics throughout its service area. For a suggested contribution of $10, registered nurses provide basic foot and nail care, as well as education about caring for feet between visits. \"We offer a very non-threatening, wellness-oriented and comfort driven environment,\" said Mary Corder, an RN/BA who coordinates the foot clinic in Wilber. \"According to the holistic wellness theory, if your feet don't feel good, you don't feel good.\" Maintaining healthy feet should be a priority for everyone, especially older adults. Healthy and pain free feet keep older adults active and balanced, preventing falls. In addition, regularly monitoring feet can provide early warning signs of diabetes, arthritis, poor blood circulation and nerve damage. As people age, Corder said they can have trouble both reaching their feet and having enough upper extremity strength to cut their nails. \"They can cut their nails to their detriment when they're not able to do it properly,\" she said. \"We don't want people to compromise their health by getting an infection from a wayward cut.\" Richard Schmidt, a 72-year-old Crete resident, has been visiting the clinic in Wilber since April 2008. He began making an appointment every other month when it became too difficult to perform the task himself. \"It got to be harder and harder, so I appreciate the service they offer,\" he said. \"I enjoy the company, and Mary does a good job.\" RN/BA Mary Corder spruces up the feet of Richard Schmidt at the foot clinic in Wilber. RN/BSN Mary Tines, working with Thayer resident Dorothy Farley, typically sees 12 to 15 clients each time she visits York.

The name strawberry comes from the Old English streawberige, likely because the plant sends out runners that could be likened to pieces of straw. Because wild berries were plentiful, strawberries were not cultivated until the early 1800s. Today, berries are primarily cultivated in large commercial farms in California, Florida and Oregon. The growing season and production are dependent on the weather in these locations, so availabilityand price can change due to large amounts of rain or late freezes. Though fresh strawberries have a delicious naturally sweet taste, there are only about 50 calories in one cup. Highly nutritious, eight medium size fresh berries can contain about 150 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C and 20 percent of folate. They also are high in potassium and a good source of dietary fiber. When shopping, choose strawberries with a bright red color and fresh green caps. As strawberries do not continue to ripen after they've been picked, do not buy berries that are partly white and unripe. The sweetness or taste of a strawberry is not determined by its size, but by its variety, weather and growing conditions, and the degree of ripeness when picked. Fully ripe berries, large or small, will be equally sweet and flavorful. Until you are ready to eat or use them in a recipe, do not wash fresh strawberries or remove their caps. Store strawberries in a covered container in the refrigerator and use as soon after buying as possible. To wash strawberries, place them in a large strainer or colander and rinse with cool water. Remove their caps with the point of a paring knife, or gently twist and pull them off. Eat within a day or two of purchase, as mold is always a threat and there is no nutrition in food you have to throw out. A local 'you pick' operation may be the best source for berries that have more keeping time or if you want to freeze some. Recipes are abundant for desserts, including the favorite and easy standby of angel food cake with fresh berries. Also, try adding fresh berries to salad greens or even baby spinach. It's \"berry\" good.

First, there was jaw-dropping research for all of us to consider when we think we are in total control of our food consumption. Through many experiments, Brian Wansink, Ph.D. from Cornell University, found that \"knowledge doesn't necessarily lead to behavior.\" After 90 minutes of nutrition education, college graduate students were treated to two types of food experiences at a Super Bowl party at a favored local sports bar. One room had three large 4-liter bowls (just over a gallon, or 16 cups) of snacks, while the other had six smaller bowls that each held only 2 liters. The only difference between the two rooms was the bowl sizes; both rooms had the same amount of food, same type of snacks and same number of students. The results were surprising: students in the room with the larger bowls ate 53 percent MORE food. The second study involved stale popcorn at the movies and pre-weighed servings - either large or extra-large - and fresh or five-day-old popcorn. At the end of the movie, containers were collected and the remainder weighed. The results - people ate 45 percent more fresh popcorn from the extra-large containers than the large. Even when the popcorn was stale, movie-goers ate 34 percent more from the extra large containers. The conclusion? There is more to eating than know-how and taste. There are too many opportunities in our environment for mindless eating and our obesity epidemic may, in part, be a result. What to do? Are there any solutions as easy to do as mindless eating? The answer is yes; try some of these easy to implement ideas: Use a 10 1/4 inch plate instead of the 12 inch dinner plate (eating a full plate gives us a sense of satiety). Use smaller bowls and narrow glasses (again, we want a full bowl or glass). Rearrange cupboards so eye-level foods are the healthiest. Consider not eating in the kitchen, as the presence of foods can encourage more eating. Avoid multitasking and eating. If you don't attend to your eating, you are apt to overeat. There you have it - Plate and Quiet for minding what you eat. For more information, visit MindlessEating.org or Eatingmindfully.com. Mind Your P's and Q's I Lw Staying Involved Living Well 16 arilyn Moore has learned a lot of lessons throughout her lengthy career with Lincoln Public Schools, but one of her most poignant moments had to do with a discussion about rocks. While visiting with students in a teacher advisor group, she learned that a seventh-grader named Mike - typically a good student - had received a poor grade in his science course. \"When I asked him about it, he told me he was really excited to learn about rocks and minerals but wished that at least once during the class he could have actually held a rock,\" Moore said. \"It was such a powerful lesson about how when children are learning about something, they need to be able to grab a hold of it and not just read about it.\" Getting Her Start Moore, who will retire as associate superintendent for instruction on June 30, received from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln a Bachelor of Science degree in social sciences in 1971; a master's degree in education in 1974; and a doctorate in education in 1980. \"I've always wanted to be a teacher,\" she said. \"Growing up, I liked learning and I liked school. Math and music were my favorite subjects.\" The southwest Nebraska native's first job in education was as a sixth- and seventh- grade social studies and English teacher at Goodrich Middle School. She spent three and a half years in the classroom before spending seven years with Teacher Corps, a federal program designed to train teachers to work in high poverty schools in the United States. She served two years as team leader and five years as assistant director. Her career path then led her to the LPS Human Resources Department, where she spent five years hiring elementary teachers and serving as the district's Title 9 officer. She also worked with area colleges and universities to place practicum students and student teachers in schools throughout the community. In 1987, Moore took on her current responsibilities of supervising the eight directors in LPS's instruction division; developing and implementing the district's instruction budget; and overseeing all board policies related to instruction. \"It's my job to keep students and their learning at the center of every conversation we have,\" she said. \"It's important to keep all of our attention focused on this mission.\" A Changing Classroom When Moore took on her current role 25 years ago, the LPS student population consisted of only about 7 percent minorities; today, that percentage has grown to about 30 percent. \"The community of Lincoln is much more diverse today, and that's a powerful and really good change,\" she said. \"Different experiences and perspectives make every conversation richer.\" The district's financial demographic also has changed dramatically. In 1987, fewer than 25 percent of students qualified for free or reduced lunch; today, that number has grown to 43 percent. Improving technology, too, has altered how teachers teach and students learn. Moore remembers when the first computer arrived at Goodrich Middle School, and teachers wondered how they could possibly incorporate it into their lessons. \"Now, we can't have enough computers,\" she said. \"Information has become so accessible that it has changed the role of the teacher. It's now their job to help students find that information, learn to evaluate if it's from a reliable source and know what to do with it.\"A Lifetime of Learning M The most important work that takes place in our community happens in our classrooms; it's an amazing thing to watch students realize they can do something they weren't able to do before.

For her, there is nothing more amazing than witnessing a kindergartner learn the sounds a letter makes, seeing a student produce an incredible piece of research or watching middle school students develop complex and abstract thinking skills. \"The most important work that takes place in our community happens in our classrooms,\" said Moore, who retires after this school year. \"It's an amazing thing to watch students realize they can do something they weren't able to do before. There's nothing more reinforcing, and it happens every day.\" The Future Retirement will be anything but slow for Moore. She is an active member of the community and has served as a board member for the Child Guidance Center; BryanLGH Health Systems; TeamMates; Junior Achievement; and the Lied Center. She recently completed two terms on the Lincoln Symphony Orchestra Board and is an active member of Saint Paul United Methodist Church. On Sept. 1, she will become president of the BryanLGH College of Health Sciences. \"I'm looking forward to working in the area of higher education,\" she said. \"The role I'm taking on will allow me to share what I've learned about leadership, teaching and learning.\" Moore also looks forward to spending time with Dave, her husband of 40 years, and her niece LwMarilyn Moore accompanies the Lincoln Youth Symphony on a trip to Hungary last spring, where the group made a stop at composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's home in Budapest. and nephew; traveling; reading; and attending baseball games. \"Every year when I meet with the retired administrators from LPS, I tell them they look younger and younger,\" she said. \"It's because they're keeping their minds and bodies healthy and staying engaged. I plan to do the same.\"Staying Involved Living Well 18 fter sculpting the minds of Lincoln's youth for more than three decades, retired Huntington Elementary School Administrator Beverly Ashley is channeling her energy into a different form of art. Right Place, Right Time About one year ago, Ashley was walking the halls of Legacy Estates when she bumped into a friend who had just returned from an art class. After showing Ashley her masterpiece - a rubbing of leaves - the friend encouraged her to attend the monthly art class led by Jean Martin. \"I appeared the following class and have faithfully attended ever since,\" Ashley said. \"What's fun about this project is it becomes something you can't let go of; it's a passion.\" Since that fateful meeting, she has been busy. In the last year and a half, she has created 40 framed pieces. Her artwork is divided into several themes, including politics, family and friends, and ranges from melted wax creations to photo collages. \"I would never have thought I'd be doing this in retirement,\" said Ashley, who retired in 1994. \"I encourage others to go into the unknown and wear a different hat.\" Aside from keeping her mind active and creative juices flowing, she has noticed other physical benefits from devoting herself to her artwork. \"Anyone that is my age will have some aches and pains,\" Ashley said. \"When I'm working, I become totally immersed and so focused on what I am doing that those feelings leave me. You can lose yourself entirely in the process.\" Endless Possibilities Ashley's artwork is as limitless as her imagination. She enjoys the Beverly Ashley, seated, with her mentor, Jean Martin, at her Feb. 23 art show at Legacy Estates.

A Family CaregiverSpring 2012 23fter devoting his career to his country, it's only natural Ed Binder is spending his golden years in service to his community. During a career that spanned from 1943 to 1983, the 88-year-old served in World War II and the National Guard before retiring as a major general. He also served as state commander of the American Legion and state director of the Selective Service System. \"My time in the service taught me to help people and be a leader,\" he said. \"It taught me to be a doer and keep a positive attitude.\" Binder applies these life lessons to his work at the County/City Building, a place he's volunteered more than 20 years. He has assisted with Homestead Exemptions and worked in the county assessor's office, but for the last 10 years his smiling face has been parked behind the information desk every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning. Binder's typical morning involves providing information and directions, validating parking and completing the occasional word search. The part he gleans the most joy from, though, is the social interaction. \"It keeps me thinking young,\" he said. \"I'm no youngster, but hopefully I feel younger than I am. You can feel yourself slowing down, but you want to stop that if you can.\" After 50 years of marriage, Binder's wife, Roma, died 15 years ago. Volunteering provides the perfect opportunity for him to get out of the house, interact with others and keep his mind active and sharp. He encourages older adults to follow in his footsteps, but cautions them against trying to do too much at once. \"Volunteering can be very self-satisfying,\" he said. \"But if you get too involved in too many things, you won't do any of them well. Find one or two things you like to do and focus on it. You want to be selective, so you can perform a service.\" When not fulfilling his civic duty, Binder enjoys working on the computer, reading military stories, attending events and spending time with his family. He has two children, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Living History The United Services Organizations performed musical tributes - often featuring major motion picture stars and entertainers - for troops overseas during World War II to thank soldiers for their extraordinary service to our country. \"Some of the greatest music in American history was created during this turbulent time,\"said Leta Powell Drake, OLLI show coordinator. Audience members will enjoy songs from their youth and, Drake hopes, be inspired to sing along with the cast. OLLI/LCP Radio Active Players The OLLI/LCP Radio Active Players was created in 2011 by Morrie Enders, Lincoln Community Playhouse executive director; Dr. Dee Aguilar, OLLI coordinator; and Leta Powell Drake, OLLI arts chair, to offer older adults the opportunity to perform on stage in a radio show. An added incentive to encourage seniors to step on stage is they don't need to memorize lines; scripts are read, just as they were in the old time radio shows. Costumes of the period will be worn by the cast. The Radio Active Players presented their first show last May. A \"Jack Benny Show\" was selected because the script was written about Benny receiving an Admiralship in the Nebraska Navy. In addition, Don Wilson, the show's great announcer, was born in Lincoln. Local commercials for Gold's Green Stamp Redemption Center and Miller and Paine's famous cinnamon rolls were inserted into the show. Nostalgia for the Jack Benny show required additional rows of chairs to be set up to accommodate the overflow audience in the Studio Theatre at the Playhouse. Based on the show's success, Orson Welles' \"War of the Worlds\" was presented in November. Lincoln music legend Dorothy Applebee accompanied singers on the piano and a full house again applauded the Main Stage production. Audience members donated a Lincoln Food Bank item as the price of admission.

In my house, someone was always singing. My mother sang while she cooked and did the laundry. My sisters and I sang to help pass the time as we walked to school each morning. We sang at church, we sang in school choirs - and we especially loved singing along to our favorite songs on the radio. Singing is pleasurable, producing a calming effect on the mind and body, and there's an increasing body of research to indicate that singing is especially beneficial for older adults. But how many of us are actively singing? It's a question I frequently ask the people I meet. Often the responses I receive are something like \"I sang when I was young\" or \"My voice isn't very strong anymore.\" While it's true that our voice changes as we grow older, we can sing throughout our entire lives. Frequent singing can start to reverse the effects of vocal aging, allowing the voice gradually to regain strength and vitality. For older adults, the key element is access to songs that are musically and intellectually challenging, but not physically demanding. While all singing is beneficial, research indicates that participating in choral music is especially helpful for the older adult. Aside from the social benefits of singing with others, choral singing leads to increased respiratory function, improved health, heightened immune system and improved brain function. Best of all, researchers have found that people who sing on a regular basis require fewer doctors' visits and are less likely to be depressed. Now that's good news! Residents of Lincoln and surrounding communities have many choices for choral singing. Most churches have opportunities for their members to participate in choral singing. Some of the other chorus opportunities include the Lincoln Continentals and the Lincolnaires, men's and women's barbershop groups. The Lincoln Senior Chorus is a mixed chorus that meets throughout the year and performs at various venues in Lincoln.

Nebraska Christian Men's Chorus members have been raising their voices in song since 1993. The roughly 20 members range in age from mid-50s to late 80s, and these men produce a joyful and rich sound that comes from the soul as much as from the diaphragm. What is it about singing that feels so good? One of the members of the Nebraska Christian Men's Chorus (NCMC) is Carlos Arroyo, 74, a retired general contractor who now spends much of his time as a photographer. He admits that he's lost some of the technical ability and musical range that he enjoyed as a younger man, but he feels that older adults more than make up for these losses with an increased understanding of the meaning of the music. Nile Buch, 71, is a retired ELCA minister who joined NCMC last year. He calls the chorus \"a powerful gift\" that continues to energize him long after the rehearsals have ended. Mark Roemer, an active farmer in his mid-50s, sings with NCMC as a means of relaxation, enjoyment and fellowship. John Ellis, 86, met his wife 10 years ago when they were members of the Lincoln Senior Chorus. A retired music teacher, Ellis has sung with NCMC for 12 years and consistently delights audiences with his obvious love for music. Larry Cripe, 76, is the NCMC's accompanist and a frequent vocal soloist who has been involved with the chorus for 15 years. Although he is now retired from his calling as a minister/minister of music, he feels his ministry continues when he performs for residents of retirement centers. Vern Hartman, 70, sometimes bemoans the fact that he can't sing as well as he did when he was younger, but he loves the social aspect of singing with the men in the NCMC. He recalls one particular rehearsal when the Chorus sang \"O Holy Night.\" \"It was surreal,\" Hartman said. \"The music came from our souls. Once you've had an emotional experience like that, you want another, and then another.\" As these and other members of the NCMC will attest, singing takes our minds off the stresses of the day. When we sing, our bodies release pain-relieving endorphins. Our lungs expand, our circulation is improved and our immune systems are stimulated. Singing is an easy way to improve our physiological and psychological well-being. So whether you sing with your church choir, with one of the local choruses, with your friends and neighbors, or with your grandkids, do yourself a favor and SING! It's good for the health, and also good for the soul!

Since December, Exeter-Milligan's first-grade class has been spending one hour each month at the center. The idea was broached by the class' teacher, Sharon Lott, who asked if Program Director Brenda Motis would be willing to help students hone their reading skills. \"The idea seemed too great to pass up,\" Motis said. The eight students who read to older adults in December marked the beginning of a mutually beneficial partnership. The children returned in January to practice math and counting currency before reversing the tables and teaching their older companions about iPads. \"The students get to practice their skills and learn from the seniors of the community,\" Lott said. \"They also get to put to work what they have learned from the six pillars of character: responsibility, respect, caring, citizenship, fairness and trustworthiness.\" The students returned to the center in February for a Valentine's Party - featuring treats made by the students - and again in March, when older adults shared quilts they owned or made to correlate with the students' lesson on quilting and patterns. Motis, who believes the students are gaining much more than just a monthly field trip, looks forward to a lasting relationship with the school and thanks Lott, her students and the school's administration for their support. \"This partnership is wonderful and a win-win situation for the students and the senior center participants,\" Motis said. \"When you look around and see smiles on all the faces, you realize something special is happening.\" Students normally visit on the second Wednesday of each month. Motis encourages older adults in Exeter and its surrounding communities to stop by the center and join in the fun. For more information, call the Exeter Senior Center at 402-266-2133.Participants at the Exeter Senior Center include, back row, from left, Mary Ann Votipka, Doris Hall, Elva McBride, Evelyn Michl and Jane Kaiser; second row, from left, Darleene Becker, Erma Adamson, Elaine Krejci, Roma Rhodes and Marion Geiger; and front row, from left, Olivea Swanson, Gabe Jindra, White, celebrates a Bingo win with Roma Rhodes.

Caring for Your Parents as They Cared for You. www.windcrestonvandorn.comSpring 2012 31ince 2003, Lincoln Electric System customers and matching community donors have contributed more than $1 million to fund Lincoln Parks and Recreation projects and programs through Lincoln Cares, the City of Lincoln's voluntary donation program that offers LES customers the opportunity to contribute by adding $1 each month to their bill payments. Lincoln Cares is expanding its giving opportunities to include both Aging Partners and Lincoln City Libraries. A donated dollar on a monthly bill will be distributed to the three city departments for projects that need support beyond the funding provided by your tax dollars. The addition of two new departments to this successful program offers community members the chance to expand their generosity. June Pederson, Aging Partners director, said the Agency will use donated funds to support programs - such as the Snow Removal Program - that provide services that assist low-income older adults to remain in their homes. \"Aging Partners works with older adults who are on fixed incomes and struggle to find the extra dollars to pay for snow removal or lawn care, but could continue to live at home with a modest amount of help. Joining the successful Lincoln Cares program will add to our ability to keep elders in their homes as they grow older,\" Pederson said. \"We have a number of older adults who can live in their own homes with a small amount of help,\" she said. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of people living in Lincoln age 60 and older grew from 30,126 to 39,894, an increase of 75.5 percent. The largest number of older adults served by Aging Partners is the 80 to 85 age group, which grew by 46.4 percent in the last 10 years. Without assistance from Aging Partners, older adults teetering on the brink of independence would need to move to facilities largely paid for by state and federal Medicaid dollars. Donations from Lincoln Cares can help these longtime members of the community safely remain in their own homes. \"Reduced city budgets mean we're trying to do a lot more with fewer dollars to serve an increasingly larger number of people,\" Pederson said. \"Aging Partners and the older adults it serves will greatly benefit from the assistance provided by this successful program.\" More information regarding the addition of Aging Partners and Lincoln City Libraries to Lincoln Cares will be inserted in April LES customer bills.

Former Nebraska Governor Kay Orr and Live & Learn host Leta Powell Drake review their notes before interview taping begins. ay Orr made history 26 years ago when she won the Nebraska gubernatorial race to become the first Republican woman to be elected governor in the U.S. It was a grueling fight in the polls between Orr and her Democratic counterpart, Helen Boosalis, mayor of Lincoln from 1975-1983. Orr pulled away from her competitor, winning by a 53 to 47 percent margin. \"That whole campaign really did put Nebraska on the map,\" she said, reflecting on the moment that changed her life forever. Campaign Highlight It was an exciting campaign overall, but perhaps her most memorable moment was when she was challenged to ride the symbol of her party when a circus came to Lincoln. Hearing her opponent agree to do the same motivated Orr to mount the elephant and ride it from the railroad station to Pershing Center downtown. \"When I got up there, I thought, 'Oh my!'\" she said. \"When I got into campaigns, no one told me exactly what we'd get into!\" Political foundation She attended the University of Iowa before beginning her political career in 1964 as a volunteer Republican party worker. She worked alongside politicians such as Richard Nixon, Roman Hruska, Carl Curtis and more. Orr was named an Outstanding Young Republican Woman in Nebraska. All of this pales in comparison to her term as 36th Governor of Nebraska from January 1987 to December 1990. Reversed Roles Her governorship kept her busy, requiring her husband, Bill, to absorb the traditional homemaker role. The couple received significant national attention for this. People magazine, for example, ran a photo Dec. 12, 1988, of her at the podium with Bill standing behind her, holding her purse. The attention escalated during fundraising efforts for the Governor's Mansion when Bill released a compilation of recipes by well-known Nebraskans called \"The First Gentleman's Cookbook.\" He was later featured on \"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee\" and made his favorite recipe from the book \u2014 meatloaf. \"They found soon enough that he adapted well to center stage,\" Orr said. Her Legacy She took over for former Governor Bob Kerrey at the end of the recession, which required her administration to \"pinch\" for the first year. The revitalization of the entire economy allowed Orr to make positive changes in Nebraska. \"My administration turned things around by creating more jobs,\" she said. Despite her successes, she was defeated by Democrat Ben Nelson in her campaign for re-election in 1990 by a small margin. A New Journey Although she enjoyed her time in the political spotlight, she loves her current role. \"This is the best time of life for me, being a grandmother,\" she said. Orr has six grandsons and one granddaughter, ranging in ages from 13 to 23. She is thrilled to live within two blocks of five of her grandsons. Although family keeps her busy, she also makes time to be a trustee at a traditional classical liberal arts college in Hillsdale, Mich. Spring 2012 33s the mercury inches upward and lawns turn green, residents throughout Lincoln begin to eye their dusty blinds and curtains and those elusive dust bunnies under the couch. Fortunately for older adults, the time-honored tradition of spring cleaning coincides perfectly with the addition of heavy housework to the Home Handyman Program's long list of services. Introducing Heavy Housework Services In a recent in-house survey, older adults reported needing help for such tasks as cleaning behind and under heavy furniture; scrubbing showers and tubs; and using stepladders to take down, launder and re-hang curtains and blinds. In response, the Home Handyman Program expanded its offerings to include Heavy Housework Services. Along with assisting with the above duties, home handymen will be available to clean hard-surfaced floors, wash windows, clean ceiling fans and turn mattresses. \"Staying in touch with seniors' needs is essential in providing relevant services,\" said Carol Meyerhoff, Home Handyman program coordinator. \"This addition to our service remains consistent with our mission and is intended to assist older adults in completing tasks that have become difficult or unsafe to do.\" As each year passes, Emma George, 91, notices that chores she previously performed around her home are becoming harder and harder to do. \"I don't have a sense of balance like I used to,\" she said. \"Sometimes I get a little woozy when I get up.\" It's also difficult for George to climb back to her feet after kneeling, making it nearly impossible to clean her bathtub or floors. \"I'm not strong enough to push myself back up, and I tire very easy,\" she said. \"These new services will make my life a little easier. I'm going to use the Home Handyman Program when I need it.\" Meyerhoff said George is a great example of an older adult who uses the resources available to her to remain independent in her own home. \"She tries to do everything on her own, but when she gets to the point where she needs help she's smart enough to protect her health and safety,\" she said. Celebrating 40 Years In April the Home Handyman Program will celebrate four decades of providing quality and dependable minor home repair and maintenance services for older adults in Lincoln and Lancaster County. \"Our mission throughout the years has focused on supporting a senior's decision to remain living safely in their home of choice,\" Meyerhoff said. \"Our excellent staff and terrific handymen make the service what it is today. Older adults trust the dependability of the handymen and have confidence they will be treated fairly.\" In addition to the new Heavy Housework Services, take advantage of the wide array of existing services: Outdoor Work Season: Schedule your yard cleanup, mowing, gutter cleaning, garden prep, spring window washing, setting up your patio furniture or other outdoor repair or maintenance tasks. Safe Homes for Seniors: A \"free\" home hazardous waste assessment and removal program is offered through a partnership with the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department and the Aging Partners Home Handyman Program. Specially trained handymen conduct a home assessment to identify, sort and possibly remove potentially harmful products in and around your home you no longer need or use. Assessments are scheduled in conjunction with the Community Household Waste Collections April through November or by appointment. Contact the Home Handyman Program at 402-441-7030 to schedule a service. The Home Handyman Program is looking for honest and reliable men and women to fill the work need for its new Heavy Housework Services or in its Outdoor Service area, which includes mowing and general work. We accept quality and invested workers who are genuinely interested in supporting older adults. Interested?
