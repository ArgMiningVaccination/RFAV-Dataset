Complementary medicine is used together with conven- tional medicine, and alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. Integrative medicine combines conven- tional and CAM treatments for which there is evidence of safety and effectiveness. While scientific evidence exists regarding some CAM therapies, for most there are key questions that are yet to be answered through well-designed scientific studies\u2014questions such as whether these therapies are safe and whether they work for the purposes for which they are used. NCCAM' s mission is to explore CAM practices using rigorous scientific methods and build an evidence base for the safety and effective- ness of these practices. How Many People Use CAM In the United States, approximately 38 percent of adults (about 4 in 10) and approximately 12 percent of children (about 1 in 9) are using some form of CAM, shown in figure 1. 1 Unless noted otherwise, the statistics are for CAM use during the 12 months prior to the 2007 survey. Comparisons from the 2002 NHIS are indicated.Figure 1 CAM Use by U.S. Adults and Children Adults (2007)Adults (2002)Children (2007)In December 2008, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the National Center for Health Statistics (part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) released new findings on Americans' use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The findings are from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an annual in-person survey of Americans regarding their health- and illness-related experiences. The CAM section gathered information on 23,393 adults aged 18 years or older and 9,417 children aged 17 years and under. A similar CAM section was included in the 2002 NHIS, providing the opportunity to examine trends in CAM use, too. 1 36.0%38.3% 11.8% National Institutes of HealthNatioNal CeNter for ComplemeNtary Ayurveda* Biofeedback* Chiropractic or treatmentHypnosis*Massage*MeditationMovement therapiesNatural products (nonvitamin and non- mineral, such as herbs and other products from plants, enzymes, etc.) Naturopathy*Progressive relaxationQi gongTai chiTraditional healers*YogaFigure 3 CAM Alaska Included in the 2007 NHIS: An asterisk (*) indicates a practitioner-based therapy.

However, CAM use among adults is greater among women and those with higher levels of education and higher incomes. Figure 2 shows the percentage of people using CAM by age. Figure 3 shows CAM use by race/ethnicity. CAM Therapies Used the Most Nonvitamin, nonmineral natural products are the most commonly used CAM therapy among adults. Use has increased for several therapies, including deep breathing exercises, meditation, massage therapy, and yoga. Figure 4 shows the percentage of people using the most common CAM therapies and therapies with significant increases between 2002 and 2007. Use of Natural Products The most popular natural products are fish oil/omega 3, glucosamine, echinacea, and flaxseed. Figure 5 ranks the top 10 natural products used among adults in 2007 and 2002 (note that the 2007 survey asked about use in the last 30 days, whereas the 2002 survey asked about use in the last year). Health Conditions Prompting CAM Use People use CAM for an array of diseases and conditions. American adults are most likely to use CAM for musculoskeletal problems such as back, neck, or joint pain. The use of CAM therapies for head or chest colds showed a substantial decrease from 2002 to 2007. Figure 6 ranks the top 10 conditions prompting CAM use among adults for 2007 and 2002.Figure 2 CAM Use by Age Most Common Natural Products Among Adults Back Pain Back Pain Neck Pain Neck Pain Joint Pain Joint PainArthritis Arthritis InsomniaAnxiety Anxiety/DepressionStomach Upset Recurring PainInsommiaCholesterolHead or Chest ColdHead or Chest ColdOther Musculoskeletal Severe Headache or Migraine 510 10 10 1020 20 15 1520 2040 for Which CAM Is Most Frequently Used Among Adults The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 2007* 2007 2002* 2002*Percentages among adults who used natural products in the last 30 days. *Percentages among adults who used natural products in the last 12 months.Ginger Supplements5101520Figure 4 10 Most Common CAM Therapies Among Adults - 2007 Natural HomeopathicTreatmentTherapies with significant increases between 2002 and 2007 are 2002 2007 Deep breathing 11.6% 12.7% Meditation 7.6% 9.4% Massage 5.0% 8.3% Yoga 5.1% 6.1%Figure 7 10 Most Common Therapies Among Children Figure 8 Most Common Natural Products Among Children* Figure 9 Diseases/Conditions for Which CAM Is Most Frequently Used Among ChildrenNatural Products Deep Breathing Echinacea *Percentages among children who used natural products in the last 30 days.

Overall, approximately 12 percent of children use some form of CAM. Use is greater among: Children whose parents used CAM (23.9%) Adolescents aged 12-17 (16.4%), compared to younger children White children (12.8%), compared to Hispanic children (7.9%) and black children (5.9%) Children whose parents had higher education levels (more than high school: 14.7%) Children with six or more health conditions (23.8%) Children whose families delayed conventional care because of cost (16.9%) Figures 7-9 show survey findings on CAM use by children, including top therapies, natural products, and diseases/conditions.
