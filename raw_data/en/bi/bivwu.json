Naturopathic philosophy believes that the healing process is ordered and actually, in a way, \"intelligent\". Naturopaths treat each patient by taking into account not only physical aspects but also mental, emotional, environmental, social, and even behavioral health. When obstacles are identified, we act to help remove those barriers. As the body takes over healing and recovery, natural processes are able to gravitate the body back to a steady state of wellness, oftentimes without having to resort to harsher, more extreme interventions. Naturopathy can be experienced as a stand-alone service, or in conjunction with traditional medicine. "}
