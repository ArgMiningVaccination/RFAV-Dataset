Please note the following considerations when reading this document: We suggest using the 'Bookmarks' function on the left to navigate through this document. Evidence reviews are systematic reviews answering a specific question or set of questions and were prepared by an evidence team with contribution from clinical experts. Narrative reviews were prepared by clinical experts allocated to a specific question or set of questions. Narrative reviews were completed in areas of lower health professional or consumer priority or where the clinical question was not well suited to a systematic review. Some reviews started as systematic reviews, however if no evidence was identified, were addressed as narrative reviews. This has been noted at the top of the review as \"No evidence identified in evidence review\" . The evidence reviews and narrative reviews in this technical report represent the steps immediately after evidence synthesis when GDGs met to discuss and make recommendations, and are a set stage in evolution of the process of evidence synthesis and the development, refinement and consensus of recommendations in various stages of review, discussion and consultation across clinical experts, GDGs and panels; therefore the final recommendation (in the guideline) may not be reflected here. Final recommendations in the guideline reflect post GDG meeting followup, integration and response to feedback from public consultation and the latest updates in key evidence raised during public consultation, which is not encompassed or documented in these reviews. The table of responses to feedback are available as a separate document. Following these changes and evolution from the technical report to the final document, consensus was again sought with all GDG members across all recommendations. Each narrative review has been completed by one or more of 60 contributors to the development of this guideline and thus, there may be minor differences in formatting or layout of detail. Some narrative reviews may not contain a GRADE framework. This is because the review has been considered within a GRADE framework contained in a different section. This has been noted where relevant. GRADE components may be formatted slightly differently across reviews given technical difficulties using the online GRADE framework and in translating information from the online GRADE framework. With respect to the methods for chapter four and five, a separate methods document is provided for each chapter rather than full methods presented in each individual review. This is because in some cases, multiple clinical questions are addressed within the same search. 1 1.1 NARRATIVE REVIEW No evidence identified in evidence review Clinical question: In adolescents, at what time point after onset of menarche do irregular cycles indicate ongoing menstrual dysfunction? Prevalence and problem Physiologically, during the first year postmenarche, hormonal responses do not match adult patterns. During the second year about one half of the menstrual cycles range from 2145 days in length however progesterone levels are low (1,2). The average adult menstrual cycle is 28 days, with a normal cycle range of 24 to 35 days (2). However, during the first few years postmenarche, cycles vary considerably, with recent data suggesting that a majority of irregular cycles may be ovulatory in girls 2 years postmenarche (36). In the first postmenarcheal year, around half of cycles are anovulatory. Nonetheless, 80% of cycles occur within a predictable range of 21 to 45 days and last two to seven days (58). By the third postmenarcheal year, 95% of cycles fall into this range and as such in the 5% without regular cycles PCOS should be considered. Regular ovulatory cycles onset are related to age at menarche (9). In girls who begin menses at <12 years, between 12 and 13 years, and >13 years of age, 50% of cycles are ovulatory by one year, three years, and 4.5 years, respectively (9). At age 15 more than 50% of girls who are oligoamenorrheic remain so at age 18. (10) Hence it is variable and still remains somewhat unclear at what developmental stage irregular cycles in adolescents reflect immaturity of the reproductive system or possible PCOS. Clinical Practice Gap: Need for guidance Current practice defining when adolescent menstrual cycle irregularity becomes pathophysiologic is unclear. With many women reporting delayed diagnosis, it is likely that current practice involves prescription of the oral contraceptive pill without diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents. Diagnosis also allows for early intervention screening and prevention. While this may increase referral for diagnostic testing and specialist care, the benefits of early diagnosis and prevention of associated complications and infertility may be beneficial to the overall disease burden. Dissatisfaction with diagnosis experiences and delays in diagnosis are linked to anxiety. (Gibson) Summary of key information We did not identify any evidence in our patient population to answer the question and therefore a clinical consensus recommendation has been made informed by the natural history of menstrual cycles and ovulation in adolescents (aged <18 years). Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS In adolescent women (<18 years), after two years of irregular cycles (>35 or <21 days) following the onset of menarche, polycystic ovary syndrome should be considered and assessed according to the guidelines. The value and timing of assessment and diagnosis should be discussed with the individual patient, taking into account psychosocial factors. Reassurance can be given about future reproductive potential. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS 2 If oral contraceptive pill therapy is being considered or has commenced in adolescents (<18 years), the following are recommended: After twelve months of irregular cycles (>35 or <21 days) after onset of menarche, baseline assessment of clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism and cycle patterns should be considered before commencement of the oral contraceptive pill. If baseline assessment is abnormal, potential increased risk of PCOS could be communicated to the patient and subsequent reassessment should be considered. Where a baseline assessment has not been performed, consider withdrawal of the oral contraceptive pill for at least three months. Contraception will need to be otherwise managed during this time. Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to narrative review. Panel discussion The aim was to promote awareness of PCOS among patients and health professionals, fac ilitating timely diagnosis and management, preventing complications and limiting overdiagnosis in adolescents. Undesirable effects How substantial are the unde sirable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion Potential delays in diagnosis if reassessment does not occur. Potential over diagnosis if assessed too close to menarche. Linked with recommendations on not using ultrasound for diagnosis in adolescents , this will be minimised. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? 3 Judgement No included studies Very low Low Moderate High Research evidence Narrative review. Panel discussion NA Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence NA. Panel discussion Agreement that this recommendation is of high valu e, however there may be important uncertainty. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and unde sirable effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement 7 Favours this option 5 Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion Uncertainty of the value of diagnosis in adolescents contributed to judgment discussion. However, overall panel deemed the balance favoured this option. How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement Don't know Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Variability across different countries in current standard prac tice. Costs of assessment and diagnosis are generally low and based on clinical assessment and blood tests in adolescents. 4 Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Variability, as per resources. Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement Don't know 4 Varies Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion For those with reduced access to care, attention should be paid toward ability for reassessment and early intervention if required. If recommendations are followed equity would be improved, however it is acknowledged that resources and access to expertise may impact on the implementation of recommendation. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know 4 Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Likely to accept. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement 5 Don't know Varies No 2 Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Concerns raised about health professionals adoption of these recommendations. Access to resources and expertise worldwide may affect implementation. Translation important CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendation In adolescent women (<18 years), after two years of irregular cycles (>35 or <21 days) following the onset of menarche, polycystic ovary syndrome should be considered and assessed according to the guidelines. The value and timing of assessment and diagnosis should be discussed with the individual patient, taking into account psychosocial factors. Reassurance can be given about future reproductive potential. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice points If oral contraceptive pill therapy is being considered or has commenced in adolescents (<18 years), the following are recommended: After twelve months of irregular cycles (>35 or <21 days) after onset of menarche, baselin e assessment of clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism and cycle patterns should be considered before commencement of the oral contraceptive pill. If baseline assessment is abnormal, potential increased ri sk of PCOS could be communicated to the patient and subsequent reassessment should be considered. Where a baseline assessment has not been performed, consider withdrawal of the oral contraceptive pill for at least three months. Contraception will need to be otherwise managed during this time. Subgroup considerations Obese and/or amenorreahic subgroups require further attention. Implementation considerations Education of paediatricians/family physi cians and gynaecologists as to timing of diagnosis and normal physiologic processes. 6 Monitoring and evaluation Whether patients have been assessed and counselled according to the recommendation. Research priorities Further longitudinal studies to identify early predictors and natural history of PCOS in adolescents would be of value and these could then be targeted to allow for timely diagnosis. 7 References 1.

Hyperandrogenism evidence review 1 1.2 EVIDENCE REVIEW Clinical question: In women with suspected PCOS, what is the most effective measure to diagnose PCOS related hyperandrogenism (biochemical)? Contents Background ............................................................................................................................... .............................................. 2 Findings 4 included studies 26 Appendix III: Table of excluded studies ............................................................................................................................... . 56 Hyperandrogenism evidence review 2 Background Hyperandrogenism is a wellestablished contributor to PCOS aetiology, detectable in around 60-100% of cases, depending on methods and criteria used, yet it is especially challenging to diagnose. It includes both clinical (hirsutism, central alopecia and acne) and biochemical hyperandrogenism. Clinical hyperandrogenism manifests differently depending on the population studied, for example, Asian populations manifest fewer features, while South East Asian and Mediterranean populations display more marked features of clinical hyperandrogenism. When determining biochemical hyperandrogenism, accurate diagnosis is hampered by a lack of ideal methods for measurement. Within these limitations, a direct measure of androgens is testosterone. Calculated bioavailable testosterone and calculated free testosterone can be used interchangeably as a marker of testosterone, and can be derived using various different formulas, however calculated free testosterone is the most commonly measured marker, using the formula of Vermuelen et al. (Vermeulen, Verdonck et al. 1999). The free androgen index (FAI = 100 x [total testosterone/SHBG]) is also a widely used measure of androgens. To diagnose hyperandrogenism, testosterone assays are widely used, however deficiencies in the accuracy of these assays limits their use in a setting where standardised testosterone measurements that are accurate, reliable and comparable over time are essential (Taieb, Mathian et al. 2003, Rosner and Vesper 2010). Also, most routine testosterone assays are designed for use in males with accuracy and precision at the lower androgen levels noted in females being much less. Given the controversy, methodological challenges and variety of different options for the biochemical measurement of androgens and uncertainty in clinical practice, it is important to determine which measure is the most appropriate. Summary of evidence Included studies Seven studies were identified by our search. Seven diagnostic studies (level III2) reported the diagnostic accuracy of different reproductive hormone markers to detect PCOS. Another diagnostic study (level III2) compared the diagnostic accuracy of GCMS and RIA to detect PCOS using serum reproductive hormone markers.

Methodological quality/risk of bias Due to the nature of the question of this review it is important that participants are entered into the study based on explicit selection criteria; from the same population and that entrance to the study is either random or consecutive. It is also important that studies are adequately powered to detect the specified outcome and that they include an independent, blinded comparison with a valid reference standard. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Findings of studies of moderate or high risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. The studies by Bili et al., Rudnicka et al., Villarroel et al., StenerVictorin et al. and Koskinen et al. were found to have a high risk of bias and Hahn et al. and EscobarMorreale et al. were found to have a moderate risk of bias. Reasons include: selection criteria were not explicitly stated; it is unclear whether participants were entered into the study appropriately (random or consecutive); casecontrol design; and inadequacies around application of index and reference tests. Consistency of studies Six studies reported the diagnostic accuracy of different reproductive hormone markers in serum to detect PCOS and another compared the diagnostic accuracy of liquid (LCMS/MS) tandem mass spectrometry, gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GCMS) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) to detect PCOS using serum reproductive hormone markers. The serum reproductive hormone markers included: total testosterone (TT), calculated bioavailable testosterone (CBT), (A), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS), and free androgen index (FAI). Generalisability Where reported, the studies were consistent in terms of age and BMI and are generalisable to the target population for this evidence review. The tests that were addressed in the studies are available and routinely used in Australia. Studies were conducted in university departments, outpatient clinics in hospitals in Germany, Spain, Finland, Sweden, Chile, Greece, Poland and Chile. Hyperandrogenism evidence review 4 Findings Due to the small number of included studies and the heterogeneity in threshold/cut off values for each index test, meta analyses (for pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates) have not been performed. Data are presented in forest plots and summary ROC analyses wherever thresholds/cut off values were similar. Where thresholds/cut off values are different, only summary ROC analyses have been presented. Only studies with sensitivity and specificity data are able to be analysed and presented in these formats, using RevMan. It allows imputation to derive true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) to provide greater detail about the accuracy of the index test. There is insufficient evidence about diagnostic accuracy of any of the index tests reported in the included studies. Index Test: Total testosterone (p<0.0001) 4.6 NR `Converted from various units.

CMIA, Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay Hyperandrogenism evidence review 11 RECOMMENDATION 1.1a Direct assays (e.g. radiometric, enzymelinked, etc.) for assessing total or free testosterone may have limited accuracy for PCOS and should preferably not be used to assess women for possible hyperandrogenism, since these assays demonstrate poor sensitivity, accuracy and precision. Direct assays may underestimate or overestimate the presence of PCOS. EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATION 1.1b Calculated bioavailable testosterone, calculated free testosterone, or free androgen index should be used to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism (i.e. hyperandrogenemia) in polycystic ovary syndrome (consider removing). For the most accurate diagnosis of biochemical hyperandrogenism, health professionals are recommended to use high quality assays (LCMSMS and extraction/chromatography immunoassays) to assess total or unbound (free) testosterone. In the case that total or free testosterone is not elevated, health professionals might consider investigation of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS); however these may provide limited additional information regarding hyperandrogenemia in PCOS. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT 1.1c It is difficult, if not impossible, to reliably assess for hyperandrogenemia in women on the oral contraceptive pill as these medication's effects include increases in sex hormone binding globulin and reductions in gonadotropin dependent androgen production. Where the oral contraceptive pill has already been commenced and assessment of biochemical androgens is imperative, it should be withdrawn for at least three months, if not longer, before appropriate hormonal assessments for hyperandrogenemia are undertaken. Contraception should be managed otherwise during this time. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT 1.1d Assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism (hyperandrogenemia) is most useful in establishing the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or the specific phenotype of PCOS, in girls or women with unclear or absent clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, in particular hirsutism. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT 1.1e If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, other causes of hyperandrogenemia, including neoplastic growth, iatrogenic causes, and syndromes of severe insulin resistance, may be considered. In this setting the clinical history of time of onset and/or rapid progression of symptoms is critical in assessing for an androgen secreting tumour. However, it should be kept in mind that some androgen secreting neoplasms are associated with mild to moderate increases in androgen levels. Hyperandrogenism evidence review 12 Clinical decisions should be guided by the reference ranges of the laboratory used. Reference ranges for different methods and different laboratories vary widely, and are often based on an arbitrary percentile or variances of the mean of the values observed in a population. Normal values should preferably be determined either by the range of values in a well phenotyped healthy control population or by cluster analysis of the values of a large general population. Justification The GDG believe that nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia should be excluded before the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is confirmed. Androgen measures are useful to demonstrate or confirm biochemical hyperandrogenism (hyperandrogenemia) in patients suspected of PCOS and other androgen excess disorders. Circulating androgen measures will be most useful in girls and women who demonstrate minimal to no concrete clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (e.g. hirsutism). There was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation based on evidence alone about the best method to use for measurement of markers for biochemical diagnosis of PCOS, although data indicates that, as a single measure, free testosterone measurements provide the highest ability to detect biochemical hyperandrogenism followed by, in no specific order, total testosterone, DHEAS, and androstenedione. With few exceptions [15] methods for directly assessing total testosterone levels in the circulation (e.g. direct radioimmunoassays or chemiluminescence immunoassays) are of insufficient precision, sensitivity and specificity to be used for the accurate assessment of total testsoterone levels in chilldren and women, including those suffering from the polycystic ovary syndrome. There are also currently no reliable direct assays for total or free testosterone, but laboratories can provide calculated bioavailable testosterone, calculated free testosterone, or free androgen index (FAI). Additionally, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate may be used to increase the probability of detecting hyperandrogenemia. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate is predominantly an adrenal source of circulating androgen. Mild elevation may be seen with PCOS. However, markedly raised dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the setting of rapidly progressive virilisation should prompt one to investigate for possible androgen secreting adrenal tumour. Androstenedione, in turn, nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Testosterone during midcycle and assessment of androgen status should preferably be performed in the early follicular (preovulatory) phase in cycling women, which can be determined by clinical menstrual history. In women with oligoamenorrhea it is best to perform the assessment after a withdrawal bleed has been induced with progesterone or progestins. Diurnal variation may also occur in circulating androgen levels [14] and morning levels may be most predictive. Clinical considerations Total testosterone alone can identify 2030% of PCOS women with hyperandrogenic phenotypes as hyperandrogenemic, while measures of unbound or free testosterone will identify 5060% of such women with PCOS as hyperandrogenemic. Mild to moderate elevations of androstenedione may be observed in polycystic ovary syndrome, whereas marked elevations of androstenedione are more indicative of 21OH deficient nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia. The most common form of NCCAH, 21hydroxylase deficiency, can be excluded by measuring serum 17 hydroxyprogesterone in the follicular phase, preferably in the morning. Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH), although rare, needs to be considered before the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome is confirmed.

Hyperandrogenism evidence review 14 Panel discussion The body of evidence included here is predominately of low certain ty with serious to very serious risk of bias, serious risk of inconsistency and serious risk of indirectness; w ith no serious risk of imprecision or publication bias. Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variabil ity in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement 7 Important uncertainty or variability 4 Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was conducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Disagreement among GDG members about the extent that health professionals may value the recommendation. Both patients and clinicians are likely to value highly an accurate diagnosis of PCOS, and as measures of circulating androgens will be important in the di agnosis of those women with PCOS a nd without clear clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (i.e. hirsutism), they will be valued most hi ghly in the evaluation of women without clear clinical signs of hyperandrogenism. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and undesira ble effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion The desirable effects (an accurate diagnosis) far outweigh the undesirable effects (higher costs and lesser availability of high quality androgen assays). How large are the resource requirements (costs)? Judgement Don't know Varies Large costs 2 Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Hyperandrogenism evidence review 15 The difference between not using androgen measures at all, or using lower cost and lower qua lity androgen measurements and using higher quality higher cost assays , is modest, and likely to decrease if demand and utilization increases. Certainty regarding this statemen t is moderately high. Certainty of evidence of required resources What is the certainty of the eviden ce of resource requirements (costs)?

Hyperandrogenism evidence review 17 CONCLUSIONS Evidence-based recommendation 1 Calculated bioavailable testosterone, calculated free test osterone, or free androgen index should be used to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism (i.e. hyp erandrogenemia) in polycystic ovary syndrome (consider removing PCOS).

Direct assays may underestimate or overestimate the presence of PCOS. Judgement Hyperandrogenism evidence review 18 Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison 4 Conditional recommendation for the option 7 Strong recommendation for the option Practice points It is difficult, if not impossible, to reliably assess fo r hyperandrogenemia in women on the oral contraceptive pill as these medication's effects include increases in sex horm one-binding globulin and re ductions in gonadotropin- dependent androgen production. Where the oral contraceptive pill has already been commenced and assessme nt of biochemical androgens is imperative, it should be withdrawn for at least three months , if not longer, before appropriate hormonal assessments for hyperandrogenemia are undertaken.

Normal values should preferably be determined either by the range of values in a well phenotyped healthy control population or by cluster analysis of the values of a large general population. Subgroup considerations As noted above, the value of assays for circulating androgens is highest in those women with PCOS who do not have clear clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism. Caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to some ethnic populations, although there is limited evidence that androgen m easures are less effective in one ethnic group than another for the detection of PCOS, when good quality assays a nd appropriate ethnic-related normative ranges are used. Implementation considerations Implementation will require wide-spread edu cation of stakeholders, including clinic ians, researchers, patients and patient advocates, payers, health plan mana gers, and diagnostic laboratories. Monitoring and evaluation The utilization of high quality androgen assays, particularly calculated free (unbound) testosterone, for the evaluation of patients with potential PCOS should be monitored, which should include an assessment at baseline (initiation of the campaign) and a periodic intervals. Research priorities Criteria defining how 'normal ranges' should be established are required. The development of higher quality, specif ic and sensitive, but lower cost and automated androgen assays, including those for total and free (unbound) testosterone. Prospective epidemiologic studies assessing the predictive valu e of the different androgens, and androgen assays, for the diagnosis of PCOS.

EXTERNAL VALIDITY - IS THIS STUDY AND ITS RESULTS GENERALIZABLE TO MY SYSTEMATIC REVIEW QUESTION? Patient/population/ participants Women with PCOS and women with normal ovarian function, between the ages of 18 and 35 years. For the homogeneity of the PCOS group, women with regular cycles but with signs of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ultrasound morphology were excluded. Recent pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives, ovulatory agents, antidiabetic medications and glucocorticoids, within three months prior to enrolment. Women seeking fertility were also excluded, as they often receive hormonal therapies, which may interfere with study results N PCOS: 43 C: 40 Setting Tertiary care, outpatient clinic, academic hospital from January 2009 until May 2012.

Reference standard PCOS by Rotterdam Outcomes Between day 3 and 5 of the menstrual cycle Accuracy (comparison with the reference standard test) - Sensitivity and specificity, Likelihood ratios, Area under the ROC curve Inclusion and exclusion criteria reported? Yes Does the study have a clearly focused question? Yes INTERNAL VALIDITY - HAS THIS STUDY BEEN CONDUCTED RIGOROUSLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE BIAS? (INCLUDING ITEMS FROM THE QUADAS2 TOOL) PATIENT SELECTION/SPWas the spectrum of patients representative of the patients who will receive the test in practice? No Studies which recruit a group of healthy controls and a group known to have the target disorder will be coded as \"no\" on this item in nearly all circumstances. Studies enrolling patients with Hyperandrogenism evidence review 27 known disease and a control group without the condition may exaggerate diagnostic accuracy. For PCO use: Controls would not be routinely assessed for ovarian volume using ultrasound. The PCOS group is representative of those who will be assessed with these criteria in practice, however, the method of ultrasound may not be routine practice in the patient group relevant to this question. Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? (Q2) Not reported It is best if the patients are randomly selected or consecutive admissions so that selection bias is minimised. Was a casecontrol design avoided? (Q2) No Studies enrolling patients with known disease and a control group without the condition may exaggerate diagnostic accuracy. Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? (Q2) Not reported Studies that make inappropriate exclusions, eg. excluding \"difficult to diagnose\" patients, may result in overoptimistic estimates of diagnostic accuracy. Exclusion of patients with \"red flags\" for the target condition, who may be easier to diagnose, may lead to underestimation of diagnostic accuracy. CLASSIFICATION/VERIFICATION/INCORPORATION/REVIEW BIAS Were all participants assessed with both index test and reference standard? (Also in Q2) Not reported Implied. Cochrane suggests that partial verification bias (also known as workup bias, (primary) selection bias, or sequential ordering bias) can occur when not all of the study patients are verified by the reference standard. Did all patients receive the same reference standard? (Q2) Not reported Implied. Cochrane suggests that differential verification bias can occur when some patients are verified by one type of reference standard and other patients by a different standard. Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? (Q2) Yes Consider if the reference standard is likely to correctly classify the target condition or is the best method available. Making a judgement as to the accuracy of the reference standard may not be straightforward. You may need experience of the topic area to know whether a test is an appropriate reference standard. Estimates of the performance of the index test are based on the assumption that the reference standard is 100% sensitive and specific. If there are any disagreements between the reference standard and the index test then it is assumed that the index test is incorrect. (Not required with reproducibility type questions.) Was the reference standard independent of the index test (ie. the index test did not form part of the reference standard)? No Hyperandrogenism and PCOM are criteria in diagnosis of PCOS. Cochrane suggests that incorporation of the index test in the reference standard testing is likely to increase the amount of agreement between index test results and the reference standard Hyperandrogenism evidence review 28 thereby overestimating diagnostic accuracy. This is incorporation bias. Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test? (Q2) Not reported Cochrane suggests that test review bias may occur when interpretation of the results of the index test is influenced by knowledge of the results of the reference standard. This is similar to the issue of blinded outcome assessment in intervention studies. Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard test? (Q2) Not reported Cochrane suggests that diagnostic review bias may occur when interpretation of the results of the reference standard is influenced by knowledge of the results of the index test. This is similar to the issue of blinded outcome assessment in intervention studies. If a threshold was used, was it prespecified? Not reported QUADAS suggests that selecting the test threshold to optimise sensitivity and/or specificity may lead to overoptimistic estimates of test performance, which is likely to be poorer in an independent sample of patients in whom the same threshold is used. DETECTION BIAS Is the time period between tests short enough to be reasonably sure that the target condition did not change between the two tests? (Also in Q2) Not reported QUADAS suggests that if there is a delay or if treatment is started between index test and reference standard, misclassification may occur due to recovery or deterioration of the condition. ATTRITIO NBIASWere withdrawals from the study explained? X% treatment X% control/ comparison Numbers described as enrolled are the same as those in results. REPORT BIAS Were uninterruptable/ intermediate test results reported? Yes If it is clear that all test results, including uninterpretable/ indeterminate/intermediate are reported then this item should be scored as \"yes\". If the authors do not report any uninterpretable /indeterminate /intermediate results and if results are reported for all patients who were described as having been entered into the study then this item should also be scored as \"yes\". If you think that such results occurred but have not been reported then this item should be scored as \"no\". If it is not clear whether all study results have been reported then this item should be scored as \"not reported\". OTHER ISSUES -Was the execution of all tests described in sufficient detail to permit replication of the tests? Yes Hyperandrogenism evidence review 29 Were the clinicians undertaking the tests representative of the clinicians who will be undertaking the tests in the clinical setting? Not reported Consider if the clinicians undertaking the tests similarly qualified, trained and experienced as would be the clinicians likely to undertake the tests in practice. Were the same clinical data available when test results were interpreted as would be available when the test is used in practice? Not reported Cochrane suggests that where tests report an objective measurement (such as a biochemical assay) which is unaltered by external information, an unbiased estimate of test accuracy may be obtained by interpreting it in isolation from other clinical information. Were there any conflicts of interest in the writing or funding of this study? Yes Declared. If statistical analysis was undertaken, was this appropriate? Partial Unclear: if an adequate sample size calculation was undertaken if the statistical analysis was planned a priori if the data were analysed accordingly to the study protocol. A 4 X 4 table of test performance was not presented. Diagnostic accuracy and measures of statistical uncertainty (eg. 95%CI) presented: Sensitivity and specificity Likelihood ratios Area under the ROC curve Comments The aim of this study was to determine the performance of PSA and ultrasound parameters, such as ovarian volume and outline, in the diagnosis of PCOS.

Partial Studies which recruit a group of healthy controls and a group known to have the target disorder will be coded as \"no\" on this item in nearly all circumstances. Studies enrolling patients with known disease and a control group without the condition may exaggerate diagnostic accuracy. For PCO use: Controls would not be routinely assessed for ovarian volume using ultrasound. The PCOS group is Hyperandrogenism evidence review 42 representative of those who will be assessed with these criteria in practice, however, the method of ultrasound may not be routine practice in the patient group relevant to this question. Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? (Q2) No It is best if the patients are randomly selected or consecutive admissions so that selection bias is minimised. Was a casecontrol design avoided? (Q2) No Studies enrolling patients with known disease and a control group without the condition may exaggerate diagnostic accuracy. Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? (Q2) Not reported Studies that make inappropriate exclusions, eg. excluding \"difficult to diagnose\" patients, may result in overoptimistic estimates of diagnostic accuracy.

Did all patients receive the same reference standard? (Q2) Not reported Implied by definition of controls: without clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenemia and absence of polycystic morphology on ultrasound examination. Cochrane suggests that differential verification bias can occur when some patients are verified by one type of reference standard and other patients by a different standard. Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? (Q2) Yes Was the reference standard independent of the index test (ie. the index test did not form part of the reference standard)? No Hyperandrogenism and PCOM are criteria in diagnosis of PCOS. Cochrane suggests that incorporation of the index test in the reference standard testing is likely to increase the amount of agreement between index test results and the reference standard thereby overestimating diagnostic accuracy. This is incorporation bias. Hyperandrogenism evidence review 43 Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test? (Q2) Not reported Cochrane suggests that test review bias may occur when interpretation of the results of the index test is influenced by knowledge of the results of the reference standard.

Prevalence and problem Hyperandrogenism is one of three principle features of PCOS, and affects between 60% and 100% of patients, depending on diagnostic criteria used and PCOS phenotypes considered. Hyperandrogenism can be assessed biochemically (i.e. hyperandrogenemia) and/or clinically. The biochemical assessment of hyperandrogenism is hampered by a lack of clarity concerning which androgens to measure, what assay methodologies to utilize, how to define the normal ranges, a significant overlap in the values obtained in control and PCOS women, and the availability of and access to high quality assays. In turn, clinical features of hyperandrogenism are present in a significant majority of patients with PCOS, are relatively low cost to assess, solely requiring clinician vigilance, astuteness and skill. Assessment is impacted by treatment (cosmetic and medical) of hirsutism. Clinical practice gap and need for guidance Signs and symptoms of severe degrees of androgen excess can result in virilization (e.g. male pattern balding, severe hirsutism, and clitoromegaly) and masculinization (e.g. deepening of the voice, breast atrophy, and android changes to skeletal muscles, bones and, in the case of fetus or young children, the external genitalia). More common is clinical evidence of mild to moderate androgen excess, including hirsutism, acne, and female pattern hair loss. The predictive value of the various signs and symptoms remains unclear, may vary by ethnicity, and requires clinician training and vigilance. Summary of key information The most recognizable clinical sign of hyperandrogenism is the presence of terminal hairs in a malelike pattern in women, i.e. hirsutism. Elevated androgens are detected in the vast majority (>70%) of women with hirsutism and few women with hirsutism do not demonstrate other features of PCOS (<5%) (1). While various methods of visually assessing excess terminal hair growth in a malelike pattern in women have been reported, the one that is used in the vast majority of studies today is the modified FerrimanGallwey (mFG) scoring method (2,3). The scale assesses for the presence of terminal hairs (hairs that would grow >5 mm in length if left unmolested, are usually pigmented, and are medullated) in areas that are primarily masculine. While FerrimanGallwey initially reported on hair growth in eleven body areas, including the lower legs and lower arms (2), they and others noted that hair growth in these two body areas did not correlate well with hair growth in the remaining body areas (i.e. terminal hair growth can occur in the lower legs and lower arms in women, whether they are hyperandrogenic or not). Hence, the FerrimanGallwey visual score was 'modified' to include assessment of only nine body areas: upper lip, chin and neck, upper chest (excluding the nipples), upper abdomen (above the umbilicus), lower abdomen (also known as male escutcheon), thighs (front and/or back), upper back, lower back, and upper arms (3,4). Each area is visually scored from zero (no terminal hair visible) to four (terminal hair consistent with a welldeveloped male). A photographic atlas has been published (3). Defining what is 'abnormal' has been somewhat controversial. While many investigators define the cutoff value for an mFG score by percentile (i.e. a score >68 is usually consistent with the 95th percentile of Black, 2 White or Mongoloid Asian populations of unselected women [2,4,5]) this may not actually represent the true \"abnormal\". Studies using cluster analysis have suggested that an mFG scores of >3 in White and Black women (6), and >5 in Mongoloid Asian (Han Chinese) women (7), represents true abnormality. Thus, while there may be differences in the degree and prevalence of hirsutism between ethnic groups (see below), there appears to be little difference in the cutoff values for determining excess terminal facial and body hair as abnormal (i.e. defining 'hirsutism'). Overall, >50% of women with mFG scores in the range of 35 having evidence of hyperandrogenism and/or PCOS (8), and >7090% of women with scores >5 demonstrating the same (3,5). There are ethnic variations to consider (1,3,910). There does not seem to be any significant difference between Black and White patients, at least in the United States (5,6) , although not all studies agree (9). Alternatively, mean the prevalence and degree of hirsutism appears to be lower in Mongoloid Asian women, but higher in Southeastern Asian women (11,12). Nonetheless, it is also important to understand that there are important referral bias in the patients seen clinically, who tend to be more hyperandrogenic than PCOS women identified in the general population in epidemiologic studies (13,14), which impacts the racial/ethnic mix and severity of the hirsutism of patients see in the clinic (13). Additionally, most women will readily treat their excess hair growth, thus making it more difficult to detect the presence of hirsutism. Consequently, clinicians should be prepared to assess any patient that complains of excess hair growth, regardless of whether there is gross evidence of hirsutism or not (8,15). A number of studies have found that acne is associated with biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (16,17). However, few studies have attempted to assess the predictive value of acne alone, as a marker of hyperandrogenism, in contrast to when acne is found in the presence of hirsutism. Furthermore, most studies have been retrospective in nature (1,17). Finally, there is no one accepted system for clinically measuring acne (1). Overall, while acne in women may be a clinical predictor of androgen excess, the predictive value of acne alone for hyperandrogenism remains unclear. Most studies of women with female pattern hair loss (FPHL), characterized by diffuse sagittal scalp alopecia, reveal a relatively low prevalence of hyperandrogenemia (1, 18). Furthermore, most studies have not clearly separated women with FPHL alone vs. those with FPHL and hirsutism, thus the predictive value of FPHL alone for androgen excess remains unclear. Likewise, malepattern balding in women is generally not an isolated event, but is usually evident in combination with hirsutism. The pattern of hair loss on the scalp is usually assessed visually using the Ludwig scale or the Christmas tree classification (1). Overall, FPHL alone is a modest clinical predictor of hyperandrogenism. Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS Health professionals should take a comprehensive history and physical examination for signs and symptoms of clinical hyperandrogenism in women, including acne, female pattern hair loss (FPHL), and hirsutism. Health professionals should preferably use standardized visual scales when assessing hirsutism (e.g. mFG) or FPHL (e.g. Ludwig). (add link mFG and Ludwig score - ask RA) Health professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact of clinical hyperandrogenism. Health professionals should be aware that an mFG score of >3, and more often >5, signals hirsutism. 3 Health professionals should be aware that patient selfidentification of unwanted excess hair growth or scalp hair loss should be considered an important indicator for evaluation regardless of overt evidence for hirsutism or FPHL. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS : Health professionals should note that there are no universally accepted visual instruments available for assessing the presence of acne. Health professionals should recognize that patients will tend to selftreat dermatologic signs of hyperandrogenism. Health professionals should appreciate that a patient's complaints or selfassessment of unwanted excess hair growth, and possibly acne and FPHL, has a high degree of validity and merits close evaluation, even if overt clinical signs of hyperandrogenism are not readily evident to the examiner. Health professionals should recognize that while the mFG cutoff score for defining hirsutism does not appear to vary widely between ethnic groups, the prevalence and degree of severity tends to vary by ethnicity. Health professionals should use published scales and a photographic atlas for the assessment of hirsutism. (link) Health professionals should recognize that overestimation of hirsutism may occur if they confuse body and facial vellus hair growth with terminal hair growth; only terminal hairs should be considered for hirsutism. The distinction rests on the fact that terminal hairs can grow >5 mm in length if unmolested, have a central core (medulla) of compact cells, and usually vary in shape and texture. They are also generally pigmented, but so can vellus hairs. Health professionals should be aware that some ethnic groups will demonstrate denser vellus hair. 4 Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to evidence or narrative review. Panel discussion While subjective and visual, the m-FG scoring method for determining the extent of facial and terminal hair growth continues to be the principal instrument used for the clinical assessment of hirsutism. Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion The undesirable effect rest on the fact that the m-FG scoring system is subjective, is affected by intra-and inter-observer variance, and can be ove r-estimated if clinicians do not dist inguish between vellus and terminal hairs when scoring facial and body hair growth. Values Is there important uncertainty about, or va riability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was conducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Both patients and clinicians value highly an accurate diagnosis of PCOS, and a standardized assessment for clinical hyperandrogenism (e.g. hirsutism) will be va lued highly, particularly as high quality and accurate 5 biochemical measures of hyperandrogenism remain le ss widely available and less well defined. Further, clinically evident dermatologic signs of hyperandrogen ism are important negative determinants of quality of life in affected patients. Balance of effects Does the balance between desi rable and undesirable effect s favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion The desirable effects (an accurate and sensitive di agnosis) far outweigh the undesirable effects (over- estimation of the degree of unwanted hair growth). How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement Don't know Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Clinicians should use standardized forms for assessing the presence of hirsutism, acne and FPHL, which are widely and freely available, and should be trained in th eir use. The use of color atlas may be of value in increasing the accuracy, and decrea sing the intra-and inter-observer variability, of these measures. Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option 2 Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion The cost of assessing for the presence of clinical si gns of hyperandrogenism using standardized tools far outweighs its modest cost(s). Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement 6 Don't know Varies Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Assessing for the presence of clinical signs of hype randrogenism using standardized tools is of value regardless of socio-economic status and resources, and may even be of greater advantages in those that are economically disadvantaged due to its lower cost relative to biochemical assessments for hyperandrogenism. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know 7 Varies No Probably No 4 Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion There is wide-spread recognition that assessment(s) fo r clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism are of significant value in the evaluation of concerned pati ents and those with probable PCOS or other androgen excess disorders. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion It is feasible to sustain the recommendations, although it does require a greater degree of physician education and training for optimum implementation. 7 CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendation Health professionals should take a comprehensive history and physical examination for signs and symptoms of clinical hyperandrogenism in women, including acne, female pattern hair loss (FPHL), and hirsutism. Health professionals should preferably use standardized visual scales when assessing hirsutism (e.g. mFG) or FPHL (e.g. Ludwig). (add link mFG and Ludwig score - ask RA) Health professionals should be aware of the pote ntial negative psychosocia l impact of clinical hyperandrogenism. Health professionals should be aware that an m-FG score of >3, and more often >5, signals hirsutism. Health professionals should be aware that patient self-i dentification of unwanted excess hair growth or scalp hair loss should be considered an important indicator for evaluation regardless of overt evidence for hirsutism or FPHL. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice points Health professionals should note that there are no un iversally accepted visual instruments available for assessing the presence of acne. Health professionals should recogn ize that patients will tend to self-treat dermatologic signs of hyperandrogenism. Health professionals should appreciate that a patient's complaints or self-assessment of unwanted excess hair growth, and possibly acne and FPHL, has a high degree of validity and merits close evaluation, even if overt clinical signs of hyperandrogenism are not readily evident to the examiner.

To be linked with pho tographs in translation resources. 8 Subgroup considerations The sensitivity of facial and body hair follicles to term inalize (i.e. transform vellus to terminal hairs) in response to androgens varies greatly between ethnic gr oups. However, while ethnicit y may affect the degree of unwanted hair growth (i.e. the m-FG score), it has le ss effect on the cut-off used to signal the presence of abnormal terminal hair growth (i.e. hirsutism), which ap pears to be similar among th e different ethnic groups. Implementation considerations Along with widespread training, the use of standardized tools and photographic atlases should be considered to maximize sensitivity and accuracy and decr ease intra- and inter-observer variability. Monitoring and evaluation Efforts to educate and train clinicians , and the use of standardized tools and photographic atlases, should be assessed globally to ensure implementation of these recommendations. Research priorities The clinical assessment of hyperandrogenism, considering its high value and low cost, should be assessed in regards to: a) the impact of education and training of patients and clinicians; b) the role that standardized forms and photographic atlases may play in increasing sensitivity and reducing intra- and inter-observer variability; and c) the specific cut-off values used to defined 'abnormal' vs. 'normal' in different ethnic/racial populations. 9 References 1.

This process continues until menopause at an average age of 50-51 years. [1] Ovarian volumes are modified overtime as the ovary matures at the time of puberty with an increase in antral follicles but also increased stromal development. There are no large studies across the lifespan to validate normal ovarian development models but studies indicate a continuous increase in size and follicle count after age 6 and size increased throughout puberty correlating with age, height, weight and pubertal status. Ovarian size increases from age 911 and is greatest after age 12.[24] Normative models suggest maximum volume is reached at age 20.[5] The correlation between menstrual function and ovarian morphology is not entirely straightforward in adolescence or early adulthood as in a study of Danish women aged 1921, 68% were shown to have polycystic morphology based on Rotterdam criteria but without clinical features of PCOS.[6]There are few longitudinal studies, but a small study in healthy adolescents examined with ultrasound over 24 years post menarche suggests PCO morphology is common and not associated with reproductive dysfunction in this age group.[7] Based on the biology and the likelihood of peak follicle presence in adolescence and early adulthood, it is likely that adult follicle criteria are inaccurate for ultrasound diagnosis of PCOS in adolescence. As ultrasound technology improves in resolution, there is a continued need to reassess the quantitative definition of PCOM.[8] Summary of evidence Included studies Fifteen studies reported the diagnostic accuracy of different ovarian morphology parameters to detect PCOS (Allemand 2006, Alsamarai 2009, Atiomo 2000, Bili 2014, Carmina Chen 2008, Chen 2008, Dewailly 2011, Jonard 2003, Jonard 2005, Kosus 2011, Lujan 2013, Pache 1992, Villa 2013, Villarroel 2015 - see evidence review for review list). Studies were of casecontrol or crosssectional design. Two of the fifteen studies were in adolescents (shaded grey). The index tests addressed in these studies included various measures and thresholds of ovarian volume and follicle number.

It is also important that studies are adequately powered to detect the specified outcome and that they include an independent, blinded comparison with a valid reference standard. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Findings of studies of moderate or high risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. Seven studies were found to have a high risk of bias and eight were found to have a moderate risk of bias. Reasons include: selection criteria were not explicitly stated; it is unclear whether participants were entered into the study appropriately (random or consecutive); casecontrol design; and inadequacies around application of index and reference tests. 4 Generalisability The populations studied are generalisable to the target population for this evidence review. The tests that were addressed in the studies are available and routinely used in Australia, and worldwide. Studies were conducted in university departments, outpatient clinics in hospitals and university hospitals in China, Canada, USA, Germany, Spain, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Chile, Greece, Turkey, Poland and UK from 1989 - 2014. Findings None of the studies prespecified thresholds. Some studies have reported diagnostic accuracy data using multiple thresholds. Here we report the study's best compromise between sensitivity and specificity, as identified by the study authors. Due to the heterogeneity in threshold/cut off values for each index test, metaanalyses (for pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates) have not been performed. Data are presented in forest plots and summary ROC analyses grouped by similar thresholds/cut off values. Using RevMan, it allows imputation of sensitivity and specificity data to derive true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) to provide greater detail about the accuracy of the index test. Based on two small studies (95 and 134 participants) of moderate risk of bias in adolescents using thresholds of 6.74cm3 (sensitivity 75.4% and specificity 80%, AUC 0.879, using transabdominal ultrasound), ovarian volume in this range may be effective for diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents if using ultrasound. However there is still insufficient evidence to establish a numeric threshold above which PCOS can be concluded. This may be particularly difficult with a population with increased BMI. In adults, there are a number of studies demonstrating optimal diagnostic accuracy for both ranges 58cm3 and 10 11cm3. Therefore it is difficult to determine the most effective threshold for diagnosing PCOS using ultrasound to measure ovarian volume in adults. There is insufficient evidence to suggest use of ovarian area; maximum number follicles in a single sonographic plane (FSSP); peripheral distribution of ovarian follicles; bright ovarian stroma; combination of age, follicle number, log ovarian volume, and testosterone; or combination of follicular size and ovarian volume for diagnosis of PCOS.

Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION 1. There is no reliable cut off for polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound in adolescents (<20), therefore, ultrasound should not be recommended for diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. 2. The threshold for PCOM should be revisited due to improved ultrasound technology and resolution. In women with PCOS, the transvaginal ultrasound is the recommended approach, if acceptable. Using transducer with frequency > 8MHz, the threshold for PCOM should be FNPO > 18 and/or an ovarian volume > 10 ml, ensuring that there are no corpora lutea, cysts or dominant follicles. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT 1. In patients with oligoamenorrhea and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound may not be necessary for diagnosis of PCOS; however phenotyping of the patient will not be complete. Vaginal ultrasound is not appropriate in adolescents who have not been sexually active. Transabdominal ultrasound should primarily use ovarian volume parameters (greater than or equal to 10ml) given the difficulty of follicle counts with this approach. If using lower resolution (<8MHz), use the threshold of greater than or equal to 12 follicles and/or ovarian volume greater than or equal to 10ml. 9 Clinicians are encouraged to ask their ultrasound colleagues for clear protocols for reporting ultrasound AFC and OV Minimum reporting standards should include: A. Last menstrual period B. Transducer frequency C. Approach/route assessed - TV D. Total FNPO measuring 29mm (total number of follicles that measure 29mm) E. Three dimensions of each ovary and the volume F. Reporting of endometrial thickness and appearance is preferred - 3 layer endometrial is of importance G. Any other pathology of ovary and uterus, including ovarian cysts, corpus luteum, dominant follicles > equal 10mm. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Further methodologically rigorous trials are important to determine: 1) Natural history of menstrual cycles in PCOS compared to nonPCOS adolescents; 2) Ageappropriate normal ranges for sonographic features of polycystic ovaries and for clinical and biochemical features of PCOS in adolescents (<18 years); and 3) Accuracy of ovarian volume to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents (<18 years). 10 GRADE framework Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework What is the most effective ultrasound criteria to diagnose PCOS? ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement 9 Favours this option 1 Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to evidence review. Panel discussion Technology has advanced and criteria need to change to av oid over diagnosis. Criteria recommended reflect the best evidence available but will remain contr oversial until more research is done. It is anticipated that there will be less overlap with normal morphology in the adult population with an increase in follicle number per ovary threshold. Here invasive ultrasound will be required less often. Undesirable effects How substantial are the unde sirable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion Controversy will continue pending more research. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Judgement No included studies Very low Low Moderate High Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion The body of evidence included here is low to very low certai nty with serious to very serious risk of bias, serious risk of inconsistency, serious and very serious risk of imprecision and serious risk of indirectness; with no publication bias. 11 Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was conducte d before evidence synthesis commenced, to inform GDG recommendations. Panel discussion There is certainty in the value people place on the accurate diagnosis of PCOS. There is desire not to over diagnose the condition, especially in adolescents. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and unde sirable effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement 9 Favours this option 1 Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion Some concerns expressed about the limited data for follicle count. How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement Don't know Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion It is not anticipated that resource requirements will increa se with this recommendation. There will be more selective use of US and better quality reporting, which means less need for repeat US is likely. Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement 12 Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Cost effectiveness should be unaltered. Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement 7 Don't know Varies Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact 3 Probably increased Increased Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion With selective and appropriate use of US, fewer wo men are exposed to more complex tests and costs. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know 1 Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Key stakeholders such as practitioners in general paediatrics, adolescent medicine and gynecology should be informed as to the limitations of ultrasound in the adolescent populatio n as a diagnostic tool and should be advised regarding the potential for misdiagnosis on ultrasound criteria alone. It is likely that this will be accepted as a benefit given the limitations in available technology. There are no ethical conc erns raised by the recommendation. Reporting may take additional time for ultrasonographers. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No 2 Probably Yes Yes 13 Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion If ultrasound is used, it requires greater ultras onographic skills and equipment. Accessibility.

Justification In patients with oligoamenorrhea and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound may not be necessary for diagnosis of PCOS; however this will not allow complete phe notyping of the patient. Link to Rob's doc. The recommendation to use FNPO as the diagnostic criteria for PCOM is not changed based on current evidence. Technology advancements in the last decade supports an increase in FNPO used fo r diagnosis. In adults, there are a number of studies demonstrating optimal diagnostic accuracy for both ranges 5-8cm3 and 10-11cm3. Therefor e it is difficult to determine the most effective threshold for diagnosing PCOS using ovarian volume in adults. In the absence of sufficient evidence to inform this recommendation, a clinical consensu s recommendation has been made regarding ultrasound in the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents. The role of pelvic ultras ound in diagnosing PCOS in adolescents remains unclear. With inadequate evidence about its use for diagno sis of PCOS in adolescents, pelvic ultrasound should be used and interpreted with caution. There is a high prevalence of polycystic ovarie s in adolescents and normal reference ranges for the age group have not been developed or validated. Transabdominal approach is less specific for follicle counts and ovarian volumes may serve as a surrogate for PC OM with this technology. Subgroup considerations Obese women may have more challenges with technical visualizat ion of the ovaries. Patients who do not tolerate or find acceptable TV US may require a less reliable transabdominal approach. Implementation considerations The main barrier to implementation is the diagnostic limitation s of ultrasound and availability of equipm ent and expertise. Monitoring and evaluation \"As screening services in this populatio n have not be evaluated in the publishe d literature, an evaluation is essential. This would include detection rate, patie nt uptake of diagnostic pathway, treatment acceptance and measurement of symptom benefits\" Research priorities 15 Further methodologically rigorous trials are important to determine: 1) Natural history of PCOM in PCOS compared to non-PCOS, including in adolescents and perimenopausal women; 2) Determine the impact of PCOS treatment on PCOM; 3) Age-appropriate normal ranges for sono graphic features of polycystic ovaries and for clinical and biochemical features of PCOS in adolescents (<18 years); and 4) Accuracy of ovarian volume to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents (<18 years). 16 Background references 1.

EXTERNAL VALIDITY - IS THIS STUDY AND ITS RESULTS GENERALIZABLE TO MY SYSTEMATIC REVIEW QUESTION? Patient/population/ participants Normoandrogenic ovulatory women with a history of male factor or tubal factor infertility, who were undergoing preparations for IVF treatment; Women with PCOS with a history of anovulatory infertility and undergoing preparations for IVF. Age (y): Control = 30.9 10.8 p=0.004 N 29 normoandrogenic and 10 PCOS. Setting Academic hospital. Controls recruited between July 2001 and May 2002. PCOS recruited between May 2002 and February 2004 Index test Ovarian volume, follicle number per ovary (FNPO), plane (FSSP) Comparison/control test NA Reference standard Polycystic ovaries (PCO) Outcomes Accuracy (comparison with the reference standard test) - Accurate diagnosis of PCO. Inclusion Criteria Partial Participant characteristics reported. Exclusion Criteria No Type of question Accuracy (comparison with the reference standard test), using a retrospective cohort study design as described by the authors however a comparative control group is used therefore it is a case control. Is this study design an appropriate method to answer this question? No Does the study have a clearly focused question? Partial Does the study have specified inclusion/exclusion criteria? Partial Consider if the inclusion or exclusion of patients was clearly defined a priori. INTERNAL VALIDITY - HAS THIS STUDY BEEN CONDUCTED RIGOROUSLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE BIAS? (INCLUDING ITEMS FROM THE QUADAS2 TOOL) PAT IENWas the spectrum of patients No Studies which recruit a group of healthy controls and a group known to have the target disorder will be coded as \"no\" on this 23 representative of the patients who will receive the test in practice? item in nearly all circumstances. Studies enrolling patients with known disease and a control group without the condition may exaggerate diagnostic accuracy. Controls would not be routinely assessed for ovarian volume using ultrasound. The PCOS group is representative of those who will be assessed with these criteria in practice, however, the method of ultrasound may not be routine practice in the patient group relevant to this question. Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? (Q2) Not reported It is best if the patients are randomly selected or consecutive admissions so that selection bias is minimised. Was a casecontrol design avoided? (Q 2) No Studies enrolling patients with known disease and a control group without the condition may exaggerate diagnostic accuracy. Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? (Q2) Not reported Studies that make inappropriate exclusions, eg. excluding \"difficult to diagnose\" patients, may result in overoptimistic estimates of diagnostic accuracy. Exclusion of patients with \"red flags\" for the target condition, who may be easier to diagnose, may lead to underestimation of diagnostic accuracy. CLASSIFICATION/VERIFICATION/INCORPORATION/REVIEW BIAS Were all participants assessed with both index test and reference standard? (Also in Q2) Unclear Not clear whether all participants were assessed with the index tests or whether all participants were assessed with the reference test. Cochrane suggests that partial verification bias (also known as workup bias, (primary) selection bias, or sequential ordering bias) can occur when not all of the study patients are verified by the reference standard.

Yes INTERNAL VALIDITY - HAS THIS STUDY BEEN CONDUCTED RIGOROUSLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE BIAS? (INCLUDING ITEMS FROM THE QUADAS2 TOOL) PATIENT SELECTION/SPECTRUM BIAS Was the spectrum of patients representative of the patients who will receive the test in practice? No Studies which recruit a group of healthy controls and a group known to have the target disorder will be coded as \"no\" on this item in nearly all circumstances. Studies enrolling patients with known disease and a control group without the condition may exaggerate diagnostic accuracy. Controls would not be routinely assessed for ovarian volume using ultrasound. The PCOS group is representative of those who will be assessed with these criteria in practice, however, the method of ultrasound may not be routine practice in the patient group relevant to this question. Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? (Q2) Not reported It is best if the patients are randomly selected or consecutive admissions so that selection bias is minimised. Was a casecontrol design avoided? (Q 2) No Studies enrolling patients with known disease and a control group without the condition may exaggerate diagnostic accuracy. Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions? (Q2) Not reported Studies that make inappropriate exclusions, eg. excluding \"difficult to diagnose\" patients, may result in overoptimistic estimates of diagnostic accuracy. Exclusion of patients with \"red flags\" for the target condition, who may be easier to diagnose, may lead to underestimation of diagnostic accuracy. CLASSIFICATION/VERIFICATION/INCORP ORATION /REVIEW BIAS Were all participants assessed with both index test and reference standard? (Also in Q2) Unclear All participants were assessed with the index tests but not clear whether all participants were assessed with the reference test. Diagnostic criteria for PCOS (reference standard) were the exclusion criteria for control participants. Cochrane suggests that partial verification bias (also known as workup bias, (primary) selection bias, or sequential ordering bias) can occur when not all of the study patients are verified by the reference standard. Did all patients receive the same reference standard? (Q2) Yes Those who received the reference standard all received the same standard. Cochrane suggests that differential verification bias can occur when some patients are verified by one type of reference standard and other patients by a different standard. 50 Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? (Q2) Yes Was the reference standard independent of the index test (ie. the index test did not form part of the reference standard)? Yes Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test? (Q2) Not reported Cochrane suggests that test review bias may occur when interpretation of the results of the index test is influenced by knowledge of the results of the reference standard. This is similar to the issue of blinded outcome assessment in intervention studies. Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard test? (Q2) Not reported Cochrane suggests that diagnostic review bias may occur when interpretation of the results of the reference standard is influenced by knowledge of the results of the index test. This is similar to the issue of blinded outcome assessment in intervention studies. If a threshold was used, was it pre specified? Unclear QUADAS suggests that selecting the test threshold to optimise sensitivity and/or specificity may lead to overoptimistic estimates of test performance, which is likely to be poorer in an independent sample of patients in whom the same threshold is used. DETECTION BIAS Is the time period between tests short enough to be reasonably sure that the target condition did not change between the two tests? (Also in Q2) Not reported QUADAS suggests that if there is a delay or if treatment is started between index test and reference standard, misclassification may occur due to recovery or deterioration of the condition. 51 ATTRITI ON BIAS Were withdrawals from the study explained?

Index test Mean ovarian volume (MOV) and maximum ovarian volume (MaxOV) using transrectal ultrasound. Comparison/control Not applicable. Reference Standard Diagnosed PCOS using NIH criteria. Outcomes Sensitivity, specificity andarea under the receiver operating curve (ROC) curve (AUCR) index tests for diagnosis of PCOS. \"Regularly menstruating women were scanned between cycle 3 and 5, oligomenorrheic or amenorrheic women were scanned either at random or between days 35 after a progestin induced withdrawal bleeding. Ultrasound measurements were taken in real time, according to a standardized protocol. If the ultrasound scanning revealed an ovarian mass or dominant follicle (more than 10mm in diameter), the participant was excluded from this study. The highest possible magnification was used to examine the ovaries.

Cochrane suggests that partial verification bias (also known as work up bias, (primary) selection bias, or sequential ordering bias) can occur when not all of the study patients are verified by the reference standard. Did all patients receive the same reference standard? (Q2) Not reported Implied. Cochrane suggests that differential verification bias can occur when some patients are verified by one type of reference standard and other patients by a different standard. Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? (Q2) Yes Was the reference standard independent of No Hyperandrogenism and PCOM are criteria in diagnosis of PCOS. Cochrane suggests that incorporation of the index test in the reference standard testing is likely to increase the amount of agreement between 92 the index test (ie. the index test did not form part of the reference standard)? index test results and the reference standard thereby overestimating diagnostic accuracy. This is incorporation bias. Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test? (Q2) Not reported Cochrane suggests that test review bias may occur when interpretation of the results of the index test is influenced by knowledge of the results of the reference standard. This is similar to the issue of blinded outcome assessment in intervention studies. Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard test? (Q2) Not reported Cochrane suggests that diagnostic review bias may occur when interpretation of the results of the reference standard is influenced by knowledge of the results of the index test. This is similar to the issue of blinded outcome assessment in intervention studies. If a threshold was used, was it prespecified? Not reported QUADAS suggests that selecting the test threshold to optimise sensitivity and/or specificity may lead to overoptimistic estimates of test performance, which is likely to be poorer in an independent sample of patients in whom the same threshold is used. DETECTION BIAS Is the time period between tests short enough to be reasonably sure that the target condition did not change between the two tests? (Also in Q2) Not reported QUADAS suggests that if there is a delay or if treatment is started between index test and reference standard, misclassification may occur due to recovery or deterioration of the condition. ATTRITI ONBIASWere withdrawals X% treatment X% control/ comparison Numbers described as enrolled are the same as those in results. 93 from the study explained? REPORT BIAS Were uninterruptable/ intermediate test results reported? Yes If it is clear that all test results, including uninterpretable/ indeterminate/intermediate are reported then this item should be scored as \"yes\". If the authors do not report any uninterpretable /indeterminate /intermediate results and if results are reported for all patients who were described as having been entered into the study then this item should also be scored as \"yes\". If you think that such results occurred but have not been reported then this item should be scored as \"no\". If it is not clear whether all study results have been reported then this item should be scored as \"not reported\". OTHER ISSUES - APPLICABILITY/COMPARABILITY/VARIATION Was the execution of all tests described in sufficient detail to permit replication of the tests? Yes Were the clinicians undertaking the tests representative of the clinicians who will be undertaking the tests in the clinical setting? Not reported Consider if the clinicians undertaking the tests similarly qualified, trained and experienced as would be the clinicians likely to undertake the tests in practice. Were the same clinical data available when test results were interpreted as would be available when the test is used in practice? Not reported Cochrane suggests that where tests report an objective measurement (such as a biochemical assay) which is unaltered by external information, an unbiased estimate of test accuracy may be obtained by interpreting it in isolation from other clinical information. Were there any conflicts of interest in the writing or No 94 funding of this study? If statistical analysis was undertaken, was this appropriate? Partial Unclear: if an adequate sample size calculation was undertaken if the statistical analysis was planned a priori if the data were analysed accordingly to the study protocol. A 4 X 4 table of test performance was not presented. Diagnostic accuracy and measures of statistical uncertainty (eg. 95%CI) presented: Sensitivity and specificity PPV and NPV Likelihood ratios Area under the ROC curve Comments The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of hirsutism and oligomenorrhea (persistent menstrual cycles445 days) as screening criteria for the detection of biochemical hyperandrogenism (BH) and polycystic ovaries (PCOM) during adolescence and to determine which androgens, granulosa cell hormone, ultrasonographic parameters have the best association with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Cross sectional study with inadequate methods that may lead to overestimation of diagnostic accuracy. What is the overall risk of bias?

Prevalence and Problem Polycystic ovaries (PCO) was incorporated into the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in 2003 in the Rotterdam criteria as it was felt it was a consistent feature in women with clinical and endocrine features of PCOS.1 The definition of a PCO in this criteria is 12 or more follicles measuring between 2 and 9mm throughout the entire ovary or an ovarian volume of 10cm3 or more. This antral follicle count (AFC) was based on a single study by Jonard et al 2003 who reported a 75% sensitivity and 99% specificity for distinguishing women with PCOS compared to controls.2 This criteria has been identified as in urgent need of update as a high proportion of healthy women with regular menstrual cycles have 12 or more antral follicles. In a Danish study, up to 70% of adolescent young women had PCO.3 It is felt that this definition does not incorporate the influence of age or the effects of improved ultrasound imaging technology. The term PCO is often confusing for patients. The ovarian feature is of multiple follicles and not cysts. At this stage, however, PCOS remains the term that is widely known and used. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance A reproducible technique to reliably estimate antral follicle count in PCO is critical if it is used to diagnose PCOS. There is a significant problem of intra and inter observer variability which does not seem to be a problem in normal ovaries. In general medical sonographers are poorly trained in antral follicle assessment, the quality of ultrasound equipment is variable, patient habitus can affect image quality and different counting techniques have been described to provide the most reproducible AFC. Other features of PCO include increased ovarian size (>10cm3). This is less sensitive than the follicle number criteria, but has a role when image resolution does not allow accurate follicle count. Morphological features include hyperechoic central stroma, peripheral location of follicles, which can give a string of pearl appearance and follicles of similar size measuring 29 mm. These features are not currently incorporated into the definition of a PCO. The diagnostic threshold number of follicles to distinguish women with PCOS is in debate. Ovaries may be normal in PCOS, and conversely, polycystic ovaries may be seen in women without the syndrome. Diagnosis always requires correlation with features of hyperandrogenism and oligoanovulation. Summary of key information The most reproducible technique described to estimate AFC is a grid system reported by Lujan et al 2010.4 Using this technique to count follicle numbers per ovary 26 antral follicles has been described as a good discriminator of PCO with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 94%.5 This included women between 23 and 35 years of age so is not applicable in the adolescent years. This more than doubles the number of antral follicles in the Rotterdam definition and may miss women with mild disease. Other studies have suggested lower thresholds (for example Dewailly et al 19 follicles). Different populations and counting techniques may account for differences. Recommendations CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS Ultrasound diagnosis of PCO can aid in the diagnosis of PCOS. The method of assessing AFC and the definition of PCO needs to be addressed however: There needs to be focus and training on the importance of performing a careful and meticulous count of antral follicles per ovary. Due to the high incidence of multifollicular ovaries in adolescence there needs to be an age cut off below which ovaries are not labelled as polycystic. The AFC for PCOM needs to increase based on evidence and a rigorous discussion/ expertise of the panel, including considering associations of other PCOS features with PCOM. Ovarian volume > 10 cm3 can be a useful tool in situations where it is technically difficult to assess AFC accurately. Please see GRADE framework in 1.4a Polycystic ovarian morphology.

It has since become the most widely adopted diagnostic criteria contributing essentially to the standardization for research and clinical practice purposes. Counting of antral follicles is both operator and equipment dependent, which limits its use in some clinical settings and its comparability among centres. AMH is a polypeptide of the TGF family solely secreted by granulosa cells of the preantral and small antral ovarian follicles. A significantly higher serum level of AMH has been demonstrated in women with PCOS compared with normal ovulatory women (Cook et al, 2002; Seifer et al, 2007). It leads to the postulation that AMH could be a valuable surrogate marker in place of AFC by ultrasound in diagnosis of PCOS. Given its strong involvement in the pathophysiology of PCOS, serum AMH is a subject of special interest for clinicians involved in this field. There is considerable interest in whether it might become part of the diagnostic criteria for the condition. It may also shed light on different subtypes of this diverse condition leading to greater understanding of the disordered follicle growth. Certainly, the serum AMH concentration appears to be greatly increased in most patients with PCOS. Many authors have reported a strong correlation between plasma levels of AMH and antral follicle count (AFC) on ultrasound in PCOS patients. This has led some authors to compare the performance of one against the other for the diagnosis of PCOS. However, the results in the current literature are not homogeneous between studies, for many reasons. The diagnostic value of serum AMH concentrations has also been studied in adolescents since ultrasound is often unreliable in detecting PCOM in this population. As the AFC suffers from great controversy in the current literature, there is a great expectation that AMH assay may replace (or be an alternative for) AFC in the Rotterdam classification, but data supporting this are so far insufficient. Summary of evidence Included studies Twentynine studies were identified by our search to address diagnostic accuracy of AMH for PCOS and/or PCOM in adolescents and adults. One of these was a systematic review (Iliodromiti 2013) and included nine of the studies identified here, however it also included studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria for this evidence review and it was missing additional studies published more recently that was identified by the search; and therefore cannot be used. Four of the 28 primary studies addressed the diagnostic accuracy of AMH for PCOS and PCOM; and one for PCOM only. Of the 28 studies, six studies included adolescent participants for diagnosis of PCOS and one of these addressed PCOS and PCOM. The remaining 21 studies included adult participants for diagnosis of PCOS, where three of these addressed PCOS and PCOM with the remaining 18 studies addressed PCOS (refs - refer to table). Of the studies in adolescents, one was in overweight and obese participants (Kim 2017) and in one study, BMI was unclear (Yetim 2016). Of the studies in adults, Cassar 2014 included lean and obese participants; and Carmina 2016, Casadei 2013, Eilertsen 2012, K\u00f6ninger 2014 and Zadehmodarres 2015 included overweight and obese participants.

ROB, risk of bias; Certain, certainty of the evidence (GRADE). Methodological quality/risk of bias Due to the nature of the question of this review it is important that participants are entered into the study based on explicit selection criteria; from the same population and that entrance to the study is either random or consecutive. It is also important that studies are adequately powered to detect the specified outcome and that they include an independent, blinded comparison with a valid reference standard. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Findings of studies of moderate or high risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. Many of the studies were found to have a moderate to high risk of bias with low to very low certainty. Reasons include: selection criteria were not explicitly stated; it is unclear whether participants were entered into the study appropriately (random or consecutive); casecontrol design; inclusion of PCOM cases among controls and inadequacies around application of index and reference tests, in particular wrong choice about the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity by ROC analysis. Generalisability Studies were conducted in university departments, outpatient clinics in hospitals and laboratories in Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, Iran, Chile, USA, Turkey, Italy, Taiwan, Croatia, France, Norway, UK, Germany, Denmark, China and India. Findings Due to the heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria and/or threshold/cut off values, metaanalyses (for pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates) have not been performed.

AMH evidence review 8 CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION(S) Serum AMH levels are not effective as a single test for the diagnosis of PCOS. Serum AMH should not be applied in the detection of PCOM. Serum AMH level cannot replace the antral follicle count on pelvic scanning in diagnosis of PCOS or PCOM in adolescents and adults. Providing studies with appropriate design and use of correct indexes, local inhouse control data about serum AMH can be used to replace (or complete) AFC in the definition of PCOS and PCOM. If such data is not available locally, serum AMH should not be used to diagnose PCOS or PCOM, based on thresholds that have been established in other settings. Universal threshold for an excessive serum AMH level has to be revisited and validated worldwide in large populations of different ethnicity, with validated assays. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT This information is important and useful for diagnostic concerns as well as for phenotype/genotype analysis within genetic studies. Justification 1. Is AMH effective for diagnosis of PCOS? In adolescents, there are 5 relevant studies showing area under ROC of AMH for diagnosis of PCOS about 0.50.88. The threshold ranges from 25 to 44 pmol/L. In adults, there are 21 relevant studies showing area under ROC of AMH for diagnosis of PCOS about 0.660.994. The threshold ranges from 1057 pmol/L. Although serum AMH levels in adolescent and adult PCOS women are significantly higher than those of nonPCOS counterparts in all studies, there are overlaps between them. The threshold of AMH making a diagnosis of PCOS has a wide range for practical use. The variations among studies may be related to the AMH assays used, the population and the phenotype of women studied. 2. Is AMH effective for diagnosis of PCOM? In adolescents, there is only one relevant study showing area under ROC of AMH for diagnosis of PCOM about 0.87. The threshold is 50 pmol/L. In adults, there are five relevant studies showing area under ROC of AMH for diagnosis of PCOM about 0.670.92. The threshold ranges from 2030 pmol/L. Although serum AMH levels in adolescent and adult PCOM women are significantly higher than those of nonPCOM counterparts in all studies, there are overlaps between them. The threshold of AMH making a diagnosis of PCOM has a wide range for practical use. AMH evidence review 9 The results from the current literature are not homogeneous. Part of this heterogeneity is due to the lack of welldefined populations. In particular, some authors have used the PCOS definition established in 2003 at the Rotterdam conference , using 12 follicles of 29mm diameter per ovary for the polycystic ovaries morphology (PCOM). This cut off is highly dependent on ultrasound equipment and operator skill. Therefore, with the latest ultrasound generation, the threshold has evolved and is now up to 19 or 25. This threshold will probably continue to increase as newer ultrasound technologies and equipment are developed. Additionally, there are critical issues regarding what populations are included or excluded in the normative population. In particular, the inclusion of controls with PCOM is questioning. These women are not defined as having PCOS according to the Rotterdam classification, but when it comes to defining a threshold for PCOM, they cannot be used as controls. This leads to an overlap of the AFC and AMH values between the control and the PCOS groups, which undermines the quality of the ROC analysis and forces to place the threshold relatively high to minimize this overlap. In addition, there are technical issues regarding the serum AMH leading to further heterogeneity of the results in the literature. About half of the studies were performed using either the DSL or IOT assays, for which concordance in the values is problematic, and these assays are not marketed anymore. More recent studies using the Gen II kit should also be interpreted with caution. There is so far very little data with the new automated assays (Pigny et al., 2016). Lastly, the AMH assay should not be proposed as a diagnostic test for PCOS. It can be used in place of follicular counting and an excessive level can be considered as a surrogate for PCOM, which is one of three items in the Rotterdam classification and cannot by itself define PCOS.

Subgroup considerations Age, obesity and ethnicity. Implementation considerations See general guideline implementation recs. Monitoring and evaluation Monitor the use of AMH in the use of diagnosis of PCOS and detection of PCOM. Research priorities The inclusion of controls with PCOM should be avoided (see ab ove). This requires particular statistical approach (cluster analysis). Serum AMH level has to be revisited and validated worldwide in large populations of different ethnicity. Age- stratified thresholds have to be defined. AMH evidence review 15 Appendix I: Methods EVIDENCE REVIEW: Is AMH effective to diagnosis of PCOS?

Clinical presentations and issues Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was originally described in Caucasians and subsequently has shown to be prevalent across the world. There have been many descriptions of the presentations and the response to treatment among different ethnic groups. However, there have been very few descriptions of differences in PCOS presentation and prevalence between different ethnic groups except in the same country. These are often flawed based on a failure to take into consideration modifying factors. For instance several descriptions from the United States, comparing people of Caucasian origin with those of African American and immigrant Asian background do not take into consideration differences in diet, lifestyle and occupation. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance Health personnel see patients of different ethnic backgrounds and try and apply the same diagnostic principles to the diagnosis of PCOS. It is important to provide guidance to them and patients on potential differences to consider between groups. Summary of key diagnostic features between ethnic and geographic origins: 1. Ovulation There is little evidence that this varies across different groups. 2. Testosterone measurements - Most studies from Asia, Europe and North America show similar levels of testosterone in the blood of subjects with PCOS. 3. Ultrasound features - Data on this aspect are compromised by the differences of ultrasound probes used, diagnostic features and skill and consistency of the operator. However there is little evidence to suggest a difference in ultrasound features between ethnic groups. 4. Skin manifestations - As part of the hyperandrogenism definition, hirsutism is taken into consideration and there are clear differences between ethnic groups, with women from Middle Eastern and South Asian origin having far greater hirsutism that for example, those of Eastern Asian origin. In the latter group acne seams to be more common. 5. Metabolic features - There are clear differences in body mass index between different ethnic groups but this is probably not genetic and is more dependent on lifestyle and environmental factors. Body mass index (BMI) in parts of North America are enormous compared to some parts of Europe and East Asia. There is therefore a concomitant increase in insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and lipid profiles but much of this is probably dependent on BMI rather than ethnic factors. Summary of other features in PCOS 1. Genetic data - The original genetic data came from China and several elements of this genotype were confirmed in genome wide studies from North America and Europe. Additional genes were identified in these populations and there is now some variation between the Asian and the Caucasian databases, but this is commonly found when genome wide scans are done even within the same population. At the moment there is no clear evidence for genetic difference in the origins of PCOS compared to those between different ethnic populations. 2. Psychological response to PCOS - This is impossible to determine between ethnic groups, largely because of societies and support mechanisms that exist in different communities. It is clear that in groups where there is a strong family presence and support, that the psychological impact is less than those that are more isolated and under pressure as an individual to have a child. Substantial research needs to be done in this area to see how different ethnic groups respond to the psychological impact of knowing they have PCOS. 3. Response to treatment - There have been a number of studies that suggest that response to IVF treatment is less successful in women with an Asian background but there is no similar data for ovulation induction. This is an area that continues to need exploration. 4. Prevalence - The highest prevalence has been reported among Australian aboriginal women and South Asians migrating to developed countries with a high incidence of excessive BMI Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION Health professionals should consider the ethnic variations in presentation and manifestation of patients with PCOS. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT Health professionals should be aware that the prevalence and presentation of PCOS varies across ethnic groups, including differences in skin manifestations (e.g. hirsutism and acanthosis nigricans) and metabolic sequelae (e.g. obesity and insulin resistance). RESEARCH RECS Research should be intensified looking at the differences between ethnic groups in terms of clinical and metabolic presentations of PCOS as well as psychological and treatment effects Need to capture more diverse populations, particularly from the African and South American continents.

Prevalence and problem The diagnosis of PCOS by the 2003 Rotterdam Criteria with two out of three criteria of oligo and/or anovulation, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries by ultrasound is well established in PCOS. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance However, these three criteria for diagnosis are altered with aging hence the aging and postmenopausal phenotypes of PCOS are poorly defined. Diagnostic criteria for PCOS after menopause is important for individual patient management as well as to guide research investigating longterm outcomes in PCOS. Summary of key information With aging, changes occur in all three PCOS diagnostic criteria. Menstrual cycles become more regular with aging in women with PCOS (Brown et al., 2011; Elting et al., 2000; Vulpoi et al., 2007). Ovarian volume and follicle number decrease longitudinally in PCOS and control women. Using cross sectional data, ovarian volume and follicle number decrease in both groups, but the decrease in ovarian volume is less pronounced in women with PCOS than in controls. Agebased criteria to define polycystic ovarian morphology have been proposed using a combination of age, log ovarian volume, follicle number, and testosterone to distinguish PCOS subjects from those without PCOS (Alsamarai et al., 2009). Aging women with PCOS and regular cycles have a lower follicle count than those with irregular cycles (Elting et al., 2003). Androgen levels in women with PCOS decrease with age toward menopause (Liang et al., 2011; Winters et al., 2000) including DHEAS (Carmina et al., 2012) and in longitudinal and crosssectional studies using LCMS (Pinola et al., 2015). Testosterone levels, FAI, and calculated free testosterone are significantly higher in women with PCOS aged 18-44 years compared to women without PCOS (Pinola et al., 2015). The average age of menopause in PCOS is not known. A twoyear delay in the age of menopause has been estimated using AMH levels in PCOS compared to nonPCOS women (Tehrani et al., 2010). Women with PCOS have been independently associated with later menopause, when compared to women with no history of PCOS(Li et al., 2016). There is no established phenotype for PCOS after menopause. In postmenopausal women, menses ceases so anovulation cannot be used as a diagnostic criterion. There have been conflicting results for postmenopausal PCO. A study using a definition of PCO as defined by eight or more follicles of 2-8mm and an increase in ovarian stroma suggested PCO are present in postmenopausal women (Birdsall & Farquhar, 1996). However, pathology demonstrates absence of secondary follicles in postmenopausal ovaries (Richardson et al., 1987). In PCOS, a small study using direct comparison between ultrasound and pathology found that hypoechoic structures on ultrasound in postmenopausal women with PCOS corresponded to inclusion cysts and vascular structures rather than follicles (Alsamarai et al., 2009). Postmenopausal women with PCOS report more hirsutism than controls (Schmidt, Brannstrom, et al., 2011) but little is known about acne and alopecia in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women with PCOS have higher 17hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, DHEAS, total T, FAI and lower SHBG baseline levels than women without PCOS (Markopoulos et al., 2011; Schmidt, Brannstrom, et al., 2011). In one study, only DHEAS and androstenedione remained higher in women aged more than 50 with PCOS compared to women without PCOS after adjustment for BMI. As previously mentioned, androgen levels decreased with age but they have been noted to increase after age 50 in women with PCOS (Pinola et al., 2015). However, androgen assays are unreliable in women with poor precision with all assays at low testosterone levels (Legro et al., 2010). Postmenopausal women with PCOS have been shown to have persistence of abnormal glucose metabolism (Puurunen et al., 2011) and higher triglycerides than controls (Schmidt, LandinWilhelmsen, et al., 2011). Other methods to identify PCOS in postmenopausal women have been proposed. For PCOS diagnosis in menopause some studies have relied on a previous history of oligoovulation, the presence of PCO and current features of hyperandrogenism: hyperandrogenemia or hirsutism (Krentz et al., 2007), the top quartile of androgens to define hyperandrogenaemia (Merz et al., 2016) or inclusion of insulin resistance (Gabrielli et al., 2015) . Previous Guidelines have suggested that in the absence of diagnostic criteria for PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal women, a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS can be based upon a welldocumented longterm history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. The presence of PCO morphology on ultrasound would provide additional supportive evidence, although this is less likely in a menopausal woman (Legro et al., 2013). Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION A postmenopausal phenotype of PCOS is likely characterized by continuing evidence of hyperandrogenism. If the patient has been diagnosed previously with PCOS, the patient should be considered to still have PCOS. If the patient has a previous history of oligomenorrhoea and hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM in the reproductive years, she could be considered to have PCOS. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT Postmenopausal women presenting with newonset or worsening hirsutism, or other symptoms of severe hyperandrogenism, should be investigated to rule out androgen secreting tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis. Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement 4 Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to narrative review. Panel discussion Development of standardised classification criteria for postmenopausal PCOS is an important step in ensuring consistent inclusion and exclusion of patients in future studies (in this relatively understudied group) A presumed diagnosis of postmenopausal PCOS may be of benefit to individual patients so management can be tailored to treat symptoms with a known aetiology and assessment of known long-term consequences can be performed (although the efficacy of treatment in these patients has not been established in this population) Providing clarity on post-menopausal PCOS phenotype and persistence of PCOS post-menopause. Undesirable effects How substantial are the unde sirable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion Undesirable effects are unclear. May miss new diagnosis of PCOS (but unlikely to develop new-onset PCOS postmenopause) Reliance on history may overestimate the presence of oligo/amenorrhoea, but some causes such as thyroid or prolactin abnormalities can be checked and detailed history of excessive exercise, stress, diet, weight change, medications, systemic illness, history of uterine inst rumentation and menopausal symptoms can be taken to minimise this risk Labelling of patients with a diagnosis may have adverse consequences (psychological etc) Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was conducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Postmenopausal patients diagnosed with PCOS may value opportunity to have treatment tailored to symptoms and assessment of long-term consequences Researchers may value greater clarity of diagnosis of PCOS in postmenopausal women.

CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendations A post-menopausal phenotype of PCOS is likely charact erized by continuing evid ence of hyperandrogenism. If the patient has been diagnosed previously with PCOS , the patient should be cons idered to still have PCOS. If the patient has a previous history of oligomenorrhoea and hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM in the reproductive years, she could be considered to have PCOS. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice point Postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset or worsening hirsutism, or other symptoms of severe hyperandrogenism, should be investig ated to rule out andr ogen-secreting tumors an d ovarian hyperthecosis. Subgroup considerations Awareness of differential expression of hyperandrogenism (clinical or bioche mical) in different ethnic groups. Asian women are less likely to manifest hirsutism re sulting from androgen excess (a Ferriman-Gallwey score (>2) is considered to be abnormal in Asian women). When recruiting or diagnosing me nopausal women with PCOS in Asia n populations there may be under- diagnosis - history of or current clinical hirsutism n eeds to be carefully assessed in the Asian population. Implementation considerations Education of family physicians and gynaecologists as to timing of diagnosis and normal physiologic processes. Monitoring and evaluation Ongoing review of the classification criteria is required by future Guideline Development Groups- new evidence may lead to changes in the criteria Research priorities Long-term cohort studies are needed to esta blish a postmenopausal phenotype of PCOS.

There is an increased prevalence in metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS [1, 2]. They also have abnormal traditional (hyperinsulinaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension) CVD risk factors. Dyslipidaemia in PCOS occurs in the setting of abnormal lipid metabolism which may be due to a combination of overproduction of triglyceride rich lipoproteins and increased catabolism of high density lipoprotein particles [3, 4]. These abnormalities are thought to be a consequence of a global metabolic effect of IR and an excess of both visceral and hepatic fat [3]. Lifestyle interventions improve dyslipidaemia [3]. In women with PCOS, other novel CVD risk (Creactive protein [hsCRP], endothelial dysfunction and impaired fibrinolysis) [512] and early onset cardiovascular dysfunction (endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, plaques and coronary artery calcification) [79], have been noted and are related to IR and obesity [1315]. High androgens and low SHBG have also been linked to increased CVD risk in both pre and postmenopausal women [16]. Studies to date suggest that women with PCOS have subclinical evidence of premature CVD [11, 17, 18]. Two large epidemiological studies have reported increased prevalence of CVD among women with anovulation [19, 20], but initial long term studies have not shown an increase in cardiovascular events or cardiovascular mortality with PCOS [11, 21, 22]. These studies have been limited in their methodology and we lack large prospective studies. As CVD is the biggest killer of women and ~80% is preventable, the public health impact of early identification and targeted prevention in high risk, young, reproductive age women with PCOS is likely to be very significant [2326], however the best method for assessing cardiovascular risk in women with PCOS remains unclear. Summary of evidence - Question 1: Are women with PCOS at increased risk for CVD? Included studies Two systematic reviews [27, 28] and eight observational studies [11, 22, 2934] were identified by the search to address risk of CVD in women with PCOS. Seven of the observational studies were addressed across the two systematic reviews, however the systematic reviews included studies in the analysis that do not meet the PICO for this evidence review, therefore the data from the systematic reviews cannot be used here. The risk of bias/methodological quality assessments from the systematic reviews will be used. Studies were retrospective (six) and prospective cohort (one) studies reporting CVDrelated event rates in women with and without PCOS over time. The highly rigorous search strategy did not identify any studies to address the most effective tool to assess CVD risk in women with PCOS.

It is also important that studies are adequately powered to detect the specified outcome. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Findings of studies of moderate or high risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. Three studies were found to have a high risk of bias, three were found to have a moderate risk of bias, and one had a low risk of bias. Reasons include: ..... Generalisability The populations studied are generalisable to the target population for this evidence review. Studies were conducted in university departments, outpatient clinics in hospitals and university hospitals in USA, Sweden, Norway, Czech Republic and UK. CVD risk 4 Findings - Question 1 Metaanalysis was conducted for outcomes with two or more studies. There was no statistical difference between PCOS and nonPCOS groups in terms of myocardial infarction (3 studies, 1633 3012 participants, CVDrelated (2 studies, 779 participants, I2 0%); coronary artery/heart disease (2 studies, 2152 participants, I2 80%). One study each addressed angina (no difference), large vessel disease (p value not reported), coronary artery calcification (p value not reported). One study presented odds ratios and suggest that when a group of women with PCOS are compared to a UKwide population, the risk of myocardial infarction (but not angina) was increased in women with PCOS over 45 years (stratified into 1544, 4554, 5564 and >65). When they compared the same women with PCOS to a local community population, the risk of myocardial infarction and angina was increased in women with PCOS. However, when all age groups were combined, there was no difference in risk between women with and without PCOS, for neither myocardial infarction nor angina, regardless of where the control population was sourced. Given the methodological and reporting limitations and small sample sizes of these observational studies, all findings should be interpreted with caution.

CVD risk 6 Odds ratios of CVD EVENTS in across age groups in Mani 2013 [33] Narrative review - Question 2: In women with PCOS, what is the most effective tool/method to assess risk of CVD? Prevalence and problem Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in premenopausal women affecting up to 10% of women in this age group. Some of the cardinal manifestations of PCOS include hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries in its complete phenotype. Available evidence suggests that the presence of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and androgen excess appears to predispose women with PCOS to a high risk of cardiovascular events in later life. Specifically, women with PCOS have deranged lipid profile with higher triglyceride levels, low density lipoprotein (LDL), nonhigh density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower HDL compared with women who do not have PCOS. Further, they also present with endothelial dysfunction and early signs of atherosclerosis including increased carotid intima media thickness and increased coronary calcium, which appears to be related to insulin resistance and obesity. This evidence, along with the high diabetes risk in women with PCOS, suggests that CVD risk is relatively high in this group. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance CVD risk 7 Data from two large epidemiological studies has highlighted an increased risk of CVD among women with PCOS. However longterm studies in this area have not been able to arrive at the same conclusion. If the focus shifts to post menopausal women, Shaw and colleagues reported data from the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation study, which clearly showed clinical correlation between PCOS features and CV events. Globally, CVD remains the leading cause of death in women. Hence, early identification and targeted prevention in high risk, young, reproductive age women with PCOS has significant implications for healthcare systems. However, the lack of evidencebased studies makes it very difficult to identify the best method to assess CV risk in this population. Justification for recommendations The difficulty in deciding the most effective tool/method to assess CVD risk is that there are no conclusive data on clinical outcome (ie cardiovascular events) against which to judge the utility of surrogate indices. Women with PCOS clearly have an adverse metabolic profile with well described increased risk of dyslipdaemia, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes [13] but although clearly related to higher risk of cardiovascular events in the general population, these are indirect indices and we do not know how they relate to long term outcome in women with PCOS. The value of these biochemical indices is further compromised by the confounding effect of overweight or obesity. Indeed, there remains controversy about whether lipid abnormalities, or even T2DM [4, 35, 36], are more prevalent in lean PCOS women than in the general population. It is logical to surmise that direct assessment of cardiovascular function is a better guide to the risk of cardiovascular events than biochemical risk markers. In the general population, measurement of endothelial function, for example by flowmediated dilatation or arterial stiffness are considered reliable predictors of cardiovascular events as evidenced by long term follow up. But, again, there are no such data specifically in women with PCOS and the confounding effect of obesity remains an issue when interpreting these data [39]. In the absence of direct evidence for assessing the predictive value of surrogate markers of cardiovascular events, it seems reasonable to propose that those which more directly assess vascular function (such as FMD and IMT which have proven utility in epidemiological studies in the general population) should be favoured but only longitudinal studies in women with PCOS can provide definitive answers. Despite the lack of clear evidence that women with PCOS are at increased risk of cardiovascular events, it is important to consider the available data for risk factors, including clinical, biochemical and vascular indices. Despite the lack of evidence, it is not safe to assume that PCOS women are not at risk, particularly as true assessment of that risk necessarily awaits the outcome of longitudinal studies well into the postmenopausal years. The lack of highquality PCOSspecific evidence to answer the clinical question regarding the best tool to assess CVD risk in women with PCOS means that the recommendations are necessarily based on clinical expertise and experience. In accordance with the ESHRE/ASRM Guideline recommendations regarding longterm health consequences of PCOS (2010) it is advised that: justification If screening in women with polycystic ovary syndrome shows that any of the following cardiovascular disease risk factors are present, these women with polycystic ovary syndrome should be considered at increased relative risk of cardiovascular disease (obesity, waist circumference >88 cm, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, lack of physical activity) and those with metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes, at even greater risk.

Panel discussion Screening for cardiovascular risk markers could cause unn ecessary anxiety (and unnecessary interventions), particularly in the absence of reliable predictors of car diovascular disease risk in women with PCOS. The dissenter was concerned about unecessary anxiety around CVD disease in women with PCOS. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certainty of the evidence of effects? Judgement No included studies Very low Low Moderate High Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. CVD risk 9 Panel discussion Low to very low certainty evidence. Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variabil ity in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was conducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Effective screening leading to CVD prevention or attenuation of risk would be of high value. Value is uncertain because the CVD risk is uncertain. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and undesira ble effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion Assessment of risk using, simple well recognised factors in cluding BMI, waist circumference, BP, glucose & HbA1c and lipid profile is desirable and prompt intervention to reduce ri sk of CVD is logical even though we lack longitudinal data for validation.

Judgement Don't know Varies 2 Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion The resources needed for the recommended clinical and bioche mical screening are modest and can be considered part of routine management. Moderate in countries with existing regul ar screening. Large cost in countries where not routine (Scandinavia). However, in high risk ethnic groups, this would not vary from standard care and therefore would not increase costs. CVD risk 10 Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option 5 Probably favours this option 7 Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion There is no evidence on cost effectiv eness of any intervention in PCOS. Equity What would be the impact on health equity? Judgement Don't know Varies Reduced Probably reduced 1 Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Unfortunately, obesity, a major risk factor for T2DM and CVD in women with or without PCOS (but especially in PCOS) is more prevalent in women in the lower strata of socio-economic class and in different ethnic groups. Acceptability Is the option acceptabl e to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know 4 Varies No Probably No 8 Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Probably acceptable to key stakeholders, however the baseline investigations differ by country. Feasibility Is the option feasible to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No 1 Probably Yes Yes Research evidence CVD risk 11 Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Yes, for simple clinical and biochemical screening. CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendations All women with polycystic ovary syndrome should be asse ssed for individual cardiovascular risk factors. If screening in women with polycystic ovary syndrome shows th at any cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. obesity, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, lack of physical activity) are present, they should be considered at increased relative risk of cardiovascular disease. All women with polycystic ovary syndrome shoul d be assessed for excess weight at every visit. In assessing women with polycystic ovary syndrome < 18 years, age appropriate and gender appropriate body mass index should be calculated at every visit. All women with polycystic ovary syndrome should be assessed for cigarette smoking. All women with PCOS, regardless of age, should have a lip id profile (Total cholesterol, Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Triglycerides) at diagnosis. Thereafter, frequency of measurement of a lipid profile should be based on the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors. It is recommended that blood pressure be measured annuall y in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and more frequently in women with cardiovascular risk factors. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison 4 Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice point When determining frequency of cardiovascular risk asse ssment consideration should be given to the significant differences in CVD risk across ethnicities. Justification For dissent for conditional: Country, health system and ethnic differences. Subgroup considerations At risk groups have been defined above. Women with obesity and/or WC >88cm are most at risk. In women of South Asian origin, risk of CVD is increased at lower BMI and those with BMI >25 kg/m2 should be considered at increased risk. Socioeconomic status. Implementation considerations These are procedures that are generally widely accepted. Monitoring and evaluation CVD risk 12 Important to evaluate utility and e fficacy of screening and interventions. Research priorities A clear need for good longitudinal studi es to assess CVD events and their correlat es. Important to evaluate utility and efficacy of screening and interventions.

Patient/population/ participants Women with PCOS and women with Screened Enrolled Allocated/randomised: PCOS= 64, controls= 776 Assessed (at year 20 examination): PCOS= 55, controls= 668 Followed up Setting USA Intervention/indicator N/A Comparison/control N/A Outcomes CAC Inclusion Criteria Yes PCOS based on having both oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism. \"Oligomenorrhea was defined as irregular menstrual cycles at age 2030, as reported by women at the year 16 exam. Hyperandrogenism was defined as either hirsutism or increased levels of serum testosterone. Hirsutism was considered present if a woman reported having excess unwanted hair at age 2030. Free and total testosterone measures were assessed using stored samples from CARDIA Year 2 (ages 2034) by the OB/GYN Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. Total testosterone was measured using a competitive immunoassay (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) using direct chemiluminescent technology on the Beckman Access Automated System. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was determined using equilibrium dialysis, and free testosterone was calculated on the basis of measured total testosterone and SHBG [3]. Abnormal testosterone levels were defined as total testosterone of >80ng/dL or free testosterone of >0.75ng/dL, which corresponds with the 95th percentile, among women who were not pregnant and did not use oral contraceptives at the year 2 exam. Measurements of testosterone were available for 83% of the study population, however for the current analysis we considered measurements available only for 55.3% of the women who were not pregnant or did not use oral contraceptives at the time of year 2 examination\".

During the period in which most of these patients presented, it was not the clinical policy of the department to perform routine ovarian ultrasound when the diagnosis of PCOS was clear on clinical and biochemical grounds. Based on this enhanced data set, subgroup analysis was performed for those with evidence for definite PCOS (two or more Rotterdam criteria17 (which given lack of ultrasound data in most cases represented the two main NIH criteria for PCOS)' Exclusion Criteria Yes Patients with Cushing's syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia were excluded Does the study have a clearly focused question and/or PICO?

Yes If there were specified inclusion/ exclusion criteria, were these appropriate? Yes 'Presenting symptoms such as hirsutism, infertility or menstrual irregularity were typically recorded, but the precise diagnostic criteria leading to the diagnosis were not systematically recorded prospectively. The consensus diagnostic criteria for PCOS also changed over the same time period. We therefore accepted the recorded diagnosis of PCOS in our database as evidence that an appropriate diagnosis of PCOS had been made in this patient based on prevailing clinical criteria at the time. Diagnostic criteria for PCOS were however reviewed in the available clinic letters and updated in the analysis database. As data were all recorded in the database as a part of routine clinical practice and as a clinical diagnosis of PCOS had been applied to the patient in the endocrinology clinic where patients were consistently reviewed by a senior endocrinologist, we considered that in patients where no symptoms were recorded, this was most likely evidence of failure to record relevant clinical findings rather than evidence of absence of these finding' Were the outcomes measured appropriate?

No evidence identified in evidence review 2) Are women with PCOS at increased risk for impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus? Evidence not sought Prevalence and problem Insulin resistance is present in 75% of lean and 95% of obese women with PCOS (Stepto et al 2013). Obesity is closely associated with insulin resistance. The event rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) was four times higher in women with PCOS compared to controls in a Danish register study and T2D was diagnosed four years earlier in PCOS (Rubin 2017). The prevalence of T2D differs by ethnicity (Kakoly 2017) and is higher in obese BG, 2h BG, HOMAr, triglycerides, age, and BMI at baseline were the best predictors for development of T2D (Rubin 2017). When models were corrected for age and BMI, fasting BG, 2h BG, and triglycerides were the best predictors of development of T2D (Rubin 2017). Clinical practice gap: need for guidance We need more data on methods for assessing risk of T2D, especially the role of 2h glucose during OGTT and HbA1c. The recommendation of OGTT in newly diagnosed PCOS varies between different guidelines, recently reviewed by Pelanis et al (Pelanis 2017). Some guidelines recommend mandatory OGTT for all women with the PCOS whereas others include BMI, previous gestational diabetes or a family history of T2D in the decision model before the recommendation of OGTT (Rotterdam ESHRE /ASRMSponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group 2004). It is still debated whether risk of prediabetes and T2D is increased due to PCOS per se, or if obesity is the main risk factor (Ollila 2017). Increasing age is associated with loss of beta cell function and age >40 years has been chosen as a separate risk factor for T2D in several guidelines (Pelanis 2017). Ollila et al (Ollila 2017) reported, previously, that none of 62 lean women with selfreported PCOS developed T2D by 46 yearsofage and the results suggested that OGTT screening should be targeted to overweight and obese women with PCOS. Recently, Pelanis et al (Pelanis 2017) have published data on a Nordic cohort, where no Nordic woman was diagnosed with T2D using OGTT if the BMI was normal (< 25 kg/m2).The role of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in women with PCOS needs to be clarified. The clinical utility of HbA1c for diagnosing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes in PCOS in daily practice is low. Longterm prospective studies are needed to determine whether HbA1c may be a good predictor for cardiovascular risk in patients with PCOS (Velling 2011). Summary of key information There is currently no clinical study in PCOS, which can help us to clarify which tool(s) most effectively assess risk of T2D in different ethnic groups. An OGTT may not be indicated in normal weight women (women in low risk ethnic groups) with PCOS (Ollila 2017). However, future prospective studies in different ethnic groups are warranted (Kakoly 2017). Importantly, the incidence and absolute DM2 risk needs to be understood in PCOS, across the age and BMI range. Given hyperglycaemia in the IGT range causes morbidity in pregnancy, an OGTT before and during pregnancy is important. Fasting, 1 hour and 2 hour glucose levels are independantly associated with adverse outcomes in the general population in pregnancy, hence an OGTT is recommended. Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS Health professionals should be aware that the prevalence of IGT and T2D are significantly increased in PCOS (5 fold in Asia, 4 fold in the Americas and 3 fold in Europe) and is independently worsened by obesity. Health professionals should be aware that the prevalence of GDM is also significantly increased in PCOS. Glycemic status should be assessed in all women with PCOS at baseline and reassessed every one to three years, based on risk. In high risk women with PCOS at baseline, an OGTT should be performed (BMI >25, BMI in Asian >23, family history of diabetes or high risk ethnicity). In other women with PCOS, FPG or HbA1c may be substituted for an OGTT. All women with PCOS planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment should have an OGTT.

Judgement Favours this option 2 Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to evidence review. Panel discussion The effects/benefits are probably quite substantial in high risk population.

CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendation Health professionals should be aware that the prevalence of IGT and T2D are significantly increased in PCOS (5 fold in Asia, 4 fold in the Americas and 3 fold in Europe) and is independently worsened by obesity. Health professionals should be aware that the prevalence of GDM is also significantly increase in PCOS. Glycemic status should be assessed in all women with PCOS at baseline and reassessed every one to three years, based on risk. In high risk women with PCOS, an OGTT should be perform ed at baseline (e.g. BMI >25, BMI in Asian >23, family history of diabetes, GDM, hypertension or high risk ethnicity). In other women with PCOS, FPG or HbA1c may be substituted for an OGTT. All women with PCOS planning pregnancy or s eeking fertility treatment should have an OGTT. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison 4 Conditional recommendation for the option 8 Strong recommendation for the option Justification Reason for difference in group judgment - data may not be sufficient for FPG and HbA1c in detecting IGT and T2D in PCOS (including in lean women). (2 person) Risk is that you will do too many OGTTs compar ed to benefit in all populations (2 people) Subgroup considerations Indeed, there will be differences according to ethnicity. Implementation considerations Outreach (social media etc), local invo lvement, patient organisa tions. Governments, local politicians, doctors nurses etc. Responsibility: Key persons will be depending on country and health structure. Monitoring and evaluation Yes, if possible incidence and development of DM. Research priorities Issues about glucose metabolism and ethnicity.

Prevalence and problem Obstructive sleep apnoea is a condition characterised by repetitive occlusions of the upper airway during sleep leading to futile ventilatory efforts, oxygen desaturations, terminating in arousal from sleep and the resumption of ventilation. This condition may lead to sleep fragmentation, unrefreshed sleep and daytime sleepiness. The postulated longer term health consequences of these repeated sleep related physiological derangements have drawn links to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cognitive decline and dementia. However these associations are yet to be causally demonstrated through rigorous controlled trials. The prevalence of OSA among general western adult populations based on polysomnographic criteria of an apnoea hypopnoea index of 5 or more respiratory events per hour varies across cohorts between 9 and 38% (1). More than half of these will be minimally symptomatic. The prevalence is higher in men, increases with greater body mass index and advancing age. The diagnostic cut off is an arbitrary point along a continuum which evolved from historic rather than evidenced based criteria and is further affected by varied definitional and measurement based factors. Unlike conditions such as hypertension and diabetes where clinical sequelae are measurable at a particular cut off point that inform treatment decisions, there is no established cut off point at which OSA warrants treatment. In the absence of such guiding parameters the treatment process describes a personalised care plan that factors in symptomatology and disruptive impact of associated snoring. Although not well quantified, the potential long term health sequelae still remain an important consideration in the treatment decision and treatment is usually offered routinely to severe cases (2). Addressing the public health implications of OSA are challenged by the magnitude of its prevalence, the complexity of the diagnostic process as well as the suboptimal effectiveness of device based treatments such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Summary of key information Randomised controlled intervention studies demonstrate benefits of treatment on symptoms, quality of life, mood and productivity (3). There are important observational trials demonstrating an association with the severe spectrum of obstructive sleep apnoea and adverse cardiovascular outcomes and death (4). Intervention trials have shown that treating OSA may lead to favourable outcomes in some surrogate endpoints such has blood pressure (5), however the effect overall is modest at 13mmHg, with a greater effect for more severe OSA and preexisting hypertension. The relationship between OSA and diabetes and insulin resistance has shown mixed results across observational trials and smaller intervention studies (6) (7) (8) (9). A more recent larger randomised controlled trial of the use of CPAP for moderate to severe OSA and coexistent diabetes failed to demonstrate improvements in measures of glycemic control (10). Three randomised controlled trials exploring the treatment effect of obstructive sleep apnoea as secondary prevention for cardiovascular events and/or death have failed to demonstrate a benefit of CPAP treatment on these endpoints (3) (11) (12). The largest of these, the SAVE trial (3), enrolled 2717 subjects with moderate to severe OSA. Whilst they demonstrated treatment improvements in quality of life, mood and work related productivity, the lack of effect on the primary endpoint of cardiovascular events or death was unexpected. These studies conclude there is insufficient evidence to support a case for screening for OSA among patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease intending to modify the consequences of these conditions. A recent systematic review of OSA screening provides evidence of value in identification of symptomatic OSA among populations where OSA may be overrepresented in which OSA symptoms may be alleviated (13). Large trials of general populations with OSA may provide some guidance in identifying the goals for care for managing OSA among subgroup populations such as PCOS. Several studies demonstrate that patients with PCOS are associated with high rates of OSA, between 11 and 72 percent (14) (15) (16) (17). Not all these trials included control groups (16) however in the studies that used matched controls (14) or statistical correction for mismatches samples (14), the high prevalence of OSA was not explained by obesity. The explanation for this high prevalence is not known. There is evidence that the relative androgenised state may contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA (18). Another unproven possibility is that if OSA were to directly contribute to the metabolic syndrome (19) it might explain a statistical overrepresentation of this condition among a PCOS patient cohort where features of the metabolic syndrome may facilitate their clinical presentation. Tasali et el showed a relationship between OSA severity and measures of insulin resistance among a small group of women with PCOS (20) and the same group in another study showed small improvements in insulin resistance in an uncontrolled group of 9 subjects with PCOS and OSA with CPAP treatment over an 8 week period (19). Studies exploring the links between PCOS and OSA have tended to include small numbers and are of varied quality trial design. Nonetheless some groups have advocated for screening of OSA among PCOS populations (21). Patients with PCOS may have features of the metabolic syndrome that expose them to increased cardiovascular diabetes and other health risks. However the extent to which OSA contributes additionally to this risk is not yet supported by robust clinical trials in this area. There are a number of screening questionnaires that are validated for general populations including the STOP BANG (22), OSA50 (23) or Berlin Questionnaire (Appendix 1). Although these all make some limited enquiry into symptomatology they tend to focus on BMI and snoring/apnoea detection for predictive power. Therefore these questionnaires are designed to predict for the presence of OSA and do not necessarily inform the case for treatment. Questionnaires are simple to complete and inexpensive to administer. They can be a very useful rule out tool, as the approach to managing a very large proportion of positive screening questionnaires that go onto ambulatory or inlaboratory polysomnography for confirmation, is not well described in a PCOS population. Additional screening for a symptomatic subset reduces this burden and directs treatment to those demonstrated to obtain benefit. This is best achieved through history taking (2). Alternatively the functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire (FOSQ) is a 30 item questionnaire focusing of symptoms of sleep disturbance that is potentially applicable for clinicians not proficient in taking a sleep apnoea symptom history (24). The most compelling case for treating OSA relates to the improving symptoms of nonrestorative sleep, daytime fatigue and sleepiness. These symptoms may contribute to mood disturbance, especially anxiety and depression. PCOS is a condition in which mood disturbance is common. The extent to which coexistent OSA may additional contribute to mood disturbance attributed to PCOS may be an important area for future exploration. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support a case for screening for OSA among women with PCOS with the intention of improving features of the metabolic syndrome, measures of diabetic control or longer term cardiovascular health. However the limited evidence does indicate that a higher prevalence of OSA may exist in PCOS and the potential for symptom benefit to be achieved through identification and effective therapy of OSA is likely to be worthwhile but not currently described in a cohort of PCOS. Therefore it would seem that questionnaire based screening for OSA may be an appropriate strategy when combined with a thorough sleep apnoea history to establish if a sufficient symptom profile exists to explore the more resource intensive process of polysomnographic evaluation and therapy trial. There is no OSA screening questionnaire validated for young women with and without PCOS. The Berlin questionnaire may be the preferred choice as it does not include gender or age criteria in the prediction (Appendix 1 attachment). Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS Health professionals should only consider screening for OSA in women with PCOS to identify and alleviate symptoms of OSA (e.g. snoring, waking unrefreshed from sleep, daytime sleepiness, and the potential for fatigue to contribute to mood disorder). A simple screening questionnaire could be considered, preferably using the Berlin tool; and if positive, referral to a specialist considered. Health professionals should be aware that there is insufficient evidence to justify screening for OSA with the intention of improving metabolic derangement or reduce risk from cardiovascular disease. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS A positive screening test for OSA may raise the likelihood of its presence however does not quantify the symptom burden and therefore alone does not make a case for treatment. If women with PCOS have OSA symptoms and a positive screen, they should be referred to a specialist centre for further evaluation. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION There is no OSA screening questionnaire validated for young women.

Judgement Favours this option 2 Probably favours this option 9 Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion There are resource constraints through the screenin g and identification of symptomatic OSA that need consideration. Availability of ambulatory or in labo ratory polysomnography in conjunction with clinical follow-up of the results and treatme nt planning may not be universal. Values Is there important uncertainty about, or va riability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement 7 Important uncertainty or variability 4 Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was conducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Alleviation of symptomatic OSA is in general widely va lued by the recipient of treatment. In the case of young women with PCOS treatment selection is import ant as appliance based solutions such as CPAP has cosmetic and other social implications that need individual discussion with the patient. Heath professionals managing PCOS may not value the importance of OSA. Balance of effects Does the balance between desi rable and undesirable effect s favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option 10 Probably favours this option 1 Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion The desirable effects of treatment may outweigh the resourcing provided the pathway remains focused on the symptomatic subset.

Panel discussion The resource implications are potentially substantive. The introduction of screening questionnaires is simple. A sleep apnoea history will be factored into many cons ultations if the screening questionnaires are positive or alternatively the FOSQ could be supp lemented however is 30 items.

This includes social disruption/embarrassment related to snoring, waking unrefreshed, daytime fatigue and sleepiness in mo re passive contexts, cognitive impairment, mood and anxiety disorders. There is no questionnaire that encompasses all these components hence a history approach is preferred however the FOSQ will cover much of the fatigue and sleepiness components. Subgroup considerations Obesity, East Asian. Symptomatic subset of OSA. This includes social disruption/embarrassment related to snoring, waking unrefreshed, daytime fatigue and sleepin ess in more passive contexts, cognitive impairment, mood and anxiety disorders. There is no questionnaire that encompasses all these components hence a history approach is preferred however th e FOSQ will cover much of the fatigue and sleepiness components. Implementation considerations Familiarity and acceptability may impact on implementation. Monitoring and evaluation As screening services in this population have not be evaluated in the published literature, an evaluation is essential. This would include detection rate, patient uptake of diagnostic pathwa y, treatment acceptance and measurement of symptom benefits. Research priorities Evaluation of appropriate models of care. There is no OSA screening questionnaire valida ted for young women with or without PCOS. Prevalence of OSA needs to be determined. References 1.

Prevalence and problem Endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is a relatively common condition that affects women of all age groups. It is diagnosed three times more commonly than endometrial cancer and is classified into three different categories based on the microscopic appearance into simple, complex non atypical or atypical complex hyperplasia. Without any intervention the risk of progression to endometrial carcinoma is less than 1% for women with simple hyperplasia, 3% for complex nonatypical hyperplasia, and up to 29% for women with atypical complex hyperplasia (1). World Health Organization guidelines in 2014 have reclassified EH by categorizing it as hyperplasia without atypia and hyperplasia with atypia. A recent systematic review showed that the risk of EC was three times higher in women with PCOS compared to women without the disease (2). Endometrial tumors display a variety of histologic features but the majority of cases are adenocarcinomas (>95%) and can be classified into two main subtypes, endometrioid (Type I) and nonendometrioid (Type II) (3, 4). As approximately 70-80% of endometrial cancers are Type I tumors the reported associations between PCOS and endometrial cancer are likely driven by this subtype. To our knowledge only one study has examined the association between PCOS and subtype specific endometrial cancer reporting a slightly stronger association between PCOS and endometrial cancer when limited to Type I (OR all cases=2.2; 95% CI 0.9-5.7 vs. OR Type I cases=2.4; 95% CI=1.0-6.2) (5, 6). An association between PCOS and endometrial cancer was first suggested over fifty years ago by a series of small case reports, but these studies were limited by lack of control groups and small numbers (7). A major factor for this increased malignancy risk is prolonged exposure of the endometrium to unopposed estrogen that results from anovulation. Additionally, secretory endometrium of some women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction or receiving exogenous progestin exhibits progesterone resistance accompanied by dysregulation of gene expression controlling steroid action and cell proliferation (8). Recently three metaanalyses, with overlapping studies, reported a significant increased risk of endometrial cancer among women with PCOS (911). All three studies included estimates from analyses that did not take into account BMI which is a common characteristic of PCOS and a strong and wellestablished risk factor for endometrial cancer (2). Besides lack of adjustment for BMI these studies were additionally limited by a small number of exposed cases. In those studies that have reported effect estimates adjusted for BMI the observed associations with PCOS and endometrial cancer have been less consistent (6). Wild et al. followed a cohort of women diagnosed with PCOS and reported an increased risk of endometrial cancer in these women compared to agematched controls with OR of 5.3 (95% CI=1.5-18.6) without adjustment for BMI and 6.1 (95% CI=1.0- 36.9) after adjustment for BMI (12). In contrast, Fearnley and coworkers. reported an increase in the OR following adjustment for BMI (OR=4.0; 95% CI=1.7-9.3 and OR=2.2; 95% CI=0.9-5.7, respectively) et al. observed no association between PCOS and endometrial cancer with a BMIadjusted OR of 1.3 (95% CI=0.7-2.2) with an OR that was slightly higher when limited to premenopausal women (OR=2.0; 95% CI=0.8-5.4) (13). Differences in these studies may be due to varying control for confounders, Wild et al. did not adjust for any variables except BMI while Fearnley et al. adjusted for parity and oral contraceptive (OC) use, and Zucchetto et al. adjusted for parity, OC use, age at menarche, and age at menopause. In addition, the study population in Fearnley, et al. was limited to women under age 50 which is likely a primarily premenopausal population (6). In a recent study of 117 women with PCOS by Rotterdam criteria, endometrial thickness and age were significant predictors of endometrial disease (14). Age and endometrial thickness were significantly related to endometrial disease. Endometrial thickness of greater than 8.5 mm had a 77.8% sensitivity and 56.7% specificity, while age above 25.5 years had a 70.4% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity, in predicting endometrial disease. In another study of anovulatory women with PCOS and infertility, an endometrial thickness greater 2 than 7 mm or an intermenstrual interval of more than 3 months was associated with endometrial hyperplasia (15). The epidemiologic data examining the relation between metformin and endometrial cancer have generally suggested no association or a protective association between metformin and endometrial cancer (6). Endometrial cancer has been the least studied of the hormone related cancers in relation to clomiphene use. An association has been hypothesized since clomiphene has chemical properties similar to tamoxifen, a drug that has been associated with endometrial cancer risk. However, most previous studies of clomiphene and endometrial cancer have been limited by power. In one of the largest studies to date Brinton et al. reported a slight nonsignificant increase in risk of endometrial cancer among clomiphene 95% CI=1.0- 2.0) (16). Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, has more recently been considered as an additional treatment option for anovulatory infertility. While longitudinal data does not yet exist to adequately examine the association between letrozole use for ovulatory infertility and endometrial cancer risk, letrozole is currently used as an adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor positive postmenopausal breast cancer, thus it could be hypothesized that it would likely decrease hormonal related cancer risk (6). Clinical practice gap: need for guidance The associations between PCOS and endometrial cancer are complex, requiring consideration of PCOS diagnostic criteria, etiologic heterogeneity of cancer subtypes, confounding and mediating factors, menopausal status, comorbid conditions such as infertility, type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome as well as treatment options that may also influence cancer risk. In addition, the rarity endometrial cancers make these cancers even more difficult to study. Larger welldesigned studies, or pooled analyses, may help clarify these complex associations (8) (6). Summary of key information The associations between PCOS and endometrial cancer is complex, with the need to consider many methodological issues in future analyses. Endometrial surveillance by transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial biopsy is indicated for those women PCOS who have thickened endometrium, prolonged amenorrhea, unopposed estrogen exposure or abnormal vaginal bleeding, based upon clinical suspicion (8). There is no evidence yet that ovulation inducing agents do increase the risk for endometrial cancer in women with PCOS. Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION Health professionals and women with PCOS should be aware of a 26 fold increased risk of developing endometrial cancer which often presents premenopausally. However the absolute risk of developing endometrial cancer remains low. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS Health professionals should have a low threshold for investigation for endometrial cancer in women with PCOS or a history of PCOS. Routine ultrasound screening for endometrial thickness in women with PCOS is not recommended, however investigation by transvaginal ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy is indicated for those women with PCOS who have persistent thickened endometrium and/or prolonged oligo amenorrhea and/or abnormal vaginal bleeding. 3 Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to narrative review. Panel discussion Timely identification of endometrial cancer. Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion Inappropriate testing. Values Is there important uncertainty about, or va riability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was conducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Patients and health professionals would value this. 4 Balance of effects Does the balance between desi rable and undesirable effect s favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement Don't know 2 Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion There are some costs in endometrial in vestigation. The need for additional resources could be partly alleviated by early diagnosis and management. In case women with PCOS are examined on a yearly basis screening for risk factors (young age, amenorrhea, overweight or obesity, hyperandrogenism) for endometrial cancer should be included in the yearly examinations. Depending on insurance policies and wh at costs will be covered screening and treating for endometrial cancer will impact on pati ent and or insurance company resour ces. The same holds true for the prescription of OCP's, cyclic progestogens and Levonorgestrel containing IUD's. Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Screening for endometrial cancer in the general popula tion is not cost effective. Whether screening for endometrial cancer in a population with an a priori 2 - 6 fo ld increase in cancer risk is cost effective is not known. Hence this is not recommended and overall, absolute risk is not high. 5 The use of OCP's as well as other medication to prevent endometrial cancer is probably cost effective since treatment of endometrial cancer is more expensive. Th e same holds true for life style modification. Although data are lacking endometrial ablation might as well be cost effective in preventing much more costly interventions later on if left untreated. Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement Don't know Varies 1 Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion May reduce inequity if recommendation is followed e.g. in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. The decision to assess for the presence of endometrial cancer should be based on clinical factors including length of amenorrhea, presence of abnormal uterine bleeding, thickness and appearance of the endometrium on imaging, and the age of the patient. The approach that should be taken to assess possible endometrial pathology is to be determined based on the clinical picture and the doctors assessment in each indi vidual case. Special consideration is needed for women in lower income and socio-economic classes because pr oper healthcare might not be readily available for them. The same holds true for ethnic groups who live in more secluded areas for whom yearly surveillance might be a problem. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes 2 Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Common cancer. The relatively low risk and the uncertainty about the real magnitude of the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PCOS might be an obstacle for different stakeholders to implement this assessment in high risk patients. Given the relatively well differentiated status of most endometrial carcinomas in women with PCOS provides another important obstacl e for different stakeholders. Given these factors key stakeholders are likely not to accept the balance of benefits, harms and costs. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement 6 Don't know 2 Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion The knowledge base of non-gynecologist health profe ssionals regarding assessment of the endometrium is variable. Health system and resource variability will impact on feasibility. In case assessments are done within a setting of yearly physical examinations within a structured follow-up program screening for endometrial cancer is feasible. Th e same holds true for hysteroscopic examinations and endometrial ablation in case it is done within a clinical setting. Prescribing OCP's cyclic Progestogens or Levonorgestrel containing IUD's could either by GP's or (reproductive) endocrinologist or gynecologists. 7 CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendation Health professionals and women with PCOS should be aware of a 2-6 fold increased risk of developing endometrial cancer which often presents pre-menopaus ally. However the absolute risk of developing endometrial cancer remains low. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice points Health professionals should have a low threshold for investigation for endometrial cancer in women with PCOS or a history of PCOS. Routine ultrasound screening for endometrial thickness in women with PCOS is not recommended, however investigation by transvaginal ultrasound and/or endometr ial biopsy is indicated for those women with PCOS who have persistent thickened e ndometrium and/or prolonged oligo amenorrhea and/or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Justification The collective data show that the reduced risk for endometrial cancer is about 50% and 70% for 4 and 12 years of oral contraceptive use, respectively, and that a minimum pe riod of use is necessary to obtain this protective effect. After ceasing oral contraception, the risk of endometrial ca ncer begins to rise from its reduced (levels, but remains lower than never users, even after >20 years of discon tinued use. The protective eff ects according to different endometrial tumor types and oral contracep tive formulations re main unk nown (17). Subgroup considerations In women with PCOS who are under the age of 50 years th e risk for endometrial cancer seems to be elevated. Women with overweight or those that are obese have the highest risk to develop endometrial cancer. Never users of OCP's seem to be also more at risk compared to women with PCOS that have been using OCP's. Women with hyperandrogenism seem to be at a higher risk compar ed to women without hyperandrogenism. Similarly women with hyperinsulinaemia are also at higher ri sk for developing endometrial carcinoma (8, 18). Implementation considerations International and national professional societies should fo llow their specific guidelines for implementation of the guideline. The extent to which thes e recommendation will be implemented in daily clinical care should be monitored during audits for quality control. Monitoring and evaluation The number of women at high risk for endometrial cancer from the latter group in whom an ultrasound or an endometrial biopsy was performed. Monitoring of the implementation of the recommendation in clinical practice. Capture how many women are being investigated according to the recommendation. Research priorities 8 Development of common preventive strategies, therapies, and guidelines based on evidence-based investigations are warranted to promote endometrium-r elated health in women with PCOS. The relative impact of PCOS versus other recognized risk factors for endometrial cancer, such as insulin resistance, nulliparity, infertility and its treatment, anovu lation, and obesity needs to be studied. Need prospective epidemiological studies on the true incidence of endometrial cancer in women PCOS. 9 References 1. Gallos ID, Ganesan R, Gupta JK.

List I: Methods question ......................................................................................... 24 PICO/selection criteria question QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 2 Summary As acknowledged in guideline development meetings, quality of life is not necessarily diagnosed and instead is assessed using tools that measure the level of impairment of quality of life. Therefore we are unable to determine the 'prevalence' of quality of life in women with PCOS as this would require evidence about the number of women diagnosed with impaired quality of life in those with and without PCOS. Here we have compared the level/severity of impairment of quality of life in women with and without PCOS. Based on studies of low quality and certainty; and with some statistical heterogeneity, the evidence suggests that women with PCOS have lower quality of life compared to women without PCOS. This may suggest the value of quality of life assessment as part of standard care in order to address the aspects leading to reduced quality of life. No evidence was identified by our search to determine the most effective tool to assess quality of life. A clinical expert recommendation may be made about tools used in the general population such as SF36 and WHOQOL or the PCOS specific, PCOSQ.

QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 13 GRADE framework Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework 1) In women with PCOS, what is the prevalence and severity of red uced QoL and should QoL be assess ed as part of standard care? Evidence review 2) In women with PCOS, what dimens ions of QoL are most affected? Narrative review 3) In women with PCOS, what is the most effectiv e tool/method to assess quality of life (QoL)? Evidence/narrative review QUESTION Question details Problem: Women with PCOS have lower quality of life than women without PCOS, capturing patient reported impact of their condition is imp ortant, however assessment of QoL in PCOS can be challenging Option: Is QoL reduced in PCOS and should assessment be part of standard care in women with PCOS Comparison: NA Main outcomes: Quality of life Setting: Primary care, PCOS models of care and in clinical research Perspective: Health care provider Background Health Related Quality of life (HRQoL) is a well-recognised and important health outcome, especially in chronic disease and rel ates to the patient repor ted physical, social and emotional effects of a condition and its as sociated treatments. HRQoL is patient reported subjective perception of wellbeing, h as multiple dimensions and is time dependent. Assessment is based on patient reported outcomes and can be me asured through a variety of tools. Commonly used generic tools fo r screening HRQoL such as the Short Form -36 (SF-36) and WHO- BREF are limited by specificity for PCOS featut es and are not ideal for PCOS overall as they have a significan t focus on unrelated health issues such as mobility, impact on work, pain, environment and propensity to infective illn esses. They also do not measure the impact of key dimensions of PCOS such as infertility and hirsutism. However the use of these tools is the only way to assess Qo L across women with PCOS and women without PCOS. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 14 Condition specific tools have therefore been developed which in PCOS include the PCOSQ and modified PCOSQ (MPCOSQ). The PCOSQ h as 26 items, measuring emotions (8 items), body hair (5 items), weight (5 items), infertility diffi culties (4 items) and menstrual problems (4 items). Each item i s graded with a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no problems or difficulties). The MPCOSQ is si milar to the PCOSQ and in addition to four more items on acne. Studies in PCOS increasi ngly use the PCOSQ and the MPCOSQ which have also been adapted an d tested in different ethnic populations in cluding in China. However these tools cann ot be used to show QoL in PCOS differs to non PCOS women. Subgroups Subgroup name: Adults Description: Women with and without PCOS Subgroup name: Adolescents Description: Adolescents with and without PCOS ASSESSMENT Problem Is the problem a priority? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Meta-analysis of five studies using SF-36 and three studies using WHO-BREF in adult women, all of which were low quality and lo w certainty, suggests that women with PCOS have lower quality of life compared to women without PCOS. Statisti cal heterogeneity was present in meta-analysis for six out of th e ten domains in SF-36 and in one out of four domains in the WHO-BREF. Additional considerations The application of generic poorly tailored QoL tools that includ e features unrelated to the cond ition such as immobility, pain, risk of infections and environment have limited relevance in assessment of QoL in PCOS however they are the only tools that can compare across women with PCOS and those withou t the condition. Given the generic nature of these tools, and the specific features of PCOS, the resutls are consistent with the clinical features of PCOS with lower QoL pr imarily related to emotional role, functioning, psychological features, vitality and mental health. Physical impacts were less remarkable as expected. Also as PCOS is a divers e condition with variable expression of each of the features, that also vary by ethnicity are dynamic overtime and are influenced by individual patient persepctives heterogenity i s to be expected. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 15 In this case, the evidence captured in th is evidence review is not greatly helpful in addressing the question on which tools sh ould be used and should QoL be assessed in routine care. Instead this question is best an swered armed with the awareness that QoL is reduc ed and that there is a need for increasing awa reness and understanding of th e need to treat to patient reported and meaningful outcomes. Clinically a detailed history re mains important to capture and treat to patient prioritised o utcomes when partnering with women with PCOS in their care. These outcomes can be captured in QoL tools and the availability of more appropriate and condition specific QoL assessmen t tools (PCOSQ and MPCOSQ) outlined in the narrative review could be useful in targeting treatment to area s of greatest QoL impact, although burden of administration is n oted. In the research setting, whilst the expert GDG acknowledge that there is a need to determine clincial meaningul differences in QoL scores and to validate the tools for change over time, based on a range of evidence sources, clinical expertise and patient perspectives it was co nsidered important to formally measure QoL in clinical res earch studies with condition specific tools. Panel discussion All in agreement for judgement. Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Don't know Varies Trivial Small Moderate Large Research evidence No evidence was identified about the effects of assessing quality of life or which tool/method is most effective in women with PCOS. Additional considerations Addressing patient reported and prioritised outcomes is important in improving Qol and optimising health in any chronic conditi on. This is based on evidence from literature of patient reported outcome measures (PROMS) and patient reported experience measures (PREMS) internationally. If patient reported priorit ies and outcomes were re cognised as front and centre of holistic care, this would be a substantive step forwar d in addressing key gaps in care and significant dissatisfactio n expressed by women internationally with PCOS. If formal QoL assessment tools were applied in standard care it brings patient and provider burde n and individual benefit is mo re difficult to determine. If application of QoL assessment were applied in clinical res earch this would significantly adva nce understanding of the useful ness and comparative effectiv eness of treatments from the patients perspective.

Additional considerations This is uncertain. However in recent years, there has been an increased focus on placin g patients at the center of health care research and evaluating clini cal care in order to improve their experience and ensure that research is both robust and of maximum value for the use of treatments and health services. Pa tients' involvement in clinical research and service evaluation is now recognised as fundamenta l and encompasses patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-reported outcome measu res (PROMs), patient-reported experiences measures (PREMs) and patient and public involvement (PPI) for in cluding patients in the research and in service development and improvement. Generic ev idence in this area suggests value from the assessment on patient prioritsed outcomes in clinical research and also underpins the notion fo patient centred care in clinical pr actice. Based on reduced QoL in PCOS and patient dissatisfaction with current care, it would appe ar to be of value to apply PCOS specific assessment tools i n clinical research and to potentially consider them if time allows for application in clinical care, with the caveat that clinically meaningful differences in scores need to be deter mined with urgency.

Judgement Don't know Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified about the effects or resource re quirements of assessing quality of life in women with PCOS. Additional considerations Overall the costs of implementing the recommendations to unders tand and focus on patient prior ities including taking a targeted history and considering patient prioritised outcomes may increase consultation times, ye t may make treatments more target ed and beneficial to patients. If structured tools are to be used in pr actice, these can be completed outside contact time, costs are minimal and relate to he alth professional time to score and explain the tools. However the resource requirements here on a larger scale are significant. Costs of self administration of QoL assessme nt tools in clinical research studies ar e nominal. These relate to staff time to di stribute the tools and enter and analyse the date only. Panel discussion Moderate potential savings by targeting appropria te most meaningful priorities for patients. Certainty of evidence of required resources What is the certainty of the eviden ce of resource requirements (costs)? Judgement No included studies Very low Low Moderate High Research evidence No evidence was identified about the effects or resource re quirements of assessing quality of life in women with PCOS.

Cost-effectiveness QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 19 Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Don't know Varies Favours the comparison Probably favours the comparison Does not favour either the option or the comparison Probably favours the option Favours the option Research evidence No evidence was identified about the eff ects or cost effectiveness of assessing quality of life in women with PCOS. Additional considerations Overall the costs of implementing the recommendations to unders tand and focus on patient prior ities including taking a targeted history and considering patient prioritised outcomes may increase consultation times, yet benefits are likely to ou tweigh disadvantages of treatment without considering a woman's p erspectives. If considering implementing the formal QoL tool into routine care the burden of administration is likely unreasonable in clinic al care but important and appropriate in research in capturing the benefits of new treatments or health services on QoL and in this sett ing the balance favors application of the to ols yet in standard care it is not possible to assess the balance at this time. Panel discussion All in agreement for judgement. Equity What would be the imp act on health equity?

Additional considerations None Panel discussion Improving active patient and health professional participatio n will increase the effectiveness of this strategy. Acceptability QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 20 Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence No evidence to inform this criterion. Additional considerations In clinical research this would be accept able to stakeholders, however in standard care application of the assessment tools in unlikely to be acceptable at this time Panel discussion In certain cultures, health systems and contexts, pa tient driven prioritisation may be less acceptable. At the current time assessment of QoL in standard care is unlikely to be acceptable to providers given inadequate evidence of benefit and time limitations Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence No evidence was identified about assessing quality of life in women with PCOS. Additional considerations Feasibility challenge in clinical care , but feasible in research settings. Panel discussion This requires a degree of change in practice towards partnership in care internationally. As per acceptability, feasibility in clinical rese arch is relatively simple but in practice is limited at this time QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 21 CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendations All health professionals should be aware of th e adverse impact of PCOS on quality of life. Capturing patient perceptions of their symptoms, impact on their quality of life and priorities must be considered in standard care to improve patient outcomes. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice point If it is clinical or patient preference to use a structured tool to elicit patient priorities, the PCOSQ or the MPCOSQ may be of use. Justification QoL is reduced in PCOS. PCOS is a diverse and dynamic condition and patient experience, perceptions and priorities in terms of the impact of different dimensions of PCOS on QoL are important. This diverse condition, vari es across the lifespan and across ethnicitie s, key gaps in patient satisfaction have been demonstrated in ths cont ext, eliticing patient priorities to guide management are very important here. Whilst QoL is vital in individual patient standard care, the lack of evidence on degree of diff erence that constitutes meaningf ul changes over time and lack of longitudinal date as well as patient and provider burden and likely lack of acceptability and feasibility would su ggest that impelmentation of formal QoL assessment into stanard care is not recommended at this time. Qol is an important outcomes in research to info rm treatment or service benefit and patient value. Subgroup considerations Ethnic, linguistic, cultural and lifestage cons iderations impact on the dimensions most impaired by PCOS. In research the PCOSQ and MPCOSQ have been tested and validated across ethnicities. Implementation considerations Implementation can include letters to the editors of key PCOS j ournals around QoL tool application in research as well as commu nciation through the 32 international societies involved in the PCOS guideline. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 22 Monitoring and evaluation Patient surveys could assess whether clinical practice takes note of pa tient priorities in clinical care. Evaluation of QoL reporting in PCOS research can be simply comp leted and reported to ascertain effective guideline recommendati on implementation. Research priorities Quality of life should be measured using the PC OSQ or MPCOSQ in all clinical research studies. Determination of the clinical m eaningful differences in QoL scores should be underatken with urgency and validation of the use of the QoL assessment tools over time should be completed, acknowledging that PCOS is a dynamic condition that changes over time. QoL assessment with the MPCOSQ should be included in all clinic al, health services and populatio n health research in PCOS When comparing women with PCOS and those without PCOS, considerat ion should be given to using broader tools capturing psychosoc ial dimensions of QoL such as the AQoL.

INTERNAL VALIDITY - HAS THIS STUDY BEEN CONDUCTED RIGOROUSLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE BIAS? SELECTION BIAS Were the cases and controls taken from comparable populations? Yes Partial No Not reported Study participants may be selected from the target population (all individuals to which the results of the study could be applied), the source population (a defined subset of the target population from which participants are selected) or from a pool of eligible subjects (a clearly defined and counted group selected from the source population. Consider: whether the different sources would affect outcomes e.g. one group recruited from hospital(s) the other from the community. time periods i.e. historical cohort whether there is a large difference in participation rate between the two arms of the study. Cases were recruited from the hosp ital while controls were from the community. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 42 Was the case definition adequate and established in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported Yes if with independent validation/diagnosis according criteria ie. Rotterdam/NIH Partial if record linkage or based on selfreport The method of selection of cases is of critical importance to the validity of the study. Investigators have to be certain that cases are truly cases, but must balance this with the need to ensure that the cases admitted into the study are representative of the eligible population. Cases were diagnosed by NIH & Rotterdam criteria Was the control status established in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported Just as it is important to be sure that cases are true cases, it is important to be sure that controls do not have the outcome under investigation. Control subjects should be chosen so that information on exposure status can be obtained or assessed in a similar way to that used for the selection of cases. If the methods of control selection are not described, the study should be rejected. PCOS diagnosis criteria performed on everyone. Similar criteria was applied to exclude PCOS in controls PERFORMANCE BIAS Aside from the exposure/ intervention, were the groups treated the same? Yes Partial No Not reported To be sure it's the exposure which is responsible for the effect. May not be relevant for cross sectional studies. - Insulin resistance level of the control group was not measured and so similarity of the groups on this regard is not known. Although the control group had a lower BMI than the cases, there is still a possibility that lean people can also be insulin resistant. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 43 DETECTION BIAS Were measurements (for exposures or outcomes) carried out and calculated in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported NA Where measures require any degree of subjectivity, some evidence should be provided that the measures used are reliable and have been validated prior to their use in the study. Consider whether ascertainment of exposure was determined by: secure record (eg surgical records) (least bias) structured interview written self report (bias) no description (most bias) They were measured objectively using a validated criteria Were outcome assessors blind to case and control status? Yes Partial No Not reported Consider: If the outcome is objective (e.g. death) then blinding is less critical. If the outcome is subjective (e.g. symptoms or function) then blinding of the outcome assessor is critical. The inclusion of evidence from other sources or previous studies that demonstrate the validity and reliability of the assessment methods used, or that the measurement method used is a recognised procedure, should further increase confidence in study quality. If there is a possibility that case ascertainment can be influenced by knowledge of exposure status, assessment of any association is likely to be biased. A well conducted study should take this into account in the design of the study. Almost all of the outcomes were assessed objectively by laboratory tests. Previously validated tool s were used for the subjective outcomes. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 44 Were all outcomes measured in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported Where outcome measures require any degree of subjectivity, some evidence should be provided that the measures used are reliable and have been validated prior to their use in the study. For some outcomes (e.g. fractured hip), reference to the medical record is sufficient to satisfy the requirement for confirmation of the fracture. This would not be adequate for vertebral fracture outcomes where reference to xrays would be required. Consider whether outcomes were determined through: independent blind assessment or confirmation of the outcome by reference to secure records (xrays, medical records, etc.) (least bias) record linkage (e.g. identified through codes on database records) self report (i.e. no reference to original medical records or xrays to confirm the outcome) (bias) no description (most bias) Established case definition and validated tools were used. Were outcomes assessed objectively and independently? Yes Partial No Not reported Independence of assessment is important where the result of one outcome may effect the interpretation of another. When outcomes are objectively assessed, their independence from each other is less important. ATTRITION BIASWhat percentage of the individuals recruited into each arm of the study were lost to follow up? X% treatment X% control/ comparison Not reported Consider: if all patients who entered the trial were properly accounted for and attributed at its conclusion. why patients dropped out, as well as how many. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 45 Not applicable the drop out rate may be expected to be higher in studies conducted over a long period of time. if comparisons were made between participants followedup and those lost to follow up, by exposure status. What percentage of the individuals were not included in the analysis? X% treatment X% control/ comparison Not reported Not applicable Consider: if analysis was as per protocol or intention to treat number of crossovers reason for crossover This is a concern if greater than 20%. REPORT BIAS Is the paper free of selective outcome reporting? Yes Partial No Not reported Consider: if all the planned outcomes were measured ??? if all the measured outcomes were reported if any additional or composite outcomes were measured. This is difficult to determine if there isn't a protocol. CONFOUNDING Were the groups comparable with regards to key prognostic variables? Yes Partial No Not reported Key prognostic variables include age, sex, economic status. The groups should be similar, however particularly in small studies, some variations are very likely. There should be some indication of whether differences between groups are clinically important. May need to check with clinician for this information. Consider if any matching was done and which variable were used. Either cases and controls must be matched in the design and/or confounders must be adjusted for in the analysis. Statements of no differences between groups or that differences were not statistically significant are not sufficient for establishing comparability. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 46 Note: If the odds ratio for the exposure of interest is adjusted for the confounders listed, then the groups will be considered to be comparable on each variable used in the adjustment. The groups were different in BMI, but the authors didn't adjust all the outcomes for this factor. E.g. comparison of psychological parameters (BDI and SF-36) between cases and controls were not adjusted for BMI. Level of insulin resistance in controls and cases was not compared. OTHER INTERNAL VALIDITY/BIAS Were there any conflicts of interest in the writing or funding of this study? Yes No Not reported Consider: if any of the authors are/were employed, sponsored etc by pharmaceutical companies, or have other financial/other ties if any commercial companies were involved in funding, writing, editing, data analysis or manuscript approval Was the study sufficiently powered to detect any differences between the groups? Yes Partial No Not reported Consider: if an adequate sample size calculation was undertaken if the required sample size recruited and retained for which outcomes the study was powered if confidence intervals include a clinically important difference, the study was underpowered NB this is less important if significant differences were found. Sample size determination was not reported, but clinically significant difference was observed between cases and controls.

INTERNAL VALIDITY - HAS THIS STUDY BEEN CONDUCTED RIGOROUSLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE BIAS? QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 62 SELECTION BIAS Were the cases and controls taken from comparable populations? Yes Partial No Not reported Study participants may be selected from the target population (all individuals to which the results of the study could be applied), the source population (a defined subset of the target population from which participants are selected) or from a pool of eligible subjects (a clearly defined and counted group selected from the source population. Consider: whether the different sources would affect outcomes e.g. one group recruited from hospital(s) the other from the community. time periods i.e. historical cohort whether there is a large difference in participation rate between the two arms of the study. Cases were recruited from the out patient clinics whereas controls were from the previous study. Was the case definition adequate and established in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported Yes if with independent validation/diagnosis according criteria ie. Rotterdam/NIH Partial if record linkage or based on selfreport The method of selection of cases is of critical importance to the validity of the study. Investigators have to be certain that cases are truly cases, but must balance this with the need to ensure that the cases admitted into the study are representative of the eligible population. Cases were diagnosed by the 1990 PCOS-NIH criteria Was the control status established in a Yes Partial No Just as it is important to be sure that cases are true cases, it is important to be sure that controls do not have the outcome under investigation. Control subjects should be chosen so that information on exposure status can be obtained or assessed in a similar way to QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 63 standard, valid and reliable way? Not reported that used for the selection of cases. If the methods of control selection are not described, the study should be rejected. PCOS diagnosis criteria performed on everyone. Similar criteria was applied to exclude PCOS in controls Is it clear that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of study? Yes Partial No Not reported In the case of mortality studies, outcome of interest is still the presence of a disease/ incident, rather than death. That is to say that a statement of no history of disease or incident is least biased. PERFORMANCE BIASAside from the exposure/ intervention, were the groups treated the same? Yes Partial No Not reported To be sure it's the exposure which is responsible for the effect. DETECTION BIAS Was exposure measured in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported NA Where exposure measures require any degree of subjectivity, some evidence should be provided that the measures used are reliable and have been validated prior to their use in the study. Consider whether ascertainment of exposure was determined by: secure record (eg surgical records) (least bias) structured interview written self report (bias) no description (most bias) Validated tools and laboratory tests were used to measure the the exposures and outcomes. Were outcome assessors blind to Yes Partial Consider: QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 64 case and control status? No Not reported If the outcome is objective (e.g. death) then blinding is less critical. If the outcome is subjective (e.g. symptoms or function) then blinding of the outcome assessor is critical. The inclusion of evidence from other sources or previous studies that demonstrate the validity and reliability of the assessment methods used, or that the measurement method used is a recognised procedure, should further increase confidence in study quality. If there is a possibility that case ascertainment can be influenced by knowledge of exposure status, assessment of any association is likely to be biased. A well conducted study should take this into account in the design of the study. Previously validated tools were used to measure subjective outcomes in addition to the laboratory tests. Were all outcomes measured in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported Where outcome measures require any degree of subjectivity, some evidence should be provided that the measures used are reliable and have been validated prior to their use in the study. For some outcomes (e.g. fractured hip), reference to the medical record is sufficient to satisfy the requirement for confirmation of the fracture. This would not be adequate for vertebral fracture outcomes where reference to xrays would be required. Consider whether outcomes were determined through: independent blind assessment or confirmation of the outcome by reference to secure records (xrays, medical records, etc.) (least bias) record linkage (e.g. identified through codes on database records) QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 65 self report (i.e. no reference to original medical records or xrays to confirm the outcome) (bias) no description (most bias) Established case definition and validated tools were used. Were outcomes assessed objectively and independently? Yes Partial No Not reported Independence of assessment is important where the result of one outcome may effect the interpretation of another. When outcomes are objectively assessed, their independence from each other is less important. ATTRITION BIAS What percentage of the individuals recruited into each arm of the study were lost to follow up? X% treatment X% control/ comparison Not reported Consider: if all patients who entered the trial were properly accounted for and attributed at its conclusion. why patients dropped out, as well as how many. the drop out rate may be expected to be higher in studies conducted over a long period of time. if comparisons were made between participants followedup and those lost to follow up, by exposure status. What percentage of each group (cases and controls) refused to participate in the study? X% case X% control Not reported A large difference in participation rate between the cases and control may indicate that a significant degree of selection bias may be present, and the study results should be treated with considerable caution. Consider if comparisons were made between participants and non participants to establish their similarities or differences. Even if participation rates are comparable and acceptable, it is still possible that the participants selected to act as cases or controls may differ from other members of the source population in some QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 66 significant way. A well conducted casecontrol study will look at samples of the nonparticipants among the source population to ensure that the participants are a truly representative sample What percentage of the individuals were not included in the analysis? X% treatment X% control/ comparison Not reported Consider: if analysis was as per protocol or intention to treat number of crossovers reason for crossover This is a concern if greater than 20%. REPORT BIAS Is the paper free of selective outcome reporting? Yes Partial No Not reported Consider: if all the planned outcomes were measured if all the measured outcomes were reported if any additional or composite outcomes were measured. This is difficult to determine if there isn't a protocol. CONFOUNDING Were the groups comparable with regards to key prognostic variables? Yes Partial No Not reported Key prognostic variables include age, sex, economic status. The groups should be similar, however particularly in small studies, some variations are very likely. There should be some indication of whether differences between groups are clinically important. May need to check with clinician for this information. Consider if any matching was done and which variable were used. Either cases and controls must be matched in the design and/or confounders must be adjusted for in the analysis. Statements of no differences between groups or that differences were not statistically significant are not sufficient for establishing comparability. Note: If the odds ratio for the exposure of interest is adjusted for the confounders listed, then the groups will be considered to be comparable on each variable used in the adjustment. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 67 Women with PCOS had significantly higher BMI and HOMA-IR than the controls. OTHER INTERNAL VALIDITY/BIAS Were there any conflicts of interest in the writing or funding of this study? Yes No Not reported Consider: if any of the authors are/were employed, sponsored etc by pharmaceutical companies, or have other financial/other ties if any commercial companies were involved in funding, writing, editing, data analysis or manuscript approval Was the study sufficiently powered to detect any differences between the groups? Yes Partial No Not reported Consider: if an adequate sample size calculation was undertaken if the required sample size recruited and retained for which outcomes the study was powered if confidence intervals include a clinically important difference, the study was underpowered NB this is less important if significant differences were found. Sample size determination was not reported, however, a difference in statistical significance was observed in QoL and other outcomes between the groups.

INTERNAL VALIDITY - HAS THIS STUDY BEEN CONDUCTED RIGOROUSLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE BIAS? SELECTION BIAS Were the cases and controls taken from comparable populations? Yes Partial No Not reported Study participants may be selected from the target population (all individuals to which the results of the study could be applied), the source population (a defined subset of the target population from which participants are selected) or from a pool of eligible subjects (a clearly defined and counted group selected from the source population. Consider: whether the different sources would affect outcomes e.g. one group recruited from hospital(s) the other from the community. QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 82 time periods i.e. historical cohort whether there is a large difference in participation rate between the two arms of the study. Both cases and aged-matched controls were selected from the hospital. Was the case definition adequate and established in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported Yes if with independent validation/diagnosis according criteria ie. Rotterdam/NIH Partial if record linkage or based on selfreport The method of selection of cases is of critical importance to the validity of the study. Investigators have to be certain that cases are truly cases, but must balance this with the need to ensure that the cases admitted into the study are representative of the eligible population. Cases were diagnosed by the revised Rotterdam criteria Was the control status established in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported Just as it is important to be sure that cases are true cases, it is important to be sure that controls do not have the outcome under investigation. Control subjects should be chosen so that information on exposure status can be obtained or assessed in a similar way to that used for the selection of cases. If the methods of control selection are not described, the study should be rejected. PCOS diagnosis criteria performed on everyone. Similar criteria was applied to exclude PCOS in controls QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 83 PERFORMANC EBIASAside from the exposure/ intervention, were the groups treated the same? Yes Partial No Not reported To be sure it's the exposure which is responsible for the effect. May not be relevant for cross sectional studies. DETECTION BIAS Were measurements (for exposures or outcomes) carried out and calculated in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported NA Where measures require any degree of subjectivity, some evidence should be provided that the measures used are reliable and have been validated prior to their use in the study. Consider whether ascertainment of exposure was determined by: secure record (eg surgical records) (least bias) structured interview written self report (bias) no description (most bias) Validated tools were used to assess the outcomes. Were outcome assessors blind to case and control status? Yes Partial No Not reported Consider: If the outcome is objective (e.g. death) then blinding is less critical. If the outcome is subjective (e.g. symptoms or function) then blinding of the outcome assessor is critical. The inclusion of evidence from other sources or previous studies that demonstrate the validity and reliability of the assessment methods used, or that the measurement method used is a recognised procedure, should further increase confidence in study quality. If there is a possibility that case ascertainment can be influenced by knowledge of exposure status, assessment of any association is likely QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 84 to be biased. A well conducted study should take this into account in the design of the study. Previously validated tools were used. Were all outcomes measured in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Partial No Not reported Where outcome measures require any degree of subjectivity, some evidence should be provided that the measures used are reliable and have been validated prior to their use in the study. For some outcomes (e.g. fractured hip), reference to the medical record is sufficient to satisfy the requirement for confirmation of the fracture. This would not be adequate for vertebral fracture outcomes where reference to xrays would be required. Consider whether outcomes were determined through: independent blind assessment or confirmation of the outcome by reference to secure records (xrays, medical records, etc.) (least bias) record linkage (e.g. identified through codes on database records) self report (i.e. no reference to original medical records or xrays to confirm the outcome) (bias) no description (most bias) Established case definition and validated tools were used. Were outcomes assessed objectively and independently? Yes Partial No Not reported Independence of assessment is important where the result of one outcome may effect the interpretation of another. When outcomes are objectively assessed, their independence from each other is less important.

QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 86 This is difficult to determine if there isn't a protocol. CONFOUNDING Were the groups comparable with regards to key prognostic variables? Yes Partial No Not reported Key prognostic variables include age, sex, economic status. The groups should be similar, however particularly in small studies, some variations are very likely. There should be some indication of whether differences between groups are clinically important. May need to check with clinician for this information. Consider if any matching was done and which variable were used. Either cases and controls must be matched in the design and/or confounders must be adjusted for in the analysis. Statements of no differences between groups or that differences were not statistically significant are not sufficient for establishing comparability. Note: If the odds ratio for the exposure of interest is adjusted for the confounders listed, then the groups will be considered to be comparable on each variable used in the adjustment. The PCOS group had higher mean BMI score than the control group. And no data reported on participants' economic status.

Yes Partial No Not reported NA Where exposure measures require any degree of subjectivity, some evidence should be provided that the measures used are reliable and have been validated prior to their use in the study. Consider whether ascertainment of exposure was determined by: secure record (eg surgical records) (least bias) structured interview written selfreport (bias) no description (most bias) A validated tool was used Were outcome assessors blind to case and control status? Yes Partial No Not reported Consider: If the outcome is objective (e.g. death) then blinding is less critical. If the outcome is subjective (e.g. symptoms or function) then blinding of the outcome assessor is critical. The inclusion of evidence from other sources or previous studies that demonstrate the validity and reliability of the assessment methods used, or that the measurement method used is a recognised procedure, should further increase confidence in study quality. If there is a possibility that case ascertainment can be influenced by knowledge of exposure status, assessment of any association is likely QoL evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 114 to be biased.

Yes Partial No Not reported Where outcome measures require any degree of subjectivity, some evidence should be provided that the measures used are reliable and have been validated prior to their use in the study. For some outcomes (e.g. fractured hip), reference to the medical record is sufficient to satisfy the requirement for confirmation of the fracture. This would not be adequate for vertebral fracture outcomes where reference to xrays would be required. Consider whether outcomes were determined through: independent blind assessment or confirmation of the outcome by reference to secure records (xrays, medical records, etc.) (least bias) record linkage (e.g. identified through codes on database records) self report (i.e. no reference to original medical records or xrays to confirm the outcome) (bias) no description (most bias) A validated tool was used Were outcomes assessed objectively and independently?

Prevalence and problem Depression and anxiety are exceptionally common throughout the world and represent a major public health problem. Several studies have shown that women with PCOS are more likely to have depressive symptoms or clinical depression and anxiety symptoms than their healthy counterparts. Clinical practice gap - need for guidance Despite an awareness of the high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms there are no uniform recommendations to screen women with PCOS routinely. The Australian PCOS guidelines state that depression and anxiety should be routinely screened and assessed by all appropriately qualified health professionals in women with PCOS. If a woman with PCOS is positive on screening, the practitioner should further assess for depression/anxiety. If detected, appropriate management should be offered. Despite these recommendations surveys of women with PCOS in North America, Europe and Australia show that less than 10% were satisfied with information regarding long term complications associated with PCOS and less than 5% were satisfied with emotional support and counselling offered Summary of key information Depression The most commonly reported symptoms of depression were daily fatigue, sleep disturbances and diminished interest [1]. A metaanalysis of 10 studies including 522 women with PCOS and 475 controls from 8 countries reported increased depression scores in 44% women in the PCOS group Interestingly, the risk of having an abnormal depression score was still 4 fold increased when PCOS and control groups were matched for BMI (number of studies = 5) suggesting that this risk is independent of obesity. This metaanalysis reported no evidence of heterogeneity between the included studies. Another metaanalysis with several overlapping studies included 910 women with PCOS and 1347 controls and reported a standardized mean difference (SMD) of depression scores between the two groups of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.730.92), suggesting a higher risk of depression in PCOS [3]. Included studies did not show a significant heterogeneity in this metaanalysis however, it was not clear if the depression scores were clinically significant. A metaanalysis of 26 studies including 4716 participants from 14 different countries was published in 2012 [4]. This paper reported SMD of 0.60 for depression scores between PCOS and control groups (95% CI: 0.47 0.73) however, the authors emphasized that scores for women with PCOS were not in a clinically significant range in half of the studies whereas mild depression was reported in the remaining studies. Further, there was significant heterogeneity between studies (I273%, p<0.001). The most recent metaanalysis including 23 studies was conducted with rigorous inclusion criteria including diagnosis of PCOS by a physician and not selfreported, and inclusion of studies that provided prevalence of abnormal depression scores in the study population [5]. This meta analysis showed the odds ratio of moderate/severe depressive symptoms was 4.18 in women with PCOS (95% CI:2.686.52). The median prevalence of depression was 36.6% 22.3, 50.0%) in the PCOS group and 14.2% (IQR: 10.7, 22.2%) in the control group. This metaanalysis also confirmed that the increased risk of depressive symptoms was independent of obesity. Sensitivity analyses showed that both clinic and community recruits had higher depressive scores compared to matched controls. There are some limitations to most studies included in the above metaanalyses including relatively small sample sizes of individual studies and limited confirmation of the diagnosis of depression. For example, in only 3 studies, depression was confirmed with further clinical assessment in individuals who had abnormal screening test scores. Nevertheless, two out of those 3 studies reported increased rates of clinically diagnosed depression in women with PCOS. A large population based study using national health registries in Sweden, examined the association between PCOS and psychiatric disorders, as well as risks for psychiatric disorders in female and male siblings of women with PCOS [6]. This study reported a significantly increased adjusted risk of depression in women with PCOS of 1.25 (1.1.91.31). In another large hospital database in Western Australia, the incidence of depression in women with PCOS (9.8%) was significantly higher compared to women who did not have a diagnosis of PCOS (4.6%) [7]. Overall these studies confirm that women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms indicating a chronic condition and not episodic events. Anxiety Symptoms of anxiety and anxiety disorders are more common in women with PCOS. One metaanalysis published in 2011 including 6 studies and another including 11 studies reported that women with PCOS had significantly higher anxiety scores compared to controls [3, 4]. Another metaanalysis in the same time period including 4 studies reported a sevenfold increase in the risk of abnormal anxiety scores among PCOS subjects [8]. However, there was significant heterogeneity amongst included studies in all three metaanalysis. A recent rigorous meta analysis identified 10 studies that included prevalence of anxiety symptoms in women with welldefined PCOS diagnosed by physicians using validated screening tools [5]. This study shows an increased odds of high anxiety symptoms compared with controls (OR: 5.62; 95% CI: 3.22, 9.80) and also an increased odds of moderate and severe anxiety symptoms (OR: 5.38; 95% CI: 2.28, 12.67). The median prevalence was 41.9% (IQR: 13.6, 52.0%) in the PCOS group and 8.5% (IQR: 3.3, 12.0%) in the control group. There was however, increased heterogeneity amongst studies. In a large population based study in Sweden, including 24,385 women diagnosed with PCOS matched for sex, year of birth, and county of residence to ten individuals randomly selected from the general population showed an increased adjusted OR for anxiety disorder (1.37, CI: 1.32, 1.43) [6]. Further, sisters of women with PCOS also had higher adjusted OR for anxiety disorder (1.15, CI: 1.07, 1.25). In another large hospital database in Western Australia mentioned in the depression section, the incidence of anxiety in women with PCOS (14%) was significantly higher compared to women who did not have a diagnosis of PCOS (5.9%) [7]. Collectively these studies indicate increased anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in women with PCOS, across diverse ethnic groups. Recommendations CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS Given the high prevalence, we recommend that depression should be routinely screened and assessed in all women with PCOS at diagnosis. Simple screening tools validated in the region of practice may be utilized. If a woman with PCOS has a positive screen, practitioners should further assess, refer to appropriate specialists or offer treatment. If a woman with PCOS has a negative screen, repeated screening is suggested in high risk women such as those with anxiety, obesity, diabetes, family history of depression and postpartum period. Given the high prevalence, we recommend that anxiety should be routinely screened and assessed in all women with PCOS. Simple screening tools validated in the region of practice may be utilized. If a woman with PCOS has a positive screen, practitioners should further assess, refer to appropriate specialists or offer treatment. If a woman with PCOS has a negative screen, repeated screening should be suggested in high risk women such as those with depression and obesity. Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework In women with PCOS, what is the prevalence and severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety and should they be screened? CONSIDERATIONS Background Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, registries and health se rvice datasets collectively indicate that women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of clinically sign ificant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Identification of mental health disorders is important for supporting women's overall health, wellbeing and quality of life by facilitating appropriate referral and care. In the context of PCOS, identif ication of mental health disorders is also crucial for optimising women's ability to engage with lifestyle management and ot her preventive strategies at the core of PCOS care. Therefore, we recommend routine mental health screening for women with PCOS. We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS fo r an evidence based recommendation about screening tools and therefore a clinical consensus recomm endation has been made based on key relevant sources of evidence-based information for the general population and the clinical expe rtise of the multidisciplinary guideline development group. ASSESSMENT Problem Is the problem a priority? Judgement 1 Don't know Varies No Probably No 3 Probably Yes 5 Yes Research evidence Women with PCOS are at increased risk of experiencing sy mptoms of depression and anxiety compared to women without PCOS. Past systematic reviews re port that both prevalence and odds of depression and anxiety symptoms in women with PCOS are higher than in women without PC OS [1,2]. Further moderate and severe symptoms are increased in women with PCOS. Few studies indicate that cl inically diagnosed depression is also increased in women with PCOS Additional considerations Despite an awareness of the high prevalence of depr essive and anxiety symptoms there are no uniform recommendations to screen women with PCOS routinely. The Australian PCOS guidelines state that depression and anxiety should be routinely screened and assessed by all ap propriately qualified health professionals in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. If a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome is positive on screening, the practitioner should further assess for depression/anxiety. If detected, appropriate management should be offered. Also, the endocrine society guidelines recommend screening women with PCOS for depression and anxiety. Despite these recommendations surveys of women with PCOS in North America, Europe and Australia show that less than 10% were satisfied with information rega rding long term complications associated wi th PCOS and less than 5% were satisfied with emotional support and counselling offered. Panel discussion All in agreement for judgement. Resources required How large are the resource requirements (costs)? Judgement Don't know Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence Evidence not sought. Additional considerations In many countries it is not usual practice to screen women with PCOS for depression and/or anxiety symptoms and doing so may identify affected patients who would otherwise be missed. Screening may have resource implications such as an impact on length of consultation, however this can be reduced by the use of the screening tools recommended here. If depression and/or anxiety symptoms are detected, intervention may require referral to other health practitioners. Additional time with the patient may also be required to complete an appropriate care plan. Access to appropriately trained and experienced health professionals will be required. It is the responsibility of all health professionals to understand the impact of PCOS on psychological health and to screen for and manage these disorders. Panel discussion Complex because resources sit across scre ening, referral and treatment and there is no evidence to assess the balance. Primary resource required is clinical time. Regional re sources and training and health system are relevant. Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the interventio n favour the interventi on or the comparison? Judgement 1 Don't know Varies Favours the comparison Probably favours the comparison Does not favour either the intervention or the comparison 3 Probably favours the intervention 2 Favours the intervention Research evidence Evidence not sought. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion The GDG did have different pers pectives on this issue. Equity What would be the impact on health equity? Judgement Don't know Varies Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Research evidence The life stage of a woman should also be considered when sc reening for mental health disorders as risk factors and life events may differ. Specific screening tool s for risk factors and symptomatology exist for adolescents, the antenatal and postnatal periods and for older adults. Consider issues around religion and sexual orientation. The cultural identity and preferred language of a woman are also important considerations. Be aware of possible variations in presentation of mental health disorders and conduct screening in a culturally sensitive manner. Consider using screening tools that have been translated and cross-cu lturally validated [13]. For example, culturally validated assessment tools for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are available and should be used in a context of culturally competent care [11]. Additional considerations None Panel discussion Cultural and linguistic workforce training, he alth system, stigma a nd resources considered. Acceptability Is the intervention accepta ble to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence not sought. Additional considerations None Panel discussion Cultural and linguistic workforce traini ng, health system, stigma and resources. Feasibility Is the intervention feasible to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Based on consultation of the key sources of evidence-based information for the general population [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] and the clinical expertise of the multidisciplinary guideline development group we suggest a stepped screening process and the use of tools outlined in the recommendation to increase feasibility. Screening for mental health disorders co mprises three parts: assessment of risk factors, assessment of symptoms, and assessment of risk of deliberate self-harm or suicidal intent. Screening can be separated into two levels depending on the competence of the practitioner. Step 1: The following questions could be asked [12]: Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems? 1) Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? 2) Little interest or pleasure in doing things? 3) Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge? 4) Not being able to stop or control worrying? Step 2: If any of the responses are positive, further screening should involve either: A) Referral to an appropriate professional to perform a further mental health assessment. If this is not the patient's usual GP, inform the GP of the referral. OR B) Completing the following assessments: 1) Assess psychosocial risk factors with or without a structured tool: Where appropriate, respectfully elicit a history of any past or current mental health disorder or chronic physical illness, domestic violence, sexual abuse or past traumatic events , past response to treatments, past experience of mood elevation, family history of mental illness. Enquire about current living conditions, financial security, quality of interpersonal relationships, social isolation, employment, immigration status, alcohol and drug use. Structured tools to assist with risk factor assessment exist and an appropriate tool should be selected based on the woman's circumstances such as age, ethnicity and life-stage. 2) Assess symptoms using one or more of the following general screening tools: Many of these tools are available in different lengths and ha ve been widely translated. Ex ercise clinical judgement to select the appropriate tool or combination of tools. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)* (self-administered) Brief Psychiatric Rati ng Scale Anxiety and (HADS) (self-administered) Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) (self-administered) If further testing is required then the more specific or comprehensive screening tools listed below can be used: Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD7) (self-administered) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)* (clinician-administered) Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (clinician- administered) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)* (self- administered) Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (self- administered) Zanarini Rating Scale (ZAN-BPD)* (clinician-administered to diagnose Borderline Personality Disorder) 3) Assess suicidal ideation, intent and deliberate self-harm. The tools marked * contain questions for asking about suicidal thoughts or intentions, and thoughts or acts of self-harm. Use clinical judgement and the information gained from all three assessments to decide whether referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist is required for a clinical interview to establish a mental health diagnosis. Additional considerations The optimal timing and interval for screening is unknown. A pragmatic approach may be to screen all women and adolescents at the time of PCOS diagnosis and where appropriate, at the time of their regular physical health checks for PCOS. Use clinical judgment considering an individual woma n's risk factors to inform if additional screening is warranted. Align timing and interval of screening during the antenatal and postnatal periods with the regional clinical practice guidelines. Panel discussion Cultural and linguistic workforce traini ng, health system, stigma and resources. CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendations All health professionals must be aware of the high prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults with PCOS. Anxiety and depressive symptoms should be routinely screened in all adolescents and adults with PCOS at diagnosis. If a woman with PCOS has a positive screen, practitioner s should further assess and/or refer for assessment. If treatment is warranted, psychological therapy and/or pharmacological treatment should be offered, informed by regional clinical practice guidelines. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice points The optimal interval for screening is not known. A pragmatic approach could include repeat screening using clinical judgment, considering risk factors, comorbidities and life events. If using pharmacological treatment, avoid agents that exacerbate PCOS symptoms including weight gain. Justification High prevalence in PCOS and impact of treatment on better engagement in PCOS related treatments. Subgroup considerations Adolescents and different PCOS phenotypes should be considered. Implementation considerations The life stage of a woman should also be considered when sc reening for mental health disorders as risk factors and life events may differ. Consider issues around culture and sexual orientation. The cultural identity and preferred language of a woman are also important considerations. Be aware of possible variations in presentation of mental health disorders and conduct screening in a culturally sensitive manner. In many countries it is not usual practice to screen women with PCOS for depression and/or anxiety symptoms and doing so may identify affected patients who would otherwise be missed. Screening may have resource implications such as an impact on length of consultation, however this can be reduced by the use of the PCOS emotional wellbeing general screening tool and other tools recommended here. If depression and/or anxiety symptoms are detected, intervention may require referral to other health practitioners. Additional time with the patient may also be required to complete an appropriate care plan. Access to appropriately trained and experienced health professionals will be required. It is the responsibility of all health professionals to understand the impact of PCOS on psychological health and to screen for and manage these disorders. Monitoring and evaluation Ongoing monitoring of women with depressive and anxiety symptoms is important. Change in symptoms with initiation of PCOS related therapies should be monitored. The guideline translation, including these recommendations, will need to be evaluated. Research priorities Validation of screening tools in the PCOS population. Longitudinal follow up to determine frequency of screening for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in PCOS phenotypes, populations and across different life stages. Prevalence of mental health disord ers diagnosed by clinical interview. Elucidate the cause of depressive and anxiety symptoms. References 1. Hollinrake, E., et al., Increased risk of depressive disorders in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

A pragmatic approach may be to screen all women and adolescents at the time of PCOS diagnosis and at the time of their regular physical health checks for PCOS. Use clinical judgment considering an individual woman's risk factors to inform if additional screening is warranted. Align timing and interval of screening during the antenatal and postnatal periods with the national clinical practice guidelines. Specific Populations The life stage of a woman should also be considered when screening for mental health disorders as risk factors and life events may differ. Specific screening tools for risk factors and symptomatology exist for adolescents (e.g. PHQA, BDIPC), the antenatal and postnatal periods (e.g. EPDS) and for older adults (e.g. Geriatric Depression Scale). Consider issues around religion and sexual orientation. The cultural identity and preferred language of a woman are also important considerations. Be aware of possible variations in presentation of mental health disorders and conduct screening in a culturally sensitive manner. Consider using screening tools that have been translated and crossculturally validated [13]. Culturally validated assessment tools for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are available and should be used in a context of culturally competent care [11]. Clinical impact of the recommendation: Very large In many countries it is not usual practice to screen women with PCOS for depression and/or anxiety symptoms and doing so may identify affected patients who would otherwise be missed. Screening may have resource implications such as an impact on length of consultation, however this can be reduced by the use of tools recommended here. If depression and/or anxiety symptoms are detected, intervention may require referral to other health practitioners. Additional time with the patient may also be required to complete an appropriate care plan. It is important to note that all tools mentioned are free to use in clinical practice, research and education. Access to appropriately trained and experienced health professionals will be required. It is the responsibility of all health professionals to understand the impact of PCOS on psychological health and to screen for and manage or refer for management of these disorders.

Background Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, registries and health service datasets collectively indicate that women with PCOS have a hig her prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety and of related symptoms.

D&A tools evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 13 Acceptability Is the intervention accepta ble to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence not sought for this criterion. Additional considerations A study in North America, Europe and Australia show that less than 10% of women with PCOS were satisfied with information regar ding long term complications associated with PCOS and less than 5% were satisfied w ith emotional support and counselling offered [14]. Panel discussion Evidence from diabetes suggests that screenin g for emotional distress would be acceptab le to women with PCOS, as they are likel y to want to be able to share this burden and have someone to talk with, who they perceive as 'on their side'. However, we need to be careful about whether depression/anxiet y measures are the right route, and generate new evidence to determine whether a new measur e of 'PCOS-related distress' would be useful. Feasibility Is the intervention fe asible to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Based on consultation of the key sources of evidence-based information for the general population [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] and the clinical expertise of the multidisciplinary guideline development group we suggest a stepped screening process and the foll owing tools to increase feasibility. Screening for mental health diso rders comprises three parts: assessment of risk factors, assessment of symptoms, and assessment of risk of deliberate self-harm or suicidal intent. Screening can be separated into two levels depending on the competence of the practitioner. D&A tools evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 14 Step 1: The following questions could be asked [12]: Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems? 1) Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? 2) Little interest or pleasure in doing things? 3) Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge? 4) Not being able to stop or control worrying? Step 2: If any of the responses are positive, further screening should involve either: A) Referral to an appropriate professional to perform a further mental health assessment. If th is is not the patient's usual GP , inform the GP of the referral. OR B) Completing the fo llowing assessments: 1) Assess psychosocial risk factors with or without a structured tool: Respectfully elicit a history of any past or current mental heal th disorder or chronic physical illness, domestic violence, sex ual abuse or past traumatic events, past response to treatments, past experience of mood elevation, family history of mental illness. Enquire about current living conditions, finan cial security, quality of interpersonal relationships, social isolation, employment , immigration status, alcohol and drug use. Structured tools to assist with risk factor assessment exist an d an appropriate tool should be selected based on the woman's ci rcumstances such as age, ethnicity and life-stage. 2) Assess symptoms using one or more of the following general screening tools: Many of these tools are available in different lengths and have be en widely translated. Exercise clinical judgement to select t he appropriate tool or combination of tools. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)* (self-administered) Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)* (clinician-administered) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (self-administered) Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) (self-administered) If further testing is required then the more specific or comprehensive screening tools listed below can be used: Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD7) (self-administered) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)* (clinician-administered) Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (H AM-A) (clinician- administered) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)* (self- administered) D&A tools evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 15 Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (self- administered) Zanarini Rating Scale (ZAN-BPD)* (clinician-administe red to diagnose Borderlin e Personality Disorder) 3) Assess suicidal ideation, in tent and deliberate self-harm. The tools marked * contain questions for asking about suicidal thoughts or intentions, and thoughts or acts of self-harm. Use clinical judgement and the information gained from all three assessments to decide whether referral to a psychiatrist or ps ychologist is required for a clinical interview to establish a mental health diagnosis. Additional considerations None Panel discussion Short screening tools validated in the general population are availa ble. It is feasible to use emotional health screening tool s in clinical practice in other chronic conditions. USPTF also recommends screening all adults in the US for depression.

Psychosexual dysfunction refers to sexual problems or difficulties that have a psychological origin based in cognitions and/or emotions such as depression, low selfesteem and negative body image [1]. The prevalence of psychosexual dysfunction varies from 13.3% to 62.5% in PCOS patients [25]. It appears that women with PCOS suffer from greater psychosexual dysfunction than women in the general population in most studies [6]. Whilst there is limited quality research in this area, studies [68] do show a correlation between PCOS and reduced QoL, sexual satisfaction and feminine identity. Physical PCOS symptoms such as hirsutism, obesity, menstrual irregularity and infertility may cause loss of feminine identity and a feeling of being unattractive which may impact on sexuality [6,7,9]. Women with PCOS also report less sexual satisfaction and lower sexual selfworth than women without PCOS and sexual dysfunction impacts more on relationships in women with PCOS [10]. Overall, psychosexual dysfunction appears to be more common in women with PCOS, may be an important issue for the individual woman and is likely to impact on QoL and relationships. Until now, there was only one study [3] published in 2013 showed that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the PCOS group was similar to general population (25% vs 19%; P=0.54), and no significant difference was found according to each domain score of female sexual function index (FSFI). Considering all the studies above, clinicians should be aware of potential psychosexual dysfunction in PCOS and screening and assessment should be considered. In this setting guidance on the most effective way to assess psychosexual dysfunction is needed. The female sexual function index (FSFI) [3] and Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) [2] are usually be used to evaluate psychosexual dysfunction in PCOS patients.

It appears that women with PCOS suffer from greater psychosexual dysfunction than women in the general population in most studies [6-13]. Whilst there is limited quality research in this area, studies [6-8] do show a correlation between PCOS and reduced QoL, sexual satisfaction and feminine identity . Physical PCOS symptoms such as hirsutism, obesity, menstrual irregularity and infertility may cause loss of femi nine identity and a feeling of being unattractive which may impact on sexuality [6,7,9]. Women with PCOS also re port less sexual satisfaction and lower sexual self-worth than women without PCOS and sexual dysfunction impacts more on relationships in women with PCOS [10]. Overall, psychosexual dysfunction appears to be more common in women with PCOS, may be an important issue for the individual woman and is likely to impact on QoL and relationships. Until now, there was only two studies showed negative results,[2 3] Veras's study[2] published in 2011 showed the incidence of sexual dysfunction was verified (13.3%), and it was observed that the average (SD) ASEX score of 14.4 (3.7) was comparable with that of the population with no medical problems Ercan's study [3] published in 2013 showed that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the PCOS group was similar to general population (25% vs 19%; P=0.54), and no significant difference was found according to each domain score of female sexual function index (FSFI).

Additional considerations PCOS is a physical, psychological and social syndrome; theref ore, it is necessary to taking a more holistic approach to patient care beyond treating physical symptoms. Therapy should focus on both the short and long-term reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Given the aetiological role of insulin resistance and the impact of obesity on both hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenism, multidisciplinary lifestyle improvement aimed at normalizing insulin resistance, improving androgen status and aiding weight management is recognized as a crucial initial treatment strategy.

CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendation All health professionals should be aware of the increased prevalence of psychosexual dysfunction in adults with PCOS. Consider screening for psychosexual dysfunction in adults with PCOS. If a woman with PCOS has suspected psychosexual dysfunction, further assess, refer or treat as appropriate. Judgement Strong recommendation against the intervention Conditional recommendation against the intervention Conditional recommendation for either the intervention or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the intervention Strong recommendation for the intervention An upcoming meta-analysis was also discussed by the GDG. Key challenges involved variable use of scales and limited overall likely conclusions. Practice point Health professionals should be aware that obesity and infer tility are also associated with psychosexual dysfunction. Justification GDG members were aware of a conferen ce abstract about a meta-analysis that was underway and the group sought data directly from the authors who we re also involved in the guideline. Sensitivities and cultural challenges around the topic of psychosexual dysfunction from patient and health professional perspective may present barriers to implem entation. However the international, multi-disciplinary guideline development group, including consumers, recommended that despite implementation challenges, the recommendation was warranted on the basis of prevalence data from a meta-analysis and on potential impact.

Clinical need for the question Body image is complex and is influenced by many factors. For the purpose of this clinical question, body image is defined as the way a person may feel, think and view their body including their appearance. Physical factors affecting appearance (excess weight and hirsutism), psychological factors (selfesteem) and sociocultural influences all appear to influence the way women think and feel about their bodies. Body image includes attitudes to physical appearance, understanding of health, physical fitness and body size, the mental picture that individuals form of their bodies, values and selfesteem. Assessment of body image includes measures of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating (1), body size estimation and weight (2). Two thirds of women from the general population are dissatisfied with their body, yet negative body image has in some, but not all, studies been shown to be more prevalent in PCOS and impacts on thoughts and feelings of health, appearance, QoL, mood and physical fitness. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance There is no study investigating prevalence of body image distress in women with PCOS. One study demonstrated that women with PCOS, compared with control women, had a negative body image in 7 out of 10 subscales of the validated Multidimensional BodySelf Relations Questionnaire (3). Women with PCOS appear to feel less physically attractive, healthy or physically fit and are less satisfied with their body size and appearance than women without PCOS (4). Infertile women with PCOS have lower selfesteem and body satisfaction as measured with the Body Image Concern Inventory (BICI) than noninfertile women with PCOS (5). Further, hirsute women experienced lower selfesteem than nonhirsute women, and women with menstrual irregularities and higher BMI had more body dissatisfaction (5). PCOS features, in particular hirsutism and increased weight, appear to impact negatively on body image and QoL (6, 7), and negative body image is strongly associated with depression in women with PCOS (8, 9), even after controlling for weight (9, 10). However, some recent casecontrol studies did not find differences in body image satisfaction and self esteem when comparing women with and without PCOS, and all women seem to idealize a slender body shape (1113). However all studies are hampered by small sample size. Given that negative body image in PCOS may result in increased depression and poorer healthrelated QoL, body image of women with PCOS should be considered as part of a comprehensive assessment and management plan. Recommendations for screening and assessment that are easy to use and widely applicable are needed in PCOS. If identified, addressing negative body and associated mood disorders may assist to improve emotional wellbeing and QoL in PCOS, although more research in this area is needed. Summary of key information We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer the questions and therefore a clinical consensus recommendation has been made based on key relevant sources of evidencebased information for the general population and the clinical expertise of the multidisciplinary guideline development group. 2 Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION: Negative body image should be considered in women with PCOS. If a woman with PCOS is positive on screening, the practitioner should further assess for negative body image. If negative body image is detected, appropriate management should be offered. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT: To screen for negative body image, the following questions could be asked: 1) Do you worry a lot about the way you look and wish you could think about it less? 2) On a typical day, do you spend more than 1 hour per day worrying about your appearance? (More than 1 hour a day is considered excessive) 3) What specific concerns do you have about your appearance? 4) What effect does it have on your life? 5) Does it make it hard to do your work or be with your friends and family? If an issue is identified, the practitioner could further assess negative body image by: a) Identifying any focus of concern of the patient and respond appropriately b) Assessing the level of depression and/or anxiety (if they have not done so already) c) Identifying if there is any distortion of body image (e.g. presence of anorexia nervosa or body dysmorphic disorder) Negative body image is increased in women with PCOS and is related to depression and reduced QoL, hence it is important and highly recommended that women with PCOS are screened and assessed for negative body image. It is not usual practice to screen and assess women with PCOS for negative body image. Detection of negative body image provides the opportunity to address both psychological aspects such as selfesteem and selfacceptance as well as working on the physical aspects of the condition such as hirsutism, overweight and acne if appropriate. As no relevant clinical evidence exists in relation to assessment of body image in women with PCOS, the guideline group have sought alternative key relevant sources of evidence based information and expertise. Consequently the guideline group have consulted the following key relevant Guidelines: 1) NICE Guideline 31 - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive compulsive 16 disorder and body dysmorphic disorder. (14) 2) Australian Medical Association Position Statement: Body Image and Health 2002. (15) 3 Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework 1) In women with PCOS, what is the prevalence and severity of body image distress and should they be screened? Narrative review 2) In women with PCOS, what is the most effective tool/m ethod to assess body image distress? Narrative review QUESTION Question details Population: Women with PCOS Option: Screening for body image distress Main outcomes: Prevalence and severity of body image distress? What is the most effective tool/method to assess body image distress? Setting: Primary care, PCOS models of care and in clinical research Perspective: Patients and health professionals Background Body image is complex and is influenced by many factors. For the purpose of this clinic al question, body image is defined as the way a person may feel, think and view th eir body including their appe arance. Physical factors affecting appearance (excess weight and hirsutism), psychological factors (self-esteem) and sociocultural influences all appear to influence th e way women think and feel about their bodies. Body image includes attitudes to physical appearance, understanding of health, physical fi tness and body size, the ment al picture that individuals form of their bodies, values and self-esteem. Assessment of body image includes measures of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating ( 1), body size estimation and weight ( 2). Narrative reviews were prepared to answer these questions (evidence was not searched systematically). There were no studies in women with PCOS to answer the questions. The GDG decided not to make a recommendation based on clinical grounds and in th e absence of evidence. Therefore, the GRADE criteria have not been specifically addressed and instead have been used to guide relevan t clinical comment and practice points. The guideline group have consulted the following key relevant Guidelines: 1. NICE Guideline 31 - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive compulsive 16 disorder and body dysmorphic disorder. ( 14) 2. Australian Medical Associat ion Position Stat ement: Body Image and Health 2002. ( 15) Subgroups Subgroup name: Adult women with and without PCOS Subgroup name: Adolescents with and without PCOS ASSESSMENT 4 Problem Is the problem a priority? Two thirds of women from the general population are dissatis fied with their body, yet negative body image has in some, but not all, studies been shown to be more prevalent in PCOS and impacts on thoughts and feelings of health, appearance, QoL, mood and physical fitness. There is no study investigating prevalence of body imag e distress in women with PCOS. One study demonstrated that women with PCOS, compared with control women, had a negative body image in 7 out of 10 subscales of the validated Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire ( 3). Women with PCOS appear to feel less physically attractive, healthy or physica lly fit and are less satisfied with their body size and appearance than women without PCOS ( 4). Infertile women with PCOS have lower self-e steem and body satisfaction as measured with the Body Image Concern Inventory (BICI) than non-infertile women with PCOS ( 5). Further, hirsute women experienced lower self-esteem than non-hirsute women, a nd women with menstrual irregularities and higher BMI had more body dissatisfaction ( 5). PCOS features, in particular hirsutis m and increased weight, appear to impact negatively on body image and QoL (6, 7), and negative body image is strongly associated with depression in women with PCOS ( 8, 9), even after controlling for weight ( 9, 10). However, some recent case-control st udies did not find differ ences in body image satisfaction and self-esteem when comparing women with and without PCOS, and al l women seem to idealize a slender body shape ( 11-13 ). However all studies are hampered by small sample size. Given that negative body image in PCOS may result in in creased depression and poorer health-related QoL, body image of women with PCOS should be considered as part of a comprehensive assessment and management plan. Recommendations for screening and assessment that are easy to use and widely applicable are needed in PCOS. If identified, addressing negative body and associated mood disorders may assist to improve emotional wellbeing and QoL in PCOS, although more research in this area is needed. Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Research evidence No evidence was identified about the effects of asse ssing body image distress or which tool/method is most effective in women with PCOS. Additional considerations Negative body image appears in women w ith PCOS and is related to depre ssion and reduced QoL, hence it is important that, in women with PCOS, negative body image is considered. It is not us ual practice to screen and assess women with PCOS for negative body image. Detection of negative body image provides the opportunity to address both psychological aspects such as self-esteem and self-ac ceptance as well as working on the physical aspects of the condition such as hirsutism, overweight and acne if appropriate. Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesi rable anticipated effects? Screening may be problematic if effective op tions for treatment/support are not available. Resources required How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? 5 Costs of self-administration of body image assessment tools in clinical research studies are nominal. These relate to staff time to distribute the tools and cons ider or enter and analyse the data only. In practice tools can be completed outsid e contact time, costs are minimal and re late to health professional time to score and explain the tools. The resource requir ements here on a larger scale are significant. Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the intervention favour the in tervention or the comparison? There was no evidence to inform this consideration. Screening may have resource implications in terms of impact on length of consultation, however this can be reduced by the use of the Emotional Wellbeing General Screening Tool and other tools recommended in this guideline. Intervention may require referral to other health practitioners. Where needed , access to appropriately trained and experienced health professionals is required. Acceptability It is not usual practice to screen for negative body imag e in PCOS. Screening for negative body image may pick up patients who would otherwise be missed. Stronger focus on wh at is most relevant to the patient, as identified in question 3 to 5 in the recommendation. A shift in cultural mind set may be required. Feasibility Is the intervention feasible to implement? Fully feasible in clinical research but of limited feasibility in standard care. 6 CONCLUSIONS Practice point Health professionals should be aware that features of PCOS can impact body image. Practice point To screen for negative body image, the following questions could be asked: 1. Do you worry a lot about the way you look and wish you could think about it less? 2. On a typical day, do you spend more than 1 hour per day worrying about your app earance? (More than 1 hour a day is considered excessive) 3. What specific concerns do you have about your appearance? 4. What effect does it have on your life? 5. Does it make it hard to do your work or be with your friends and family? If an issue is identified, the practitioner could further assess negative body image by: 1. Identifying any focus of concern of the patient and respond appropriately 2. Assessing the level of depression and/or anxiety (i f they have not done so already) (see 4.1a) 3. Identifying if there is any distortion of body image (e.g. presence of anorexia nervosa (see 4.3) or body dysmorphic disorder) Justification Addressed above in resources, cost, acceptability and feasibility Subgroup considerations NA Implementation considerations It is not usual practice to screen PCOS women for ne gative body image. Screening for negative body image may pick up patients who would otherwise be missed. Stronger focus on what is most relevant to the patient, as identified in question 3 to 5 in the recommendation. Screening may have resource implications in terms of impact on length of consultation, however this can be reduced by the use of the emotional wellbeing genera l screening tool and other tools recommended in this guideline. Access to appropriately traine d and experienced health professionals and a shift in cultural mind set may be required. Intervention may require referral to other health practi tioners. However, implementati on of the recommendation is not expected to require changes in the way care is organised. Monitoring and evaluation Body image assessment with any availabl e body image scale sh ould be included in all c linical, health services and population health research in PCOS Research priorities 7 Determination of the clinical meaningful differences in body image distress scores should be undertaken with urgency and validation of the use of the body image assessment tools over time should be completed, acknowledging that PCOS is a dynamic condition that changes over time. 8 References 1.

Prevalence and Severity of Eating Disorders/Disordered Eating Diagnosable disorders include Anorexia Nervosa (AN); Bulimia Nervosa (BN), BingeEating Disorder (BED), Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED; atypical AN, BN of low frequency and/or duration, BED of low frequency and limited duration, purging disorder, and night eating syndrome), and Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorders (USFED; symptoms consistent with eating disorders, including the severity of symptoms and distress and impairment, but do not meet the full criteria for any of the eating disorder diagnoses). The prevalence of AN in women is 0.9%, BN is 1.5% and BED is 3.5% [1]. There is a lack of data regarding the prevalence of USFED and OSFED however, given the range of disorders covered by these categories, rates are likely higher than that of the other eating disorders. The associated disturbed eating and eatingrelated behaviours impair physical and psychosocial health and wellbeing. Obesity is not considered an eating disorder but it is associated with increased risk of binge eating disorder and disordered eating [2]. Disordered eating refers to eating and weight related symptoms commonly associated with an eating disorder, this can include behavioural (e.g., bingeing, restriction), cognitive (e.g., dietary restraint, negative body image), and emotional (e.g., emotional eating) factors. The prevalence of disordered eating is far higher than the prevalence of eating disorders; many women who do not meet full criteria for an eating disorder experience disordered eating and associated distress. For example, Australian research [3] reports that 7.5% of women surveyed experienced binge eating, 2.1% purging, and 5.2% strict dieting or fasting. There is a lack of good evidence regarding the prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating in women with PCOS. Available data suggests that the prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating is higher in women with PCOS that in the general community. In the only study to use a clinical interview (MINI for DSMIV) to assess eating disorder prevalence in women with PCOS (n=49), Mansson and colleagues [4] reported increased prevalence of any eating disorder (21% vs 4%) but not bulimia nervosa (12% vs 4%) compared to controls. Of note, the MINI only assesses AN and BN, and this study uses the older DSMIV diagnostic criteria. A recent Swedish registry study of women with PCOS (n=24 385) and age and county of residence matched controls reported an increased risk of BN (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.151.58: AOR 1.21; 95% CI 1.03, 1.41), but not AN, among women with PCOS before and after controlling for psychiatric comorbidity [5]. A Swedish survey of women with PCOS recruited from the community (n=72) reported mixed results. Women with PCOS reported higher symptoms of AN and BN (EAT40 Total) but no difference in cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, or emotional eating (TFEQ21) or current symptoms of BN [6]. A recent US survey study of treatment seeking women with PCOS (n=148) reported increased disordered score; 12.16% vs. 2.83%), binge episodes (3.49 vs. 1.71), and compulsive exercise episodes (2.23 vs. 0.51) than controls in the previous 28 days [7]. Questionnaire data was also used to estimate eating disorder prevalence based on DSM5 criteria. Overall 28% of women with PCOS reported symptoms consistent with an eating disorder. Six percent reported symptoms consistent with BN, 18% BED, and 13% night eating syndrome. There were no cases of AN [7]. An earlier US survey study of women with PCOS (n=103) also reported an increased prevalence of BED in women with PCOS compared to controls (2.6% vs 1.9%)[8]. Women with PCOS are at increased risk of experiencing many of the identified risk factors for eating disorders [9]. They are at increased risk of overweight/obesity, depression, anxiety, selfesteem and poor body image. They are also more likely to be highly motivation for weight loss and to be prescribed dietary restriction. Potential endocrine mechanisms have also been proposed[10]. Available data suggests that, in women with PCOS, disordered eating is associated with a higher body weight [7, 11], anxiety [7], depression [8] and poorer quality of life [7]. In women with PCOS it is not known whether: phenotypic differences are associated with different rates of eating disorders or disordered eating; the prevalence of eating disorders or disordered eating changes over time; or PCCS treatments impact on the prevalence of eating disorders or disordered eating. Should Eating Disorders/Disordered Eating be Screened? The high prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating in women with PCOS, and the negative biopsychosocial consequences of eating disorders and disordered eating highlight the need for screening for eating disorders and disordered eating in women with PCOS. The importance of screening for eating disorders and disordered eating is noted in the Australian Evidence based Guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Screening is also recommended for women with PCOS and/or PCOS symptoms in a number of eating disorder guidelines. For example, the Australian National Eating Disorders Collaboration list women with PCOS as one of the high risk groups who may benefit from screening (www.nedc.com.au/identifying peopleatrisk). Likewise the draft National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines for Eating Disorders: Recognition and Treatment (www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid cgwave0703/documents) suggest that clinicians think about the possibility of an eating disorder in individuals with a range of symptoms relevant to PCOS (see below). Assessment of Eating Disorders/Disordered Eating Many women with eating disorders are undiagnosed and unaware that they have an eating disorder. Likewise, many women with disordered eating are unaware that their eating and weight related thoughts and behaviours are unusual and/or causing distress. Therefore, screening, assessment and diagnosis are essential. Unfortunately there are not standardised, widely implemented processes for screening and assessment. The variety of eating disorder diagnosis, and associated symptoms makes it difficult to identify simple screening and assessment methods that cover all eating disorder diagnosis and symptoms. The draft National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines for Eating Disorders: Recognition and Treatment ([12]; www.nedc.com.au/identifying peopleatrisk) consider questions relating to the utility, reliability and validity of instruments, tools and methods for screening and assessing eating disorders. This review highlighted the limited, and low quality evidence regarding eating disorder screening tools. It was concluded that none of the tools are effective for identifying eating disorders when used in isolation (given the high variability of false positives and negatives in across populations). Instead the clinician should use their judgement based on a full diagnostic interview. The SCOFF was the most commonly used screening tool in adults. Their review of the SCOFF indicated that a threshold of 2 or more was optimal for identifying the presence of an eating disorder (both generally and for the specific disorders of anorexia, bulimia and EDNOS). Its sensitivity (pooled estimate) was 0.9 (i.e., 10% of people with an eating disorder would not be detected with the test. The SCOFF takes only a few minutes to administer [12]. Of note, the final two questions have been shown to be useful screening questions (Cotton, 2003 #28} Does your weight affect the way you feel about yourself? Are you satisfied with your eating patterns? SCOFF S - Do you make yourself Sick because you feel uncomfortably full? C - Do you worry you have lost Control over how much you eat? O - Have you recently lost more than 6.35 kg in a threemonth period? F - Do you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin? F - Would you say Food dominates your life? An answer of 'yes' to two or more questions indicates the need for a more comprehensive assessment. A further two questions have been shown to indicate a high sensitivity and specificity for bulimia nervosa. 1. Are you satisfied with your eating patterns? 2. Do you ever eat in secret? The draft National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines for Eating Disorders: Recognition and Treatment [12] review of assessment tools identified evidence for: the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, MunichED, the 40item Eating Attitudes Test, Structured Expert Interview for Anorexic and Bulimic Syndromes and EDA5 (interview and electronic application) and Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburgh. They concluded that the EDA5 was the most versatile. The most sensitive tests for each diagnosis are listed in the table below. The EDEQ was the most commonly used tool, but may miss important outcomes (e.g., bingeing). Diagnosis Better Tests Anorexia Nervosa EDA5 App DSMIV EDA5 App OSFED EDA5 However, the committee highlighted the risk of false positives (and hence inappropriate treatment) with these tool due to the use of these assessment tools, particularly given a full diagnostic interview would be required. The committee recommended (amongst other things) that [12]) (1) clinicians think about the possibility of an eating disorder in people with one or more of the following: o an unusually low or high BMI or body weight for their age o dieting or restrictive eating practices (such as dieting when they are underweight) that are worrying them, their family members or carers, or professionals o family members or carers report a change in eating behaviour o other mental health problems o a disproportionate concern about their weight (for example, concerns about weight gain as a side effect of contraceptive medication) o problems managing a chronic illness that affects diet, such as diabetes o menstrual or other endocrine disturbances, or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms o physical signs of: starvation, such as poor circulation, dizziness, palpitations, fainting or pallor compensatory behaviours, such as laxative misuse, vomiting or excessive exercise dental erosion o taking part in activities associated with a high risk of eating disorders (for example, professional sport, fashion, dance, or modelling). And, (2) Professionals in primary and secondary mental health settings should assess the following in people with a suspected eating disorder: their physical health, including checking for any physical effects of starvation or of compensatory behaviours such as vomiting the presence of mental health problems commonly associated with eating disorders, including depression, anxiety, selfharm and obsessive compulsive disorder the possibility of alcohol or substance misuse. the need for emergency care in people whose physical health is compromised or who have a suicide risk. Recommendations (Consistent with NICE) Eating disorders and disordered eating should be considered in all women with PCOS at diagnosis and regularly throughout treatment. If screening suggests the presence of an eating disorder or disordered eating, practitioners should further assess via a full diagnostic interview (e.g., EDE, EDA5) If a screening tool is to be used the SCOFF should be considered. The following two questions may be helpful in screening o Does your weight affect the way you feel about yourself? o Are you satisfied with your eating patterns? The EDEQ may be a helpful assessment tool Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework 1) In women with PCOS what is the prevalence and severity of disordered eating and should they be screened? 2) In women with PCOS, what is the most eff ective tool/method to assess disordered eating? Background Nervosa (AN); Bulimia Nervosa (BN), Binge-Eating Disorder (BED), Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED; atypical AN, BN of lo w frequency and/or duration, BED of low frequency and limited duration, purging disorder, and night eating syndrome), and Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder s (USFED; symptoms consistent with eating disorders, including the severity of symptoms and distress and impairment, but do not m eet the full criteria for any of the eating disorder diagnoses). Disordered eating refers to eating and weig ht related symptoms commonly associated with an eating disorder, this can include behavioural (e.g., bingeing, rest riction), cognitive (e.g., dietar y restraint, negative body image), and emotional (e.g., emotional eating) factors. ASSESSMENT Problem Is the problem a priority? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No 3 Probably Yes 3 Yes Research evidence The prevalence of AN in women is 0.9%, BN is 1.5% and BED is 3.5% [1]. There is a lack of data regarding the prevalence of USFED and OSFED however, given the range of disorders covered by these categories, rates are likely higher than that of the other eating disorders. The associated disturbed eating and eating-related behaviours impair physical and psychosocial health and wellbeing. Obesity is not consid ered an eating disorder but it is associated with increased risk of binge eating disorder and disordered eating [2]. Disordered eating refers to eating and weight related symp toms commonly associated with an eating disorder, this can include behavioural (e.g., bingeing, restriction), cogn itive (e.g., dietary restraint, negative body image), and emotional (e.g., emotional eating) factors. The prevalence of disordered eating is far higher than the prevalence of eating disorders; many women who do not meet full criteria for an eating disorder experience disordered eating and associated distress.

Six percen t reported symptoms consistent with BN, 18% BED, and 13% night eating syndrome. There were no cases of AN [7]. An earlier US survey study of women with PCOS (n=103) also reported an increased prevalence of BED in women with PCOS compared to controls (2.6% vs 1.9%)[8]. This research was recently collated in a systematic re view and meta-analysis {Lee, under review #37}. Lee and colleagues identified eight studies reporting the prevalence of eating disorder diagnosis or symptoms assessed using validated measures in women with well-defined PCOS. Wo men with PCOS increased risk of having an eating disorder diagnosis (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.43, 10.49; 4 studie s) and eating di sorder symptoms (OR3.05; 95% CI1.33, 6.99; 4 studies). The authors highlighted the need for routine eating disorder screening in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS are at increased risk of experiencing many of the identified risk factors for eat ing disorders [9]. They are at increased risk of overweight/obesity, depressi on, anxiety, self-esteem and poor body image.

In women with PCOS it is not known whether: phenotypic differences are associated with different rates of eating disorders or disordered eating; the prevalence of eating disorders or diso rdered eating changes over time; or PCCS treatments impact on the prevalence of eating disorders or disordered eating. Additional considerations ED are associated with anxiety and depression which have a high prevalence in PCOS. ED are also associated with obesity, again this comorbidity is high in PCOS. Weight loss strategies may vary in obese women with and without ED. Panel discussion All in agreemen t for judgement. Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects?

O - Have you recently lost more than 6.35 kg in a threemonth period? F - Do you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin? F - Would you say Food dominates your life? An answer of 'yes' to two or more questions indicates the need for a more comprehensive assessment. A further two questions have been shown to indicate a high sensitivity and specificity for bulimia nervosa. 1. Are you satisfied with your eating patterns? 2. Do you ever eat in secret? However, the committee highlighted the risk of false positiv es (and hence inappropriate treatment) with these tools, and questioned their value given a full diagnostic interview would be required. The committee recommended (amongst other things) that [12]) (1) clinicians think about the possibility of an eating di sorder in people with one or more of the following: an unusually low or high BMI or body weight for their age dieting or restrictive eating practices (such as dieting when they are underweight) that are worrying them, their family members or carers, or professionals family members or carers report a change in eating behaviour other mental health problems a disproportionate concern about their weight (for exampl e, concerns about weight gain as a side effect of contraceptive medication) problems managing a chronic illness that affects diet, such as diabetes menstrual or other endocrine disturbances, or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms physical signs of: o starvation, such as poor circulation, dizziness, palpitations, fainting or pallor o compensatory behaviours, such as laxativ e misuse, vomiting or excessive exercise o dental erosion taking part in activities associated with a high risk of eating disorders (for example, professional sport, fashion, dance, or modelling). And, (2) Professionals in primary and secondary mental health settings should assess the following in people with a suspected eating disorder: their physical health, includ ing checking for any physical effects of st arvation or of comp ensatory behaviours such as vomiting the presence of mental health problems commonly associated with eating disorders, including depression, anxiety, self-harm and obsessive compulsive disorder the possibility of alcohol or substance misuse. the need for emergency care in people whose physical health is compromised or who have a suicide risk.

CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendation All health professionals should be aware of the increased prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating associated with PCOS. Consider screening for eating disorders and disordered eating associated with PCOS. If treatment is warranted, psycholo gical therapy should be offered, in formed by regional clinical practice guidelines. Judgement Strong recommendation against the intervention Conditional recommendation against the intervention Conditional recommendation for either the intervention or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the intervention Strong recommendation for the intervention Practice point Eating disorders and disordered eating can be screened us ing a stepped approach. Initial screening questions can include: Step 1: The SCOFF may be a useful screening tool. The following questions (could also be asked: Does your weight affect the way you feel about yourself? Are you satisfied with your eating patterns? Step 2: If any of the responses are positive, further screening should involve: A) Assessment of risk factors and symptoms using age, culturally and regionally appropriate tools. B) Referral to an appropriate professional to perform a further mental health assessment (which should include a diagnostic interview). If this is not the patient's usua l healthcare provider, inform the primary care physician Justification A recent systematic review and meta-analysis {Lee, unde r review #7} demonstrated that women with PCOS increased risk of having an increased ri sk of eating disorder diagnosis (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.43, 10.49; 4 studies) and eating disorder symptoms (OR3.05; 95% CI1.33, 6.99; 4 studies). Limited evidence and controversy over optimal screening. Subgroup considerations Adolescents generally have a higher rate of disordered eating in general population. Consider screening in adolescents who are recommended lifestyle recommendation. Women with PCOS who are also obese are likely at higher risk of disordered eating and eating disorders. Implementation considerations Consider age, life stage, religion and sexual orientat ion when screening/assessi ng for eating disorders and disordered eating. The cultural identity and preferred lan guage of a woman are also important considerations. Be aware of possible variations in presentation of eating disorders and disord ered eating and conduct screening in a culturally sensitive manner. Consider using screening tools that have been translated and cross-culturally validated [13]. In many countries it is not usual practice to screen wo men with PCOS for eating disorders and disordered eating and doing so may identify affected patients who would otherwise be missed. Screening may have resource implications such as an impact on length of consultati on, however this can be reduced by the use of stepped approach to screening recommended here. If eating disord ers or disordered eating ar e detected, intervention may require referral to other health practitioners. Additional ti me with the patient may also be required to complete an appropriate care plan. Access to appropriately trained and experienced health professionals will be required. It is the responsibility of all health profe ssionals to understand the impact of PCOS on psychological health and to screen for and manage these eating disorders and disordered eating. Monitoring and evaluation Ongoing monitoring of eating disorders and disordered eating should be considered particularly in response to significant changes in weight, and following initiation of PCOS related therapies. Surveys of consumers and health professionals on adherence to the guideline is recommended. Research priorities In adolescent subgroups and generally in PCOS using DSM5.

Prevalence and problem Delivering comprehensive, womancentred care and providing accurate information are both key to delivering optimal care for PCOS. Firstline management also relies on women's engagement [1]; therefore, it is important to equip women to make informed decisions about their health, and to create opportunities for early engagement in preventive strategies for metabolic complications [2]. Women's perceptions of receiving better quality information are also associated with better quality of life [3]. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance Women's experiences of PCOS care Many women around the world report seeing multiple health professionals about their PCOS symptoms before a diagnosis is established [2, 46]. Women report having to flag their symptoms multiple times [7, 8], and experiencing long and confusing delays before receiving a diagnosis [2, 4, 5, 8]. Receiving a diagnosis is important to women [8]; however, a diagnosis can also lead to feelings of anxiety, frustration or lack of control if women feel uncertain about the nature of the condition or if they don't have all the information they need [57]. Research often identifies weight, menstrual irregularity, infertility and hirsutism as key concerns for women with PCOS [2, 9]. However, women also feel that the psychological effects of PCOS are sometimes under appreciated [7], or that their primary concern goes unrecognised [5]. Women's information needs At the time of PCOS diagnosis women want specific and practical information about lifestyle management, fertility consequences, medical therapy, cosmetic treatments, potential longterm consequences of PCOS and emotional support and counselling; yet this information is not often provided, or does not meet their needs [2, 4, 68, 10, 11]. Women's initial source of information is their healthcare provider [79], however, women are frustrated if they feel this information is inadequate, particularly regarding the longterm health consequences, inaccurate or conflicting [2, 10]. Many women report seeking PCOS information from the internet [7, 8, 10], however find an unevenness in the quality of the information [8] and a lack of credibility in information provided by commercial entities [10] that may also contribute to feeling overwhelmed or anxious [5]. Healthcare providers' knowledge and practices Studies of healthcare providers' practices regarding PCOS suggest that diagnosis and management varies depending on specialty. Rates of undiagnosed PCOS are reported to vary between endocrinology, infertility, gynaecology and dermatology clinics (lowest in infertility and highest in dermatology) [12]. Importantly, while the predominant presenting symptom often differs between clinical settings, menstrual disturbance is present in most women [12]. Differences between gynaecologists and endocrinologists have been reported regarding the tests ordered to establish a PCOS diagnosis, however most clinicians in both specialities recommend lifestyle management as the firstline therapy [13]. 2 While a survey of dietitians reported that most provide advice consistent with evidencebased PCOS care [14], the same survey found that less than onequarter of women with PCOS reported seeing a dietitian or receiving dietary advice from a doctor [14]. Regarding educational programs for healthcare providers, programs to develop a comprehensive understanding of women's healthcare topics have been shown to result in better knowledge and confidence in managing PCOS among internal medicine residents [15]. Further research investigating the efficacy of PCOSspecific educational programs for healthcare providers is needed. Summary of key information A systematic search of peerreviewed literature was conducted to identify articles investigating i) women's experiences of PCOS care and obtaining PCOS information ii) women's perceived needs for PCOS care and information, iii) health care providers' delivery of PCOS care and information, iv) health care providers' perceived needs for PCOS information, education programs, or professional development. Recommendations Women with undiagnosed PCOS may see different healthcare providers depending on their primary concern. To facilitate timely diagnosis, general practitioners, endocrinologists, gynaecologists, dermatologists, nurses and allied health practitioners should all be aware of the features of PCOS and enquire about menstrual disturbance when obtaining patient histories. It is recommended that PCOS information is comprehensive, evidencebased and inclusive of the biopsycho social dimensions of the condition [2, 46, 16]. Use a patient centred care model that helps women to prioritise their individual concerns to guide the codevelopment of appropriate medical and support interventions [16]. Women with PCOS are best supported by a range of resources: respectful and empathetic healthcare providers, websites, leaflets and support groups [8, 17, 18].Women's concerns, information and support needs differ across the lifetime and with personal background [2, 8, 9]. Diagnosis is particularly a time of greater need [6]. Assist women to access accurate, highquality resources and consider referring to dietitians, exercise physiologists and psychologists. Finally, health professionals should address PCOS misconceptions [1], emphasise the longterm chronic nature of the condition and provide support to increase selfefficacy [11] and consumer engagement [1]. 3 Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework What are the information, resource and educat ion needs of women and healthcare providers regarding PCOS?

Many women report delays in diagnosis, dissatisfaction with diagnosis experience, current PCOS care and with the information and support they receive about the condition. This is a problem because first-line management (lifestyle m odification) relies on women's engagement. Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Don't know Varies Trivial Small Moderate Large 5 Research evidence - WOMEN Women report having to flag their symptoms multiple times [7, 8], experiencing long and confusing delays before receiving a diagnosis [2, 4, 5, 8], or that their primar y concern goes unrecognised [5]. However, receiving a diagnosis can lead to feelings of anxiet y, frustration or lack of control if women feel uncertain about the nature of the condition or if they don't have all the information they need [5-7]. Women's perceptions of receiving better quality information are also associated with better quality of life [3]. At the time of PCOS diagnosis, women may want informa tion about lifestyle management, fertility consequences, medical therapy, cosmetic treatments, potential long-term consequences of PCOS and emotional support and counselling; yet all this information is not often provided, or does not meet their needs [2, 4, 6-8, 10, 11]. Women are frustrated if they feel the information they receive from healthcare providers is inadequate, inaccurate or conflicting [2, 10]. Many women report finding discrepanc ies in the quality of PCOS information available from the internet [8] and a lack of credibility in informatio n provided by commercial entities [10] and these issues may contribute to feeling over whelmed or anxious [5]. Research evidence - HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS Rates of undiagnosed PCOS are reported to vary betwee n endocrinology, infertility, gynaecology and dermatology clinics [12]. Importantly, while the predominant presen ting symptom often differs between clinical settings, menstrual disturbance is present in most women [12]. Universal application of the widely recommended Rotterdam diagnostic criteria and the appropriate diagnostic tests appears to remain a challenge, with co nsiderable variation reported across regions and specialties (Doll 2012, Ning 2013, Conway 2014, Dokras 2017). This is likely to contribute to delays in diagnosis, delays in optimal management, confusion and frustration for both women and healthcare providers. Management strategies for PCOS vary across specialties, which is expected given that women are likely to see different clinicians depending on their primary concern. Ho wever, there is wide variation across studies regarding how commonly lifestyle management is recommended for either fertility or non-fertility concerns (Doll 2012, Conway 2014, Dokras 2017 [13]). While a survey of dietitians reported that most provide advice consistent with evidence -based PCOS care [14], the same survey found that less than one-quarter of women with PCOS reported seeing a dietitian or receiving dietary advice from a doctor [14]. Awareness of potential metabolic comorbidities appears to be high among healthcare providers (Dokras 2017, Doll 2012, Dhesi 2016, Conway 2014) but a comprehensive understanding of current metabolic screening practices across different settings and specialties is lacking. Regarding educational programs for healthcare providers, programs to develop a comprehensive understanding of women's healthcare topics have been shown to result in better knowledge and confidence in managing PCOS among internal medicine residents [15]. Further research investigating the efficacy of PCOS-specific educational programs for healthcare providers is needed. Additional considerations A retrospective cohort study suggests that PCOS is under-recognised in primary care (Ding 2016). Studies of PCOS healthcare for adolescents report similar fi ndings to those of PCOS care for adults (Auble et al 2013, Bonny et al 2012). Panel discussion All in agreement for judgement.

However, while resources from professional societies exist, the level of involvement of patients, physicians and other PCOS healthcare providers in their development varies. Co-development of resources with women with PCOS and a range of different healthcare providers is crucia l to ensure the resources will actually meet the needs of the end users. This may mean that existing resources require revision or replacement. Resources should also be based on evidence-based guidelines and the re search literature regarding evidence- practice gaps relevant to the target audience.

Subgroup considerations It is important to ensure that resources for women ar e designed with a low reading level and a low health literacy level. It is also important that resources both women and healthcare providers are culturally appropriate and available in la nguages other than English. Implementation considerations Resources should be based on evidence-based guidelines , research literature and co -developed with end users. Monitoring and evaluation Feedback from both women and healthcare providers should be sought regarding their experiences of using new resources. Research priorities Effect of information, education and resources on improving uptake of evidence-based healthcare recommendations, quality of life and health outcomes. 11 References 1.

MoC evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 1 2.6b NARRATIVE REVIEW No evidence identified in evidence review Clinical question: What is the effectiveness of different models of care compared to usual care in PCOS? Contents Summary ............................................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................... ...... 2 Narrative synthesis ............................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... 2 GRADE ............................................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................... 4 List ......... 16 MoC evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 2 Summary None of the studies identified in the systematic search met the selection criteria (PICO). Four studies described models of care in terms of barriers and enablers as well as satisfaction of patients and care providers and inform a narrative synthesis by the key contacts that demonstrates the value of self management and social support in care delivery; and multidisciplinary clinics in remote, Indigenous areas, despite limited resources. Methodologically rigorous and practical studies addressing important outcomes to demonstrate effectiveness of models of care are needed. In particular, the transition from paediatric to adult care needs further investigation. Narrative synthesis Prevalence and problem A woman with PCOS may face multiple health problems as wells as psychological and social distress. She may need to see multiple health care providers such as a general practitioner, dietitian, psychologist, exercise physiologist, endocrinologist, gynaecologist and infertility specialist. This multidisciplinary team approach has been used in the management of a number of chronic diseases and has been credited with improvements in health related outcomes including general wellbeing. However there have been a number of criticisms with the multidisciplinary care model, namely the compartmentalization of patient care and the limited communication between health professionals. Here we suggest a clinical consensus recommendation to offer Interdisciplinary care to women with PCOS. An interdisciplinary care model is \"the collaboration between a woman with PCOS and a care team who have shared goals for her total wellbeing\". Clinical practice gap: need for guidance The original Australian PCOS guideline recommendation for interdisciplinary care in PCOS was based on consensus because no evidence was identified addressing the effectiveness of interdisciplinary care in women with PCOS. Therefore, more research is needed to document that this model of care is more effective than a single specialist care model. Furthermore, little is known about other models of care, especially those that focus on selfmanagement or provide psychological and social support to women with PCOS and their benefits to disease management. Summary of key information The systematic search did not identify any studies addressing the effectiveness of any type of model of care. Four studies were identified as relevant that described models of care in terms of barriers and enablers as well as satisfaction of patients and care providers. One study provides pilot data on the function of a pilot multidisciplinary PCO clinic in an Indigenous remote population (1); the remaining three studies examine the benefits of informational and socioemotional support as models of care on PCOS outcomes (24). Evaluation data on a PCOS clinic that offered comprehensive evidencebased service to Indigenous women with PCOS in the Torres Strait area of Australia after 12 months of implementation showed that the clinic was largely successful in providing evidencebased care, emotional screening and lifestyle management despite limited resources MoC evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 3 (1). The services were greatly valued by both patients and health care workers. Barriers to clinic sustainability included staffing limitations, lack of administrative support, funding, high staff turnover and system issues (1). The role of support groups, as models of care, on PCOS outcomes was examined in two studies (2,3). The first study involved an online peersupport group based in the UK (2). Fifty participants with PCOS responded to a series of openended questions via an online survey. Qualitative analysis of the data revealed a range of positive benefits, such as \"connecting with people who understand\", access to information and advice, building confidence in interaction with health care professionals, help with treatment related decisionmaking and improvement in adjustment and management. However, there were also a couple of disempowering experiences such as \"reading about the negative experiences of others\" and \"feeling like an outsider\". The second study reports on the experiences of a nurse-led peer support group from UK (3). Qualitative interviews were conducted in 13 patients. Results revealed that participation in the support group provided opportunities for social comparison and feeling less isolated/more empowered, offered access to relevant information and resulted in direct positive effects on selfmanagement behaviors. A study from Canada involved 43 women with PCOS who received an educational curriculum on PCOS as part of a research study and then were invited to complete an online questionnaire (4). Participants felt that education about PCOS increased their motivation to implement preventive health management strategies, enhanced their satisfaction with their health care provider and empowered them to participate in the management of their condition. Conclusions There are still sparse data on the outcomes of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary models of care in PCOS, although pilot data suggest that multidisciplinary clinics in remote Indigenous areas can be highly successful albeit limited resources (1). Clearly more research is needed in this area. Specifically to adolescents with PCOS, there was no study addressing outcomes transitioning from paediatric to adult care. There is a small but growing body of evidence about the value of selfmanagement and social support in care delivery. Specifically, two studies on support groups suggest that peer support groups in PCOS can alleviate patients' psychosocial distress, provide relevant information and promote selfmanagement activities (2,3). These groups can be led by a heath professional, i.e. a nurse. Online support groups can provide a relative inexpensive and convenient alternative to facetoface groups. Structured educational series can increase disease understanding and improve compliance with lifestyle changes (4), and such educational models can be not only clinically relevant but also costeffective. MoC evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 4 GRADE framework Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework What is the effectiveness of different mo dels of care compared to usual care? QUESTION Question details Problem: Women with PCOS access care from different health care di sciplines but not necessarily in a co-ordinated approach. Option: NA Comparison: NA Main outcomes: Delivery of a Care Model, Cost Effectiveness (long-term), Patien t-defined outcomes (e.g. satisfaction with care), Improved comm unication (between staff and between staff and patients), Patient Health Outcomes (e.g. impr oved physical functioning, improved mental functioning), Timely access to care and treatment (efficiency of care), Quality of Life, Self-rated Emotional Wellbeing. Op timal self-management indicators. Setting: Primary care Perspective: Health care provider and patient Background Women with PCOS frequently face multiple health problems and may see numerous health care providers. This multidisciplinary te am approach may lack coordination and communication among providers. Instead, an interdisciplinary care model that calls for \"the collaboration between a woman w ith PCOS and a care team who have shared goals for her total wellbeing\" has been recommende d. There is little evidence at the moment that the interdisciplinary care model res ults in better disease outcomes or improvement in quality of life. Furthermore, women with PCOS may suffer psycholo gical and social distress, and th us, benefit from care models that promote informational, psychological and social support. Again, there is lack of evidence about the effectiv eness of these models of care compared to standard care.

Judgement Don't know Varies Trivial Small Moderate Large Research evidence When a systematic evidence review was conducte d, no evidence was identified about the effectiveness of models of care in women with PCOS. Here we present a narrative review. Literature search resulted in four relevant studies: one st udy provides pilot data on the function of a pilot multidisciplinary PCOS clinic in an Indigenous remote population (1); the remaining three studies examine the benefits of informational and socio-emotional support as models of care on PCOS outcomes (2-4). One study involved an online peer-support group based in UK (2) and included fifty participants with PCOS who responded to a se ries of open ended questions via an on line survey. Qualitative analysis of the data revealed a range of positive be nefits, such as \"connecting with people who understand\", access to information and advice, building confidence in interaction with health care professionals, help with treatment related decision-making and improvement in adjustment and manag ement. Another study from UK reports on the experiences of a nurse -led peer support group (3). Qualitative interviews were conducted in 13 patients.

Additional considerations An Australian study evaluating a clinic's evidence based servic e for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women with PCOS emph asized that adaptation of educational resources and longer consultation times are required in order to provide culturally appropriate care. Depending on the culture and family con nections the need for grou p rather than individual consultations was also recommended. Among the cultural barriers we re low health literacy, high level of tolerance to problems a nd unwillingness to see a ma le physician for comfort reasons. Even though it does not seem possible at this point to genera te evidence based recommendation, expert opinion and limited avail able data suggest that language is an important barrier for linguistically appropriate care. Sensitivity to patient's need s, beliefs and cultural predispositions may help overcome com munication gap due to linguistics. Panel discussion Public vs. private funded models, differences in health care sy stems and settings, including rural and regional areas and devel oping countries. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence No evidence to inform this criterion. Additional considerations The services of a comprehensive PCOS clinic for indigenous women with PCOS were greatly valued by both patients and health care workers. Panel discussion Might be different depending on acceptability of interdisciplin ary care. Cost, healthcare systems and resources all effect acce ptability. Women's expectat ions may also impact. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement MoC evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 11 Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence No evidence was identified about feasibility of models of care in women with PCOS in a systematic evidence review. Narrative re view of the literature suggests that evaluation data on a PCOS clinic that offered comprehensive evidence based service to indigenous women with PCOS in the Torres Strait area of A ustralia after 12 months of operation showed that the clinic was largely successful in providing evidence-based care, emotional screening and lifestyle management despite limite d recourses (1). The services were greatly valued by both patients and health care workers. Ba rriers to clinic sustainability included staffing limitations, lack of administrative support, funding, high staff turnover and system issues (1). Additional considerations Models of care that incorp orate on line support groups can be cost effective. Interdisciplinary models of care have been used for care of patients with cancer and other chronic conditions. Feasibility would vary based on the intervention and proposed mode l of care. Models of care that are focused on support groups, especially, on line support groups, can be easy to implement. Panel discussion Might be different depending on acceptability of interdisciplin ary care. Cost, healthcare systems and resources all affect feas ibility. Women's expectations may also impact. MoC evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 12 CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendations Interdisciplinary care should be offered to adolescents and adults with PCOS as needed. Care should be provided in partnership with women. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Justification There are still sparse data on the outcomes of multidisciplinary a nd interdisciplinary models of care in PCOS, although pilot d ata suggest that multidisciplinary clinics in remote indigent areas can be highly successful albeit limited resources (1 ).

Structured educat ional series can increase disease understanding and improve compliance with lifestyle change s (4), and such educational models can be not only clinically relevant but also cost-effective. The development of new models of care should involve stakeholde r consultation (both women and he althcare providers) during the design and evaluation stages. Subgroup considerations There was no study focused on adolescents with PCOS. Implementation considerations Professional societies may consider providing educational webinars to patients and health care providers or develop PCOS educat ional curricula to be disseminated to various programs. It is important to emphasise that women with PCOS and healthca re providers should be involved during the design of any model of care. This could mean inclusion of a stakeholder consultation phase or a more form al co-design/co-development role. Monitoring and evaluation Patient questionnaires before and after intervention. Disease outcomes before and after intervention among various clinics/programs. Healthcare provider qu estionnaires before an d after intervention.

There are cultural variations in how patients perceive their disease, although this contact's experience and personal communication with other experts suggest there are more similarities across ethnic/racial/geographic groups than dissimilarities for women with PCOS. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance It is important to determine and address cultural and linguistic factors that could influence access of patients to appropriate care. We should note that language is an obvious barrier to appropriate care. Summary of key information Although data are scarce in the literature on provision and need for culturally and linguistically competent medical care in PCOS there are a few studies that could guide the development of recommendations. An Australian study evaluating a clinic's evidence based service for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women with PCOS emphasized that adaptation of educational resources and longer consultation times are required in order to provide culturally appropriate care. Depending on the culture and family connections the need for group rather than individual consultations was also recommended. Among the cultural barriers were low health literacy, high level of tolerance to problems and unwillingness to see a male physician for comfort reasons (1). A study looking at implications of participation in a clinical trial of PCOS reported that women with PCOS felt they had more knowledge and motivation in the management of their condition (2). Similarly, peer to peer online support and participation in a nurseled peer support group appears to help access to information, advice and appropriate care (3,4). A recent online survey of women with PCOS from 32 countries reported that there is a delayed diagnosis and lack of information associated with dissatisfaction in women with PCOS (5). We should note that all studies above are limited to Englishspeaking women. It would be of interest to look at potential contribution of diverse cultural backgrounds to dissatisfaction of women in the last study as well as whether these results could be extrapolated to women with PCOS speaking other languages. Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION At this point the GDG was unable to generate evidence based recommendation. Limited available data suggest that language is an important barrier for linguistically appropriate care. Sensitivity to patient's needs, beliefs and cultural predispositions may help overcome communication gap due to linguistics. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Studies looking at potential interaction of cultural differences and appropriate care for PCOS in various populations including women speaking languages other than English are needed.

Justification Clinical similarities in the condition are acknowle dged irrespective of culture and racial influences. Culturally appropriate care involves more than lingu istic considerations and is just as important for women who speak English but are not of the cultural majority. Subgroup considerations Implementation considerations Everyone involved in the the dissemination and implementation of this guideline must consider culturally and linguistically appropriate delivery to suit individual patients' needs and beliefs. Broad international consultation with women with PCOS, professional societies and stakeholders must inform the dissemination and implementation of this guideline. Monitoring and evaluation International evaluation of the guideline should include apsects of cultural and linguistic appropriateness. Research priorities We should note that all studies ab ove are limited to English-speaking women. It would be of interest to look at potential contribution of diverse cultural backgrounds to dissatisfaction of women in the last study as well as whether these results could be ex trapolated to women with PCOS speaking other languages. Studies looking at potential interaction of cultura l differences and appropriate care for PCOS in various populations including women speaking languages other than English are needed. References 1.

Clinical question: Is acupuncture effective for management and support of depression and/or anxiety, disordered eating, body image distress, selfesteem, feminine identity or psychosexual dysfunction in women with PCOS? Contents Narrative synthesis ............................................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................... ................................... 6 Acupuncture evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 2 Narrative synthesis Clinical need for the question With a high prevalence of depression and/or anxiety, disordered eating disordered eating, body image distress, selfesteem, feminine identity or psychosexual dysfunction (Lee, Cooney et al. 2017, Cooney 2017), it is of importance to alleviate psychiatric symptoms and to prevent longterm physical and psychiatric complications. First line treatment of women with PCOS is lifestyle intervention focusing on diet and exercise. One alternative treatment to alleviate these symptoms could be acupuncture. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance Acupuncture and counselling for patients presenting with depression in primary care has been shown to reduced depression at 3 months when compared to usual care alone with no difference between acupuncture and counselling (MacPherson, Richmond et al. 2013). Acupuncture has also been shown to improve of major depression disorder in women (Luo, Jia et al. 1985, Luo, Meng et al. 1998, Yeung, Chung et al. 2011, Gronier, Letombe et al. 2012), and in women with depression during pregnancy (Manber, Schnyer et al. 2004, Manber, Schnyer et al. 2010). In women with breast cancer, 12 weeks of acupuncture improved HRQoL and sleep assessed with the Women's Health Questionnaire (Frisk, Kallstrom et al. 2011), general wellbeing assessed with the Symptom Checklist and mood assessed with the Mood Scale (Nedstrand, Wyon et al. 2006). Acupuncture has been found to improve some PCOS related symptoms (Jedel, Labrie et al. 2011, Johansson, Redman et al. 2013), an effect that is partly mediated via modulation of sympathetic nerve activity (Stener Victorin, Jedel et al. 2009). Although there are a few studies indicating that acupuncture may improve symptoms of anxiety and depression in nonPCOS patients, only two randomized controlled trials studies has investigated the effects of acupuncture in women with PCOS (StenerVictorin, Holm et al. 2013, Jin, Pang et al. 2016). Sixteen weeks of acupuncture treatment, twice a week for 2 weeks and thereafter once per week, in women with PCOS resulted in a modest improvement in symptoms of anxiety measured with Brief Scale for Anxiety (BAS) at follow up 4 months after last acupuncture treatment, with no effect in the exercise and no intervention groups (StenerVictorin, Holm et al. 2013). Symptoms of depression measured by Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRSS) was unaffected. In the second study, acupuncture treatment 3 times per week during 3 months significantly reduced the scores of somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety and hostility in the symptom checklist90 (SCL90) and improved more than Diane 35 for 3 months (Jin, Pang et al. 2016). These data suggest continued investigation of the effect of acupuncture on symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with PCOS. None of the studies reported any negative side effects. No studies on acupuncture and disordered eating, body image distress, selfesteem, feminine identity or psychosexual dysfunction in women with PCOS has been found. Summary of key information There are currently no evidence for the use of acupuncture in for management and support of depression and/or anxiety, disordered eating, body image distress, selfesteem, feminine identity or psychosexual dysfunction. Recommendation RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Methodological rigorous trials in women with PCOS with especially symptoms of depression and/or anxiety are important to elucidate whether acupuncture relieve these symptoms as primary outcomes.

Clinical question: Are antidepressants and anxiolytics effective for management and support of depression and/or anxiety or disordered eating in women with PCOS? Contents Narrative synthesis ............................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... 2 ............................................................................................................................... .............................................................................................................. 16 AntiD Anxio evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 2 Narrative synthesis There are a significant number of studies now demonstrating the prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders as well as eating disorders in women diagnosed with PCOS. Consideration of the available treatments is from a clinical practice perspective, as the evidence base from clinical trials of psychotropic medications in PCOS is lacking. Antidepressants and the Management of Mood Disorder in Women with PCOS Mood disorders is the broad term that encapsulates bipolar mood disorder, major depressive disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, dysthymic disorder (which is a type of subclinical depression) and persistent depressive disorder. Each of these mood disorders has a range of multifactorial aetiologies. The Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for Mood Disorders (1), advises that it is useful to construct a template to capture each patients' problems using the biopsychosocial and lifestyle model (BPSL Model) and to consider the predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors. Considering the PCOS patient's problems in this way is particularly useful, since the biological mechanisms related to mood disorder aetiology include altered reproductive and metabolic factors that are part of PCOS. In clinically managing depression in a woman with PCOs, any obvious precipitating environmental factors need to be addressed. Interpersonal violence, recent losses, physical ill health, financial and other social stresses are prominent factors that can trigger or perpetuate depression, in an acute or more persistent manner. It is important to take a careful history from the patient and her family and friends about any manic or hypomanic episodes to delineate bipolar from unipolar mood disorders. This delineation has very important implications for optimal management, prognosis, and avoiding iatrogenic worsening of affective instability. Following physical examination and laboratory investigations aiming to eliminate other comorbid conditions, moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder in women with PCOS, will need antidepressant pharmacotherapy. From clinical experience, antidepressants are useful in managing depression in women with PCOS, who have moderate to severe depression. The first line of antidepressant treatment is usually with one of the following - oxidase inhibitors' and reversible MAOIs. (1) Importantly, many women with PCOS describe premenstrual exacerbation of depressed mood and meet the criteria for a DSM 5 diagnosis of PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). In these women, the first line of treatment is usually with gonadal hormone modulation commonly with a combined oral contraceptive pill. If this is not successful, the next line of treatment is with an antidepressant and the medication of choice is the SSRI sertraline. This SSRI is often prescribed for use during the premenstrual week, ceasing use with menses. If this is inadequate, then sertraline can be prescribed in an ongoing manner. Most SSRIs are used to treat women with combined depression and anxiety symptoms and in particular, sertraline has good anxiolytic benefit. Non responsive depression in women with PCOS usually requires a change of antidepressant from an SSRI to one of the other first line drugs. Second line and third line antidepressants are occasionally needed and can be effective in women with PCOS who have severe depression. Tolerability to side effects is an important determinant of adherence to medication and should be weighed against the efficacy profile of the antidepressant. The newer generation antidepressants are in general better tolerated than tricyclics or MAOIs and cause fewer problems with anticholinergic side effects such as sedation, dry mouth AntiD Anxio evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 3 and constipation Anxiolytics, Antidepressants and the Management of Anxiety Disorders in Women with PCOS Anxiety disorders are common but often non specific in women with PCOS. The \"classical\" symptoms of Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder and the phobias as described in the DSM 5, are often present in women with PCOS in a \"subsyndromal\" manner, making a full diagnosis of specific anxiety disorders difficult. In clinical practice, many women with PCOS present with a history of feeling constantly anxious, with intermittent exacerbation of anxiety symptoms and even panic. Another common clinical observation is the high prevalence of a history of early life trauma or poor attachment to parents, or early life loss/ separations in women with PCOS. In these women, anxiety symptoms are constant and impair their quality of life. This type of anxiety is not very amenable to standard anxiolytic medication treatment. Psychotherapy using a trauma informed care model, is a more useful treatment for this type of anxiety disorder. The most common treatment of anxiety in women with PCOS is usually with nonmedication, psychotherapeutic interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness, and combinations of psychotherapeutic approaches are considered to be the preferred treatment options for anxiety. Benzodiazepines are used in limited, short term fashion in women with PCOS and severe anxiety/ panic, but are not recommended for longer term use because of the addiction issues. In particular, anxiolytics such as alprazolam are rapidly physiologically addictive as well as psychologically addictive, and can be impairing of cognition. It is more common practice to prescribe an SSRI (particularly sertraline) to treat anxiety if the preferred first line psychotherapeutic treatment options have not succeeded. Off label use of very low dose antipsychotics are also used when anxiety symptoms are very severe - but both of these medications can cause weight gain and other metabolic issues - which is not ideal in PCOS. (2) Anxiolytics, Antidepressants and the Management of Eating Disorders in Women with PCOS Eating disorders of both extremes (over and under eating) have a wide range of aetiological factors. In PCOS, where the metabolic issues are critical, the psychological mechanisms involved in causing eating disorders include reactionary behaviours to the symptoms of PCOS, or as a separate comorbid issue. Poor selfesteem, poor selfimage, a desire to control eating when all else seems out of control (seen in anorexic disorders), suppressed rage, a history of abusive relationships including sexual abuse, addictive behaviours and substituting food for other pleasures are some of the psychological drivers for the development of eating disorders. In general antidepressants are used to treat superimposed depression in women with PCOS who have eating disorders. Antidepressants are not usually indicated as specific treatment for eating disorders. Similarly, anxiolytics are not used as standard treatments for eating disorder, but may be used to treat comorbid anxiety. In general, in clinical practice, the actual eating disorder itself does not respond well to antidepressants or anxiolytic medications.

Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence not sought. Additional considerations In PCOS, there is a need to be really sure about a diagnosis of Major Depression Diso rder and/ or Generalised Anxiety Disorder before prescribing medications. Seeking alternate options may be more appropriate, such as treating PCOS symptoms and reducing stigmatising diagnoses. Panel discussion The problem of mental illness in PCOS is a serious and prevalen t one. Hence treatment for depres sion, anxiety, eating disorders and other mental health disorders in PCOS needs consideration despite the poor evidence base to date. Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Don't know Varies Trivial Small Moderate Large Research evidence There are a significant number of studies now demonstrating the pr evalence of depression and anxiety disorders as well as eatin g disorders in women diagnosed with PCOS. Consideration of the available treatments is from a clinical pr actice perspective, since the evid ence base from clinical trials of psychotropic medications in PCOS is lacking. Additional considerations Also, we need to consider the im pact of PCOS related treatments such as COCPs, metformin, anti-androgens,laser therapy weight l oss In addition, treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms may enable women to better adhere to weight loss interventions. AntiD Anxio evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 6 Caution is needed around understanding the prevalence of anxiet y and depression in PCOS. Most evidence is based on studies usin g screening tools rather than clinical interviews establishing a diagnosis. Screening tools are likely to overestimate pr evalence and high quality studies establishing the true prevalence are needed. To expl ain it another way, we know quite a lot about prevalence of symptoms but less about prevalence of clinical disorders. This is an important distinction in t he context of management and medication recommendations. Panel discussion All in agreement for judgement.

Values Is there important uncert ainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence Considerations from the general literature regarding treatment wi th anti-depressants and anxiolyt ics should be considered? Some cause weight gain and may exacerbate PCOS features, which needs to be considered. Additional considerations The different conditions have different responses to antidepressa nt/ anxiolytic treatment - hence the overall judgement is that this varies. Patient surveys indicate that women desire psychological support and identified that th ey did not receive adequate information fr om their physicians. Moreover there were regional differences in concerns over depressive and anxiety symptoms between those residing in Europe and USA.

Additional considerations Antidepressants and anxiolytics are widely available and hence feas ible to prescribe. Therefore this area needs careful conside ration in view of the potential use and misuse of these medications in the PCOS population Panel discussion All in agreement for judgement. AntiD Anxio evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 11 CONCLUSIONS Consensus recommendation If treatment is warranted, psychological th erapy and/or pharmacological treatment should be offered, informed by regional clini cal practice guidelines. ( Will be grouped in guideline with recommendations listed in prevalence framework ) Judgement Strong recommendation against the intervention Conditional recommendation against the intervention 2 Conditional recommendation for either the intervention or the comparison 1 Conditional recommendation for the intervention 3 Strong recommendation for the intervention Justification The specific evidence base for antidepressant/ anxiolytic medica tion use in PCOS is lacking. The justification is based on clin ical observation and general population Mood Disorder guidelines. Overall, the evidence for the us e of antidepressants and anxioly tics in PCOS is very limited. Antidepressants are recommen ded for the treatment of true, sustained Major Depressive Disorder (persistent for more than 4 mont hs), that is not fluctuating depressive symptoms. This should be managed by an experienced health professional. Other PCOS treatments could be considered initially and if the M DD persists and particularly if suicidal symptoms are present, then antidepressant treatment is recommended. Anxiolytics, in particular benzodiazepines are not recommended for anxiety symptoms that are commonly seen in PCOS sufferers. This intermittent and fluctuating anxiety is thought to respond better to psychotherapy, in particular - cognitive be havioural therapy. If anxiety persists and is severe after 12 m onths of psychological therapies, then medical therapy could be used to treat the anxiety. This is useful if depression co-exists or develops as a result of the quality of life impac t of ongoing anxiety. Relevant medications have noted side eff ects including weight gain, agitation, cognitive changes and serotonin syndrome. Anxiol ytics (commonly the benzodiazepines), are associated with physiological and psychological addiction. Subgroup considerations Patients of all age groups and so ciodemographics were considered. Implementation considerations Recommendations can be readily implemented in the primary and ot her health sectors - primarily the recommendation is for cautio n with prescribing these medications and to restrict use to true diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. AntiD Anxio evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 12 Monitoring and evaluation Monitoring of drug side effects is in standard consultations an d routine liver, kidney, full blood function tests conducted by primary health practitioners.

It compared a mindfulness stress management program to no intervention and measured stress, anxiety, depression and quality of life in 46 women with PCOS (23 in mindfulness group and 15 in control group). Statistically significant difference between groups for DASS21 depression and stress subscales; and total life and general satisfaction. Authors conclude that their pilot results are promising for \"ameliorating stress, anxiety, depression and the quality of life in women with PCOS and could be used as an adjunct method to the conventional management of these women\". Narrative synthesis Mental Health Disorders Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of clinically significant selfreported symptoms of depression, anxiety and eating disorders. Available research also suggests that women with PCOS have higher prevalence of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and eating disorders as diagnosed by a psychiatrist using structured clinical interview. In a recent systematic review and metaanalyses (N=30) women with PCOS had increased odds of any depressive symptoms (OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 3.03-4.72; 95% CI: 2.68-6.52; 11 studies). Women with PCOS of any anxiety symptoms (OR: 5.62; 95% CI: 3.22- 9.80, (OR: 6.55; 95% CI: 2.87, 14.93; five studies). When subjects were matched on BMI, women with PCOS still had higher odds of both depressive (OR: 3.25; 95% CI 1.73-6.09; 6.30, 95% CI: 1.88-21.09; three studies). There was no substantial heterogeneity among studies in the overall MA on depressive symptoms (I2 = 22.4%, P = 0.19), but there was significant heterogeneity among studies in the analysis on anxiety symptoms (I2 = 59.6%, P= 0.01). (Cooney et.al. 2017). Most studies used selfreport tools. The two studies which in which mental illness was diagnosed by a psychiatrist also reported elevated levels of depressive disorders and anxiety disorders (Mansson et al., 2008; SayyahMelli et al., 2015). In a recent systematic review and metaanalyses (n=8) women with PCOS had higher odds of having abnormally elevated ED scores when compared to controls (OR 3.05; 95% CI 1.33, 6.99; 4 studies) (Figure 2A). In three of the four studies, the women with PCOS had a higher mean BMI than the controls. Women with PCOS also had higher odds of having any ED diagnosis compared to controls (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.43, 10.49; 4 studies) (Figure 2B). Of the studies reporting the prevalence of specific ED diagnoses, only one used a diagnostic tool, the MINI (M\u00e5nsson et al., 2008). The remaining studies used screening tools and assessed for fulfillment of diagnostic criteria based on the survey answers provided (Bernadett & Szem\u00e1nN, 2016; Karacan et al., 2014; Larsson et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017). In all studies, the women with PCOS had a higher mean BMI than the controls. No studies identified any cases of AN, and none reported data on EDNOS. The odds of BN (OR 2.23; 95% CI 0.66, 7.55; 3 and (OR 3.12; 95%CI 0.83, 11.75; 2 studies, Figure 2D) were increased but not statistically significant. Only one study reported results on NES, with a similar prevalence among women with PCOS compared to controls (12.9% vs. 12.38%, p=1.000) (Lee et al., 2017). Most studies used selfreport tools. The one study which in which mental illness was diagnosed by a psychiatrist also reported elevated levels of depressive disorders and anxiety disorders (Mansson et al., 2008; SayyahMelli et al., 2015). A range of psychological options are effective for the treatment of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. The choice of treatment is dependent on participant characteristics (e.g., age), diagnosis and symptoms severity, and available resources. Psych evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 3 Local clinical practice guidelines typically provide guidance regarding identification, assessment and treatment for these disorders. They typically include information about treatment sequencing when multiple mental health disorders (or comorbid symptoms) are present, matching treatment intensity to symptoms severity including using stepped care treatment models, and consideration of physical health conditions when treating mental health disorders. Links to some relevant guidelines are provided below. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/published?type=csg,cg,mpg,ph,sg,sc National Institute of Mental Health: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/index.shtml American Psychiatric hiatrists/practice/clinical practiceguidelines National Health and Medical Research Centre: https://www.clinicalguidelines.gov.au/ Mental Health Symptoms There is no study investigating prevalence of body image distress in women with PCOS. One study demonstrated that women with PCOS, compared with control women, had a negative body image in 7 out of 10 subscales of the validated Multidimensional BodySelf Relations Questionnaire (3). Women with PCOS appear to feel less physically attractive, healthy or physically fit and are less satisfied with their body size and appearance than women without PCOS (4). Infertile women with PCOS have lower self esteem and body satisfaction as measured with the Body Image Concern Inventory (BICI) than noninfertile women with PCOS (5). Further, hirsute women experienced lower selfesteem than nonhirsute women, and women with menstrual irregularities and higher BMI had more body dissatisfaction (5). The prevalence of psychosexual dysfunction varies from 13.3% to 62.5% in PCOS patients [25]. It appears that women with PCOS suffer from greater psychosexual dysfunction than women in the general population in most studies [6]. Whilst there is limited quality research in this area, studies [68] do show a correlation between PCOS and reduced QoL, sexual satisfaction and feminine identity. Physical PCOS symptoms such as hirsutism, obesity, menstrual irregularity and infertility may cause loss of feminine identity and a feeling of being unattractive which may impact on sexuality [6,7,9]. Women with PCOS also report less sexual satisfaction and lower sexual self worth than women without PCOS and sexual dysfunction impacts more on relationships in women with PCOS [10]. Overall, psychosexual dysfunction appears to be more common in women with PCOS, may be an important issue for the individual woman and is likely to impact on QoL and relationships. Till now, there was only one study [3] published in 2013 showed that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the PCOS group was similar to general population (25% vs 19%; P=0.54), and no significant difference was found according to each domain score of female sexual function index (FSFI). Of note, negative body image, low selfesteem and psychosexual dysfunction are core features and/or common comorbidities of depressive, anxiety and eating disorders. Therefore these symptoms are likely to improve if depressive, anxiety or eating disorders are successfully treated. Psych evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 4 There are no broadly accepted guidelines for the treatment of body image distress, selfesteem, feminine identity or psychosexual dysfunction. Therefore psychological treatment of these mental health symptoms should be guided by the results of systematic reviews and metaanalyses where available, or where they are not available high quality randomised controlled trials. Body Image: Empirical support has been established for the effectiveness of body image cognitivebehavioural (BICBT) interventions in treating negative body image. For example, a metaanalysis of 19 standalone body image cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) found that CBT was effective in improving attitudinal and behavioural aspects of body image, as well as associated depression, anxiety, selfesteem and eating attitudes and behaviour in both clinical (e.g., individuals with eating disorders) and non clinical samples (Jarry & Ip, 2015). A more recent metaanalysis of 63 standalone BI interventions (predominantly cognitivebehavioural based) also concluded that interventions resulted in small to medium improvements in body image and beauty ideal, and a large impact on body ideal internalisation. Effect sizes were larger when studies: (1) used a group intervention format rather than individual interventions, (2) were facilitated (rather than selfhelp), and (3) were conducted across multiple sessions. Thirtyone treatment strategies used in these studies; twelve of these strategies (e.g., monitoring and restructuring of cognitions, exposure exercises) were associated with larger body image improvements, and three were associated with poorer body image (e.g., selfesteem exercises, discussing physical activity; Alleva, Sheeran, Webb, Martijn, & Miles, 2015). Selfesteem: There is surprising little research examining standalone interventions for low selfesteem. The few published studies evaluate a cognitive behavioural treatment program (M. Fennell, 2006) based on a cognitive conceptualisation of low selfesteem (M. J. V. Fennell, 1997). In one of the only randomised controlled trials of this intervention, a 10session individual program resulted in greater improvements in selfesteem, overall functioning, depressive symptoms and number of psychiatric illnesses at the end of treatment. Improvements were maintained at 11 week followup. A second study evaluated this program delivered in a 10session group format. Following treatment participants reported improvements in selfesteem and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Improvements were maintained at 3month followup. This program is available for use in a selfhelp format (M. Fennell, 2006). Recommendations Women with PCOS with depressive, anxiety, and/or eating disorders should be offered treatment guided by regional clinical practice guidelines. Women with PCOS with disordered eating, body image distress, selfesteem, problems with feminine identity or psychosexual dysfunction may be offered cognitive behavioural treatment where appropriate. If multiple mental health disorders are present (i.e., depression, anxiety, eating disorders), rather than psychosocial symptoms (i.e., disordered eating, body image distress, selfesteem, feminine identity or psychosexual dysfunction) psychiatric treatment should be prioritised. Psych evidence review for GDG 2: Emotional wellbeing 5 GRADE framework Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework Is psychological therapy effective for management and support of depression and/or anxiety, disordered eating, body image distr ess, self-esteem, feminine identity or ps ychosexual dysfunction in women with PCOS? QUESTION Question details Population: Women with PCOS Option: Psychological therapy Main outcomes: Depression Anxiety Eating Disorders/Disordered Eating Body Image Distress Low Self-Esteem Feminine Identity Psychosocial Dysfunction Setting: Primary and specialist care Perspective: Patients and health professionals Background Women with PCOS are at increased risk of experiencing depression, anxiety, eating di sorders/disordered eating, body image distr ess, low self-esteem, difficulties with feminine identity and psychosexual dysfunction. Each of these conditions are associated with significant distress and impairment and thu s warrant treatment. These cond itions are also likely to impact on the outcomes of treatments for women with PCOS which makes provision of effective trea tment for these conditions even more important. An evidence review was conducted and one st udy with a small sample size was identified. There is insufficient evidence about e ffectiveness of psychological therapy in women with PCOS, therefore the literature about psychol ogical therapy in the general population has been used to inform this consensus rec ommendation.

Each of these conditions are associated with significant distress and impairment and thu s warrant treatment. These cond itions are also likely to impact on the outcomes of treatments for women with PCOS which makes provision of ef fective treatment for these conditions even more important. There is insufficient evidence about effectiveness of psychologi cal therapy in women with PCOS. Numerous empirically supported treatments (e.g., cognitive behavi our therapy, behaviour therapy, interpersonal therapy) are ava ilable for the treatment of depression, anxiety, eating disorders/disordered eating in the general population. These treatments re sult in clinically significant improvements in the co ndition and associated distress and impairment, as well as broader improvements including quality of lif e and social functioning. Th ese interventions have also been shown to be cost-effe ctive. Available research suggests that psychological treatment, partic ularly cognitive behaviour therapy, is effective in improving b ody image distress and low self-esteem. These treatments have been shown to improve the condition and associ ated distress and impairment. Cost -effectiveness of these interve ntions has not been assessed. There is little evidence of negative effects of empirically supported psychosocial treatments for these conditions. Most empiri cally supported treatments are delivered over multiple sessions (typically 10 - 20), this intensit y of treatment is often not available in pu blic health care systems and/or funded by private health in surance. Additionally, attrition from treatment can be high (up to 30% ). Therefore there is a risk that women will not receive a full dose of treatment. Empirically supported interventions may not be available in some areas.

Contents Summary of evidence ............................................................................................................................... ........................ 2 Important considerations for GRADE ............................................................................................................................... 5 Recommendations ............................................................................................................................... ............................. 8 GRADE framework ............................................................................................................................... Methods Search results ............................................................................................................................... ................................... 17 References ............................................................................................................................... ....................................... 19 Appraisal of included studies ............................................................................................................................... ........... 20 2 Summary of evidence Included studies A systematic review was identified in the original evidence review, with a further two RCTs identified in the updated search, and two RCTs obtained from an update (not yet published) of the systematic review included in the original evidence review. The systematic review had a low risk of bias and included six RCTs (of moderate high risk of bias) for the effectiveness of lifestyle treatment compared to minimal treatment in improving reproductive, metabolic, anthropometric and quality of life factors in women with PCOS [1]. Three of the additional articles identified are secondary analyses of an RCT of exercise versus minimal intervention, included in the aforementioned systematic review, and the fourth is an RCT comparing an exercise intervention to a control group. Methodological quality/risk of bias The Cochrane review was assessed as low risk of bias. The risk of bias of included studies were moderate to high risk of bias, with limitations including: inadequate randomisation, allocation and/or blinding with incomplete data and selective outcome reporting in many of the included studies. Due to the inconsistencies and methodological weaknesses of included studies, caution is recommended when interpreting the combined metaanalyses and results. Certainty of the evidence While the methodology of the systematic review has been assessed as low risk of bias (high quality), the body of evidence in the systematic review is of low certainty with very serious risk of bias, serious risk of inconsistency, serious risk of indirectness, serious risk of imprecision; with no serious risk of publication bias. It is important to note that while the metaanalysis was approved by the Cochrane Review group, the evidence team believe it was not appropriate to combine studies of clinical heterogeneity. The interventions are different across all included studies with three slightly different lifestyle interventions and three exercise intervention studies of different durations (12, 16, 24, and 48 weeks). Study inconsistencies and methodological weaknesses can affect results and caution should be used when interpreting the combined metaanalyses results. Consistency of studies Consistency across the included studies was variable. There were four studies that used structured exercise interventions (Brown 2009; StenerVictorin 2009; Vigorito 2007; Turan 2015) and three that used combined lifestyle modification programmes including diet, exercise and behavioural components (Guzick 1994; Hoeger 2004; Hoeger 2008). The interventions varied in length from 12 to 48 weeks. Five studies had 20 women in the study, with one study having n = 90. Dropout was also variable between studies, with two studies having 0% dropout, and the other studies having 18%, 35%, 43%, and 46%. Control groups either (Brown 2009; Guzick 1994; Hoeger Vigorito 2007). Results The Cochrane Review states that \"Three studies compared physical activity to minimal dietary and behavioural advice or no advice. Three studies compared combined dietary, exercise and behavioural intervention to minimal intervention. There were no studies assessing fertility primary outcomes and no data for metaanalysis on ovulation or menstrual regularity. For secondary outcomes, lifestyle intervention provided benefits compared to minimal treatment for endpoint values for total testosterone (mean difference (MD) 0.27 by FerrimanGallwey score (MD 1.19 95% CI 2.35 to 0.03, p=0.04), weight (MD 3.47 kg 95% CI 4.94 to 2.00, p<0.00001), waist circumference 1.95 cm 95% CI 3.34 to 0.57 p=0.006), waisthipratio (MD 0.04 95% CI 0.07 to (MD 2.02 \u00b5U/mL 95% CI 3.28 to 0.77, p=0.002) and oral glucose tolerance test insulin (standardised mean difference 1.32 95% CI 1.73 to 0.92, p<0.00001) and % weight change (MD 7.00% 95% CI 10.1 to 3.90, p<0.00001). There was no evidence of effect of 3 lifestyle for body mass index, free androgen index, sexhormone binding globulin, glucose or lipids and no data for quality of life, patient satisfaction or acne.\" However, acne and quality of life data was reported in secondary analyses of an RCT included in the Cochrane Review. Side effects were not reported. Results for fertility outcomes are presented below in Table 1, nonfertility outcomes in Table 2, anthropometric outcomes in Table 3, metabolic outcomes in Table 4, and quality of life outcomes in Table 5. Table 1. Fertility outcomes Pregnancy rates In a Cochrane review by Moran et al., no data were available for analysis on pregnancy outcomes, live birth or miscarriage. Menstrual regularity In a Cochrane review by Moran et al., \"no studies reported menstrual regularity as defined in the review methods (initiation of menses or significant shortening of cycle length). The studies reported data as mean\u00b1SD menstrual cycles for lifestyle versus minimal treatment (24 weeks 2.88\u00b11.7 versus 2.85\u00b11.6, MD 0.03 95% CI 1.64 to 1.70, p=0.97 and 48 weeks 5.4\u00b13.6 versus 4.3\u00b12.1 MD (Hoeger 2004), 27/45 (60%) of treatment group having normal menstrual cycles with no reported data for the control group (Vigorito 2007), an average of 2.3 versus 2.5 cycles per 24 weeks for lifestyle compared to controls (Hoeger 2008) and no change in menstrual bleeding pattern for both the control and intervention group with no numeric data provided (StenerVictorin 2009)\" (Analysis 1.1 in the Cochrane Review). In a secondary analysis of StenerVictorin's 2009 RCT included in the Cochrane Review, Jedel et al. 2011 reported a statistically significant difference in menstrual frequency between the exercise group and no intervention group after 16 (p<0.05) and 32 weeks (p<0.05). Ovulation \"No studies reported ovulation as defined in the review methods (number of ovulatory menstrual cycles). The studies reported data as mean\u00b1SD ovulations for lifestyle versus minimal treatment (24 weeks 2.25\u00b11.7 versus 2.23\u00b12.1, MD 0.02 95% CI 1.93 to 1.97, p=0.98, and 48 weeks 6.0\u00b13.6 versus 2.8\u00b12.9 MD 3.20 95% CI 1.02 to 7.42, p=0.14) (Hoeger 2004), 4/6 versus 1/6 people ovulatory in lifestyle versus control group (OR 6.59 95% CI 0.73 to 59.34, p=0.09) (Guzick 1994) and 60% versus 50% ovulatory cycles for lifestyle versus the controls (Hoeger 2008)\" (Analysis 1.1 in the Cochrane Review).

In the Turan study, there was a mean change in BMI (kg/m\u00b2) of 0.1\u00b10.1 in the exercise group vs 0.04\u00b10.1 in the control group (p value not reported). Adiposity distribution In a Cochrane review by Moran et al., \"there was a greater reduction in endpoint WHR (MD 0.04 95% CI 0.07 to 0.00; 113 participants, 3 trials, p=0.02, Analysis 1.4) and endpoint waist circumference (MD 1.95 cm 95% CI 3.34 to 0.57; 108 participants, 2 trials, p=0.006) ... for lifestyle treatment compared to minimal treatment.\" (Analysis 1.5, Figure 5 in the Cochrane Review). In the Turan study, there was a mean change in waist circumference (cm) of 1.18\u00b10.4 in the exercise group vs 0.31\u00b10.1 in the control group (p value not reported). In a secondary analysis of StenerVictorin's 2009 RCT included in the Cochrane Review, Stener Victorin et al. 2012 reported a decrease in waist circumference in the exercise intervention group after 16 and 32 weeks, however this change from baseline was not statistically significant. The no intervention group also had a decrease in waist circumference at 16 weeks but then an increase at 32 weeks. This change from baseline was also not statistically significant. Table 4. Metabolic outcomes from the Cochrane Review [Moran 2010]. Surrogate measures of insulin resistance \"There were greater reductions in endpoint fasting insulin (MD 2.02 \u00b5U/mL 95% CI 3.28 to 0.77; 144 participants, 5 trials, p=0.002, Analysis 1.6) (Figure 6) and endpoint OGTT insulin (SMD 1.32 95% CI 1.73 to 0.92; 121 participants, 3 trials, p<0.00001) ... for lifestyle treatment compared to minimal treatment.\" (Analysis 1.7 in the Cochrane Review) In the Turan study, there was a mean change in fasting insulin (U/ml) of 0.8\u00b10.1 in the exercise group vs 0.2\u00b10.2 in the control group (p < 0.05, between difference scores of exercise and control groups). Glucose tolerance \"There was no evidence of effect for endpoint fasting glucose (MD 0.09 mmol/L 95% CI 0.20 to 0.03; 144 participants, 5 trials, p=0.15, Analysis 1.8) or endpoint OGTT glucose (SMD 0.02 95% 0.38 to 0.33; 121 participants, 3 trials, p=0.90) ... for lifestyle compared to minimal treatment.\" (Analysis 1.9 in the Cochrane Review). In the Turan study, there was a mean change in fasting glucose (mg/dl) of 4.4\u00b12.5in the exercise group vs 0.4\u00b10.3 in the control group (p < 0.05, between difference scores of exercise and control groups). Lipid profile \"There was no evidence of effect for endpoint lipids measured as total cholesterol (MD 0.14 mmol/L 95% CI 0.31 to 0.03; 132 participants, 4 trials, LDLC (MD 0.15 mmol/L 95% CI 0.37 to 0.07; participants, 4 trials, p=0.18), HDLC (MD 0.04 mmol/L 95% CI 0.14 to 0.07; 132 participants, 4 trials, p=0.50) or triglycerides (MD 0.01 mmol/L 95% CI 0.09 to 0.11; 132 participants, 4 trials, p=0.87) ... for lifestyle treatment compared to minimal treatment.\" (Analysis 1.10 in the Cochrane Review). In the Turan study, there was a mean change in triglycerides (mg/dl) of 2.8\u00b11.3 in the exercise group vs 0.8\u00b10.4 in the control group (p < 0.05, between difference scores of exercise and control groups). There was also a mean change in total cholesterol (mg/dl) of 3.4\u00b11.1 in the 5 exercise group vs 0.2\u00b10.7 in the control group (p < 0.05, between difference scores of exercise and control groups), a mean change in LDLC (mg/dl) of 8.62\u00b11.5 in the exercise group vs 0.1\u00b10.2 in the control group (p < 0.05, between difference scores of exercise and control groups), and a mean change in HDLC (mg/dl) of 0.6\u00b10.1 in the exercise group vs 0.0\u00b10.5 in the control group (p value not reported). Table 5. Quality of life outcomes from Turan 2015 Short form36 summary scores (after 16 weeks directly after treatment) For the physical component, there was a mean change of 1.6 \u00b1 6.2 in the exercise group vs 3.2 \u00b1 4.6 in the control group (p value not significant).

For menstruation, there was a mean change of 0.4 \u00b1 1.0 in the exercise group vs 0.4 \u00b1 0.8 in the control group (p value not significant). Important considerations for GRADE Outcomes No studies reported rates of pregnancy, live birth, or miscarriage. For the outcome of menstrual regularity, four studies were noted, but these did not report outcomes as defined by the Cochrane Review methods, however a secondary analysis of StenerVictorin's 2009 RCT included in the Cochrane Review by Jedel et al. 2011, did report on menstrual frequency. For ovulation outcomes, three studies were noted, but these did not report outcomes as defined by the review methods. Weight (endpoint) was only reported by two studies, and weight (% change) was only measured by one study, therefore caution is recommended when interpreting these results for any clinical application. The metaanalysis for the outcome of adiposity included only three studies, two of which were exercise studies, and this may indicate a bias towards studies from exercise. No study reported on acne. Subgroups There were no population subgroup analyses presented in any of the studies. However, it is noted that the majority of participants were likely to be European Caucasians. Caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to other ethnic populations. Only one study included in the Cochrane Review investigated adolescent females; however there was no subgroup analysis for this study presented. Furthermore, subgroup analyses for overweight and normal weight women are lacking. Generalisability 6 Evidence from the included studies is generalisable to the target population of women with PCOS, particularly to women who are overweight. There may be limitations to generalizing these findings to other ethnic groups, especially to nonEuropean populations. Generalisability applies only to a particular lifestyle regime compared to no treatment or minimal treatment. There are reservations about generalising the metaanalysis findings of this review to any one specific diet, exercise, or lifestyle treatment, because the metaanalysis was an aggregated analysis of the included studies which had used various treatments. The review states that \"There is no existing RCT data identified in this review to assess whether lifestyle intervention improves reproductive outcomes including fertility, menstrual regularity, ovulation or acne, and there is no evidence that lifestyle intervention inducing this magnitude of weight loss improves metabolic outcomes including fasting or OGTT glucose or lipid profiles [1].\" There needs to be more high quality studies comparing different types of lifestyle treatments to minimal treatment that measure these outcomes. Furthermore, there is lack of longterm follow up data since most studies were of short duration. Applicability The evidence obtained from the Cochrane Review and three secondary analyses of an RCT included in the Cochrane Review on diet, exercise, and lifestyle treatments may be applicable to an international healthcare context. However there may be some differences in resource needs to implement the lifestyle treatments. A clinical judgment about applicability will need to accompany any recommendations. Lifestyle modification treatment is applicable in different health care settings for example in general outpatient care but also within specialist care such as reproductive medicine and endocrinology. However, applicability may vary depending on country, health care system and resources. Resource requirements It is likely that substantial resources are need to implement a lifestyle intervention for weight and health benefits. The evidence of resource requirements is uncertain and may vary considerably across different settings and countries. Other factors are the type and duration of intervention, as well as the intervention intensity which reflects the number and duration of facetoface contacts. However, the use of mHealth, eHealth tools or group programs within this domain may be used to offset high resource requirements and more intensive interventions. Challenging in consultation time. Cost effectiveness A clinical judgment about cost effectiveness will need to accompany any recommendations. Health economy studies are lacking in this area and therefore the evidence of cost effectiveness is low. Lifestyle modification treatment should be compared to minimal treatment or no treatment but also to pharmacological treatment and surgery. Efficient lifestyle modification resulting in longlasting healthy lifestyle and weight reduction and eventually reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are likely to be highly cost effective. Doesn't apply for lean women. Equity A clinical judgment will need to accompany any recommendations and address: Differences in relative effectiveness of the intervention for disadvantaged groups or different baseline conditions across disadvantaged subgroups that affect the absolute effectiveness. 7 There is limited evidence of effectiveness for subpopulations such as different ethnical groups, adolescents and adults, normalweight and overweight populations, patients with comorbidity, and disabled and handicapped individuals. Furthermore, effectiveness could also be dependent on cultural and socioeconomic factors including education and household income. Rural and remote considerations Acceptability A clinical judgment will need to accompany any recommendations and address: Whether key stakeholders are likely not to accept the balance of benefits, harms and costs; or the costs or undesirable effects in the short term for desirable effects in the future; or likely to disagree with the values attached to the desirable and undesirable effects; or not to accept the option because of ethical concerns. The acceptability of lifestyle modification therapy is likely to be high for stakeholders since the risk benefit balance is estimated to be favourable with very low risks of harm or undesirable effects. Data on patient acceptability or satisfaction is lacking. Strategies are needed to improve adherence and minimize the dropout rate. No ethical barriers have been identified. Health professional capability, access, resources and time will influence acceptability. Socioeconomic, cultural factors. Feasibility A clinical judgment will need to accompany any recommendations and address: Whether it is feasible to sustain the option and to address potential barriers to implementation. Feasibility is dependent on the specific setting, provider, resources and country. Most studies have been performed in academic settings and not in clinical settings. However, there should be no major barriers for implementation of lifestyle treatment in health care if there are essential resources for implementation. Socioenomic status and geographical location and health system may influence feasibility and access. Policy settings, health system enablers, education and engagement of health professionals and patient considerations (such as the cost of longer consultations and/or consultations with other health professionals) will affect feasibility. Health literacy. Implementation A clinical judgment will need to accompany any recommendations and address: Factors that should be considered when implementing the consideration, including strategies to address concerns about acceptability, feasibility, timeframe, who is responsible and accountability. Dissemination, translation evaluation and scale up is critical. This covers policy and systems level health professional and population level factors. Monitoring and evaluation A clinical judgment will need to accompany any recommendations and address: any indicators that should be monitored and should implementation of the recommendation be evaluated. Longterm followup of all important outcomes should be recorded and evaluated. Research priorities 8 A clinical judgment will need to accompany any recommendations and address: any important uncertainties in relation to any of the criteria that are a priority for further research Further high quality research is needed regarding the efficacy of: Lifestyle intervention: different types (diet alone, exercise alone, behavioural modification alone or combined approaches) delivery methods including eHealth/mHealth approaches different durations of treatment provided by different health care professionals longterm followup For different outcomes: weight loss, weight maintenance and weight gain prevention menstrual regularity, ovulation, pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage insulin resistance, glucose tolerance and serum lipids emotional wellbeing, quality of life, participant satisfaction attrition and sustainability For different subpopulations: normalweight and overweight adolescents, adults women with comorbidities disabled individuals healthcare disparities (or different socioeconomic groups) longterm followup of children (fertility success, metabolic outcomes) ethnicities life stages cost effectiveness implementation and health systems research Recommendations EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATION conditional Lifestyle modification therapy (single or combined approaches of diet, exercise and/or behavioural interventions) should be recommended in women with PCOS and overweight or obesity for reductions in weight, central obesity and insulin resistance. CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION Healthy lifestyle behaviours encompassing healthy eating and regular physical activity should be recommended in all women with PCOS for achieving and maintaining healthy weight, improving hormonal outcomes, general health, and quality of life across the life course. 9 GRADE: Desirable, mainly from general population data. Undesirable few. Balance of effects positive. Equity may be an issue re access to lifestyle intervention.

Practice points Achievable goals (5% to 10% loss of body weight in overweight women) yield significant clinical improvements - adopt obesity treatment guideline rec 2013 re duration and percent and based on PCOS data. Ongoing assessment and monitoring of outcomes is important. Psychological factors (eg. body image concerns, depression), stigma and personal sensitivities should be considered and managed to optimise engagement and adherence to lifestyle interventions. Health professional interactions should be respectful and patientcentred. Health professionals should consider marginalisation and potential weightrelated stigma. Women's healthy lifestyle individualised preferences should be considered. Differences in culture and ethnicity should be considered when optimising lifestyle and weight management. Adolescent and ethnicspecific BMI and waist circumference categories should be considered when optimising lifestyle and weight management. Healthy lifestyle may derive health and quality of life benefits in the absence of weight loss. Monitoring and selfmonitoring (query for behaviour) Healthy lifestyle and optimal weight management is the joint responsibility of all health professionals, partnering with women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Where complex issues arise, referral to allied health professionals should be considered. Cultural - obesity perception of prosperity Hirsutism RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION More high quality RCTs are needed to investigate the extent of the benefits of lifestyle modification therapy on all clinically relevant outcomes compared to no or minimal treatment. Specific research is needed assessing the efficacy of different types of lifestyle management (diet alone, exercise alone, behavioural modification alone or combined approaches), the effect of lifestyle modification therapy for weight maintenance compared to weight loss, the effect of lifestyle modification therapy for women with PCOS who are both overweight and not overweight, adolescents and adults, and specific reproductive outcomes such as menstrual regularity, ovulation and fertility and the relative efficacy of lifestyle modification therapy either compared to or in combination with pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, longterm followup studies are needed. 10 Better definition of behavioural interventions - replicable components.

Studies using any definition of PCOS or overweight we re included in this review with the trialist's definition of PCOS and overweight described.\" N 6 studies. Intervention n = 128. Control n = 104. Please note all these studies may not have assessed our outcomes of interest. Setting Four studies were conducted in medical and clinical research centres in the USA. One study was done in a university hospital in Sweden. Another study was done with a medical school in Italy. Intervention/indicator Reference Intervention Brown 2009 Exercise dose of 14 kcal/kg of baseline weight/week (~228 min/wk) at 40-60% peak VO 2. No more than 60 minutes of exercise in a 24h period. Exercise was performed on either the stationary bicycle, elliptical machine or treadmill. Sessions were conducted under supervision. The total exercise intervention was 2024 weeks which included a812 week ramp up phase followed by a 12week moderate intensity exercise program. Weight and diet were maintained Guzick 1994 Weight loss, 12 week behavioural weight control program comprising 8 weeks of very low calorie diet (Optifast, additional meals and multivitamin supplement) then reintroduction of foods and gradual increase in energy intake until 42005040 kJ/day reached. Behaviour modification training around eating behaviours, increasing energy expenditure (1050 kJ/week extra 4200 kJ/week extra, 2 miles, 5x week). Hoeger 2004 Weight loss, lifestyle intervention with placebo defined as 710% weight loss, registered dietitian/exercise physiologists, individualised meal plan with 5001000 calorie deficit/day (50% carbohydrate, 25% protein, 25 % fat, low GI foods, individualised exercise plan 150 minutes/week). Intervention was 48 weeks; two phases. Intensive phase included progress monitoring and group meetings weekly for 024 weeks. Maintenance phase biweekly progress monitoring and group meetings for 2548 weeks. Hoeger 2008 24 week weight loss, lifestyle intervention versus placebo. Closed group intervention format, 56 members per group, participants and one adult family member (parent or guardian) in series of 16 structured training classes on diet, exercise and behaviour modification skills with frequent contact, flexible personal strategies, selfesteem and social 21 support. Therapy goals of a 57% weight loss and a level of exercise of at least 150 minutes/week. Exercise was not monitored. StenerVictorin 2009 (Jedel 2011, StenerVictorin 2012, and StenerVictorin 2013 are secondary analyses of this RCT, included in updated search) Weight maintenance, aerobic exercise: Instructed to do 3045 min 3x week moderate intensity exercise (eg.brisk walking, cycling, aerobic) beyond daily physical activity with pulse frequency above 120/min and weekly followup and guidance for 16 weeks. Vigorito 2007 Not specifically aimed to induce weight loss, 12 week, structured supervised training sessions 3 x/week, 5 min warm up and cool down, 30 minute exercise with 6070% V02 max bicycle ergometer. Comparison/control Reference Comparison Brown 2009 No change in lifestyle. Guzick 1994 No change in lifestyle. Hoeger 2004 Placebo plus no change in lifestyle. Hoeger 2008 Standard advice on nutrition and exercise for healthy living and seen monthly. StenerVictorin 2009 No exercise, given same information about importance of physical activity and diet as physical activity group in one session by a physiotherapist and given option to phone study coordinator at any point. Vigorito 2007 No training program. Both intervention and control received general dietary and behavioural advice without structured calorie restriction program, healthy balanced meal plan encouraged (50% carbohydrate, 25% protein, 25% fat, low GI food intake). 22 Outcomes Primary outcomes: Fertility outcomes (pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage), menstrual regularity (an initiation of menses or significant shortening of cycle length where possible), menstrual frequency, and ovulation (number of ovulatory menstrual cycles where possible). Secondary outcomes: Reproductive factors: Total testosterone, SHBG, estimates of free BMI, circumference, waisttohip ratios (WHR)), waist circumference Metabolic factors: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose, lipid profile (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), triglycerides), fasting glucose and insulin, surrogate measures of insulin resistance (OGTT insulin). Quality of life and participant satisfaction (secondary outcome) Inclusion Criteria Studies: RCTs only. Crossover RCTs were also considered. reproductive age (postmenarchal and premenopausal) with PCOS. Studies using any definition of PCOS or overweight were included in this review with the trialist's definition of PCOS and overweight described.\" Intervention: \"Lifestyle intervention was defined as a structured dietary, exercise or behavioural intervention (both designed to induce weight loss through an energy deficit or not designed to induce weight loss through an energy deficit)\". \"A structured program refers to more than one study visit allocated to implementation of the dietary, exercise or behavioural treatment.\" Minimal treatment was defined as \"either no treatment or standard unstructured minimal dietary, exercise or behavioural advice.\" This systematic review included trials examining: dietary intervention versus minimal treatment, exercise intervention (resistance or aerobic exercise) versus minimal treatment, behavioural management techniques for modifying diet or exercise versus minimal treatment, combination of dietary, exercise and/or behavioural intervention versus minimal treatment. All study duration lengths over two weeks were included. Exclusion Criteria Studies: Quasirandomised trials. Population: \"Conditions Participants were not excluded based on DM2, comorbidities or medication use for clinical or metabolic features of PCOS as long as this medication use was not a primary component of the intervention or control arms. In this scenario, DM2, comorbidities or medication use was noted and the effects on outcome measures assessed. Participants were not excluded based on ethnicity.\" 23 Intervention: Any study that used lifestyle treatment in both groups. Study Validity. Is it clear that there were no conflicts of interest in the writing or funding of this review? Yes. All authors state their funding sources and current research. Two authors have funding from four pharmaceutical companies, but it is unclear how this would affect the Cochrane Review. Does the review have a clearly focused question? Yes. Is a systematic review appropriate? Yes. Does the review have specified inclusion/exclusion criteria? Yes. If there were specified inclusion/ exclusion criteria, were these appropriate? Partial. It was unclear how complementary medicines and therapies may have fitted in the lifestyle intervention category (e.g. Chinese medicines, acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine). Herbal medicines or supplements are not mentioned either. However, this study included a study that looked at meal replacement supplement (Optifast), so it is assumed that meal replacement supplements were part of the treatment inclusion criteria. Does the review document a comprehensive search strategy? Yes. Were reviewers blind to authors, institutions and affiliations? No. The reviewers were notblind to the study authors, institutions and affiliations. Were 2 or more independent reviewers used for: 1. application of inclusion criteria to assess eligibility of studies? Yes. 2. extraction of data from study reports? Yes. 3. appraisal of study quality? Yes. 24 Were the strengths and limitations of included studies and potential impact on the results discussed? Yes. Was the validity of included trials appraised using appropriate criteria? Yes. Is there a summary of the results of individual studies? Yes. If metaanalyses were conducted, was it reasonable to do so? Yes. Metaanalysis was done and was approved by the Cochrane Review group to do so. However, there are a few issues that really depend on whether the review group take a \"lumping\" or \"splitting\" attitude to metaanalysis. Studies used slightly different lifestyle (three studies) or exercise regimes (three studies) to each other. The methodological quality of all studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. How the study inconsistencies and methodological weaknesses affects clinical outcomes overall is variable and specific to individual studies, and caution should be used when interpreting the combined metaanalyses and results. There were three studies that used exercise and three that used combined lifestyle modification programmes, with the outcome measurements being done at various times (12, 16, 24, and 48 weeks). Five studies had 20 women in the study, with one study having n = 90. Dropout was also variable between studies, with two studies having 0% dropout, and the other studies having 18%, 35%, 43%, and 46%. If metaanalyses were conducted, was it done appropriately? Yes. Other What is the overall risk of bias? Low. Author's Conclusions. Lifestyle intervention improves body composition, hyperandrogenism (high male hormones and clinical effects) and insulin resistance in PCOS. There was no evidence of effect for lifestyle intervention on improving glucose tolerance or lipid profiles and no literature assessing clinical reproductive outcomes, quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Our Comments/Summary. This Cochrane Review had a low risk of bias. 25 The 6 included studies had a moderate to high risk of bias, so the metaanalysis should be interpreted with caution because the quality of the studies on which they are based are of poor to moderate quality. A GRADE table included with the metaanalyses would have been useful to help indicate to readers the risk of bias for the various metaanalyses. Caution must be used when generalising the findings to populations other than Caucasians because of the lack of other ethnicities tested. All but one study assessed the interventions in adults. Only one assessed the intervention in adolescents (Hoeger et al 2008). The Cochrane Review also notes that \"For all studies, the intervention group had a greater number of study visits compared to the control groups, indicating a difference in researcher contact and intervention intensity which may exaggerate the intervention effect. Other factors affecting the implementation of a lifestyle intervention in research or clinical settings include the range of intervention intensities, visit numbers, training of intervention providers and group versus individual treatment formats. This indicates caution both with directly combining results and practically extrapolating research results to clinical practice.\" There are a few questions about the \"splitting or lumping\" of studies that affects the validity of the metaanalysis and really depends on which approach the particular Cochrane Review group tends to take. It seems that this review fell under the \"lumping\" category for metaanalysis. The Cochrane Review states that \"The study durations ranged from 12 weeks (Brown 2009; Guzick 1994; Vigorito 2007), 16 weeks (StenerVictorin 2009), 24 weeks (Hoeger 2008) and 48 weeks (Hoeger 2004)\" and that \"The lifestyle intervention was either a structured physical activity intervention (Brown 2009; StenerVictorin 2009; Vigorito 2007) or a intervention (Guzick 1994; Hoeger 2004; Hoeger 2008). Interventions weight loss (Guzick 1994; Hoeger 2004; Hoeger 2008) or not specifically induce weight loss (Vigorito 2007) or to be weight maintenance (Brown 2009; StenerVictorin 2009)\" and \"Control groups either received no lifestyle advice (Brown 2009; Guzick 1994; Hoeger of treatment varied a lot between studies, and the lifestyle treatments also varied. It can be debated whether or not the meta analyses should have been \"lumped together\" or split to make it more valid. If these studies come under the banner of \"lifestyle\" treatments then it may be valid to lump them together, but a subgroup metaanalyses could have been done for the different lifestyle treatments as well. There were some limitations to the analysis in the Cochrane Review that can only be answered with further studies that measure those particular outcomes. With regards to the volume of evidence for each outcome presented in the Cochrane Review it is noted that no studies reported on pregnancy, live birth, or miscarriage. For the menstrual regularity outcome four studies were noted, but these did not report outcomes as defined by the Cochrane Review methods. For ovulation outcomes, three studies were noted, but these did not report outcomes as defined by the Cochrane Review methods. Other metaanalyses reported in the Cochrane review used five or less of the included studies, and used the exercise and lifestyle studies in nearly equal proportions for each metaanalyses. Weight (endpoint) only used two studies, and weight (% change) only used one study, so caution should be used in interpreting these results for any clinical application. The adiposity metaanalysis only had three studies included, with two being exercise studies, so there may be a lack of volume of evidence and a skew towards studies from exercise. 26 Data Extraction Template (adopted from Cochrane review in print) Review title: Review ID: Lifestyle and PCOS Study ID : Turan 2015 Reference ID: Person extracting data: TC Date of date extraction: 8/3/17 Year of study publication: 2015 Title: Benefits of structured exercise in non-overweight women with ovary A, Tosun G, Mat E, Gezer C, Malkoc M.

Narrative synthesis Clinical need for the question Lifestyle intervention (diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions) is first line PCOS treatment. With weight gain increasing in women across the population, and prevention of weight gain a national and international priority, the need for preventive strategies also extends to PCOS [1]. Indeed, women with PCOS demonstrate a greater mean 10 year weight gain of 8.9kg (95% CI: [2] which translates to ~1kg average expected weight gain in PCOS per year compared to the mean of ~600 grams/year in young women without PCOS . Previous lifestyle intervention studies in PCOS have focused on shortterm dietary interventions with or without an exercise component. Numerous uncontrolled dietary intervention studies which have shown limited success, with an overall weight loss effect of between 515% of initial body weight in addition to improvement in complications exacerbated by weight gain including IR, menstrual dysfunction and psychological features [3], however retention and sustainability were suboptimal. With the majority of lifestyle intervention studies focused on dietary intervention there is an unmet need to explore other strategies in PCOS, including behaviour change interventions. Behavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions are the most commonly used psychological approaches to weight management. Behaviour therapy results in significantly greater weight loss than placebo, and behaviour/cognitive behaviour therapy combined with diet and exercise is more effective than diet and exercise interventions alone. More intensive behavioural interventions were associated with greater weight loss [4]. Behavioural and cognitive behavioural intervention approaches target the behaviours (and their antecedents and consequences) and cognitions thought to be maintaining a positive energy balance [5]. Behavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions have the strongest empirical support in the treatment of overweight/obesity and are recommended by international practice guidelines for the treatment of overweight and obesity [e.g., 6, 7]. One study evaluating engagement within a multidisciplinary PCOS clinic comprising a dietitian, health psychologist, gynaecologist and endocrinologist treating adolescents supports incorporation of 'behavioural intervention', reporting enhanced weight loss outcomes when combined with dietary consultation compared to receiving neither or dietary advice only (1.3\u00b14.2kg vs 2.0\u00b12.8kg or 1.2\u00b14.3kg, respectively; [8]). Yet, specific techniques implemented were not well defined or replicable and other outcomes including changes to metabolic, reproductive and psychosocial functioning were not assessed. Two randomised controlled trials have evaluated interventions that included behavioural components. Both provided minimal detail regarding the behavioural component of the interventions. Hoeger [9] reported the use of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention with placebo encompassing nutrition, behaviour and physical 2 activity delivered over 24 weekly interactive group session followed by a maintenance program incorporating 12 group sessions conducted over 24 weeks compared to placebo alone. Significant weight reduction occurred at 48 weeks in the lifestyle group but the change was not significantly different from the placebo group. Hoeger [10] reported the use of a lifestyle modification program incorporating training in diet, exercise, and behaviour modification skills. This intervention targeted selfesteem and social support and combined frequent contact, structured lectures and personalised strategies. The 24week program combined individual appointments and 16 group sessions. Parents and adolescents attended separately. Serum levels of SHBG increased, and free androgen index and plasminogen activator1 decreased significantly in the lifestyle group but not in the placebo group. These program descriptions do not provide important information about the theoretical framework of the behavioural intervention, or the combination and intensity of the behavioural strategies used. In the absence of research examining and/or describing behavioural weight loss interventions in women with PCOS, treatment decisions may be informed by the research in other weight related comorbidities, for example type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A comprehensive systematic review of lifestyle interventions in populations at risk of Type II Diabetes or Cardiovascular Disease summarised key successful factors of varying combinations of lifestyle interventions related to improved diet and physical activity behaviours [11]. Use of behavioural change techniques in combination with diet and exercise interventions resulted in greater weight loss than diet and/or physical activity alone [11]. In particular, clustering of behaviour change techniques with emphasis on selfmanagement appears to enhance efficacy of weight loss and diet and physical activity behaviour change [11]. Social support from family members potentiates intervention outcomes, with evidence to suggest greater weight outcome measures at up to 12 months post intervention when social support from family is targeted, compared with interventions not incorporating social support [11]. Mode of delivery and intervention facilitator (with appropriate training), setting and intensity did not appear to significantly alter outcomes [11]. Overall, these findings support the addition of: 1/ established behaviour change techniques (goal setting, problem solving, goal review and active feedback) 2/ selfmanagement/ selfmonitoring techniques and 3/ social support to preventive lifestyle interventions [11]. These findings are largely consistent with international practice guidelines for the treatment of overweight and obesity [e.g., 6]. For example, the Australian NHMRC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Overweight and Obesity promote the use of behaviour change techniques and psychological therapies in conjunction with lifestyle interventions [6, pg 45]. These guidelines also highlight the need for resources (e.g., written, audio visual) and the potential for internet programs to supplement to face to face support. The strategies recommended by these guidelines include; goalsetting, selfmonitoring, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, assertiveness training, slowing the rate of eating, reinforcing changes, and relapse prevention. Previous research has also demonstrated that extending treatment up to 12months can result in greater weight loss and delayed weight regain, but participant retention is a challenge. Continued contact after treatment (facetoface or telephone) does improve weightloss maintenance. Including support people in treatment (e.g., partner, friend) is associated with better weight loss and weightloss maintenance. Combining behavioural/cognitive behavioural weight loss interventions with more intensive interventions including very low calorie diets and weight loss medications results in better weight loss than using these interventions alone [1215]. Evidence to answer the question We did not identify any evidence in women with PCOS to answer the question and therefore the efficacy of behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions for improving anthropometric, 3 metabolic, reproductive, fertility, quality of life and emotional wellbeing outcomes remains unclear and research recommendations have been made. Recommendation CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION Lifestyle interventions could include behavioural strategies (goalsetting, selfmonitoring, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, assertiveness training, slowing the rate of eating, reinforcing changes, and relapse prevention) to optimise weight management and/or health behaviour change and emotional wellbeing in women with PCOS, as per general population recommendations [e.g., 6]. Comprehensive health behavioural or cognitive behavioural interventions could be considered to provide support, increase engagement, retention and adherence and improve maintenance of health behaviour change and improve health outcomes in women with PCOS. Important considerations for GRADE Justification In comparable populations, including adults at risk of Type 2 Diabetes development, use of behavioural change strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions in combination with diet and exercise interventions is associated with greater weight loss than diet and/or physical activity alone. In particular, emphasis on selfmanagement components appears to enhance efficacy of weight loss and health behaviour change. Overall, these findings support the addition of: 1/ established behaviour change techniques (goal setting, selfmonitoring, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, assertiveness training, slowing the rate of eating, reinforcing changes, and relapse prevention)[6] 2/ selfmanagement/ self monitoring techniques and 3/ social support to preventive lifestyle strategies in PCOS. Subgroups Behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions appears to be effective over a wide range of subgroups with effectiveness noted across varying BMI, age and ethnic groups in the general population [5], supporting broad application. In adolescents and in some cultural subgroups engagement of family members should be considered. Resource requirements Evidence in general population demonstrates behavioural interventions can be delivered with equal efficacy by a range of trained health professionals (i.e. doctors, nurses, dietitians/nutritionists, exercise specialists and trained health professionals). Similarly behavioural intervention appears efficacious across a range of delivery methods - individual, group, mixed and remote methods. Evidence does generally support a positive relationship between amount of contact or frequency of visits and improved outcomes, including weight loss and dietary modification. However previous randomised trials have demonstrated that lowintensity contact with minimal resources is sufficient to prevent weight gain in high risk groups, including women of reproductive age [1618]. Primary resources required would include adequate training in behavioural lifestyle change, including engagement skills consistent with motivational interviewing as well as skills to facilitate goal setting, problem solving, improved selfmanagement strategies and application of active listening. 4 Policy context, health system, resources and health professional training and access as well as geographical region will influence resource requirements and availability. In general current resources are inadequate for delivery of intensive lifestyle interventions. Cost effectiveness High quality evidence to assess this criterion is limited. Regional circumstances should be considered when assessing cost and resources. Equity Evidence supports positive outcomes including increased physical activity and weight loss in lower and higher risk populations including participants of higher and lower starting weight, sedentary and nonsedentary groups and groups at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Effectiveness may be reduced in the presence of chronic disease, including those with Type 2 Diabetes compared to those without, necessitating the need for more intensive multidisciplinary care. Acceptability Health professional training, time, capability and confidence may limit acceptability for implementation of behavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions. Barriers could be related to the balance between consultation time available and efficacy to induce change. Feasibility - use statement about policy etc in other sections Policy settings, health system enablers, education and engagement of health professionals and patient considerations (such as the cost of longer consultations and/or consultations with other health professionals) will affect feasibility. Implementation Barriers to implementation could include resources available to health care professionals, adequate training and clinical acceptability related to time, potentially increased engagement with additional health care providers and increased patient contact. Yet behavioural intervention could be applied as a form of shared decision making by health professionals and used as a strategy to replace traditional education approaches in health care. Health professional resources, including frameworks and behavioural change approaches following training in conjunction with guidelines could help address barriers to implementing behavioural change intervention in the treatment of PCOS. Education of health professionals lifestyle interventions and interdisciplinary approaches. Policy settings, health system enablers, education and engagement of health professionals and patient considerations (such as the cost of longer consultations and/or consultations with other health professionals) need to be considered in implementation. Some consumer targeted resources (including books, websites and online programs) claim benefits for specific macronutrient composition for women with PCOS, so greater education for consumers and health professionals around evidence based dietary approaches is important. Monitoring and evaluation A clinical judgment will need to accompany any recommendations and address: any indicators that should be monitored and should implementation of the recommendation be evaluated. 5 Longterm followup of all important outcomes should be recorded and evaluated. Selfmonitoring of health behaviours (eg. Daily steps, fruit and vegetable consumption) and outcomes (eg. Menstrual cycles and/or weight) supported by health professional feedback for the woman with PCOS, is vital for lifestyle intervention efficacy. Evaluation of lifestyle integration into routine care Attendance of sessions Process and outcome evaluations are required during implementation and scale up. Population and health administrative data to could be used to assess uptake of the guideline. Research Recommendations Highquality randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions to optimise health behaviour change and/or weight management are required to evaluate additional benefits of adding of behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions to dietary and/or exercise prescription approaches in this population for improved anthropometric, metabolic, reproductive, fertility, quality of life and emotional wellbeing outcomes . Longitudinal evaluation from PCOS specific research would address current gaps and provide insight across feasibility, acceptability, implementation and efficacy. Highquality randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions in women with polycystic ovary syndrome are important to address: The extent of the additional benefits of adding behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions to standalone dietary and/or exercise prescription approaches in improving weight, metabolic, reproductive and psychosocial wellbeing; Provide evidence of the efficacy of differing types of lifestyle management; Provide evidence for the effect of behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions across varying phenotypic profiles of women with polycystic ovary syndrome including variation by body mass index categories of healthy, overweight or obese; Provide evidence for the effect of behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions in the prevention of weight gain compared to weight loss. Provide evidence for the effect of behavioural strategies and/or behavioural/cognitive behavioural interventions for improved metabolic (i.e. insulin resistance), reproductive (i.e. menstrual dysfunction, infertility) and psychosocial dysfunction (i.e. quality of life, depression, anxiety, disordered eating) in women with PCOS. 6 References 1.

One high quality RCT with a low risk of bias investigating the changes in anthropometric and metabolic outcomes by comparing a DASH diet with a control diet [2, 3]. One low quality RCT with a high risk of bias investigating the changes in anthropometric and metabolic outcomes by comparing a high protein diet with a normal protein diet [4]. Methodological quality/risk of bias Methodological limitations and factors contributing to a higher risk of bias included inadequate or unstated allocation concealment, inadequate and unstated blinding of participants, investigators, care providers and/or assessors. Blinding of participants and researchers is difficult for lifestyle interventions and could be supported by outcome assessor blinding. Some studies were either not powered adequately or it was unclear if it was powered at all. A high dropout rate of participants was observed in one study [1] which will bias outcomes. Certainty of the evidence The body of evidence included here is of very low certainty with serious risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision; with no serious risk of inconsistency or publication bias. Consistency of studies There was a broad range of ages and BMI in the women included in the studies. Participants were not taking other medication (e.g. oral contraceptives, hormones, insulinsensitising agents) immediately before or during the studies. The macronutrient composition of the intervention and control treatments varied between studies because the studies emphasized changing different components of a diet. One study compared HP to HC diets [1], and one study compared HP to NP [4]. The other study compared a DASH diet to a control diet [2, 3]. The total energy load of the diets also varied, with one allowing a 4187 kJ deficit [1], another allowing a 3], or allowed ~84105kJ/kg current weight/day participants who were overweight or obese, and ~105126 kJ/kg current weight/day for participants who were normoweight [4]. There was also variation across studies in terms of the support and advice given to participants. The compositions of the individual diets are shown in Table 1 below. Study duration and followup times also varied. Table 1. Nutritional composition of diets used in the four included studies to treat and manage PCOS.

Low risk/ Moderate certainty Important considerations for GRADE Outcomes All studies measured anthropometric outcomes. The number and types of anthropometric measures used varied between studies. All studies measured metabolic outcomes. The number and types of metabolic measures used varied between studies. One study measured nonfertility outcomes. One study reported on fertility outcomes (amenorrhea) but no statistical comparison could be made between groups. With the exception of reductions in serum insulin levels in favour of the DASH diet in one study, there were no differences for any outcomes between any interventions. Subgroups There was no population subgroup analysis presented. Caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to subgroups such as some ethnic populations. As the majority of participants were likely to be European Caucasians, caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to other ethnic populations. All studies were performed in adults and the majority of participants were likely to be overweight or obese. Caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to adolescents or for lean women. Generalisability The evidence from the included studies could be generalisable to women with PCOS and overweight and obesity. All diets aimed to achieve weight loss with an energy deficit. Caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to modifying diet composition where weight loss was not specifically aimed for or where weight maintenance was aimed for. Caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to different ethnic populations, adolescent women and lean women. Applicability The recommendations are based on evidence applicable to the general population internationally. Resource requirements Since most health practitioners do not recommend specific dietary composition, the recommendations are unlikely to change current practice or resource requirements. Policy context, health system, resources and health professional training and access as well as geographical region will influence resource requirements and availability. In general current resources are inadequate for delivery of intensive lifestyle interventions. Cost effectiveness The recommendations may increase healthcare costs through increased consultation times and referral to health professionals, however the longterm benefits of dietary and lifestyle modification may reduce the health and 5 economic burden of PCOS. However there is inadequate evidence in the general population for cost effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. Equity The effectiveness of the recommended interventions may be impacted in certain groups due to limited access to evidencebased dietary education (from health professionals including dietitians) as a result of location or finances. Evidence supports positive outcomes including increased physical activity and weight loss in lower and higher risk populations including participants of higher and lower starting weight, sedentary and nonsedentary groups and groups at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Effectiveness may be reduced in the presence of chronic disease, including those with Type 2 Diabetes compared to those without, necessitating the need for more intensive multi disciplinary care. Acceptability The recommendations are unlikely to significantly change usual care for most health practitioners although may necessitate longer consultation times and increased referral to health professionals. Consumers (women with PCOS) may want more specific dietary advice to assist them in implementing the recommendations to lose weight and/or prevent weight gain. Acceptability will be influenced by the expectations, cultural considerations and health literacy of the women and accessibility and affordability of the interventions. Feasibility Policy settings, health system enablers, education and engagement of health professionals and patient considerations (such as the cost of longer consultations and/or consultations with other health professionals) will affect feasibility. Implementation Policy settings, health system enablers, education and engagement of health professionals and patient considerations (such as the cost of longer consultations and/or consultations with other health professionals) need to be considered in implementation. Some consumer targeted resources (including books, websites and online programs) claim benefits for specific macronutrient composition for women with PCOS, so greater education for consumers and health professionals around evidence based dietary approaches is important. Monitoring and evaluation A clinical judgment will need to accompany any recommendations and address: any indicators that should be monitored and should implementation of the recommendation be evaluated. Longterm followup of all important outcomes should be recorded and evaluated. Process and outcome evaluations are required during implementation and scale up. Research priorities Large, welldesigned and longterm studies investigating different dietary compositions in this population. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of a range of dietary compositions on weight and metabolic outcomes in both lean and overweight/obese women with PCOS. This could include dietary interventions that have been found to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in other populations, including a variety of diet approaches: lower glycaemic load or glycaemic index, Mediterranean, plant based and DASHstyle diets for a range of outcomes. It is acknowledged that not all diets need to be trialed in this PCOS population. Large scale, general population studies will also be of relevance here. 6 Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS With a reduction in dietary energy intake, a variety of balanced dietary approaches can be recommended to induce weight loss in women with PCOS and overweight and obesity, as per general population guidelines. General healthy eating principles should be followed for all women with PCOS across the life course, as per general population recommendations. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS No or limited evidence that one isocaloric diet type is better than other diet types in PCOS No current evidence that women with PCOS differentially respond in terms of weight to weight management intervention. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Further research is required including larger, adequately powered, rigorously designed studies. These need to assess a range of diet compositions including low GI in both weight loss and weight maintenance in women with PCOS who are overweight and not overweight. There needs to be more monitoring of safety and harms of diets and longer followup. There is also a need to address the high dropout rate from dietary intervention studies. 7 Methods Study selection criteria Population Inclusion : Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. All ages.

BMI =2845 kg/m2. N N = 35. High protein (HP) diet group = 17. High carbohydrate (HC) diet group = 18. Setting Participants were recruited from \"a variety of sources\" including private practices in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and at the M.S. Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania, and through advertisements (p631). Intervention/indicator High protein (HP) diet: The HP diet consisted of 30% protein, 40% carbohydrate, and 30% fat. \"Energy needs of patients were calculated with the HarrisBenedict equation using an adjusted body weight for obesity and an activity factor of 1.5\". Participants had a 1000kcal deficit per day [or equivalent to 4187kJ], which was 1000g/wk. Patients consumed a multivitamin/mineral supplement daily. Diet delivery regime: A dietitian guided the food choices for participants using \"limited exchange lists from the American Diabetes Association Exchange Lists for Meal Planning\" (p631). \"Specific instructions were not given about types of carbohydrates or glycemic indices\". The HP diet was given for four weeks. Other support: Patients maintained their current exercise levels throughout the four week study. Patients faxed weekly completed daily selfmonitoring diet charts and their weight measurements. Patients \"filled out satiety questionnaires and spoke with the dietitian weekly, reviewing their charts and answering questions related to\" their prescribed diet plan. Comparison/control High carbohydrate (HC) diet: The HC diet consisted of 15% protein, 55% carbohydrate, and 30% fat. \"Energy needs of patients were calculated with the HarrisBenedict equation using an adjusted body weight for obesity and an activity factor of 1.5\". Participants had a 1000kcal deficit per day [or equivalent to 4187kJ], which was 1000g/wk. Patients consumed a multivitamin/mineral supplement daily. 14 Diet delivery regime: A dietitian guided the food choices for participants using \"limited exchange lists from the American Diabetes Association Exchange Lists for Meal Planning\" (p631). \"Specific instructions were not given about types of carbohydrates or glycemic indices\". The HC diet was given for four weeks. Other support: Patients maintained their current exercise levels throughout the four week study. Patients faxed weekly completed daily selfmonitoring diet charts and their weight measurements.

Outcomes Anthropometric: Weight; BMI; waist circumference; waisthip girth ratio. Metabolic: oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), with a 75g oral glucose challenge done women were selected based on a diagnosis of PCOS through \"a history of chronic anovulation ( six spontaneous menstrual cycles per year) and unexplained elevated circulating T levels\" (p631). Patients were not judged for inclusion or exclusion based on ultrasonography \"because the presence or absence of polycystic ovaries has not been included in consensus criteria for the definition of the endocrine syndrome of PCOS\". \"None of the participants had been diagnosed previously with diabetes mellitus\" (p631). \"All patients were obese which was defined as a body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2 ... were in good health and, for at least 1 month before the study, were not taking any medication (except for oral contraceptive agents which were stopped 3 months prior to the study) known to affect sex hormone levels, carbohydrate metabolism, or appetite. The participants were required to be nonsmokers and to exercise no more than three times per week\" (p631). Exclusion Criteria \"Other causes of tumors)\" (p631). Study Validity. Is it clear that there are no conflicts of interest in the writing or funding of this study? Yes. Authors state their funding sources (p630). 15 Does the study have a clearly focused question? Yes. All elements of a PICO are clearly described. Is a RCT the appropriate method to answer this question? Yes. Does the study have specified inclusion/exclusion criteria? Yes. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are clearly described (p631). If there were specified inclusion/exclusion criteria, were these appropriate? Yes. The authors have relevant criteria for detecting PCOS (p631). Did the study have an adequate method of randomisation? Yes. A random number table was used (p631). Was allocation to intervention group concealed? Not reported. Were patients blind to intervention group? No. Dietitians discussed the intervention or control diet plans with the respective intervention and control group patients. Patients also had to make conscious food choices to comply with either treatment group (p631632). Were investigators and care providers blind to intervention group? No. Dietitians knew the treatment groups (p631632). Were outcome assessors blind to intervention group? Not reported. All outcomes were measured in a standard, valid and reliable way? Partial. The laboratory biochemical tests are standard, valid and reliable tests. Measurements of weighthip ratio measurements are standard, valid and reliable. The measurement of weight may be unreliable because it depended on participants' accurate selfreporting of weight. It is unclear if everyone performed weight measurements under the same conditions (e.g. same accuracy of weigh scales, same amount of clothing on) and were not subjectively recording weights or were reliably recording weights daily. The FerrimanGallwey scores is a standard and valid method of evaluating hirsutism. However, its reliability is varied due to the need for subjective decisions on the scoring by users. Were outcomes assessed objectively? Yes. Laboratory tests are objective. Measurements of weight and weighthip ratio measurements are mostly objective, but may involve some observer judgement depending on the equipment being used for measuring. The FerrimanGallwey scores need subjective decisions on the scoring by users. Were outcomes assessed independently? Yes. The laboratory tests are independent. The weight and weighthip outcomes are independent and are not always related to each other (depending on body phenotypes). The FerrimanGallwey scores may not be independent because each question within the tool may reinforce other answers. However, this outcome does not influence the other outcomes assessed. 16 Were the groups similar at baseline with regards to key prognostic variables? Yes. For all the variables measured in Table 1, there were no significant differences (p633). Aside from the experimental intervention, were the groups treated the same? Yes. Were the outcomes measured appropriate? Yes. The outcomes measured are appropriate. Some may not be as commonly used clinically as other measures though. Was there sufficient duration of followup? Yes. Participants were followedup immediately after the four week treatment period (p632). Was there 20% dropout? No. There was 24% (4/17) dropout in the intervention group and 28% (5/18) dropout in the control group. Was the study sufficiently powered to detect any differences between the groups? No. The study needed 17 participants per treatment arm to achieve 95% power to detect a weight loss difference of 1.5kg between the two arms, with a standard deviation of 1.2kg, in a twosample ttest with a twosided significance level of 5% (p632). However the study only analysed 13 participants per treatment arm. If statistical analysis was undertaken, was this appropriate? Yes. It is unclear if the statistical tests were planned a priori because there is no published protocol to indicate this. The authors used twosample ttests to analyse outcomes that used continuous data. Point estimates and measures of variability were presented for outcomes. It is unclear if there was any missing data. Figures 2 and 3 shown graphs for \"combined diets\". It is unclear whether this analysis is necessary because the study is aimed at finding out which diet is more effective, so therefore combining the results of the two diets does not add any useful information. Were all the subjects analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated (ie intention to treat analysis)? Yes. It appears that all participants were accounted for and analysed to the group which they were allocated to. Is the paper free of selective outcome reporting? Not reported. There is no published protocol available. Other What is the overall risk of bias? Moderate. Results. The mean change from baseline in anthropometric, metabolic and nonfertility outcomes are shown below in Tables 1, 2 and 3 (extracted from Table 2, p633, in the journal article). Overall, many outcomes improved with both diets, but there were no significant differences between the treatments for any outcomes. Table 1: Mean changes from baseline in anthropometric outcomes.

This weight loss is not significant between the groups. Table 2: Mean changes from baseline in metabolic outcomes.

However, the baseline data was not collected so statistical comparisons should not be made between groups. Author's Conclusions. \"Those who complete a hypocaloric intervention can expect a significant weight loss and significant improvement in their reproductive and metabolic abnormalities, but these data demonstrated that no statistically significant increased benefit was associated with a highprotein diet\" (p636). Our Comments/Summary. This study has a moderate risk of bias. There were no significant differences between the HP and HC diets for anthropometric, metabolic, or fertility outcomes. However, because this study did not reach adequate power, the analyses showing nonsignificance is not be reliable. The conclusions made by the authors are justified, but it does not answer the question of whether a particular diet is more effective at improving PCOS outcomes. It is unclear whether the particular formulations of the diets were optimal to show significant differences in four weeks. It is unclear whether a 15% difference in protein and 15% difference in carbohydrate content between diets were adequate for the timeframe of the intervention. It is also unclear whether the outcomes at four weeks can be extrapolated to longer term outcomes. The authors report that there was a reasonable compliance to the diets of 75%. However it is not reported what the compliance was for each treatment group, as this could have been different. The generalisability of this study is limited to shortterm (four weeks) diets of the specific nutritional composition described by the study for women with PCOS aged between 21 and 37. 19 Study ID Toscani 2011 Study citation Toscani, M.

The DASH diet was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lowfat dairy products and to be low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, and sweets. Prescribed sodium in the DASH diet was <2,400 mg/d.... This study was not a feeding trial; therefore, we did not prepare foods for the participants; they only received 7d menu cycles. The diets were individually planned using a \"caloriecount\" system. To facilitate compliance with the diets, participants were given and instructed to use an exchange list. To control for the participants' dietary intakes throughout the study, 25 the dietitian called the participants to resolve any problems. Furthermore, to examine compliance with the diets, we asked participants to record their dietary intakes every 2 wk.

Narrative synthesis Clinical practice gap: need for guidance PCOS is a complex endocrine condition that affects 813% of reproductive aged women globally [1] [2, 3] and 30% of overweight women[4]. reproductive and psychosocial health. Cardiometabolic health: Women with PCOS have an inherently lower insulin sensitivity (27%) than matched healthy control women irrespective of BMI [5]. Insulin resistance is present in 95% of overweight, and 75% of lean women with PCOS [6] contributing to the increased type 2 diabetes and metabolic risk [7, 8]. Insulin resistance is integral to PCOS aetiology, and independent of obesity [46]. The prevalence and severity of PCOS are also exacerbated by obesity [4]. Furthermore, compared with PCOSfree women, the disorder conveys greater 10year weight gain [4, 9] amplifying insulin resistance and metabolic risk. Women with PCOS have increased cardiovascular disease risk factors including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and impaired fibrinolysis [10]. Recent Australian data have also shown marked increases in type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke [11], and are major disease burdens for women. Up to 80% of this health burden is preventable with lifestyle change [12]. While PCOS is currently treated with lifestyle and insulin sensitisers [13, 14] efficacy is not optimal, as neither medications nor lifestyle (exercise and/or diet) normalise insulin resistance in PCOS [13]. Reproductive health: Reproductive features are driven by insulin resistance and androgens and include anovulation and infertility - key features in PCOS. Obesity further exacerbates these features. Lifestyle interventions are firstline fertility treatment for overweight women with PCOS [14]. However, the quality of available evidence on efficacy is low, especially around exercise [14]. Psychosocial wellbeing: There is a high prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, negative body image and poor quality of life (QoL) in women with PCOS, independent of, but exacerbated by, obesity [1522]. Psychological wellbeing can impact motivation, selfworth, and limits effective treatment (adherence and compliance). Physical activity and exercise in PCOS: In general populations, physical activity (any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure (WHO)) and structured exercise (an activity requiring physical effort, carried out to sustain or improve health and fitness) delivers metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychosocial benefits, whether alone or combined with diet changes [2325]. Additionally, sedentary behaviours (activities during waking hours in a seated or reclined position with energy expenditure less than 1.5 times resting metabolic rate) are now linked 2 to allcause mortality and requires significant amounts of physical activity (>60 min per day) to offset this association [26, 27]. Both aerobic exercise and resistance exercise are proven beneficial to reduce cardiometabolic risk factors but combined training seems to be most efficient[28]. It is estimated that the health impacts of formal exercise therapy can reduced longterm cost to any healthcare system by ~ $1900 AUD (or $1500USD) per prediabetic person annually [29]. There is also a range of evidence in women with PCOS from small RCT's and high quality mechanistic studies (cohort and case control studies) that physical activity, including formal exercise (aerobic and muscle strengthening), improves metabolic features (IR, dyslipidaemia, and CVRFs), body composition (reduction of waist circumference, central adiposity and BMI), reproductive features (AMH, a marker of ovarian function) and psychological wellbeing in overweight women with PCOS [14, 15, 18, 3040], compared to minimum or no interventions. These benefits also occur independent of significant weight loss [31]. Despite the wellestablished benefits of physical activity and formal exercise for prevention of chronic disease, maintenance of health and therapeutic benefits in the general population and in women with PCOS, these populations tend to remain inactive [41]. This disengagement from physical activity and formal exercise is likely due to general and PCOS specific barriers to physical activity and formal exercise [15, 16]. To overcome reduced participation we need to address the general (time limitations) and PCOS specific (lack of confidence about maintaining physical activity, fear of injury, physical limitations) barriers [15] by finding not only effective formal exercise activities, but ones that are enjoyable and likely sustainable beyond formal therapeutic intervention periods. However, as with pharmacological treatments, physical activity and exercise does not normalise insulin resistance [30], nor completely ameliorate PCOS features. While there is a clear role for physical activity and exercise in management and treatment of PCOS, either alone or within a lifestyle program, there is an urgent need to determine appropriate physical activity and/or formal exercise \"doses\", types and regimes that are most efficacious for improving clinical features of PCOS while enhancing engagement and longterm sustainability in therapeutic exercise interventions. Summary of key information The key clinical question and knowledge gap relates to establishing which physical activity and/or formal exercise programme/intervention is best suited to targeting the complex clinical features of PCOS. Physical activity and formal exercise programmes can be classified in 3 broad categories of aerobic/endurance style activities (focusing on aerobic capacity/fitness), resistance style activities (targeting muscle mass and strength) or a combination of both. These general classifications can be further subgrouped by exercise intensity, especially aerobic style activities or exercises, and can be defined as light, moderate, vigorous or highintensity depending on the physiological stress [42]. To date there is minimal high quality RCT evidence exploring what exercise best targets clinical features of PCOS, but two small RCT's have been conducted exploring duration of moderate intensity aerobic exercise or if aerobic exercise or combined aerobic and resistance exercise were best for targeting clinical features of PCOS. The first study investigated if the duration (weeks of intervention) of moderate intensity bicycle exercise on a cycle ergometer 3 times per week was important and clearly demonstrated that 24 weeks of intervention had greater clinical impacts than 12 weeks on metabolic features [43]. Specifically, at 24 weeks markers of glucose homeostasis at baseline and an OGTT, lipid profiles (LDL, HDL), and anthropometry (waist circumference (6cm reduction) and BMI (2 kg/m2 reduction) showed significantly greater improvements than at 12 weeks, but no impact on reproductive biomarkers [14, 35, 43]. The second study ([33, 34]; a relatively small RCT) explored the impact of different 20 week fitness centre based exercise programs (superimposed on a high protein diet) using either an aerobic exercise program (5 3 days/week of moderate intensity treadmill walking/jogging) compared to a combined exercise intervention (3 days/week of moderate intensity treadmill walking/jogging plus 2 days a week of progressive resistance training). Here both training interventions similarly improved metabolic, reproductive and psychosocial features on the background of the same dietinduced weight loss in women with PCOS [14, 3335]. The impacts of exercise and physical activity on the cardiometabolic and reproductive features of PCOS have been relatively well summarised in a number of publications [35, 4446]. While acknowledging the poor quality of evidence (sample size, study type, heterogeneity of interventions) currently available, the studies explored in these evidence syntheses do show important clinical impacts of improved glycaemic control, biomarkers of reproductive health, quality of life and functional capacities (aerobic fitness, maximal strength), when compared to notreatment[14, 35, 4446] [33, 47, 48]. Also, in terms of psychosocial health, limited community based/epidemiological studies demonstrating a positive association of selfreported physical activity levels and improved mental health status [15, 18]. Overall, this evidence is sufficient to encourage women with PCOS to engage in physical activity and formal exercise. Current data suggest that moderate intensity aerobic exercise with or without resistance training (using personalised progression) is effective at improving clinical features of PCOS and that this needs to be undertaken for a minimum period of 12 weeks, with greater effects demonstrated when programs are undertaken over longer time frames. However, with the ever increasing barrier of \"being time poor\" to sustained physical activity and formal exercise in the general population[49] and PCOS [15], perhaps a more time efficient physical activities and exercise programs are needed for women with PCOS. While no RCTs have been published in this area, epidemiological data suggest that vigorous exercise is associated with better health outcomes and reduced metabolic features in women with PCOS [50]. Overall, in line with international guidelines for physical activity for adults, women with PCOS should be encouraged to undertake at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity most days of the week, complimented with some flexibility and resistance exercises. In context of sedentary behaviour, research into the general population, while in its infancy, has a causal link to chronic disease and allcause mortality [26]. While little research has been undertaken in women with PCOS, there is evidence of increased sitting time in this population [51]. It is therefore vital to try to minimise sedentary behaviours in these women based on general population data and consider increased efforts in quantifying and developing strategies to reduce sedentary behaviours in an already inactive group with significant current and future health problems. Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS With limited quality RCT's on optimal exercise/physical activity recommendations in PCOS, we are limited to high quality mechanistic literature in PCOS and international recommendations for the general population. Recommended physical activity: Prevention of weight gain and maintenance of health: o In adults (1864) a minimum of 150 min/weekof moderate intensity activities or 75 min/week of vigorous intensities or an equivalent combination of both o In Adolescents at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorousintensity physical activity/ day including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 times/ week Promotion of greater health benefits including modest weightloss and prevention of weightregain: 4 o A minimum of 250 min/week of moderate intensity activities or 150 min/week of vigorous intensities or an equivalent combination of both. Muscle strengthening activities (eg. Resistance/flexibility) on 2 nonconsecutive days/ week Minimise sedentary time (sitting) Referral to suitably trained health professionals should be considered when woman with PCOS are considered inactive and/or sedentary and need assistance engaging in physical activity and formal exercise. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS Physical activity includes leisure time physical activity, transportation (e.g. walking or cycling), occupational (i.e. work), household chores, playing games, sports or planned exercise, in the context of daily, family and community activities. Aerobic activity is best performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration (1000 steps), aiming to achieve at least 30 minutes daily on most days. 10,000 steps per day is ideal and would include activities of daily living plus 30 minutes of structured physical activity (30 minutes = 3000 steps). These recommendations should be considered in the context of culturally acceptable and socioeconomically accessible preferences. The value of broader family engagement should be considered. Realistic physical activity goals can be achieved by using SMART (specific measurable, achievable, realistic and timely) goal setting and selfmonitoring to progressively increase physical activity (weekly by 5%) up to and above recommendations. Psychological factors (eg. body image concerns, fear of injury, fear of failure, depression) and personal sensitivities should be considered and managed to optimise engagement and adherence Fitness devices and technologies could be used as an adjunct to support and promote active lifestyles and minimise sedentary behaviours. Encouraging physical activity is the joint responsibility of all health professionals, partnering with women with PCOS. If referring for exercise initiation or prescription, suitably qualified health professionals should be considered. 5 BREAKOUT BOX Activity intensity Description Objective Measure Examples of activities and ADL's LIGHT An aerobic activity that does not cause a noticeable change in breathing rate.

Adapted from [42] and [52]. Important considerations for GRADE Resource requirements It is important to consider the cost and resource requirements at a health systems level and for the individual woman with many low cost options available. Irrespective of the exercise programme or physical activity recommendation, implementation of exercise therapy/physical activity programs may result in increased referral to health professionals. This is likely to increase health professional time demands. Cost effectiveness No cost effectiveness analysis has been conducted for exercise therapy in PCOS. For example, other data sources suggest regular exercise therapy can reduce the metabolic disease associate healthcare costs [29]. Group based integrated lifestyle program (exercise and diet) may reduce health care costs including assisted infertility treatment [53]. Equity Implementation of exercise therapy and longterm physical activity programs do not need to be in clinical centres, expensive gyms and fitness centres. Exercise and physical activity programs can be delivered in community centres and at sporting grounds/facilities in group settings with minimal equipment. Low cost ehealth (electronic health) and mhealth (mobile health) options can be utilised. As such, implementation of exercise and physical activity recommendations should be provided in context of the socioeconomic status of the patients and in consideration of health and community services available. Acceptability Engagement of healthcare practitioners and healthcare funders, as well as the financial barriers for the patient may be an issue. Also insufficient access to, as well as time constraint for, health professionals may be a barrier . Dropout or nonadherence to physical activity recommendations may be a problem. Feasibility As per acceptability. Utilising current structures for referral into formal exercise therapy/physical activity programmes are already in place in many countries. This makes recommending exercise therapy and /or physical activity by a care team relatively easy, and can reduce cost in a group setting. Innovative solutions to deliver and facilitate longterm increases in physical activity and exercise will be required where these 7 services and structures are not available. Overall, a global shift in cultural mindset with regards recommending regular exercise and/or physical activity may be required. Implementation Independent of the formal exercise therapy/physical activity recommended, policy, health system, health professional, community and individual barriers need to be addressed: 1) Innovative solutions to provide environments (within and beyond clinical setting) that facilitate all forms exercise and physical activity. 2) A cultural shift in mindset and additional consultation time from the primary and specialist healthcare providers are needed to educate and discuss with women the need for exercise and physical activity. 3) Recommendations to exercise must be offered in the context of the women's individual circumstances (cultural, socioeconomic, preferences) 4) The woman should be given the opportunity to take control of her exercise therapy and share in the decision making of her own care based on the best valid information from all members of the care team. 5) Accountability and responsibility should the rest with both the woman and the team of healthcare providers. Monitoring and evaluation As there is insufficient evidence for a specific type, mode or intensity of exercise being best for the management and treatment of PCOS, thus recommending goldstandard and expensive cardiorespiratory tests is unwarranted. Instead simple easy to use tools would appropriate to monitor general fitness and exercise behaviours in women with PCOS. These tests may include: 1) Simple submaximal fitness tests conducted by certified exercise professionals, where available. 2) Other data sources could be used to monitor physical activity and sedentary behaviour in a broader population level. This could include tools such as questionnaires and commercially available activity monitors, although this data would need to be interpreted with some caution. 3) Using activity monitors to monitor sedentary behaviour and daily step counts and provide feedback and motivation. Research priorities Clear clinical research gaps have been identified in this and prior extensive evidence syntheses [14, 35, 4446], stakeholder feedback including an international survey of 1592 women with PCOS and 1800 Health Professionals (2015-2017)[54]. There is an urgent need to determine: 1) Exercise \"doses\" and regimes to optimise efficacy. 2) Strategies to increase engagement and address barriers, cultural factors and sustainability of active lifestyles in PCOS management and treatment. 3) Longterm (12 months or greater) exercise studies. 4) Impact of improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and/or strength on clinical features of clinical outcome of women with PCOS. 5) Assessing the impact of reducing sedentary behaviour on clinical outcomes. 8 References: 1.

Are women with PCOS at increased risk of obesity? 2. In women with PCOS, does obesity impact on prevalence and severity of hormonal and clinical features? 1. Are women with PCOS at increased risk of obesity Obesity is not a key diagnostic criterion of PCOS. However, obesity is a common feature of PCOS, with over half of women affected being either overweight or obese [1]. Weight gain is a common presenting complaint of PCOS, while reduction of body weight is accompanied by improvement of its main symptoms [2]. Although the increasing trend in the epidemiology of PCOS worldwide appears to be in parallel with the global epidemic of obesity, the occurrence of PCOS among lean populations clearly depicts it is not caused solely by obesity [3]. Nevertheless, PCOS is closely associated with obesity [4]. Lim et al. report a comprehensive systematic review and metaanalysis of the prevalence of overweight, obesity and central obesity in women with and without PCOS in clinic based women. They found that women with PCOS had a significantly increased risk for adiposity when compared with controls. The pooled estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity in PCOS CI: 43- 62%). This increased risk was independent of the PCOS diagnostic criteria (NIH versus . Rotterdam), age and geographic region of the affected subjects. Caucasian women with PCOS had a greater prevalence of obesity than Asian women with PCOS, whether using the same criteria for overweight and obesity or ethnic specific criteria. This may reflect community prevalence of obesity or source of the study population, whether community or referred for clinical care [5, 6]. Community based prevalence studies since then in Turkey and Australia have also reported an increased prevalence of PCOS in parallel with increasing BMI [7, 8]. However, a large community based study in China reported no difference in prevalence based on BMI [9]. Again this may be reflective of community prevalence of obesity. The complex pathophysiology and clinical heterogeneity of PCOS has contributed to the lack of a clear understanding of its clinical correlates observed over time, chiefly body fat. Obesity, particularly central obesity, is well known to increase insulin resistance. The effect of obesity on the metabolic and reproductive symptoms in PCOS is considered to be mediated by insulin resistance (IR) [10, 11]. The great majority of women seeking treatment for PCOS are at risk of being overweight or obese [12]. One in three overweight women is at risk of having PCOS. One unit increase of BMI (kg/m2) increases the risk of PCOS by 9% [13]. The temporal trends of the prevalence of obesity among women with PCOS show an increase from 51% in the 90s to 74% in the following decades [1]. Furthermore, the longterm weight gain over 10 years among women with PCOS is significantly greater than unaffected women in longitudinal community based studies (mean difference 2.6kg 95% CI 1.24.0) [14] as is central obesity with a progressive increase in waist hip ratio between 2025 years and 4045 years [15] This is consistent with reports from a prospective birth cohort of increased weight gain in early adulthood in women with symptoms of or a diagnosis of PCOS compared with controls [16] 2. In women with PCOS, does obesity impact on prevalence and severity of hormonal and clinical features? IR and hyperandrogenism (HA) are the main endocrine abnormalities of PCOS. Both problems manifest independent of the degree of adiposity, but are also exacerbated by obesity. Visceral or central obesity in 2 particular can exacerbate IR and HA. The abnormally increased insulin acts as a cogonadotrophin, particularly on the ovary, with the resulting high androgens worsening the key clinical problems of PCOS [1]. The parallel inhibition of hepatic production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) through insulin resistance augments the hyperandrogenism [1]. Obesity influences the phenotypic expression of PCOS, with augmentation of menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, through a significant effect on its pathophysiology [17]. Conversely, weight loss reduces abdominal fat and IR and also improves menstrual cyclicity and hyperandrogenism, reproductive and metabolic outcomes [18, 19]. Obesity and IR related outcomes of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes are reported to occur in up to 35% and 10% respectively of U.S. women with classic polycystic ovary syndrome [3]. Such metabolic problems are influenced by age, adiposity, family history of diabetes and ethnicity. Lower highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglyceride and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels also occur, which are partly independent of BMI [1, 6, 17]. Central obesity is associated with higher fasting insulin, high fasting triglycerides and low HDL [17]. The prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes is further increased in women with PCOS who are overweight or obese, especially in population at greater risk of type 2 diabetes [11]. Women with PCOS who are obese have more severe cardiometabolic risk factors, compared with their lean counterparts [20]. The resulting reproductive problems of obesity in PCOS include oligo/amenorrhoea, prolonged time to conception, infertility and poorresponse to ovulation induction; increased risk of miscarriage, hyperglycaemia of pregnancy, preeclampsia, increased perinatal morbidity, fetal macrosomia and a greater potential for transgenerational transmission of obesity and metabolic problems [1, 3, 6, 18]. When combined with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and PCOS, the adverse outcomes can be more than additive [1, 6]. Expert opinion has therefore uniformly recommended that obese women with PCOS delay infertility therapy and pursue lifestyle modification [12, 14]. The psychological comorbidities of PCOS with overweight/obesity include anxiety, depression, low health related quality of life, sexual dissatisfaction, poor selfesteem and psychological distress over their cosmetic problems such as hirsutism and body configuration [6, 12, 19]. The psychosocial aspects of obesity in PCOS must be borne in mind by all caregivers. The need to appreciate the differing psychosocial issues during the progressing phases of the reproductive life of an affected woman needs special attention. The clinical and behavioural support required by a young adolescent or adult is very different from the older woman who is coping with different of competing priorities of childcare, career demands and selfcare. The ethnic background of the affected woman and her ethnic specific psychosocial response when coping with the common problems related to PCOS must also be borne in mind. It is noteworthy that some ethnic groups, such as women of Asian origin or Indigenous Australian women, who have a greater potential to manifest worsening of symptoms at a lower BMI e.g. considered overweight when in excess of 23 kg/m2 and obese when exceeding 25 kg/m2 with a greater potential for upper body (central) obesity [21]. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance Insulin resistance underpins both PCOS and obesity. Understanding the impact of obesity on PCOS is difficult to quantify, given the conflicting studies of prevalence in relation to obesity, a mixture of populations studied (clinical or community based), mostly small numbers and lack of longitudinal follow up. The threshold for worsening of PCOS specific symptoms appears to be when overweight, with a probable plateauing of the magnitude of the deleterious effects of adiposity on the biochemistry of affected women 3 when beyond a high BMI [3]. It is unclear whether different categories should be used in the assessment of overweight and obesity based on ethnicity. Summary of key information Obesity generally appears to be more prevalent in women with PCOS globally. Women with PCOS have greater weight gain over time compared to women without PCOS. A higher BMI increases the risk of having PCOS. Obesity augments the severity of the clinical manifestations of PCOS. Recommendations Prevention of weight gain, monitoring weight and encouraging evidence based and socioculturally appropriate lifestyle changes are important in women with PCOS, particularly from young adulthood. Weight, height, BMI and waist circumference should be measured. o BMI categories should be as per WHO guidelines but these could be adjusted by geographic region if appropriate [22] (eg. Asian BMI guidelines) and for women<19 years age specific values used [23]. o Waist circumference as per WHO guidelines or ethnic specific measurements may be used if appropriate [24]. Clinical considerations Subgroups There may be different implications for groups at increased risk of diabetes and different groups for obesity. Resource requirements Measuring and monitoring overweight and obesity can easily be done by clinicians in routine care and do not require additional resources (viz. calibrated weighing scales, height stadiometer and large, non stretchable standardized tape measures) Cost effectiveness Measuring and monitoring BMI is cost effective although the cost benefit associated with effective weight management programs is unclear. Equity Social determinants of health including support to maintain affordable healthy diet and exercise to assist weight management may have the potential for increased benefit to groups that experience increased socioeconomic disadvantage or discrimination. Acceptability Measuring and monitoring overweight and obesity is part of routine clinical practice. Feasibility Additional support such as dietitians, exercise professionals or health coach may be expensive and it may also be important to address psychosocial issues that enable behaviour change. Implementation Measuring and monitoring overweight and obesity is part of routine clinical practice. 4 Monitoring and evaluation BMI and WC.

This recommendation should be disseminated to journal editors, funding sources, and professional societies.\" That is, should we attempt to define women with PCOS according to their phenotype (and hence attempt subgroup [and combined] analysis of important outcomes according to phenotype where possible) in addition to whether they fit the Rotterdam criteria. Note relevant to adolescent subgroup: subgrouping by phenotype in adolescents is of unclear benefit.

oral contraceptive pill alone or in combination effective fo r management of hormonal and clinical PCOS features in adole scents and adults with PCOS? Evidence review QUESTION Question details Population: Adolescents and adults with PCOS Option (intervention): COCP alone Comparison: Placebo, lifestyle, metformin, anti -androgens (AA) and combinations Main outcomes: Weight (GRADE 8) BMI (GRADE 8) Waist-hip-ratio (WHR) (GRADE 7) PAI-1 (GRADE 4) Irregular cycles (GRADE 8) Hirsutism (GRADE 7) Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (GRADE 6) Free androgen index (FAI) (GRADE 6) Testosterone (GRADE 5) Insulin resistance (GRADE 8) Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (GRADE 7) Clamp (GRADE 7) Total cholesterol (GRADE 6) HDL (GRADE 6) LDL (GRADE 6) Triglycerides (GRADE 6) HOMA (GRADE 5) CRP (GRADE 4) Quality of life (GRADE 7) Depression (GRADE 7) Gastro-intestinal effects (GRADE 8) Liver function (GRADE 8) Vitamin B deficiency (GRADE 7) Lactic acidosis (GRADE 4) Setting: Primary and specialist care Perspective: Multidisciplinary health professionals and patients Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common familial heterogeneous endocrine associated with chronic anovulation, obe sity, hirsutism and metabolic syndrome. Combined contraceptives, including oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are commonly prescribed for adults and adolescents with PCOS to ameliorate the clinical symptoms and associated hormonal disturbances. The effects of combined oral co ntraceptive pills (COCPs) on menstrual cycle, hirsutism, weigh t loss, waist/hip ratio, testosterone concentrations, lipid profile and blood sugar levels are variably reported and depend on type of OCP used, duration of use, sev erity of presentation/ phenotype, adherence to the regimen, among other factors. Different combinations of COCPs ar e available with heterogeneous estrogen and progestin preparati ons with varying pharmacological and clinical properties. Thus, the efficacy and consequences of COCPs in PCOS may vary. Some preparations al so comprise natural estrogen ins tead of synthetic ethinyl estradiol (EE) with similar benefits and contraindications are considered similar. Consideration of possible adverse effects must be made before prescribing any combined contraceptive preparations, including CO CPs. Absolute contraindications for combined contraceptive use according to WHO, include women with history of migraine with aura, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embo li (PE), known thrombogenic mutations, multiple risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease, histor y of ischemic heart disease or stroke, complicated valvular he art disease, breast cancer, neuropathy, severe For women up 6 weeks postpartum with other risk factors for VTE, such as immobility, at delivery, preeclampsia or smoking, may pose an additional increased risk for VTE. Current evidence suggests that COCPs containing levonorgestrel, norethisterone a nd norgestimate are associated with the lowest relative risk of DVT/PE of the COCP prepar ations available. Also, according to WHO recommendations COCPs with 35ug EE and cypro terone acetate (CPA) should only be used in adult and adolescent women when treating moderate or se vere hirsutism or acne due to higher risk for DVT. Thus, for con traception and other indications including irregular menstrual cycles, other preparations with lower risk profiles are recommended. ( http://www.who.int/reproductiveheal th/topics/family_planning/coc/en/). Metformin is an oral biguanide insulin sens itizer that is used to treat impaired gluc ose tolerance and PCOS symptoms in affecte d women. As metformin is cheap and available it is commonly used to treat women with PCOS. Metformin has mi ld side effects of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence and ra rely in those with renal impairment of other illnesses can have serious adverse effects such as lactic acidosis. Adolescents with PCOS may present with severe PCOS-related symp toms and may warrant medical treatment. However, before starting medication, accurate diagnosis of PCOS can be challenging in the adolescent girls: please refer to the section on diagnosis, however sometimes treatment of sympt oms may be warranted without a clear diagnosis in adolescents. While considering the question of effectiveness of COCP in adol escents and adults with PCOS, all evidence was evaluated for all comparisons available and the relevant prioritised clinical questions were addressed. Subgroups Subgroup name: Adolescents - <18 years Subgroup name: Adults - reproductive age women 18- 40 years Questions: Is the oral contraceptive pill alone or in combinatio n effective for management of hormonal and clinical PCOS featur es in adolescents and adults with PCOS? Recommendations: Practice point An individual's personal characteristics, preferences and values must be considered when recommending any intervention; and tr eatments. Evidence-based recommendation 1 Type of recommendation Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation The COCP should be considered in adult women with PCOS, fo r management of hyperandrogenism and menstrual regulation. Evidence-based recommendation 2 Type of recommendation Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation The COCP should be considered in adolescents with a clear diagnosis of PCOS, for management of hyperandrogenism and menstrual r egulation. The COCP can be considered in adolescents with oligo/amenorrhea and androgen excess wh o are deemed \"at risk for PCOS\" but not y et diagnosed. Evidence-based recommendation 3 Type of recommendation Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation No specific type or dose of progestins, es trogens or combinations of COCP can be recommended in adults and adolescents with PCO S. Consensus recommendation The 35ug EE+CPA COCP preparations should not be considered first line in adult and adolescent women with PCOS, as they are only indicated for moderate to severe hirsutism or acne, and not for routine contr aception and menstrual irregula rity and have a higher for venous thromboemboli sm. Practice points When prescribing COCPs in adults and adolescents with PCOS, the androgenic properties of progestins, and VTE risk should be considered. lower dose estrogen preparations, and natural estrogen preparations (such as 20-30mcg of ethinyl estradiol or equivalent), should be considered balancing efficacy for hyperandrogenism and metabolic ri sk profile and side effect. the generally limited evidence in PCOS should be appreciated and evidence including general ab solute and relative contraindicat ions for COCP's be considered from outside PCOS populations to guide practice PCOS specific risk factors such as high BMI should be considered ( https://www.fhi360.org/sites/default/files/media/docume nts/chart-medical-eligibility-contraceptives-english.pdf) Evidence-based recommendation 4 Type of recommendation Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation The COCP can be combined with antiandrogens in adult women with PCOS to treat hirsutism, only after lifestyle, a minimum of 6 m onths of COCP therapy and cosmetic therapy for hirsutism has failed to ad equately improve these features. Consensus recommendation Antiandrogens may be considered in combination with the CO CP for the treatment of androgenic alopecia in PCOS. Practice points Antiandrogens must be used with contraception in PCOS, as shoul d pregnancy occur, antiandrogens are a known teratogen for a mal e fetus. Where COCPs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, other effective forms of contraception, should be used with antiandrogens in PCOS. Evidence-based recommendation 5 Type of recommendation Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation In combination with the COCP, metformin shou ld be considered in adult women with PCOS and could be considered in adolescents wi th PCOS and BMI 25, for management of metabolic features. Practice point Consider high metabolic risk ethnic groups GRADE ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence - ADOLESCENTS COCP versus placebo One randomised controlled trial (RCT) was id entified to address this comparison in a dolescents [1]. There was a statistically s ignificant improvement with COCP (compared to placebo) for HDL in this very low quality study with low ce rtainty. No statistically significant differences were found sugar CRP (mg/l); PAI-1. Side effects were not reported. COCP versus lifestyle One RCT was identified to address this comparison in adolescents [1]. There was a statistically significant improvement with li festyle (compared to COCP) for LDL in this very low quality study with very low certainty. No statisti cally significant differences PAI-1. Side effects were not reported. COCP versus metformin A systematic review including four RCTs th at address this comparison in adolescents was identified [2]. The evidence team condu cted additional analysis of outcomes not addressed in the systematic review. While a statistically signifi cant improvement was found in BMI and LDL with use of metformi n over COCP; and a statistically significant improvement was found in menstrual regulation with use of COCP ov er metformin, we remain cautious due to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence. A statistically significant improvement in dysglycemia (OGTT) was found with the use of metformin over COCP, however it should be noted that there is low certainty in the effect estimates and the quality of evidence. No statistically significant differences were found for: Hirsut PAI-1. Side effects included weight gain with COCP; and side effects were not specified with metformin. COCP versus metformin + anti-androgen One RCT was identified to address this comparison is adolescents [3]. Due to the lack of direct comparisons between groups (no p values reported for between groups) it is uncertain whether there were any differences in this very low qu ality study with very low Side effects wer e not reported. COCP + metformin+ lifestyle versus COCP + lifestyle + placebo One RCT was identified to address this comparison is adolescents [1]. There was a statistically significant improvement with th e addition of metformin to COCP and lifestyle (compared to COCP and lifestyle plus placebo) for testosterone an d HDL in this very low quality study with very low certainty. No statistically significant differences were found for: CRP (mg/liter). One in each group stopped metformin or pl acebo due to GI effects. COCP + anti-androgen versus COCP + anti-androgen + metformin One RCT was identified to address this comparison is adolescents [4]. Due to the lack of direct comparisons between groups (no p values reported for between groups) it is uncertain whether there were any differences in this very low qu ality study with very low certainty for effects were not reported. Research evidence - ADULTS COCP versus metformin Nine RCTs were identified to address this comparison [5-13]. There were statistically significant improvements with metformin ( compared with COCP) for fasting insulin, including for both BMI subgroups. Metformin improved HDL in the BMI>25 subgroup but not in the BMI<25 subgroup or when all par ticipants were combined; and improved triglycerides when all participants were combined, in the BMI>25 subgroup and in the subgroup where BMI was not define d, but not in the BMI<25 subgroup. There were statistically significant improvements with COCP (compared with metformin) for SHBG, FAI, total testoster one and irregular cycles, including for all BMI subgroups. COCP improved LDL in the BMI>25 subgroup but not in the BMI<25 subgroup or when all participants were combined. No statistically significant differences were found for: Weight; Clamp GI-related events, whereas the COCP group had none . While one of the included s tudies was of mode rate quality and certainty, the majority of studies in these meta-analyses were of low to very low ce rtainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence and therefore all findings should be interpreted with caution. COCP versus COCP + metformin Six RCTs were identified to address this comparison [11, 13-17]. There was a statistically significant improvement with COCP al one (compared with COCP plus metformin) for triglycerides. COCP alone improved SHBG in the BMI<25 subgro up but not in the BMI>25 subgroup or when all participants were combined. There were statistically significant improvements with COCP plus metformin (compared with COCP alone) for FAI. COCP plus metformin improved testosteron e when all participants were combined but not in BMI subgroups; improved hirsutism and fasting glucose when all participants were combined and in the BMI>25 subgroup but not in the BMI<25 subgroup; improved SHBG and fasting insulin in the BMI<25 subgroup but not when all participants were combined or in the BMI>25 subgroup; and improved total cholesterol in the BMI>25 subgroup but not when all participants were combined or in the BMI<25 subgroup. No statistically sign ificant differences were COCP increased GI-related events, wher eas the COCP alone group had none. While one of the included studies was of mo derate quality and certainty, the majority of studies in these meta-analyses were of low to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence a nd therefore all findings should be interpreted with caution. COCP versus COCP + metformin + anti-androgen One RCT was identified to address th is comparison in adults [3]. Due to the lack of direct comparisons between groups (no p val ues reported for between groups) it is uncertain whether there were any differences in this very low qu ality study with very low Side effects wer e not reported. COCP versus anti-androgen One RCT was identified to address this comparison is adults [18] . Due to the lack of direct comparisons between groups (no p va lues reported for between groups) it is uncertain whether there were any differences in this very low qu ality study with very low certainty for the outcome hirsutism ( FG score). COCP versus COCP + anti-androgen Four RCTs were identified to address this comparison in adults [19-22]. There was a statistically significant improvement with COCP alone (compared with COCP plus anti- androgen) for BMI and LDL. No statisticall depressive state; Live r function. The majority of studies in these meta-analyses were of low to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence a nd therefore all findings should be interpreted with caution. COCP + metformin + lifestyle versus COCP + metformin + lifestyle One study was identified to address this comparison in adults [23]. There were no statistically significant differences reporte d between the two interventions in this very low quality study of very low certainty for outcomes: WHR; Fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L); HbA1c (%); Total cholesterol (mmol/L); LDL (mmol/L). Side effects were not reported. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion Although combination therapy of metformin and COCP was found to be more beneficial in improving the hormonal profile, a combina tion regime leads to more GI side effects, which can impact on compliance with therapy. With metformin therapy in addition to COCP, women with PCOS and obesity may benefit more. Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion Side effects poorly reported so evidence-based judgments on undesirable effects in women with PCOS cannot be made. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion Low to very low certainty evidence for the majority of comparisons and outcomes. Values Is there important uncert ainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise wa s conducted before evidence synthesis comm enced and informed the GDG on the value o f outcomes. (see main outcomes above) Additional considerations No studies reported any evidence on the value that cons umers or health professionals place on the outcomes. In the Guideline processes to establish priorities, the highest ra nked outcomes were weight, BMI, cycles and GI side effects an d the agents differed in their effects on these outcomes, which is a key consideration in our balance of effects. Most important factor is to understand what the indivi dual woman at her particular life stage values the most. Panel discussion Acne is a feature of PCOS and may be a health concern for some women with PCOS, however objective assessment of acne is challen ging and this endpoint was not highly valued by consumers or health professionals in the GRADE outcome prioritisation pr ocess. It is acknowledged that limited adole scent engagement occurred during the outcome prioritisation process. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and undesirabl e effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion The individual phenotype of PCOS, the BMI and ethnicity of those w ith PCOS as well as the preference of individual with PCOS ne ed to be considered. Resources required How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Without data and evidence, it is nearly impossible to provide valid answe rs to this question. Likely costs vary among patients related to country of origin and h ealth care financing, i.e. universal health insurance, third party payers, no health insurance Additional considerations COCP availability can be limited in some countri es including the US, and cost can vary widely. Metformin is generally cheap and readily available internationally Costs of medications were considered in pa nel deliberations were taken into accounts however no cost effectiveness data is avai lable Panel discussion Multiple combined medication are generally more costly than single medications COCP costs vary widely based on preparatio n and health care system reimbursements Costs vary across the COCP preparations Certainty of evidence of required resources What is the certainty of the eviden ce of resource requirements (costs)? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Additional considerations Circumstances in each region need to be considered when assessing cost and resources. Panel discussion As per above on cost and cost effectiveness Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Additional considerations There is no evidence on cost effectiveness of any in tervention in PCOS hence no judgements can be made Panel discussion None Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations COCP, metformin and anti-androgens are all not indicated for the specific treatment of PCOS by regulatory bodies, however the u se of COCP and metfor min are indicated for the treatment of clinical features of PCOS and are generally not restricted for use in PCOS. Panel discussion Cannot provide judgements on this topic in the absence of evidence. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations None Panel discussion There may be moral and ethical barriers to COCP preparation use Considerations should focus on the balance of risks and benefits in the individual patient, their values and the context in whi ch is going to be prescribed. Metformin use in addition to COCP for metabolic features may not be acceptable to some practiti oners who are not familiar with metformin use Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations Implementation of these options is considered feasible and perfor med routinely in the management of women diagnosed to have PCO S and the adolescent girls judged to be \"at risk\" for PCOS. Panel discussion Feasibility of anti-androgens alone is likely to be challenging, others are less likely to enc ounter feasibility concerns altho ugh access issues as per above are a consideration. Guidelines could help address barriers to implementing the treatment of PCOS based on evidence and personal values Justification All evidence was considered Subgroup considerations Obesity is increased in PCOS and increases metabolic risk Implementation considerations Metformin in combination with COCP will requi re education, and will need to be integrat ed into education programs and algorithm s. This is anticipated to significantly change practice. Due to subgroup differences in recommendations, the persona l characteristics of all women need to be considered. Monitoring and evaluation COCP monitoring in relation to dose of preparation used may be considered Metformin in combination with COCP should be monitored longitudi nally and adherence, side effect s and benefits noted across sub groups. It is especially relevant to monitor impact in high metabolic risk ethnic subgroups. Research priorities Large scale population based studies are needed to capture side effects and risks in this population. Large scale comparative studies are need to determine optimal COCP preparations and doses Low cost interventions such as metformin or earlier generation COCPs require financia l support for research as these are not su pported by pharma EVIDENCE PROFILES COCP versus placebo - ADOLESCENTS Summary: One study was identified to address this comparison in adolescents.

The evidence team conducted additional analysis of outcomes not addressed in the systematic review. While a statistically significant improvement was found in BMI and LDL with use of metformin over COCP; and a statistically significant improvement found in menstrual regulation with use of COCP over metformin, we remain cautious due to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence. A statistically significant improvement in dysglycemia (OGTT) was found with the use of metformin over COCP, however it should be noted that there is low certainty in the effect estimates and the quality of evidence. No statistically significant differences were found for: Hirsutism; PAI1. Side effects included weight gain with COCP; and side effects were not specified with metformin. # Statistical method: Mean difference, inverse variance method, random effects model; ^ Statistical method: RiskRatio, MantelHaeztel fixed effect model; case scenario (author defined); **worst case scenario (author defined); NS, not significant noted and p value not reported; NA, not appropriate.

There were statistically significant improvements with metformin (compared with COCP) for fasting insulin, including for both BMI subgroups. Metformin improved HDL in the BMI>25 subgroup but not in the BMI<25 subgroup or when all participants were combined; and improved triglycerides when all participants were combined, in the BMI>25 subgroup and in the subgroup where BMI was not defined, but not in the BMI<25 subgroup. There were statistically significant improvements with COCP (compared with metformin) for SHBG, FAI, total testosterone and irregular cycles, including for all BMI subgroups. COCP improved LDL in the BMI>25 subgroup but not in the BMI<25 subgroup or when all participants were combined. No statistically significant differences were found for: Weight; Clamp led to GIrelated events, whereas the COCP group had none. While one of the included studies was of moderate quality and certainty, the majority of studies in these metaanalyses were of low to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence and therefore all findings should be interpreted with caution.

Yes Does the study have specified inclusion/exclusion criteria? Yes If there were specified inclusion/ exclusion criteria, were these appropriate? Partial Smoking status unknown Inclusion Criteria Yes PCOS was determined based on menstrual irregularity and androgen excess including FerrimanGallwey score above 7, elevated androgens after excluding other causes of hyperandrogenism, and menstrual irregularity. Exclusion Criteria Yes No hormonal therapy or insulin sensitizers for at least 2 months, without regard to the time in the menstrual cycle. Healthy INTERNAL VALIDITY - HAS THIS STUDY BEEN CONDUCTED RIGOROUSLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE BIAS? SELECTION BIAS Did the study have an adequate method of randomisation? Yes Table of random numbers Was allocation to intervention group concealed? Not reported PERFORMANCE BIAS Were patients blind to intervention group? Not reported for all interventions Assignment to metformin or placebo was blinded to subject. But no information was provided regarding the other groups - OCP and Lifestyle. Whilst it is not possible to blind subjects to a lifestyle intervention, subjects could be blinded towards OCP. Were investigators and care providers blind to intervention group? Yes Assignment to metformin or placebo was blinded to investigator. The same as above. Aside from the experimental intervention, were the groups treated the same? Yes DETECTION BIAS Were outcome assessors blind to intervention group? Not reported Were all outcomes measured in a standard, valid and reliable way? Yes Were outcomes assessed objectively and independently? Yes ATTRITION BIAS What percentage of the individuals recruited into each arm of the study dropped out? X% treatment X% control/ comparison = 9% LS = 3/11 = 27% Were all the subjects analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated (ie intention to treat analysis)? No REPOR T BIAS Is the paper free of selective outcome reporting? Not reported This is difficult to determine if there isn't a protocol. CONFOUNDING Were the groups similar at baseline with regards to key prognostic variables? Yes If confounding was present, was it controlled for? Yes OTHER INTERNAL VALIDITY /BIAS Were there any conflicts of interest in the writing or funding of this study? Yes The first author reports receiving lecture fees from EMDSerono and Organon Pharmaceuticals, a company that provided the OCP for the study. Was the study sufficiently powered to detect any Not reported differences between the groups? If statistical analysis was undertaken, was this appropriate? Yes Comments SUMMARY FOR GRADE Limitations RISK OF BIAS Very serious Randomisation sequence generation Concealment Blinding of participants/personnel (investigators) Blinding of assessors Incomplete data Selective outcome reporting No intentiontotreat Carryover effects Stopped early Unvalidated measures Other issue INCONSISTENCY No serious Point estimates vary widely CIs not overlapping - not reported so unable to judge Direction not consistent Statistical heterogeneity Other issue INDIRECTNESS No serious Population dissimilarity Outcome dissimilarity No direct comparison Intervention/comparator dissimilarity Timeframe insufficient Other issue IMPRECISION No serious Wide confidence intervals - no CIs reported Few patients Only one study Other issue PUBLICATION BIAS Very serious Commercially funded Asymmetrical funnel plot Limited search Missing grey literature Discontinued studies Discrepancy published v unpublished Other issue - OCP were provided by the pharmaceutical company that the first author has received lecture fees. What is the overall risk of bias? Moderate Moderate Some of the criteria have been fulfilled and those criteria that have not been fulfilled may affect the conclusions of the study.

Yes Were the strengths and limitations of included studies and potential impact on the results discussed? Yes If metaanalyses were conducted, was it reasonable to do so? No Different types of OCPs were combined together. As a result, very high heterogeneity (above 97%) was observed in each metaanalysis. If metaanalyses were conducted, was it done appropriately? No In the overall analysis, all studies have to pooled together using randomeffects model as each of the included studies were different in terms of age of participants, and type, dose and duration of interventions, but authors used random effects model only for outcomes with high heterogeneity and not explained by subgroup analysis. And sensitivity analysis was not reasonable in this case as majority of the included studies are low in quality. Were appropriate conclusions made? Yes \"These estimates are derived from very low to low quality evidence involving small studies limited to adolescents and as such the true effect may be substantially different from that estimated in this review. Clinicians should be cautious advising for or against metformin or OCP use when treating adolescents with PCOS\".

The role of metformi n in clinical care however rema ins uncertain with small, short term studies and variable endpoints. Metformin is not approved for use in PCOS, however it is not restricted from use in PCOS either. There is variability in use of metformin for PCOS women an d adolescents accordin g to the treating clinician specialty. GDG4: Metformin evidence review 6 ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options The majority favoured this option, however one member had a neutral vote. Research evidence Metformin versus placebo Twenty RCTs that address outcomes for this comparison were identified [120], of which 19 RCTs were in adults [14, 620], and 1 was in adolescents [5]. Weight: When 5 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo [1, 9, 12, 18, 19]. When three of the studies in those with BMI>25kg/m2 were subgrouped [9, 12, 18], metformin was better than BMI: When 15 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis [15, 7, 9, 10, 1317, 20, 21]; and when 11 of the RCTs in those with BMI>25kg/m2 was subgrouped [25, 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 20, 21]; metformin was better than placebo. WHR: When 8 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo (p=0.06 in favour of metformin) [1, 2, 4, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19]. When 3 of the RCTs in those with BMI<25kg/m2 were subgrouped [1, 14, 16], metformin was better than placebo. Hirsutism: When 6 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups [5, 8, 10, 14 16]. SHBG: When 13 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups [15, 810, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21]. In one very small RCT (n=20), where BMI was not reported, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of metformin [8]. FAI: When 6 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups [5, 8, 9, 15, 16, 21]. Testosterone: When 15 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis metformin was better than placebo, however there was no statistically significant difference for any of the BMI subgroups [15, 810, 13, 15, 16, 1821]. Fasting insulin: When 9 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo [24, 9, 10, 14, 18, 19, 21]. In one small RCT (n=60) of those with BMI <or>25kg/m2, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of metformin [19]. Fasting glucose: When 13 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo [15, 9, 10, 13, 14, 1821]. In one small RCT (n=58) of those with BMI <or>25kg/m2, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of metformin [19]. GDG4: Metformin evidence review 7 Cholesterol: When 10 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis [2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19]; and when 6 of the RCTs in those with BMI>25kg/m2 was subgrouped [2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14]; metformin was better than placebo. HDL: When 9 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups [2, 5, 9, 10, 1416, 18, 19]. LDL: When 9 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo (p=0.07 in favour of metformin) [2, 5, 810, 14 16, 19]. When 6 of the RCTs in those with BMI>25kg/m2 were subgrouped, metformin was better than placebo. Triglycerides: When 13 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis metformin was better than placebo, however there was no statistically significant difference for any of the BMI subgroups [2, 4, 5, 810, 13, 14, 16, 19]. There were no statistically significant differences between metformin and placebo for HOMA, menstrual cycles, CRP or PAI1. It is important to remain cautious due to low to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence across all outcomes. Gastrointestinal side effects were more prevalent in the metformin groups, but only 5 out of 20 studies including in total 358 women and metformin doses of 1500 1700mg/day reported on side effects without specific details. Ten to 62% of women taking metformin reported side effects. The majority of gastrointestinal side effects were mild to moderate and were selflimiting. The side effects reported included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain or nonspecified gastrointestinal disturbance. Only one study reported higher drop out in the metformin treated due to unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects and suggested lower start metformin dose (500 mg/day), There were no reports on Vitamin B12 levels. Metformin versus metformin + COCP Three RCTs that address this comparison in adults were identified [2224]. While a statistically significant improvement was found in WHR and triglycerides with use of metformin over metformin plus COCP, regardless of BMI, we remain cautious due to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence. No statistically significant differences were found for: Weight, BMI, FAI, testosterone, Fasting glucose (mg/dl), Fasting ratio, OGTT, Total cholesterol [mg/dl], HDL [mg/dl] and LDL [mg/dl]. Side effects were not reported. Metformin versus lifestyle Three RCTs that address this comparison in adolescents and adults were identified [5, 21, 25]. While a statistically significant improvement was found in testosterone with use of metformin over lifestyle; and in SHBG with the use of lifestyle over metformin, w e remain cautious due to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence. While not statistically significant, fasting glucose tended to favour metformin. No statistically significant differences were found for: BMI, WHR, PAI 1, Hirsutism(FG score), Fasting [mg/dl], Triglycerides CRP [mg/dl]. Side effects were GI related with metformin and only reported in one study including adult women. Metformin + lifestyle versus lifestyle \u00b1 placebo GDG4: Metformin evidence review 8 A systematic review including seven relevant RCTs that address this comparison in adults and adolescents was identified [26]. The evidence team conducted additional analysis of outcomes not addressed in the systematic review. No statis tically significant differences were found for any of the outcome s in this body of evidence of low to very low certainty and quality. Side effects were not reported. Metformin versus metformin (dose) One study was identified to address this comparison [27]. Age was not reported. There was no difference in weight between the two interventions in this very low quality of very low certainty. Other relevant outcomes were mentioned in this study, however no useable data was reported. The highest metformin dose used was 850 mg twice a day. Metformin versus anti-androgen + COCP One study was identified to address this comparison in adults [28]. 500g of metformin was better for fasting glucose; and 850g was better for CRP; however, there was no difference for BMI, HDL or triglycerides in th is moderate quality study with low certainty. Metformin + lifestyle versus anti-androgen + lifestyle Four RCTs that address this comparison in adults was identified [2932]. While a statistically significant improvement was fo und in cycles per year and HOMA-IR with use of metformin plus lifestyle over an ti-androgen plus lifestyle; and a statistically si gnificant improvement found in hirsutism, SHB G, fasting insulin and fasting glucose-insulin ration with use of anti-androgen plus lifestyle over metfor min plus lifestyle, we remain cautious due to low to very low certainty in effec t estimates and the quality of evidence. No statistically significant differences were found for: Weight Side effects were only reported in one study and included vom iting, nausea and diarrhea with metformin plus lifestyle; and abdo minal pain, polyuria, menstrual irregularity and dryness of the mouth with anti-androgen plus lifestyle. Three subjects in the metformi n group and four in the spironolactone gr oup withdrew due to side effects. Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL were reported in two studies ho wever units were unclear and there was missing data. Of the data presented, there were no differences between interventions for these ou tcomes in one study and in the other, p values were not reported for direct comparisons. Metformin + diet versus metformin + anti-androgen + diet Four RCTs that address this comparison in adults was identified [29, 30, 32, 33]. While a statistically significant improvement was found in testosterone and fasting glucose with use of metformin plus antiandrogen plus lifestyle over metformin plus lifestyle, we remain cautious due to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence. No statistically significant differences were found for: HOMAIR, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides. Side effects were only reported in one study and included vom iting, nausea, diarrhea symptoms with metformin plus lifestyle; an d nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and metrorrhagia with metformin plus anti-androgen plus lifestyle. Additional considerations None. GDG4: Metformin evidence review 9 Panel discussion There was stronger evidence in higher BMI groups for metabolic ou tcomes; inadequate evidence to make a recommendation about the use of metformin for menstrual regulation. The maximum dose used in the included studies was 850bd and the optimum dose in not known. Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion Gastrointestinal side effects may be present and resolve within a short period of time. Side effects are usually mild, self-lim iting and may be minimized with lower metformin starting dose. Extended release preparations and administration with fo od might also decrease gastrointestinal side effects. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Additional considerations GDG4: Metformin evidence review 10 None. Panel discussion Low to very low certainty evidence for the majority of comparison s and outcomes with very limite d data reported on side effects . Values Is there important uncert ainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was co nducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Additional considerations No studies reported any evidence on the value that cons umers or health professionals place on the outcomes. Highest ranked outcomes were weight, BMI, cycles and gastro-intes tinal side effects and the agents differed in their effects on these outcomes which is a key consideration in our balance of effects. All of the above should be weighed against particular values of the individual woman or adolescent in relation to her condition at the time of consultation. Panel discussion Acne is a feature of PCOS and may be a health concern for some women with PCOS, however objective assessment of acne is challen ging and this endpoint was not highly valued by consumers or health professionals in the GRADE outcome prioritization pr ocess. It is acknowledged that limited adole scent engagement occurred during this process. Balance of effects GDG4: Metformin evidence review 11 Does the balance between desirable and undesirabl e effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion Detailed judgements for this criterion include judgements regarding each of the four preceding criteria: Is there important uncertainty about or variability in how much people value the main outcomes? Variability on how much women or adolescents value main outcomes should be taken into account when considering using metformin. What is the overall certainty of the evidence of effects? Low to very low certainty of evidence in effect estimates and the quality of evidence across all outcomes. There is less evidence for adolescents and studies lack adequate diagnostic criteria as they don't report date of menarche. How substantial are the desirable anticipated effects? The stronger evidence for desirable metabolic outcomes is in higher BMI groups. There is inadequate evidence for reproductive outcomes such as menstrual regulation. There is limited data in adolescent girls. There is no data of the optimal dose to reach the desirable outcomes and the maximum metformin dose evaluated was 850 mg twice a day. How substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects? There is very limited data on undesirable side effects specifically in PCOS, indicating that side effects may be tolerable and selflimiting. How much less people value outcomes that are in the future compared to outcomes that occur now (their discount rates) The evidence for values was not sought besides initial GRADE outcome prioritization exercise. How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement GDG4: Metformin evidence review 12 Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Additional considerations None Panel discussion Metformin is low cost and widely available. Certainty of evidence of required resources What is the certainty of the eviden ce of resource requirements (costs)? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Additional considerations Circumstances in each region need to be considered when assessing cost and resources. Panel discussion None Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement GDG4: Metformin evidence review 13 Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Additional considerations There is no evidence on cost effectiveness of any in tervention in PCOS hence no judgements can be made Panel discussion None Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations COCP, metformin and anti-androgen use if off-label for the treatm ent of PCOS, however the use of COCP and metformin are general ly not restricted for use in PCOS. Panel discussion More efficacious in higher BMI groups. Unable to determine efficacy in adolescents. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement GDG4: Metformin evidence review 14 Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations None Panel discussion For the majority of women and adolescents the benefits of using metformin outweigh side effects. Side effects to improve accept ability can be minimized by lower starting dose, slow increase in dose and extended release preparations. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations None Panel discussion Implementation of these options is feasible and is currently performed routinely in the management of women diagnosed with PCOS and adolescents with a clear diagnosis of PCOS or with symptoms of PCOS before the diagnosis is made. Metformin is a low cost intervention that can be sustained in longer term. GDG4: Metformin evidence review 15 CONCLUSIONS Evidence-based recommendation 1 Type of recommendation Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation Metformin is recommended in adult women with PCOS for th e management of weight, hormonal and metabolic outcomes. Evidence-based recommendation 2 Type of recommendation Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation Metformin should be recommended for management of weight and metabolic outcomes in women with PCOS with BMI 25. Evidence-based recommendation 3 Type of recommendation Judgement GDG4: Metformin evidence review 16 Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation Metformin could be considered in adolescents with a clear diagnosis of PCOS or with some symptoms of PCOS before the diagnosis is made, but the evidence remains limited. Practice point Consider high metabolic risk ethnic groups. Practice point Where metformin is to be prescribed the following should be considered: Advise patients about GI side effects that are generally self limiting As side effects are dose related, starting at a low dose with slow dose incrementation is recommended. Extended release preparations can be used to minimize side effects. Based on evidence in other populations, metf ormin can be used long term if required. Practice point Pharmacotherapy including metformin should be considered in addition to lifestyle management. Justification There were beneficial effects that outweighs the undesirable ef fects however the quality of the evidence is not strong. There i s evidence that metformin is effective in improving weight, BMI, waist to hip ratio, testosterone, SHBG and TG in wo men with PCOS defined by the following PCOS criteria: Rotterdam , NIH or oligoamenorrhoea and hyperandrogenism. Some of the beneficial effects were noted in individuals with BMI higher than 25 (kg/m2). There were no significant effects of metformin on hirsutism, CRP, HOMA or PAI1. The maximum doses of metformin used were 850 mg BD and for a maximum trial duration of 48 weeks. Even though the majority of studies did not report side effects metformin there is evidence that causes mild to moderate gastro intestinal side effects. Subgroup considerations There were only 3 studies including adolescent girls with PCOS that did not report age of menarche or side effects. The definit ion of PCOS used was Ro tterdam and original NIH. GDG4: Metformin evidence review 17 The effect of metformin can vary according to baseline BMI. Implementation considerations Clarity over the regulation status of metfor min in PCOS is required. Metfomin is widely used and available for management of Ty pe 2 diabetes but is used off-label for management of PCOS in Europe, USA, Australia and New Zealand. Monitoring and evaluation Gastrointestinal side effects are common in individuals taking me tformin and should be monitored as they will impact on adheren ce. Vitamin B12 status should also be the subject of fu rther research to inform frequency of monitoring. Research priorities There is a need for high quality, well designed and adequately powered multicenter studies especially in adolescents with detailed report on adherence and adverse effects related to metformin. Importantly, these studies in both women and adolescents, require evaluation of different doses including 1 gram twice a day, extended release preparations and longer duration of treatment. Side effects in particular Vitamin B12evaluation are required. These low cost interventions require financia l support for research as the pharma indu stry is not interested in running them.

Weight: When 5 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo. When three of the studies in those with BMI>25kg/m2 were subgrouped, metformin was better than placebo. BMI: When 18 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis; and when 12 of the RCTs in those with BMI>25kg/m2 was subgrouped; metformin was better than placebo. WHR: When 10 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo (p=0.06 in favour of metformin). When 3 of the RCTs in those with BMI<25kg/m2 were subgrouped, metformin was better than placebo. Hirsutism: When 6 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups. GDG4: Metformin evidence review 21 SHBG: When 14 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups. In one very small RCT (n=20), where BMI was not reported, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of metformin. FAI: When 6 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups. Testosterone: When 16 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis metformin was better than placebo, however there was no statistically significant difference for any of the BMI subgroups. Fasting insulin: When 12 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo. In one small RCT (n=60) of those with BMI <or>25kg/m2, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of metformin. Fasting glucose: When 16 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo. In one small RCT (n=58) of those with BMI <or>25kg/m2, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of metformin. Cholesterol: When 13 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis; and when 7 of the RCTs in those with BMI>25kg/m2 was subgrouped; metformin was better than placebo. HDL: When 12 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, regardless of BMI subgroups. LDL: When 12 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis there was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo (p=0.07 in favour of metformin). When 6 of the RCTs in those with BMI>25kg/m2 were subgrouped, metformin was better than placebo. Triglycerides: When 13 RCTs were combined in metaanalysis metformin was better than placebo, however there was no statistically significant difference for any of the BMI subgroups. There were no statistically significant differences between metformin and placebo for HOMA, menstrual cycles, CRP or PAI1. It is important to remain cautious due to low to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence across all outcomes. Gastrointestinal side effects were more prevalent in the metformin groups.

While a statistically significant improvement was found in testosterone and fasting glucose with use of metformin plus antiandrogen plus lifestyle over metformin plus lifestyle, we remain cautious due to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence. No statistically significant differences were found for: HOMAIR, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides. Side effects included vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and hyperadrenergic symptoms with metformin plus lifestyle; and nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and metrorrhagia with metformin plus antiandrogen plus lifestyle.

The two systematic reviews included some but not all of the identified RCTs due to the different scope/PICO of each systematic review, therefore each systematic review also included additional RCTs that did not meet our PICO. For this reason, the systematic reviews could not be used to directly for this comparison. Both systematic reviews performed and reported risk of bias according to Cochrane and with sufficient detail, so these were adopted. We used data from original articles and performed our own conversions (in terms of units and variation) wherever means and SDs, SEs or CIs were reported. Where not reported, we used data from the two systematic reviews that collected additional data from original article authors in the form of means and SDs. For these additional data, we have made the assumption that the authors of the two systematic reviews have managed and reported data correctly. The data in the results tables and metaanalyses below reflect raw data collected and managed by the PCOS CRE evidence team as well as that of the systematic reviews. A major limitation in the evidence for this comparison is the lack of confidence in author reporting of units and conversions. Characteristics of included studies Rows highlighted grey indicate studies with participants described as obese. Rows highlighted orange indicate studies where BMI was not reported. Rows shaded green indicate that participants had BMI in the normal weight and overweight categories. Moghetti is shaded blue because whilst the study meets the PICO and has valuable data, the data cannot be included in metaanalyses because they have reported the number of participants in the whole study but not in each group.

ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS A systematic review by Naderpoor et al. was identified by our search, along with three RCTs that were included in the systematic review. Naderpoor 2015 included an additional RCT that did not meet out PICO. Therefore, we reperformed all metaanalyses that included this study (metaanalyses by Naderpoor are shaded grey) and for those outcomes where Naderpoor 2015 did not combined all three studies due to differences in timepoints (ie.

Whilst lifestyle change has a key role in t he management of obesity, the role of anti-obesity pharmacological agents in achievi ng weight loss and potential associated health be nefits is increasingly recognised with recent US Endocrine Society guidel ines (1), SR and Cochrane (2) in the area. However the role of these agents in PCOS and in reproductive-aged women remains unclear. Orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide are approved an ti-obesity medications in adu lts, each of which has been compared to placebo in randomised controlled trials. These medications are increasingl y being used in adults for a ssistance with weight loss. In light of very limited evidence, the guideline development gr oup were unable to make any evidence-based recommendations in wo men with PCOS, however the GDG are aware of evidence for these medications in the management of non-PCOS adults who are obese. A consensus recommendation has been made to manage obesity independent of PCOS with these medications. Therefore, the GRADE criteria have not been specifically addre ssed and instead has been used to guide releva nt clinical comment. ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Research evidence There was no evidence identified to answer this question in adolescents. Below is a su mmary of the evidence identified in adult s. Anti-obesity versus placebo GDG 4: Antiobesity evidence review 4 One study was identified to address this comparison (3). Due to th e lack of direct comparisons between groups (no p values repo rted for between groups for end of treatment data), it is uncertain whether there were any differences in this low qu ality study with low certainty for outcomes: Weight loss (kg); WH R (cm); Menstrual not reported. Anti-obesity versus anti-obesity One study was identified to address this comparison (4). Due to the lack of direct comparisons between groups (no p values rep orted for between groups for end of treatment data), it is uncertain whether there were any differences in this low qua lity study with low certainty for effects were reported. Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesi rable anticipated effects? Research evidence Side effects were not reported. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Research evidence Low to very low certainty evidence. Values Is there important uncert ainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise wa s conducted before evidence synthesis commenc ed and guided the GDG in their decisio n. Additional considerations No studies reported any evidence on the value that cons umers or health professionals place on the outcomes. Highest ranked outcomes were weight, BMI, cycles and GI side ef fects and the agents differed in their effects on these outcomes which is a key consideration in our balance of effects. All of the above should be weighed against particular values of the individual woman or adolescent in relation to her condition at the time of consultation. GDG 4: Antiobesity evidence review 5 CONCLUSIONS Practice point Anti-obesity medications are costly and have contraindications and adverse side effects. Consensus recommendation Anti-obesity medications could be considered, in addition to lifes tyle, for the management of obes ity in adult women with PCOS. Justification Given the absence of evidence, the guideline development group were unable to make any evidence-based recommendations in women with PCOS, however the GDG are aware of evidence for these medications in the management of non-PCOS adults who are obese according to SR, Cochrane and Endocrine Society guidelines . A consensus recommendation has been made to manage obesity independen t of PCOS with these medications. The GRADE criteria have not been specifically addre ssed and instead has been used to guide relevant clinical comment. The cost effectiveness of medical therapy in the treatment of obesity is low from evidence in the general population (5). Equity We do not anticipate any differences in the relative effectiveness of anti-obesity medications across different sub-groups and population of women. The cost of medications might affect access for d isadvantaged or women from a lower socioeconomic background. Acceptability Delivery of the medications (especially cons idering some are injectable), side effect s and cost may affect acceptability of thi s intervention. Feasibility The cost of the medications may make it difficult to afford for some women both in the short-term and long-term. Subgroup considerations Consensus recommendation will only apply to obese adult women not adolescent girls. There were no studies identified in adolesc ents and there is no evidence for these medications in the management of non-PCOS adolescents who are obese. Implementation considerations The implementation of this recommendation is limited as it only addresses weight but no other PCOS features. GDG 4: Antiobesity evidence review 6 Cost and regulation of these medications in different regions need s to be considered when implem enting this recommendation, esp ecially in women with moderate to severe obesity whose biggest concern is weight management. Monitoring and evaluation There are known contraindications and side effects of these medica tions that need to be evaluated and monitored for if used for obesity management. Research priorities There is a need for high quality well designed studies with metabolic and reproductive outcomes of high certainty comparing the antiobesity medications to placebo in adolescents and women with PCOS. Studies in adolescents in particular are currently lacking. Studies need to directly compare groups at the end of the intervention and also report on any adverse effects related to the medications.

Since these clinical signs negatively influences the psychologi cal well-being of PCOS women, the treatment with antiandrogen dr ugs has been proposed in the aim to improve their physical appearance, their psychologi cal situation and quality of life. It is mandatory to use concomitant contra ception with antiandrogens in order to av oid foetal male undervirilisation in the even t of unplanned pregnancy. Due to the growth cycle of hair, at least a 9-12 months course tr eatment is required in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the antiandrogen treatment in improving hirsutism and/or acne. The most investigated agents so far are spironolactone, cyproterone acetate (CPA), finasteride and flutamide. The GDG decided not to make a recommendation on this intervention based on clinical grounds as isolated anti-andr ogen therapy i s not indicated and evidence is very limited. Therefore, the GRADE criteria have not been specifically addresse d and instead has been used to guide relevant clinical comment . ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Research evidence Anti-androgen versus placebo GDG4: Antiandrogen evidence review 5 One study of adolescents was identified to address this comparison (1). Due to the lack of direct comparisons between groups (n o p values reported for between groups for end of treatment data), it is uncertain whether there were any differen ces in this very low quality stud y with very low certainty Side effects were not reported. Anti-androgen + lifestyle versus placebo + lifestyle One study was identified to address this comparison in adults (2). Due to the lack of direct comparisons between groups (no p values reported for between groups for end of treatment data), it is uncertain whether there were any differences in th is moderate quality study with moderate certainty for outcomes: Weight (kg); BMI (kg/m\u00b2); to The only side effect reported in the anti-androgen group was a mild increment in transaminase levels. Anti-androgen (daily) versus anti-androgen (every 3 days) Two RCTs that address this comparison in adults were identified (3, 4). While a statistically significant improvement was found in hirsutism FG score with use of the frequency of every 3 days over daily anti-androgens, we remain cautious due to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evi dence. No statistically signif icant differences were found for: BMI, testosterone, SHBG and fasting insulin. Gastro-intestinal related side effects were found in the group taking anti-androgen every 3 days (compared to those on daily tr eatment). Anti-androgen + diet versus metformin + anti-androgen + diet Three RCTs that address this comparison in adults were identified (2, 5, 6) . While a statistically significant improvement was found in fasting glucose and HOMA-IR with the addition of metformin to anti-androgen and lifestyle; and in tr iglycerides with anti-androgens and lifestyle (without metformin ); we remain cautious due to low to very low certainty in effect estimates and the quality of evidence. No statistically si gnificant differences were found of (mM/l), HDL (mmol/l), LDL (mmol/l). As noted above, it is difficult to offer definitive evaluation of the use of anti-androgens because of the poor quality of evid ence, lack of valid randomized controlled studies and limited relevant studies in other populations. Additional considerations It has to be noted that one of the studies was conducted in an obese PCOS population, which could be considered a confounder. Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesi rable anticipated effects? Research evidence Side effects were not clearly reported. Additional considerations GDG4: Antiandrogen evidence review 6 As the undesirable effect of antiandrogens is mostly related to mild hepatotoxicity, lifestyle does not seems to alleviate such a risk. Conversely, it seems th at the addition of metformin does not increase either the risk of elevat ed liver indices or general side effects. The potential for teratogenicity for anti-andr ogens especially when used as a single agent in women at risk for conception limi ts the use of these medications. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Research evidence Low to very low certainty evidence. Values Is there important uncert ainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise wa s conducted before evidence synthesis commenc ed and guided the GDG in their decisio n. Additional considerations No studies reported any evidence on the value that cons umers or health professionals place on the outcomes. Highest ranked outcomes were weight, BMI, cycles and gastro-intes tinal side effects and the agents differed in their effects on these outcomes which is a key consideration in our balance of effects. The most important factor is to understand the individual woman preferences may vary. The perception of hirsutism value in the health balance of the individual varies across lifespan. In general, hirsutism has a g reater impact on quality of life for younger women with PCOS. CONCLUSIONS Practice point If anti-androgens are prescribed, the safety profile in terms of liver function requires caution. The teratogenicity of anti-an drogens limits their useful as a single agent. Justification GDG4: Antiandrogen evidence review 7 There was insufficient evidence to make a clinical recommendation. There are plausible reasons for anticipating differences in the relative effectivenes s of anti-androgens for different PCOS phenotypes, ages and anthropometric characteristics . There is no evidence on the direct and indirect costs of u sing anti-androgens, however the cost of these treatments is generally not so high. Subgroup considerations Overweight and obesity are confounding factors in evaluating th e effect of treatment on the metabolic assessment and other clin ical parameters (e.g. menstrual irregularities). Implementation considerations Further research is needed before a recommendation can be made and implemented. Monitoring and evaluation Indicators of the drug effects and side effects (hormona l parameters, hirsutism scores and liver chemistries). Research priorities Comparison of efficacy of different antiandrogens agents Comparison of efficacy of different treatment schedules Assessment of optimal monitoring of adverse events A better selection of study participants in order to make possibl e a tailored approach - BMI, age, different phenotypes and met abolic assessment should be taken into consideration for future research.

Due to gastrointestinal side effects related to metformin and more serious adverse effects related to glitazones other medical options are needed in treating insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Inositol (myo-inositol and di-chi ro inositol) is a nutritional supplement that acts as a second messenger and has been shown to play a role in insulin signaling transduction. Previous studies have suggested improvement of insulin resistance and hormonal profile in women with PC OS during inositol treatment (1, 2). Furthermore, some data also suggests inositol may be effective in decreasing risk for gestational diabetes (3). 1) Unfer V, Nestler JE, Inositol(s) Women w ith PCOS: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Dec 17;(12):CD011507 ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Inositol versus placebo A Cochrane systematic review (Tang 2012) was identified to addr ess this question and comparison. No further, more current evid ence was identified. Findings from meta- analysis demonstrated that whilst serum SHBG (nmol/L) favoured inositol, there were no statistically significant differences be tween inositol and placebo for BMI, waist-hip or fasting insulin (uIU/L). Additional considerations None. Panel discussion Whilst there is limited evidence of benefit of inositol (in all forms), there is some suggestion of metabolic, hormonal and ovu latory benefit. As this agent is freely available, modest cost and appears to have a limited side effect profile, it may warrant consideration for use despite limited and low qua lity evidence. Women taking this agent are encouraged to advise their health care team when taking this agent. Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Side effects were not clearly reported. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion Side effects are poorly reported so evidence-based judgme nts on undesirable effects in wome n with PCOS cannot be made. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Low to very low certainty evidence for the majority of comparisons and outcomes. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion None. Values Is there important uncert ainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise wa s conducted before evidence synthesis commenc ed and guided the GDG in their decisio ns. Additional considerations No studies reported any evidence on the value that cons umers or health professionals place on the outcomes. Highest ranked outcomes were weight, BMI, cycles and gastro-intes tinal side effects and the agents differed in their effects on these outcomes which is a key consideration in our balance of effects. The most important factor is to understand what the individual woman at her particular lifestyle values the most. Panel discussion None. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and undesirabl e effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion None. Resources required How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion Over the counter product w ith low to moderate cost. Certainty of evidence of required resources What is the certainty of the eviden ce of resource requirements (costs)? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion None Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion There is no evidence on cost effectiveness of any in tervention in PCOS hence no judgements can be made. Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion The intervention is not being recommended thus equity is not relevant. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations None Panel discussion The intervention is not being recommended thus acceptability is not relevant. If the ef ficacy is proven in future research the acceptability may favor the option as this agent is freely available with moderate low cost. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Additional considerations None. Panel discussion The intervention is not being recommen ded thus feasibility is not relevant. CONCLUSIONS Evidence-based recommendation 1 Type of recommendation Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Recommendation Inositol (in any form) could not be recommended for treatment of women with PCOS. Practice point Women taking inositol are encouraged to advise their health care team. Justification Whilst there is limited evidence of benefit of inositol (in all forms) to make an evid ence based recommendation, there is some data suggesting metabolic, hormonal and ovulatory benefits. As this agent is freely available, modest cost and appears to have a limited side effect profile, it may warrant con sideration for use despite limited and low quality evidence. Women taking this agent are encouraged to advise their health care team when taking this agent. Subgroup considerations Might also be well tolerated in young patients. Implementation considerations Is likely to be of high value to consumer s, especially as it is a neutraceutical. As these agents have limited regulation, quality, consistency and combination or additional agents needs to be considered. Monitoring and evaluation Side effects should be captured and the quality and consistency of the products should be monitored. Research priorities The therapeutic effects and side effects of inositol (in any form) should be further strengthened with high quality research in adolescents and adults. In various forms, in isolation from other agents as well as in combination and includi ng clinical endpoints such as hormonal and metabolic outcomes and pregnancy and live birth rates and offspring outcomes acquired.

Evaluation of risk factors_response to therapy 1 5.1aI NARRATIVE REVIEW Clinical question: Should women with PCOS undergo preconception (prepregnancy) evaluation (assessment) for (and where possible correction of) risk factors that may adversely affect fertility and response to infertility therapy? Prevalence and problem Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common heterogeneous endocrine disorder of uncertain etiology, although genetics is indicated due to the increase in prevalence between first degree relatives and sisters and epigenetic impact from lifestyle and environmental exposure (4, 9,10). PCOS has lifelong psychological and mental health management implications and early diagnosis is crucial to optimise health. Lifestyle factors especially obesity and being overweight exacerbate the condition; hence prevention of weight gain from adolescence is very important. PCOS has been reported at rates of 1221% depending on diagnostic criteria, phenotype, age and ethnicity. The condition often results in several health complications, including menstrual dysfunction, infertility and metabolic syndrome disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The endometrium of women with PCOS is further compromised by obesity and may improve with weight loss (7,8). Despite its prevalence and implications for reproductive, metabolic, and psychological health, PCOS is under diagnosed, in part because of the diversity of phenotypes manifested by this condition. Women with PCOS suffer from greater body dissatisfaction. They are also at increased risk of mood, anxiety, depression, and eating disorders which may affect libido and sexual relationships, impacting fertility. (22, 23, 24, 25) Clinical practice gap: need for guidance There is currently no evidence based guideline on preconception evaluation and optimal intervention for women with PCOS. Assessment and modification of lifestyle aim to optimise fertility and response to ART. Summary of key information Modifiable risk factors known to impact fertility and response to ART: Body Mass Index <18 or >25, increased risk with increase in BMI. Smoking status, alcohol consumption, prescribed and recreational drug use, Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR - central adiposity), exposure to endocrine disruptors, untreated sexually transmitted infections, nutritional status, supplementation with folate, vitamin D, celiac disease and dental health review for periodontal disease treatment (2, 3, 5, 13,26). Sleep should also be assessed due to the association with BMI. OSA, symptomatic screening should be undertaken in overweight/obese PCOS women. This involves asking for classical symptoms including snoring, overnight apnoeas and daytime somnolence, definite diagnosis is via overnight polysomnography. There are multiple health benefits, including QOL and mental health, in diagnosing and treating OSA. A small study of 19 PCOS women found that a short 8week course of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) produced improved insulin sensitivity and benefits correlated with hours of CPAP usage and decreased BMI (11, 21). Mental health: Anxiety, depression and increased risk of suicide attempts coexist with PCOS, although it is unclear if this is a direct consequence of PCOS or due to associated psychological stressors such as obesity, hirsutism, body image issues and infertility (27). All women with PCOS should be screened for anxiety and depression. Eating disorders should be considered and explored, as PCOS women are found to be 6.4 times more likely to have an eating disorder than those without PCOS, irrespective of BMI (24, 25). All can impact relationship health and sexual intimacy for fertility as well as impacting ART treatment compliance or leading women to prematurely \"drop out of treatment\" due to the stress and demands of treatment (19). Mental health care supports treatment compliance, relationship health and quality of life. Pregnancy and fertility complications: Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of gestational diabetes, preterm birth, preeclampsia, miscarriage, still birth, longer time to conception and poor embryo development, reduced embryo implantation rates, increased risk of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (1) and ectopic pregnancy (18) all exacerbated by obesity. Lifestyle management is recommended as firstline treatment of PCOS, focusing on weight loss when BMI is >25, and preventing weight gain for all women, via dietary and exercise interventions. Women with a BMI >30 should be advised to undertake intensive support multidisciplinary contact for 36 months to support and monitor weight loss, prior to attempting other fertility treatments (2, 3, 5, 17, 20). In a 2014 systematic review assessing the effect of weight loss prior to ART, weight loss was found to improve natural conception, number of embryos available for transfer, ART pregnancies, live birth rate, reduced cancelled cycles, quantity of ART medications, reduce miscarriage rates and the number of ART cycles required to achieve a pregnancy (20). A 2017 systematic review and metaanalysis, (14) found that lifestyle interventions benefit weight loss and natural pregnancy rate, but not for live Evaluation of risk factors_response to therapy 2 birth rate or birth weight. However, natural birth rate did increase with lifestyle intervention (16, 27). Lifestyle modifications should nonetheless be extended to lean women in order to prevent weight gain, particularly as PCOS women suffer an increased propensity for weight gain (3). Weight loss: As there is good evidence of general health benefits from dietary and exercise interventions, a combined approach is recommended (6, 15). Effective strategies for instigating lifestyle intervention include multidisciplinary team support and self monitoring techniques such as food diaries and pedometers. Relapse prevention techniques to maintain weight loss such as engagement of social support and goal setting should be provided (17). Women should be advised and encouraged that the benefits of lifestyle intervention may be observed with as little as 510% weight loss (3). The optimal dietary composition for preconception health has not been established. However studies have found improved quality of life reported for a lowglycemic index diet, and improved depression, and selfesteem for a high protein diet. (6) Current dietary guidelines suggest multidisciplinary supported approach with low calorie diet, limiting sugar and alcohol, combined with monitoring food intake and weight (6, 18). Intensive weight loss should be embarked upon prior to attempts to conceive as intensive weigh loss prior to (IVF) has been associated with adverse outcomes including cycle cancellation and decrease in fertilisation, implantation, ongoing pregnancy and live birth (17). There is evidence of beneficial effects from exercise in PCOS women as improving reproductive, mental and metabolic health. The PCOS Australian Alliance recommends 150 min of exercise weekly, including 90 min of moderate tohigh intensity aerobic activity at 60-90% of maximal heart rate (12, 13,17). Bariatric surgery should only be considered as a second line therapy to improve fertility outcomes in PCOS women with anovulation and obesity (BMI 35 kg/m2) resistant to intensive lifestyle modification and/or pharmacotherapy (17). Recommendations CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT (SAME AS QUESTION 2) As for all women planning pregnancy, women with PCOS should consider factors such as weight, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, exercise, sleep and mental, emotional and sexual health to optimise reproductive and obstetric outcomes. See also sections: Lifestyle; Assessment and Management of Emotional Wellbeing; and Cardiometabolic risk RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Further adequately powered, well designed, conducted and reported RCTs are required to determine the effect of diet (including optimal dietary composition) and physical activity in the preconception period in women across the PCOS phenotypes, reporting on live birth and obstetric outcomes. GRADE considerations Desirable effects Substantial benefits are seen with weight loss, smoking cessation, omitting alcohol, exercise, sleep improvements, management of mental health issues, including mood, eating, sexual health disorders, to optimise reproductive outcomes for women with PCOS and their offspring's health. Improved health outcomes Improved response to ART treatments, hence potential for reduced treatment costs Undesirable effects No harmful effects. Consideration of advanced maternal age and appropriate interventions. Values Highly valued by clinicians, health care providers and women with PCOS when supported with education of the benefits of lifestyle intervention and supported intervention. Balance of effects The balance between desirable and undesirable effects favours the option being recommended Subgroups Different subgroups may benefit from dietary composition (for instance low GI diet for healthy weight women or low weight women) but not weight loss. Further research is needed in this area. Suggest personalised lifestyle prescriptions for each woman with PCOS and her partner. Evaluation of risk factors_response to therapy 3 Resource requirements Further research is needed to establish optimal lifestyle change interventions for subgroups. Education of service delivery and support health care workers in delivery of preconception support. Public health and health professional education resources. Service delivery support resources. Cost effectiveness Costeffectiveness of the option favours the option being recommended in terms of health benefits. Beyond the scope of this review for financial benefits. Equity Subgroups would require special consideration in access and programme design to optimise engagement and opportunity to access lifestyle change support. Acceptability There is established public health acceptability of weight loss, smoking cessation and obesity management for general health outcomes. Women diagnosed with PCOS have often been informed of the benefits of lifestyle intervention such as weight loss to reduce PCOS risk. Infertility patients are motivated to make lifestyle changes, for instance, women are more likely to cease smoking at this time than at any other throughout their lifetime. Health care professionals appreciate the benefits of lifestyle improvements, but will need resource provision to provide support to women with PCOS. Feasibility Feasible, yes. Will need to be scoped and sub groups and resources appropriately. Barriers - budgetary and resource constraints within each region / countries health care priorities and budgets. Implementation Beyond scope of this review. Suggest Cost / benefit analysis presented for International health departments, examining the impact on the health of the woman with PCOS, for her general health, reproductive health, her infertility, population implications, infant and child health outcomes and ART costs. Care provision via primary care, general practitioners, preconception midwives, nurses and development of effective targeted public health campaigns. Monitoring and evaluation Monitored Woman's PCOS health, cardiometabolic, hormonal, BMI, health. Reproductive outcomes, offspring health, longer term health outcomes. Evaluation of implementation - success of campaigns, awareness, behaviour change, service delivery, impact on monitored reproductive outcomes. Research priorities Optimal dietary composition has not been established. Infertile women are particularly vulnerable and try a myriad of diets in pursuit of a weight management solution. The benefits of weight loss, exercise and smoking cessation has been well established. We lack evidence for optimal dietary composition for the various PCOS phenotypes, and this should be a research priority. In writing the recommendations and practice points for these questions, the work of guideline development group two and three was considered on lifestyle and psychological issues. Uncertainties on preconception and antenatal care in the general population were considered. References 1. Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. (2008).

Evaluation of risk factors_pregnancy outcomes 1 5.1aII NARRATIVE REVIEW Clinical question: Should women with PCOS and with or without infertility undergo preconception (prepregnancy) evaluation (assessment) for (and where possible correction of) risk factors that may lead to adverse (early or late) pregnancy outcomes? Prevalence and problem Estimated prevalence of PCOS, ranges from 518% depending on the diagnostic criteria and population studied [1, 2]. Increased prevalence of pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, gestational diabetes (GDM), hypertension in pregnancy (HTP), preeclampsia (PE) and preterm delivery (PTD) is reported among women with PCOS (15). The prevalence of overweight and obesity among PCOS has increased over time [3] and varies in different populations. Estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity among PCOS, ranges from 6% to 100%, with an almost doubled risk for PCOS women to be obese compared to controls [4]. Women with PCOS are more obese and gain more weight over time than the general population [5]. The increased risk of HTP (x 2.1), PE (x1.9) and PTD (x1.4) seem to be mostly attributed to pregestational overweight/obesity among women with PCOS, while the risk for GDM (x 2.9) seems increased by both the PCOS condition per se, and preconception overweight/obesity (15) [6]. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance There is currently no evidence based guideline on preconception evaluation, which targets specifically women with PCOS. Prospective randomized studies that evaluate the effect of a screening program is also lacking. Preconception assessment should aim to 1) identify individual risk, 2) if possible, modify risk factors and 3) and provide appropriate antenatal care to ensure best possible pregnancy outcome. Summary of key information Overweight and obesity are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes [7]. The vast majority of women with PCOS are overweight/obese. A 10% difference in prepregnancy BMI was associated with at least a 10% lower risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, indicated preterm delivery, macrosomia, and stillbirth [8]. In women with PCOS, pregestational overweight and obesity increased the risk of IR and prediabetes [9]. High BMI, and fasting glucose before pregnancy in women with PCOS: associated with HTP, PTD and LGA[10] Preconception lifestyle modification with weight loss improved ovulation rate and life birth rate [11]. Preconception weight loss improved QoL, depression and anxiety symptoms [12]. Women with PCOS at reproductive age (30 yrs) and mean of BMI 27 kg/m2 have increased cardiovascular risk, and 24% were in need for medical treatment of blood pressure according to AHA guideline for CVD [13]. Recommendations Clinical practice point - same as question 1 As for all women planning pregnancy, women with PCOS should consider factors such as weight, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, exercise, sleep and mental, emotional and sexual health to optimise reproductive and obstetric outcomes. See also sections: Lifestyle; Assessment and Management of Emotional Wellbeing; and Cardiometabolic risk Evaluation of risk factors_pregnancy outcomes 2 GRADE considerations Desirable effects Preconception weight management - weight reduction Low evidence for preconception lifestyle, weight screening/evaluation of women with PCOS. However, benefits of weight loss, healthy BMI, and healthy lifestyle for the parents are well established to reduce pregnancy risk. One retrospective study addressed the prepregnancy maternal BMI and intervention that improved metabolic function in pregnancy. One observational study addressed the increased chance to obtain a baby for obese women with PCOS if they were regularly physically active. Two RCTs assessed pretreatment lifestyle modifications and weight loss on ovulation rate and live births. Screening for prediabetes and T2DM No evidence for screening for prediabetes and T2DM in women with PCOS Indirect \"evidence\"; Prospective clinical studies report high incidence of GDM in PCOS. Metaanalyses report increased incidence of GDM for women with PCOS compared with weightmatched controls. Screening for hypertension Metaanalyses report increased incidence of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy for women with PCOS compared to weight matched controls. One study reports on need for medical treatment of BP in \u00bc of the women with PCOS, at fertile age. Assessment of emotional and mental wellbeing One RCT reports on preconception weight loss and QoL, depression and anxiety. Undesirable effects Undesirable effects are not reported or identified Values We found no studies addressing this issue; however public health policy values improved preconception health for pregnancy outcomes for the mother and offspring. Balance of effects No reports on this issue. Undesirable effects might be, anxiety caused by focus on possible negative outcome pregnancy. However, clinically observed patients value the opportunity to do something proactive to help themselves and their baby, but need support with lifestyle change. Subgroups Normalweight women might have different recommendation than overweight/obese women Resource requirements We didn't find any evidence for this as beyond the scope of this review. Cost effectiveness We didn't find any evidence for this. Equity We didn't find any evidence for this, but on a general basis, we can assume that disadvantaged groups will have difficulties to afford prepregnancy consultations - if not covered by health insurance or access to medical care. Acceptability We didn't find any evidence for this. We cannot see any ethical concerns for instance, public health policy supports obesity management Evaluation of risk factors_pregnancy outcomes 3 Feasibility We didn't find any evidence for this. The barriers should be low to implementations, as the suggested evaluations are simple, cheap medical routines. Implementation We didn't find any evidence for this. Probably the level of care could be kept to primary care and even to specially educated midwives and nurses and development of effective public health campaign Monitoring and evaluation We didn't find any evidence for this. But it would be logical to measure the interest from the women for the recommended options and their evaluation and the pregnancy outcome. Research priorities There is a need for high quality, welldesigned and adequately powered multicenter studies to evaluate the effect of screening and preconception evaluation of women with PCOS. Clustered randomization in public health service at primary or secondary care level could be an option. In writing the recommendations and practice points for these questions, the work of guideline development groups two and three were considered on lifestyle and psychological issues. Uncertainties on preconception and antenatal care in the general population were considered. References 1.

Pregnancy monitoring 1 5.1aIII NARRATIVE REVIEW Clinical question: Should women with PCOS undergo close (early or late) pregnancy monitoring for adverse pregnancy outcomes? Prevalence and problem Increased prevalence of pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, gestational diabetes (GDM), hypertension in pregnancy (HTP), preeclampsia (PE) and preterm delivery (PTD) are reported among women with PCOS (7). The prevalence of overweight and obesity among PCOS has increased over time [1] and varies in different populations [2]. The increased risk of HTP (x 2.1), PE (x1.9) and PTD (x1.4) seems to be mostly attributed to pregestational overweight/obesity among women with PCOS, while the risk for GDM (x 2.9) seems increased by both the PCOS condition per se, and by overweight/obesity (7). Clinical practice gap: need for guidance There are no guidelines on antenatal care which target specifically women with PCOS. Antenatal followup recommendations based on studies of pregnant PCOS women lack. The conclusions drawn here are indirect, and based on the evidence that pregnancy complications such as GDM, HT, PE and PTD are more frequent among women with PCOS. Antenatal care in women with PCOS should aim to 1) detect, and if possible, modify risk factors and 2) provide appropriate care to ensure best possible pregnancy outcome. Summary of key information Overweight and obesity is associated with poor pregnancy outcome [3]. Overweight is strongly associated with PCOS. As increased risk for miscarriage, GDM, HT/PE and PTD is well documented among women with PCOS, there is an indirect evidence to identify risk factors and if possible modify and treat them. Close monitoring of weight, during pregnancy according to general guidelines to prevent excess weight gain is recommended [4]. Screening with HbA1c in early pregnancy to detect diabetes and risk of adverse pregnancy outcome is important [5]. A prospective study found that 24% of the women with PCOS develop GDM during closely monitored pregnancy [6]. Detection of gestational diabetes by screening with OGTT at week 2426 is probably advisable. Detection of hypertension and PE is part of all antenatal programs. As women with PCOS have irregular cycles, early ultrasound enables determination of gestational age and detection of major malformations. As both large for gestational age and small for gestational age offspring are reported, and GDM is frequent, monitoring of fetal growth by ultrasonography is probably useful. Recommendations CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS Since women with PCOS are at high risk of GDM, consider offering early OGTT at 1618 weeks of pregnancy and if negative, a further test at 28 weeks of pregnancy. Women with PCOS who are pregnant are at increased risk of adverse maternal and offspring outcomes and may require close monitoring. GRADE considerations Desirable effects Close weight management in pregnancy Pregnancy monitoring 2 We didn't find any evidence for this. However, benefits of weight control during pregnancy, and close followup for women with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome are well established to reduce pregnancy risk. One study reported that women with PCOS had recommended weight gain in pregnancy when they received diet and lifestyle counseling and were closely weight monitored. Screening for GDM No evidence for screening for GDM specifically in women with PCOS. Indirect \"evidence\". Prospective clinical studies report high incidence of GDM in PCOS. Metaanalyses report increased incidence of GDM for women with PCOS compared with weightmatched controls. When screening was performed in first trimester and gestational week 32, 24% met the WHO criteria for GDM Screening for hypertension Metaanalyses report increased incidence of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy for women with PCOS compared to weight matched controls. Early ultrasound examination and monitoring of fetal growth No evidence Undesirable effects Undesirable effects are not reported or identified Values Public health policy values improved pregnancy care for pregnancy outcomes for the mother and offspring. Balance of effects Undesirable effects might be, anxiety caused by focus on possible negative outcome pregnancy. However, patients value the opportunity of proactive followup to help themselves and their baby. Subgroups Normalweight women might have different recommendation than overweight/obese women Resource requirements We didn't find any studies addressing this Certainty of evidence of required resources We didn't find any evidence for this Cost effectiveness We didn't find any evidence for this. Equity Disadvantaged groups may have difficulties to afford pregnancy consultations - if not covered by health insurance or access to medical care. Acceptability We cannot see any ethical concerns. Feasibility The barriers should be low to the implementations, as the suggested evaluations are simple, cheap medical routines. Implementation Probably the level of care could be kept to primary care level and even to specially educated midwives and nurses. Monitoring and evaluation But it would be logical to measure the pregnancy outcome for the women if recommended options are adhered to. Research priorities Pregnancy monitoring 3 There is a need for high quality, welldesigned and adequately powered multicenter studies to evaluate the effect of close monitoring of weight. Large prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal timing, frequency and type of testing in pregnancy for early identification of GDM in women with PCOS. Start of RCT sentence to determine the effect of lifestyle interventions including dietary composition, nutritional supplements and physical activity in pregnancy on maternal and offspring outcomes.

Tubal patency testing 1 5.1b NARRATIVE REVIEW Clinical question: Should women with PCOS and infertility due to anovulation alone with normal semen analysis have tubal patency testing prior to starting ovulation induction with timed intercourse or IUI treatment or delayed tubal patency testing? Prevalence and problem One of the leading causes of female infertility is tubal pathology. It has been estimated that it affects around 30% of infertile women. The diagnostic assessment of infertile women often include tubal testing by hysterosalpingography (HSG) or laparoscopy. Clinical gap and need for guidance PCOS is the most frequent cause of anovulation in infertile women. Ovulation induction is the most common treatment. There is little information about the prevalence of tubal pathology or for the need of intrauterine insemination with normal semen analysis in infertile women with PCOS. Summary of key information There is no evidence to support that Hydrosalpinges or other fallopian tube disorders are more frequent in PCOS women (1) Therefore it would be suitable to perform histerosalpingography prior to IUI or timed intercourse (TI) PCOS women with the following clinical risk factors that are independent of PCOS and consistent with usual infertility care. Risk factors for Infertility associated with tubal pathology: 1) Women with PCOS and clinical records of previous abdominal septic surgery like peritonitis or any pelvic surgical procedure. 2) Women with PCOS with serum positive testing for Sexual Transmitted Disease (STD) or Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) might be considered at risk etiologic factor that potentially disrupt fallopian tube function. PositiveChlamydia Antibody Test? However, this test has little clinical value. 3) PCOS associated with endometriosis. Peritubal -adnexal adhesions. Do we need laparoscopy Unfortunately there is a lack of reliable information regarding of starting ovulation induction with Clomiphene Citrate (CC) in PCOS patients with normal semen analysis associated with IUI or Timed Intercourse (TI). The paper by Hatem Abu Hasmin et all (2) indicates that induction of ovulation with CC and timed intercourse is effective as that with intrauterine insemination for achieving pregnancy. This finding would be important since timed intercourse could represent the initial treatment option, being less invasive and less expensive than IUI. However the authors do not include in their research a third arm like one receiving CC without IUI or TI. Recommendations CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS In women with PCOS and infertility due to anovulation alone with normal semen analysis, the risks, benefits, costs and timing of tubal patency testing should be discussed on an individual basis. Tubal patency testing should be considered prior to ovulation induction in women with PCOS where there is suspected tubal infertility. Tubal patency testing 2 RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Further research is required to identify the optimal timing and method of assessing tubal patency in women with PCOS and infertility due to anovulation alone with normal semen analysis considering cost effectiveness and quality of life implications for the woman or the couple. GRADE considerations Desirable effects If the patient has clinical history of pelvic surgery, PID, STD or endometriosis it would be desirable to have a histerosalpingography preceding ovulation induction with time intercourse or with IUI. Undesirable effects Histerosalpingography technique needs small dilation of the cervix that generally produces some discomfort. Difficulties like uterine damage, infection or PID are infrequently complications. Antibiotic (Azithromycin) are usually prescribed. Values Patients appreciate the outcome of the information provided. Patients do not like to lose time. Balances effect The balance between the options favours the desirable suggestion to examine tubal patency test if required. Subgroups Group of patients that do not have the features described in section\" desirable effects\" associated with at least 3 suitable treatments of induction of ovulation including timed intercourse or IUI with negative results. This group of patients is candidate for histerosalpingography and in some case Hysteroscopy Laparoscopic procedure Resource requirements Radiology techniques, ultrasound equipment's and endoscopic armamentarium should be available. Cost effectiveness The cost support the option recommended Equity Affiliations with State University or National Health Service are the traditional partners for these types of initiative. Facilitate the access to poor people. Acceptability - Feasibility Stakeholders and donors could contribute to fulfil the implementation of the initiative. Monitoring and evaluation Follicular development and follicular rupture or progesterone determination could provide important information about the feature of the cycle. Research Priorities It could be important to reevaluate if timed intercourse and IUI have the same efficiently in PCOS women among men with normal semen analysis. It should be important to select the PCOS Phenotypes. Is not the same to induce ovulation in PCOS A than PCOS D.

Contents Background ............................................................................................................................... ........................... 2 Summary of evidence 3 Findings 10 tables included studies .............................................................................................. 25 Aromatase inhibitors 2 Background Aromatase inhibitors are oral ovulation inducing drugs that were first proposed as new ovulation inducing agents in anovulatory women (with an inadequate response to clomiphene citrate) in 2001 (Mitwally and Casper 2001). The most commonly used aromatase inhibitors in ovulation induction are letrozole and anastrozole, with letrozole being the most widely used (Elizur and Tuland 2008). Anastrazole is likely less effective than letrozole, given its proven inferiority to clomiphene in industry sponsored studies.(Tredway, Schertz et al. 2011) The enzyme aromatase is a member of the cytochrome P450 hemoprotein containing enzyme complex super family and catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens, specifically the conversion of testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone respectively in the ovary, and likely in other areas including adipose tissue and the hypothalamus. The exact mechanism of aromatase inhibition inducing ovulation is unknown. However it is generally accepted that aromatase inhibitors inhibit oestrogen biosynthesis, thereby releasing the hypothalamus/pituitary axis from oestrogenic negative feedback and increasing the secretion of FSH by the pituitary.(Adashi 1984 ) This is analogous to the proposed mechanism of clomiphene as a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM). As a result, the ovary receives increased FSH stimulation, allowing for greater follicular growth and development and development of an ovulatory follicle(s) from the antral follicle pool. The main incentives for the proposal of aromatase inhibitors as ovulation induction agents were to improve pregnancy rates with first line treatments as well as avoid some of the adverse effects of clomiphene citrate including the effects on the endometrium and cervical mucus (Healey, Tan et al. 2003) and the increased risk of multiple pregnancy (Casper 2003). Clomiphene resistance, defined as failure to ovulation in response to ovulation induction is common and may affect over 25% of women with anovulation treated with clomiphene(Legro, Barnhart et al. 2007) and clomiphene failure, defined as failure to conceive after ovulation an even larger percentage of women.i (Imani, Eijkemans et al. 1999). Although there have been data from smaller studies to suggest higher rates of monofollicular ovulation and thicker endometriums in the luteal phase after ovulation induction with letrozole (Casper 2003), larger trials to date have not confirmed these findings or the hope for a significantly lower multiple pregnancy rate.(Imani, Eijkemans et al. 2002 January) Letrozole is typically administered on days 3-7 of the menstrual cycle at doses of 2.5-7.5 mg per day in 2.5mg increments (Pritts 2010). Adverse effects include gastrointestinal disturbances, asthenia, hot flushes, headache and back pain (Holzer, Casper et al. 2006). While hot flushes are significantly less common with letrozole and clomiphene, fatique and dizziness are more common.(Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014) The potential teratogenic effect of letrozole for infertility treatment was first raised at an American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting in 2005 where an oral abstract presentation suggested that the use of letrozole for infertility treatment might be associated with a higher risk of congenital cardiac and bone malformations in newborns (Biljan, Hemmings et al. 2005). These results were never confirmed in a peer reviewed journal but led to a series of black box warnings in various countries to avoid use as an infertility agent. However multiple subsequent case series anomaly (Tulandi, Martin et al. 2006, Forman, Gill et al. 2007, Dehbashi, Kazerooni et al. 2009, Sharma, Ghosh et al. 2014, Tatsumi, Jwa et al. 2016) as well as large multicenter randomized clinical trials (Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014, Diamond, Legro et al. 2015) failed to note an increased congenital anomaly rate with letrozole nor significant differences between letrozole and clomiphene with all prevalences of anomalies with letrozole or clomiphene under 5% (the expected anomaly rate in this population is 58% (Davies, Moore et al. 2012)).

Moderate Egypt Rotterdam NR 1: 40 2: 40 1: of bias Risk of bias for the included studies were rated as low to high. Studies of moderate to high risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. The most common reasons for the ratings assigned include: unclear whether allocation to the intervention group was concealed; unclear whether participants, investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention group; unclear if all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated; power calculations were not reported; and a lack of conflict of interest statements. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Generalisability Studies were conducted in university departments, outpatient clinics in hospitals and laboratories in Egypt, Iraq, Bangladesh, Iran, India, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US. Aromatase inhibitors 10 Findings AIs versus placebo One small RCT (Kamath 2010) with a low risk of bias compared letrozole to placebo in women with clomiphene citrate resistant PCOS and found that letrozole was better than placebo for ovulation rate per patient (Letrozole: 6 patients/18 patients (33.33%), Placebo: 0 patients/18 patients (0%), p=0.006) but there was no difference between letrozole and placebo for pregnancy rate per patient or live birth rate per patient. It is important to note that the findings from this study are of low certainty due to serious risk of imprecision. This study was included in a metaanalysis by Franik 2014 and Misso 2012, however since there is only one study, the metaanalyses do not provide additional evidence.

AIs versus CC Thirteen RCTs compared letrozole with CC. Seven of these RCTs had a high risk of bias (Atay, Cam et al. 2006, Zeinalzadeh, Basirat et al. 2010, SheikhElArab Elsedeek and Elmaghraby 2011, Banerjee Ray, Ray et al. 2012, Kar 2012, Nazik and Kumtepe 2012, Selim and Borg 2012), two had a moderate risk of bias (Begum, Ferdous et al. 2009, Dehbashi, Kazerooni et al. 2009) and four had a low risk of bias (Bayar, Kiran et al. 2006, Badawy, Abdel Aal et al. 2009, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014). Upon metaanalysis, we found that letrozole was better than clomiphene citrate for ovulation rate per patient; pregnancy rate per patient; and live birth rate per patient. There was no difference between letrozole and clomiphene citrate for multiple pregnancy rate per patient; and miscarriage rate per patient. When subgroup analysis was conducted for studies that included women with PCOS who were therapy na\u00efve, there was no difference between the two interventions for any outcome though we note that for pregnancy rate per patient the OR 1.68 [95% CI 0.96, 2.94] had an I2 of 0% and a p value of 0.07.

AI versus laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS) Three RCTs with low risk of bias (Abu Hashim 2010, Abdellah 2011 and Ibrahim 2017) compared letrozole to laparoscopic ovarian surgery and found that there was insufficient evidence of a difference between letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian surgery. One of the RCTs in 147 women with clomiphene citrate resistance found that letrozole was better than laparoscopic ovarian surgery for ovulation rate per cycle, Aromatase inhibitors 12 however the evidence is of low certainty.

Aromatase inhibitors 14 Recommendations EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATION(S) Letrozole, should be considered the first line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome with no other infertility factors. GRADE: Moderate Certainty CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT The use of letrozole is still off label in many countries of the world. Where off label use of medications is allowed, health professionals should discuss possible concerns about teratogenicity and side effects with the woman. (ensure this is across all interventions) - get wording about HPs should be aware. Where it is not allowed, clinicians should use other ovulation induction agents. Letrozole should not be given where there is any possibility of a pregnancy (needs to go for CC as well) The risk of multiple pregnancy appears to be less with letrozole compared to CC. Evidence identified by key contact after the search date: Amer SA1, 1638. doi: 10.1093/humrep/dex227. Aromatase inhibitors 15 GRADE framework Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework In women with PCOS, are aromatase inhibitors effective for improving fertility outcomes? ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in evidence review. Panel discussion Patients are significantly more likely both to ovulate and to have a live birth after use of letrozole compared to clomiphene, the previous first line agent. The likeli hood of live birth is increased 40-60% with letrozole compared to clomiphene. Similarly the failure to ovulat e at all (letrozole resistance) is reduced 2-3 fold with letrozole versus clomiphene (absolute chance ~10%). Undesirable effects How substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in evidence review. Panel discussion Multiple pregnancy rate appear lower th an clomiphene. Hot flushes, genera lly the least desired side effect of any anti-oestrogen, is less common wi th letrozole than clomiphene, but still present. Fatigue and dizziness are more common. While current data do not support the association of letrozole use with increased anomaly rates, anomalies still occur without a specific pattern to suggest a po tential interaction or mechanism. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Judgement Aromatase inhibitors 16 No included studies Very low Low Moderate High Research evidence See above in evidence review. Panel discussion The body of evidence included here is of very low to mo derate certainty with serious to very serious risk of bias, serious inconsistency, imprecisio n, indirectness, and publication bias. Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was conducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Generally a live birth, as opposed to restoration of ovulation or a clinical pregnancy remains the desired infertility treatment outcome of both patie nt and clinician. Further research should focus on healthy perinatal outcomes of infant and mother, and eventual long term development of the infant. Balance of effects Does the balance between desi rable and undesirable effect s favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion The balance of benefits in terms of improved live births with letrozole and less hot flushes currently outweighs the adverse effects of relatively increased fa tigue and dizziness, multiple pregnancy, and concerns about congenital anomalies (given li mited evidence for these effects). How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Aromatase inhibitors 17 Judgement Don't know Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Proscription of prescribing by national agencies may li mit use of letrozole is specific countries or regions. These may change with time. For instance letrozole, previously proscribed in India, may now be used for ovulation induction. Because letrozole is a newer dr ug than clomiphene and may enjoy ongoing patent protection in specific countries or regions, the associ ated increased expense of the drug may favour cheaper generic forms of clomiphene. However as patent exclus ivity expires, the price of letrozole and clomiphene may be comparable. Certainty of evidence of required resources What is the certainty of the eviden ce of resource requirements (costs)? Judgement No included studies Very low Low Moderate High Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion There is no certainty of evidence for this. Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Formal cost effectiveness studies of letrozole have not yet been reported. Equity Aromatase inhibitors 18 What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement Don't know Varies Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion There are currently no known disadvantaged group or di fferent baseline conditions that may selectively favour use of any ovulation induction agent. Varies by ava ilability in different countries. Willingness of HPs to prescribe. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Perception of the risks of letrozole, including multiple pr egnancy or congenital anomalies, may lead to the choice of other treatment modalities with greater control over these outcomes. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion The major barriers to implementation of the recommen dation are regulatory agencies forbidding the off label use of letrozole for ovulation induction and the perceptions of patients and clinicians to stick with established treatment options. Aromatase inhibitors 19 CONCLUSIONS Evidence-based recommendation 1 Letrozole, should be considered the first line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome with no other infertility factors. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice points The use of letrozole is still off label in many countries of the world as is metformin. Where off label use of medications is allowed, health professionals should discuss possible concerns about teratogenicity and si de effects with the woman Where it is not permitted, clinicians should use other ovulation induction agents. Letrozole should not be given where there is any po ssibility of a pregnancy (needs to go for CC as well) The risk of multiple pregnancy appears to be less with letrozole compared to CC. Justification The guideline development group decided that letrozole was a clinically important treatment option and thus, a strong recommendation. Subgroup considerations There are no known ethnic or racial differences in response to letrozole. It appears as or more effective than clomiphene in women of all BMI classes. Implementation considerations Stakeholders, both patient support groups and leading clinicians should lobby for evidence based treatment recommendations. Where uncertainty persis ts about the risk/benefit ratio of the treatment, further high quality clinical trials should be conducted to replicate existing data. Monitoring and evaluation Continued surveillance is necessary to further delineate rare maternal and fetal adverse effects of letrozole treatment. Further reporting of multiple pregnancy rates is paramount to uphold or re ject initial hypotheses that multiple pregnancy rates are decreased with letrozole compar ed to clomiphene. Other outcomes such as pregnancy loss rates, at all stages of gestation, should be monitored. Research priorities As noted above, further scrutiny of multiple pregnancy ra tes, pregnancy loss rates, pe rinatal complications (both mother and infant) and congenital anomaly rates should be sy stematically captured and reported in clinical studies.

EXTERNAL VALIDITY - IS THIS STUDY AND ITS RESULTS GENERALIZABLE TO MY SYSTEMATIC REVIEW QUESTION? Patient/population/ participants Infertile women 18 to 40 years of age with PCOS Age (yr): 85; letrozole: 73 750 analysed ITT Setting Academic Health Centers throughout the United States Intervention/indicator After spontaneous menses or withdrawal bleeding induced by progestin administration (medroxyprogesterone acetate [Provera], 5 mg per day for 10 days), clomiphene citrate (50 mg daily) was administered, beginning on cycle day 3 for 5 days and for up to five menstrual cycles. The dose was increased in subsequent cycles in cases of nonresponse (progesterone level during the midluteal phase, <3 ng per milliliter) or a poor ovulatory response (progesterone levels indicative of ovulation but with values clustering just above the cutoff point [see the Supplementary Appendix]), noted in 2% of 2777 treatment cycles. The maximum daily dose of clomiphene was 150 mg (three pills) given for 5 days. Investigators had the option to induce menstrual bleeding with medroxyprogesterone acetate after an anovulatory cycle; this option was exercised in 309 of 1255 anovulatory cycles (24.6%). Couples were instructed to have regular intercourse two to three times a week, and the women kept an intercourse diary. Ovulation predictor kits were not used. Comparison/control After spontaneous menses or withdrawal bleeding induced by progestin administration (medroxyprogesterone acetate [Provera], 5 mg per day for 10 days), letrozole (2.5 mg daily) was administered, beginning on cycle day 3 for 5 days and for up to five menstrual cycles. The maximum daily dose of letrozole was 7.5 mg (three pills) given for 5 days. Investigators had the option to induce menstrual bleeding with medroxyprogesterone acetate after an anovulatory cycle; this option was exercised in 309 of 1255 anovulatory cycles (24.6%). Couples were instructed to have regular intercourse two to three times a week, and the women kept an intercourse diary. Ovulation predictor kits were not used. Outcomes Primary outcome: live birth; Secondary outcomes: ovulation, pregnancy loss, singleton birth, and congenital anomalies. Serious adverse events were defined as events that were fatal or immediately life threatening, that were severely or permanently disabling, or that required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; overdoses (intentional or accidental); congenital anomalies; pregnancy loss after 12 weeks of gestation; and any event deemed to be serious by the site principal investigator. Inclusion Criteria Yes Infertile women 18 to 40 years of age with the polycystic ovary syndrome who had no major medical disorders and who were not taking confounding medications (primarily sex steroids, other infertility drugs, and insulin sensitizers, as described in the study protocol), their male partners, and their neonates participated in the study.9 We used modified Rotterdam criteria1 to diagnose the polycystic ovary syndrome. Additional eligibility criteria were at least one patent fallopian tube and a normal uterine cavity, as determined by sonohysterography (on the basis of the presence of free fluid in the pelvis), hysterosalpingography, a combined Aromatase inhibitors 70 hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, or evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy within the previous 3 years; a male partner with a sperm concentration of at least 14 million per milliliter, according to World Health Organization cutoff points,11 with documented motility in at least one ejaculate during the previous year; and a commitment on the part of the women and their partners to have regular intercourse during the study with the intent of pregnancy.

Clomiphene citrate and metformin 1 5.4 EVIDENCE REVIEW Clinical questions: 1. In women with PCOS, is clomiphene citrate effective for improving fertility outcomes? 2. In women with PCOS, is metformin effective for improving fertility outcomes? 3. In women with PCOS and a BMI<3032, what is the effectiveness of metformin compared to clomiphene citrate for improving fertility outcomes? Contents Background ............................................................................................................................... ........................... Summary of evidence 3 Findings 8 Recommendations metformin receptor modulator with both oestrogenic and antioestrogenic properties (Shelly, Draper et al. 2008). It was first approved for use in women with anovulation in 1967 and has been used as a first line ovulation induction agent for over 40 years (Pritts 2010). Acting as an anti oestrogen, clomiphene citrate competitively inhibits the binding of estradiol to its receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary which in turn blocks the negative feedback effect of endogenous oestrogens including estradiol. This release of the hypothalamus from negative inhibition results in an increased secretion of pulsatile gonadotrophin releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus leading to an increase in FSH and luteinizing hormone production and secretion from in FSH estradiol production inducing hormone surge and ovulation (Adashi 1984). Clomiphene citrate is usually given for 5 days, commencing on menstrual cycle day 2 to 5, starting with 50mg/day and increasing to a maximum of 150 mg/day. If ovulation cannot be achieved with clomiphene citrate administration at maximum doses, clomiphene citrate resistance is defined. If pregnancy cannot be achieved after six ovulatory cycles with clomiphene citrate, then the patient is described as having clomiphene citrate failure (Palomba, Falbo et al. 2009). Studies with clomiphene citrate have shown an ovulation rate of 60-85% and a pregnancy rate of 30-50% after 6 ovulatory cycles. This apparent discrepancy between good ovulation rates and lower pregnancy rates has been attributed to the antioestrogenic effects of clomiphene citrate on the endometrium and cervical mucus. The rates of twin pregnancy and triplets with clomiphene citrate are 5-7% and 0.3%, respectively. The incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is less than 1% (Kafy and Tulandi 2007). A patient's lifetime exposure to clomiphene citrate without pregnancy is often limited to 12 treatment cycles, as additional cycles have been alleged (without adequate evidence) to be at increased risk of borderline ovarian tumours (Rossing, Daling et al. 1994). Metformin Hyperinsulinaemia with insulin resistance is a prominent feature of PCOS (Dunaif, Segal et al. 1989) affecting approximately 65 to 80% of women with PCOS (DeUgarte, Bartolucci et al. 2005). This results in increased ovarian androgen biosynthesis in vivo and in vitro and decreased SHBG synthesis from the liver, leading to increased bioavailability of free androgens. This excess in local ovarian androgen production augmented by hyperinsulinaemia causes premature follicular atresia and anovulation (Costello and Eden 2003). This contribution to anovulation in PCOS has led to the introduction of insulinsensitizing drugs in an attempt to restore ovulation and enhance pregnancy. Metformin has been the one studied most widely in PCOS and has the most reassuring safety profile (Palomba, Falbo et al. 2009). It is a biguanide which is used as an oral antihyperglycaemic agent in the treatment of DM2 (Elizur and Tuland 2008). The first published report on the use of metformin as a treatment for PCOS was in 1994 and early studies examining the reproductive system effects of metformin in women with PCOS showed promising results. Metformin is available in two formulations: immediate and extended release. Therapeutic regimens of metformin administration in PCOS are not well standardized in clinical practice, and various protocols have been used in the studies available in literature with an extremely variable target dose of 1500 to 2550 mg per day having been proposed (Hoeger, Davidson et al. 2008).

Mod 10 centres through out Europe and South America Per protocol CC = 123 concealed; unclear whether participants, investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention group; unclear if all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated; power calculations were not reported; lack of direct comparisons between the two groups; insufficient number of patients in the trials; unclear whether selective outcome reporting had occurred; and a lack of conflict of interest statements. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Generalisability Studies were conducted in university departments, outpatient clinics in hospitals and laboratories covering countries across Australia, Europe, South America, USA and Asia. Findings Due to the heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria and/or threshold/cut off values, metaanalyses (for pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates) have not been performed. Metformin versus placebo One systematic review (Morley 2017) with up to 14 studies; and one RCT (Kjotrod 2011) were identified to address this comparison. Metformin was better than placebo for live birth rate per participant, pregnancy rate per participant and ovulation rate per participant. Pregnancy rate and ovulation rate remained statistically significantly better than placebo when subgrouped by BMI (BMI<30kg/m2 and BMI>30 or 32kg/m2 subgroups); however live birth rate lost statistical significance when subgrouped by BMI. There was no statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo for miscarriage rate per pregnancy (including when subgrouped). Adverse events were statistically significantly lower with placebo than metformin (including when subgrouped). Multiple pregnancy and OHSS were not reported in the systematic review. It is important to note that the findings for live birth rate and miscarriage rate are of low certainty due to serious risk of bias and serious risk of imprecision in the body of evidence; and findings for pregnancy rate, ovulation rate and adverse events are of moderate certainty due to serious risk of bias. Risk of bias appraisals and GRADE assessments have been adopted from previous versions of this guideline (WHO 2014). In an RCT of 149 participants, with moderate certainty, there were no statistically significant differences between metformin and placebo for pregnancy rate per participant, multiple pregnancy rate per pregnancy or miscarriage rate per pregnancy. The majority of the trials stopped metformin at diagnosis of pregnancy or at week 12. Note: insufficient evidence of a differential effect of metformin on BMI.

Metformin plus CC was statistically significantly better than CC alone for pregnancy rate per participant and ovulation rate per participant, including when subgrouped by BMI (BMI<30kg/m2 and BMI>30 subgroups). Adverse events were statistically significantly better with CC alone than with metformin plus CC. There was no statistically significant difference between metformin plus CC and CC alone for live birth rate per pregnancy, multiple pregnancy rate per pregnancy or miscarriage rate per pregnancy. OHSS was not reported in the systematic review. It is important to note that the findings for live birth rate, multiple pregnancy and miscarriage rate are of low certainty due to serious risk of bias and serious risk of imprecision in the body of evidence; and findings for pregnancy rate, ovulation rate and adverse events are of moderate certainty due to serious risk of bias. The additional RCT Maged 2015 was insufficient evidence to supplement the findings of Morley 2017.

CC versus aromatase inhibitors (letrozole) Thirteen RCTs (level II) compared letrozole with CC. Seven of these RCTs had a high risk of bias (Atay, Cam et al. 2006, Zeinalzadeh, Basirat et al. 2010, SheikhElArab Elsedeek and Elmaghraby 2011, Banerjee Ray, Ray et al. 2012, Kar 2012, Nazik and Kumtepe 2012, Selim and Borg 2012), two had a moderate risk of bias (Begum, Ferdous et al. 2009, Dehbashi, Kazerooni et al. 2009) and four had a low risk of bias (Bayar, Kiran et al. 2006, Badawy, Abdel Aal et al. 2009, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014). Upon meta analysis, we found that letrozole was better than clomiphene citrate for ovulation rate per patient (Atay, Cam et al. 2006, Begum, Ferdous et al. 2009, Dehbashi, Kazerooni et al. 2009, SheikhElArab Elsedeek and Elmaghraby 2011, Banerjee Ray, Ray et al. 2012, Nazik and Kumtepe 2012, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014); pregnancy rate per patient (Atay, Cam et al. 2006, Bayar, Kiran et al. 2006, Badawy, Abdel Aal et al. 2009, Begum, Ferdous et al. 2009, Dehbashi, Kazerooni et al. et al. 2010, SheikhElArab Elsedeek and Elmaghraby 2011, Banerjee Ray, Ray et al. 2012, Kar 2012, Nazik and Kumtepe 2012, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Selim and Borg 2012, Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014); and per cycle (Nazik and Kumtepe 2012, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Selim and Borg 2012); and live birth rate per patient (Bayar, Kiran et al. 2006, Dehbashi, Kazerooni et al. 2009, Banerjee Ray, Ray et al. 2012, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014). There was no difference between letrozole and clomiphene citrate for ovulation rate per cycle (Bayar, Kiran et al. 2006, Badawy, Abdel Aal et al. 2009, Nazik and Kumtepe 2012, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Selim and Borg 2012); multiple pregnancy rate per patient (Atay, Cam et al. 2006, Badawy, Abdel Aal et al. 2009, Dehbashi, Kazerooni et al. 2009, Zeinalzadeh, Basirat et al. 2010, Kar 2012, Nazik and Kumtepe 2012, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014); and miscarriage rate per patient (Bayar, Kiran et al. 2006, Badawy, Abdel Aal et al. 2009, Begum, Ferdous et al. 2009, Dehbashi, Kazerooni et al. 2009, Banerjee Ray, Ray et al. 2012, Kar 2012, Nazik and Kumtepe 2012, Roy, Baruah et al. 2012, Legro, Brzyski et al. 2014). When subgroup analysis was conducted for studies that included women with PCOS who were Clomiphene citrate and metformin 15 therapy na\u00efve, there was no difference between the two interventions for any outcome though we note that for pregnancy rate per patient the OR 1.68 [95% CI 0.96, 2.94] had an I2 of 0% and a p of 0.07. Outcome RCTs* PCOS &** Effect low risk of bias, high quality; M, moderate risk of bias, medium quality; H, high risk of bias, low quality. **Includes women with PCOS and one or more of: TN, na\u00efve; ratio CC versus gonadotrophin (FSH) Two RCTs were identified by the search to address this comparison. One RCT was low quality with high risk of bias (Lopez 2004) compared recombinant FSH with CC in women with PCOS who were therapy na\u00efve and found that there was no difference between the two interventions for all fertility outcomes. The second was a multicentre RCT with moderate risk of bias (Homburg 2012) comparing CC with low dose gonadotrophins, as the first line therapy for ovulation induction in anovulatory women with PCOS who were therapy na\u00efve. They reported with per protocol analysis that the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the gonadotrophin treated group. Furthermore the chance of pregnancy was almost double in the first treatment cycle when compared to clomiphene citrate. Brown 2016 metaanalysed these same two RCTs combining data for live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate and found that gonadotrophins were better than clomiphene ] p=0.041, I2=0%). Metaanalysis of the two studies for clinical pregnancy rate found that clomiphene citrate was better than gonadotrophins (OR 0.61 [0.40, 0.93] p=0.021, I2=0%). It is important to be cautious of these results (using per protocol event rates), as the number of participants randomised has been used as the denominator when the denominator should have been the number of participants per protocol.

Conditional Women with PCOS should be counselled about the potential side effects prior to treatment with metformin. Strong Clomiphene citrate could be used alone to improve ovulation and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS, who are anovulatory and are infertile with no other infertility factors. Conditional When deciding on metformin or clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction for women who are obese (BMI is 30kg) with anovulatory infertility, with no other infertility factors, clomiphene citrate could be used. Conditional If considering using metformin to treat women who are anovulatory, have a body mass index 30kg/m2, and are infertile with no other infertility factors, clomiphene citrate could be added to improve fertility outcomes. Conditional Metformin could be combined with clomiphene citrate to improve fertility outcomes rather than persisting with further treatment with clomiphene citrate alone in women who are clomiphene citrate resistant, anovulatory and infertile with no other infertility factors . Conditional CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS The risk of multiple pregnancy is increased with clomiphene citrate use and therefore monitoring must (6)/may (7) be considered. (going with may) Prolonged (>12 treatment cycles) unsuccessful use of ovulation induction agents should be avoided.

Intervention/indicator Lowdose recombinant FSH for up to three cycles. \"Treatment with recombinant FSH (GonalF; Serono S.A.) was commenced on day 3 following spontaneous or induced menses. The chronic lowdose, stepup regimen consisted of a starting dose of75 IU daily s.c., with dose increments of 37.5 IU daily every 7 days if there was no evidence of ovarian response by ultrasonography (i.e. no follicle >I0 mm in diameter). This stepwise increase was continued until ovarian activity was seen, at which time the dose was maintained. In successive treatment cvcles, the starting dose of FSH could be modified, based on the ovarian response in the previous cycle. Criteria for HCG injection (5000 1U i.m.) were the same as for clomiphene citrate treatment cycles. A treatment cycle was cancelled if there was no follicle growth after 21 days of gonadotrophin administration. The injection of HCG was withheld if four or more follicles >I4 mm in diameter were present, because of the increased risks of OHSS and multiple pregnancy.\" \"Couples were advised to have sexual intercourse the evening of the HCG injection and the following day.\" \"Women not conceiving after three cycles of treatment crossed over to the alternative treatment for a further three cycles, with an interval of at least 45 days between treatments.\" - wasn't required and only first arm data presented here. Comparison/control Clomiphene citrate for up to three cycles. It was \"given at a daily dose of 50 mg for 5 days, starting on day 5 following spontaneous or induced uterine bleeding. If ovulation was documented but no pregnancy ensued, the same dose was used in the next cycle. However, if no ovulatory response occurred, the daily dose was increased by 50 mg for the subsequent cycle, up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg in the third treatment cycle. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG,Profasi; Serono S.A., Madrid, Spain), at a 5000 IU i.m., was Clomiphene citrate and metformin 65 administered when the lead follicle was >I7 mm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasonography. The cycle was cancelled if no growing follicle was seen by day 1820.\" \"Couples were advised to have sexual intercourse the evening of the HCG injection and the following day.\" \"Women not conceiving after three cycles of treatment crossed over to the alternative treatment for a further three cycles, with an interval of at least 45 days between treatments.\" - wasn't required and only first arm data presented here. Outcomes \"The primary outcome measure was cumulative pregnancy after undergoing up to three treatment cycles. Secondary outcomes were cycle cancellation rate, ovulation rate per cycle, cumulative ovulation rate, pregnancy rate per cycle, incidence of OHSS, cumulative live birth rate, and multiple birth rate.\" Inclusion Criteria \"A history of amenorrhoea (no menstrual periods for three or more months) or oligomenorrhoea (fewer than nine menstrual periods in a year), monophasic basal body temperature charting, proliferative endometrium on biopsy, or serum progesterone concentrations <I ng/ml were accepted as demonstration of anovulation. In addition, subjects were required to have the ultrasonographic appearance of polycystic ovaries (Adams et al., 1986), a positive response to the progestin challenge test (normal withdrawal bleeding after treatment with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, 10 mg daily for 5 days), normal serum prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, and fasting glucose concentrations, a normal hysterosalpingogram (and laparoscopy when appropriate), and no history of pelvic surgery or pelvic inflammatory disease. When the study was started the criteria for PCOS that were used were as described and these are also in keeping with the ESHREIASRM guidelines for PCOS (Rotterdam ESHREIASRM sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group, 2003). Obesity was not an inclusion or exclusion criterion.

EXTERNAL VALIDITY - IS THIS STUDY AND ITS RESULTS GENERALIZABLE TO MY SYSTEMATIC REVIEW QUESTION? Patient/population/ participants Infertile women 18 to 40 years of age with PCOS Age (yr): 85; letrozole: 73 750 analysed ITT Setting Academic Health Centers throughout the United States Intervention/indicator After spontaneous menses or withdrawal bleeding induced by progestin administration (medroxyprogesterone acetate [Provera], 5 mg per day for 10 days), clomiphene citrate (50 mg daily) was administered, beginning on cycle day 3 for 5 days and for up to five menstrual cycles. The dose was increased in subsequent cycles in cases of nonresponse (progesterone level during the midluteal phase, <3 ng per milliliter) or a poor ovulatory response (progesterone levels indicative of ovulation but with values clustering just above the cutoff point [see the Supplementary Appendix]), noted in 2% of 2777 treatment cycles. The maximum daily dose of clomiphene was 150 mg (three pills) given for 5 days. Investigators had the option to induce menstrual bleeding with medroxyprogesterone acetate after an anovulatory cycle; this option was exercised in 309 of 1255 anovulatory cycles (24.6%). Couples were instructed to have regular intercourse two to three times a week, and the women kept an intercourse diary. Ovulation predictor kits were not used. Comparison/control After spontaneous menses or withdrawal bleeding induced by progestin administration (medroxyprogesterone acetate [Provera], 5 mg per day for 10 days), letrozole (2.5 mg daily) was administered, beginning on cycle day 3 for 5 days and for up to five menstrual cycles. The maximum daily dose of letrozole was 7.5 mg (three pills) given for 5 days. Investigators had the option to induce menstrual bleeding with medroxyprogesterone acetate after an anovulatory cycle; this option was exercised in 309 of 1255 anovulatory cycles (24.6%). Couples were instructed to have regular intercourse two to three times a week, and the women kept an intercourse diary. Ovulation predictor kits were not used. Outcomes Primary outcome: live birth; Secondary outcomes: ovulation, pregnancy loss, singleton birth, and congenital anomalies. Serious adverse events were defined as events that were fatal or immediately lifethreatening, that were severely or permanently disabling, or that required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; overdoses (intentional or accidental); congenital anomalies; pregnancy loss after 12 weeks of gestation; and any event deemed to be serious by the site principal investigator. Inclusion Criteria Yes Infertile women 18 to 40 years of age with the polycystic ovary syndrome who had no major medical disorders and who were not taking confounding medications (primarily sex steroids, other infertility drugs, and insulin sensitizers, as described in the study protocol), their male Metformin and CC evidence review 106 partners, and their neonates participated in the study.9 We used modified Rotterdam criteria1 to diagnose the polycystic ovary syndrome. Additional eligibility criteria were at least one patent fallopian tube and a normal uterine cavity, as determined by sonohysterography (on the basis of the presence of free fluid in the pelvis), hysterosalpingography, a combined hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, or evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy within the previous 3 years; a male partner with a sperm concentration of at least 14 million per milliliter, according to World Health Organization cutoff points,11 with documented motility in at least one ejaculate during the previous year; and a commitment on the part of the women and their partners to have regular intercourse during the study with the intent of pregnancy.

Yes INTERNAL VALIDITY - HAS THIS STUDY BEEN CONDUCTED RIGOROUSLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE BIAS? SELECTION BIAS Did the study have an adequate method of randomisation? Yes Women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio in permuted blocks of two, four or six. Stratified randomization with permuted blocking within each stratum was generated by the data coordination centre (DCC) statistician. The only stratification variable will be by site. Was allocation to intervention group concealed? Yes Once patient consent is received, the patient is entered into secure online system where the patient is randomised and the site is provided with a patient identifier and a study kit number. According to allocated kit number, the site coordinator dispenses the intervention. PERFORMANCE BIAS Were patients blind to intervention group? Yes The purchased study drugs were overencapsulated to look the same, tested, and packaged by a commercial supply company (Almac Clinical Services).

Gonadotrophins 1 5.5 EVIDENCE REVIEW Clinical question: In women with PCOS, are gonadotrophins effective for improving fertility outcomes? Contents Background ............................................................................................................................... ........................... 2 Summary of evidence 2 Findings 6 Recommendations included studies .............................................................................................. 23 Gonadotrophins 2 Background Gonadotropin therapy is indicated for women with anovulatory PCOS who have been treated with anti estrogens (CC) if they have failed to ovulate or if they have a response to CC that is likely to reduce their chance of conception (e.g., persistent hypersecretion of LH, or an antiestrogenic effect on the endometrium). In order to prevent overstimulation and multiple pregnancy, the traditional standard stepup regimens, when 75- 150i.u. were increased by 75i.u. every 3-5 days (Lunenfeld and Insler 1974) have been replaced by either low dose stepup regimens (Hamilton Fairley, Kiddy et al. 1991, White, al. 1996) or stepdown regimens (van Santbrink, Donderwinkel et al. 1995). The lowdose stepup regimen employs a starting dose of 5075 i.u., which is only increased after 14 days if there is no response and then by only 2537.5 i.u. every 7 days. Treatment cycles using this approach can be quite long - up to 28-35 days - but the risk of multiple follicular growth is lower than with conventional stepup regimens. With the stepdown protocol, follicular recruitment is achieved using 150 i.u. daily for 3 or 4 days before decreasing the dose to 50-75i.u. to maintain follicular development. In all the abovementioned ovulation induction regimens, gonadotropins are used alone, without a background of pituitary desensitization, which does not confer any advantage. Furthermore, different gonadotropin preparations appear to work equally well (Nugent, Vandekerckhove et al. 2000). It can be extremely difcult to predict the response to stimulation of a woman with polycystic ovaries and achieve the development of a single dominant follicle in order to reduce the risks of multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Treatment with gonadotropins should be commenced within the rst 5 days of a natural or induced menstrual bleed, when a pelvic USS indicates that the endometrium is thin (less than 5mm in depth) and that there are no ovarian cysts. It is essential to carefully monitor follicular development by USS. Ovulation is usually triggered with a single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 5000 units (i.m. or s.c.), when at least one follicle of at least 17 mm in its largest diameter has developed. To reduce the risks of multiple pregnancy and OHSS, hCG should not be administered if a total of three or more follicles larger than 14 mm in diameter have developed. In overstimulated cycles hCG is withheld, the patient counseled about the risks and advised to refrain from sexual intercourse. If conception has failed to occur after six ovulatory cycles in a woman younger than 25 years or after 12 ovulatory cycles in women older than 25, then it can be assumed that anovulation is unlikely to be the cause of the couple's infertility. The couple should have been comprehensively investigated by this stage with a laparoscopy \u00b1 hysteroscopy or hysterosalpingography and sperm function tests. If no other explanation has been found for their infertility assisted conception (usually IVF) is now indicated. Summary of evidence Included studies Two systematic reviews (Brown 2016, Abu Hashim 2015) were identified in the updated search which met the inclusion criteria for this evidence review (Brown 2016 is an update of a review included in the original PCOS guidelines), whilst one systematic review was previously identified in the WHO search. In instances where an individual study reported additional outcomes to those reported in these systematic reviews, this outcome data has also been reported here in this evidence review (provided it was specified as a prioritised outcome for GDG 5). An additional randomized controlled trial (Ghanem 2013) was also identified in the updated search.

The chronic lowdose, stepup regimen consisted of a starting dose of75 IU daily s.c., with dose increments of 37.5 IU daily every 7 days if there was no evidence of ovarian response by ultrasonography (i.e. no follicle >I0 mm in diameter). This stepwise increase was continued until ovarian activity was seen, at which time the dose was maintained. In successive treatment cvcles, the starting dose of FSH could be modified, based on the ovarian response in the previous cycle. Criteria for HCG injection* (5000 1U i.m.) were the same as for clomiphene citrate treatment cycles. A treatment cycle was cancelled if there was no follicle growth after 21 days of gonadotrophin administration.

If ovulation was documented but no pregnancy ensued, the same dose was used in the next cycle. However, if no ovulatory response occurred, the daily dose was increased by 50 mg for the subsequent cycle, up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg in the third treatment cycle. hCG at a dose of 5000 IU i.m., was administered when the lead follicle was >I7 mm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasonography*. The cycle was cancelled if no growing follicle was seen by day 1820. * Couples were advised to have sexual intercourse the evening of the HCG injection and the following day human FSH (Puregon, Netherlands) was given s.c. in a lowdose protocol starting with 50 IU on cycle day 4, with weekly increments of 25 IU as necessary to induce a follicular response (Leader, 2006).'

Studies of moderate risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. The most common reasons for the ratings assigned include: unclear whether adequate randomization had been performed; unclear whether allocation to the intervention group was concealed; unclear whether participants, investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention group; unclear if all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated; power calculations were not reported; direct comparisons between groups were not reported; it was not clear whether selective outcome reporting had occurred; some of the metaanalyses had few participants and some did not have a consistent direction. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Generalisability Studies were conducted in university departments, outpatient clinics in hospitals and laboratories in Egypt, Bangladesh, centres throughout Europe and South America (countries not specified), Spain, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy, Iran, Ukraine. Findings Gonadotrophin (FSH) versus CC Two RCTs were identified by the search to address this comparison. One RCT was low quality with high risk of bias (Lopez 2004) compared recombinant FSH with CC in women with PCOS who were therapy na\u00efve and found that there was no difference between the two interventions for all fertility outcomes. The second was a multicentre RCT with moderate risk of bias (Homburg 2012) comparing CC with low dose gonadotrophins, as the first line therapy for ovulation induction in anovulatory women with PCOS who were therapy na\u00efve. They reported with per protocol analysis that the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the gonadotrophin treated group. Furthermore the chance of pregnancy was almost double in the first treatment cycle when compared to clomiphene citrate. Brown (2016) metaanalysed these same two RCTs combining data for live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate and found that gonadotrophins were better than clomiphene ] p=0.041, I2=0%). Metaanalysis of the two studies for clinical pregnancy rate found that clomiphene citrate was better than gonadotrophins (OR 0.61 [0.40, 0.93] p=0.021, I2=0%). It is important to be cautious of these results (using per protocol event rates), as the number of participants randomised has been used as the denominator when the denominator should have been the number of participants per protocol.

Gonadotrophins versus CC + metformin Two RCTs compared (Abu 2011 and Begum 2013). The RCTs found that FSH was better than CC plus metformin for ovulation rate per participant and pregnancy rate per participant. There was no statistical difference between the two interventions for live birth rate per participant, multiple pregnancy rate per pregnancy, OHSS, miscarriage rate per pregnancy or GI side effects or adverse events. A systematic review by Abu Hashim (2015) conducted metaanalysis including studies that do not meet our PICO, however some sensitivity analysis was conducted with the two RCTs listed below. A sensitivity analysis for ovulation rate in 263 patients demonstrated that gonadotrophins are better for ovulation rate (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.07-0.25; p < 0.00001, I2 = 7%); but there was no statistically significant difference between the two interventions for multiple pregnancy rate (n = 263, OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.06-1.68; p = 0.18, heterogeneity not reported).

Gonadotrophins 11 Recommendations EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATION(S) Evidencebased recommendation: Gonadotropins could be second line pharmacological therapy in women with PCOS who have failed first line oral ovulation induction therapy, are anovulatory and infertile, with no other infertility factors. Quality of Evidence: Moderate Strength of Recommendation: Strong Evidencebased recommendation: In women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with no other infertility factors, the use of gonadotropins as first line treatment, in the presence of ultrasound monitoring, could be considered following counselling regarding the cost and the potential risk of multiple pregnancy. Quality of Evidence: Strong Strength of Recommendation: Strong Evidencebased recommendation: In women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrateresistance, no other infertility factors, gonadotropins should be used rather than CC plus metformin for ovulation induction to improve live birth, pregnancy and ovulation rates. Quality of Evidence: Strong Strength of Recommendation: Strong Evidencebased recommendation: In women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrateresistance, with no other infertility factors, gonadotropins plus metformin could be used rather than gonadotrophins alone to improve live birth, ovulation and pregnancy rates. Quality of Evidence: Strong Strength of Recommendation: Strong Evidencebased recommendation: In women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrateresistance with no other infertility factors, either gonadotropins or LOS could be used, following counselling regarding the benefits and risks of each therapy. Quality of Evidence: Strong Strength of Recommendation: Strong CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT Where gonadotropins are to be prescribed, the following should be considered: Cost of the intervention for ovulation induction. Expertise required for the use of the intervention for ovulation induction. The degree of intensive ultrasound monitoring that is required. A low dose gonadotrophin protocol should be used to optimize the chance of monofollicular development. Implications of potential multiple pregnancy. Gonadotrophins 12 There is no difference in the clinical efficacy of the available gonadotrophin preparations. When using gonadotrophins, ovulation should only be triggered when there is no more than a total of two follicles greater than 14mm in diameter. In the presence of more than two follicles, greater than 14mm in diameter, the cycle should be cancelled and the patient advised to avoid unprotected intercourse.

Median age (years), FSH = 30 (2239) CC= 29 (2338) Body mass index (kg/m2), FSH = 21.9 \u00b1 1.9 CC= 22.3 \u00b1 1.9 N Assessed for eligibility = 76 patients Randomised total = 76 patients Randomised to FSH = 38 patients; all received allocated intervention; 1 patient refused to be treated for cycles 2 and 3; analysed 38 patients (ITT), 91 cycles Randomised to CC = 38; all received allocated intervention; analysed 38 patients, 104 cycles Setting Infertility clinic at the Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca in Murcia in Spain over the period April 2000 to December 2001. Intervention/indicator Lowdose recombinant FSH for up to three cycles. \"Treatment with recombinant FSH (GonalF; Serono S.A.) was commenced on day 3 following spontaneous or induced menses. The chronic lowdose, stepup regimen consisted of a starting dose of75 IU daily s.c., with dose increments of 37.5 IU daily every 7 days if there was no evidence of ovarian response by ultrasonography (i.e. no follicle >I0 mm in diameter). This stepwise increase was continued until ovarian activity was seen, at which time the dose was maintained. In successive treatment cvcles, the starting dose of FSH could be modified, based on the ovarian response in the previous cycle. Criteria for HCG injection (5000 1U i.m.) were the same as for clomiphene citrate treatment cycles. A treatment cycle was cancelled if there was no follicle growth after 21 days of gonadotrophin administration. The injection of HCG was withheld if four or more follicles >I4 mm in diameter were present, because of the increased risks of OHSS and multiple pregnancy.\" \"Couples were advised to have sexual intercourse the evening of the HCG injection and the following day.\" \"Women not conceiving after three cycles of treatment crossed over to the alternative treatment for a further three cycles, with an interval of at least 45 days between treatments.\" - wasn't required and only first arm data presented here. Comparison/control Clomiphene citrate for up to three cycles. It was \"given at a daily dose of 50 mg for 5 days, starting on day 5 following spontaneous or induced uterine bleeding. If ovulation was documented but no pregnancy ensued, the same dose was used in the next cycle. However, if no ovulatory response occurred, the daily dose was increased by 50 mg for the subsequent cycle, up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg in the third treatment cycle. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG,Profasi; Serono S.A., Madrid, Spain), at a dose of 5000 IU i.m., was administered when the lead follicle was >I7 mm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasonography. The cycle was cancelled if no growing follicle was seen by day 1820.\" Gonadotrophins 38 \"Couples were advised to have sexual intercourse the evening of the HCG injection and the following day.\" \"Women not conceiving after three cycles of treatment crossed over to the alternative treatment for a further three cycles, with an interval of at least 45 days between treatments.\" - wasn't required and only first arm data presented here. Outcomes \"The primary outcome measure was cumulative pregnancy after undergoing up to three treatment cycles. Secondary outcomes were cycle cancellation rate, ovulation rate per cycle, cumulative ovulation rate, pregnancy rate per cycle, incidence of OHSS, cumulative live birth rate, and multiple birth rate.\" Inclusion Criteria \"A history of amenorrhoea (no menstrual periods for three or more months) or oligomenorrhoea (fewer than nine menstrual periods in a year), monophasic basal body temperature charting, proliferative endometrium on biopsy, or serum progesterone concentrations <I ng/ml were accepted as demonstration of anovulation. In addition, subjects were required to have the ultrasonographic appearance of polycystic ovaries (Adams et al., 1986), a positive response to the progestin challenge test (normal withdrawal bleeding after treatment with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, 10 mg daily for 5 days), normal serum prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, and fasting glucose concentrations, a normal hysterosalpingogram (and laparoscopy when appropriate), and no history of pelvic surgery or pelvic inflammatory disease. When the study was started the criteria for PCOS that were used were as described and these are also in keeping with the ESHREIASRM guidelines for PCOS (Rotterdam ESHREIASRM sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group, 2003). Obesity was not an inclusion or exclusion criterion. The male partner had to have normal semen parameters according to World Health Organization criteria (Rowe et al., 2000).\" Exclusion Criteria \"Women with a previous pregnancy or previous treatment with ovarian stimulation drugs were excluded.\" Study Validity Is it clear that there are no conflicts of interest in the writing or funding of this study?

Clinical question: In women with PCOS, are antiobesity pharmacological agents effective for improving fertility outcomes? Clinical practice gap: Need for guidance Weight loss is considered to improve fertility outcomes in women with PCOS.1,2 The recommendation to reduce weight prior to fertility treatment in women with PCOS is based on observational data on weight loss and improved pregnancy outcomes. Nonpharmacological interventions based on diet and lifestyle have not shown significantly improved fertility outcomes in women with PCOS.3 There is a need to assess that other weight loss methods, such those based on pharmacological agents like orlistat, sibutramine, phenteramine commenced in the preconception period improves fertility outcomes in women with PCOS. Summary of key information The search undertaken by the GDG has identified only one randomised trial, that evaluated pre conception treatment in women with PCOS with a) lifestyle weight loss intervention incorporating caloric restriction, increased physical activity and pharmacological agent (initially sibutramine, and then orlistat), b) oral contraceptive pill c) combined lifestyle and contraceptive pill on fertility outcomes.4 The trial randomised 149 women, and was prematurely stopped by the DMC due to supposed futility due to the low likelihood of showing a clinically meaningful difference. Given the small sample size, particularly for a threearm trial, no meaningful robust conclusions can be inferred. Furthermore, all three are interventional arms, and there is no appropriate control that is reflective of real life practice. Within the lifestyle arm that included our agents of interest, there was a significant reduction in weight from baseline (6.2Kg, 95% CI 07.1 to 5.3), increase in insulin sensitivity (1.25, 95% 1.09 to 1.53). For fertility outcomes, compared to the women on OCP pre conception, those on lifestyle with agents showed no differences in any pregnancy outcomes. Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION Pharmacological antiobesity agents, for the purpose of improving fertility in women with PCOS, should be considered an experimental therapy. The risk/benefit ratio is too uncertain at the moment to advocate this as a fertility treatment. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Adequately powered, well designed, conducted and reported RCTs are required to determine whether anti obesity pharmacological agents are effective for improving fertility outcomes in overweight (BMI is 25 29.9kg/m2) or obese (BMI is 30kg/m2) women with PCOS who have anovulatory infertility, with no other infertility factors.

Contents Background ............................................................................................................................... ........................... 2 Summary of evidence 2 Findings 6 Recommendations Appraisal tables of included studies .............................................................................................. 22 Ovarian surgery evidence review 2 Background In 1935 Stein and Leventhal were the first to describe an association between the presence of polycystic ovaries, oligo/anovulation and hirsutism, later known as PCOS (Stein and Leventhal 1935). The observation that women with PCOS resumed regular ovulations following ovarian biopsies led to the belief that the condition was primarily ovarian in origin. This also resulted in the development of a surgical treatment for the condition involving a wedge resection of both ovaries via laparotomy (Stein 1964). A 1525 year follow up of nearly 150 women after ovarian wedge resection shows that regular menstrual patterns lasting up to 25 years after surgery were restored in 88% of patients with a cumulative pregnancy/live birth rate of 78% (Lunde, Djoseland et al. 2001). No alternative treatment was available until the arrival of hormonal preparations such as clomiphene citrate and gonadotrophins. Ovarian wedge resection was then soon abandoned because of the relative cost of the surgical treatment and the risk of postoperative adhesions. It was not until the introduction of minimally invasive techniques that surgical approaches were revisited. The laparoscopic ovarian drilling procedure was first described by Gj\u00f8n\u00e6ss in 1984 (Gj\u00f8nn\u00e6ss 1984). Minor variations of the technique have been reported (electrocautery, laser vaporization, multiple ovarian biopsies and others) but all are characterised by an altered endocrine profile following surgery. It remains poorly understood, however, which mechanisms bring about the hormonal changes and the resumption of ovulation. The main reason laparoscopic ovarian surgery has found support for the treatment of women with CCR PCOS is the fact that the endoscopic approach is thought 1) to cause fewer adhesions, 2) to be more costeffective as an outpatient procedure and 3) to restore regular monoovulations, albeit for a limited time in the majority of cases. In contrast, ovulation induction with gonadotrophins is expensive, requires regular monitoring and often results in the development of multiple mature follicles with a potential risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. It is important to establish the effectiveness of laparoscopic ovarian surgery, particularly in comparison to other treatments, in infertile women with PCOS in light of the potential risks. This review focuses on the clinical effectiveness of laparoscopic ovarian surgery compared to nonsurgical treatments for PCOS. For the purpose of this review, laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD), sometimes also referred to as laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, is a keyhole surgical procedure in which a diathermy instrument (usually a monopolar needle) is used to puncture the ovarian cortex followed by the delivery an electrical current to the ovarian stroma. Summary of evidence Included studies A systematic review (level I study) was identified in the WHO search, along with one randomized controlled trial (Abd Elgafor 2013) (level II study). Outcome data which were not reported in the systematic review were obtained from the original studies. Included studies from the systematic review which were included in the WHO evidence review were: Bayram 2004, Farquar 2002, Kaya Hashim 2011, Abu Hashim 2010, Palomba 2004, Hamed 2010, Amer 2009, and Palomba 2010. One further randomized controlled trial (Ibrahim 2017) was identified in the guidelines updated search.

Treatment was repeated for up to six cycles if the patient failed to ovulate Moderate Egypt Rott NR 1: 40 2: of bias Risk of bias for the included studies were rated as low to moderate. Studies of moderate risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. The most common reasons for the ratings assigned include: unclear whether allocation to the intervention group was concealed; unclear whether outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention group; unclear if all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated; power calculations were not reported; no direct comparisons between groups; unclear whether selective outcome reporting had occurred; and not enough participants. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Generalisability Studies were conducted in university departments and fertility clinics in Egypt, Italy, UK, Iran, Ukraine, Turkey, Yugoslavia, New Zealand, and Holland. Findings Laparoscopic ovarian surgery versus metformin Two medium quality RCTs (level II) with a moderate risk of bias compared laparoscopic ovarian surgery to metformin and found that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about laparoscopic ovarian surgery compared to metformin for live birth rate per patient, ovulation rate per cycle, pregnancy rate per cycle, pregnancy rate per patient , multiple pregnancies, miscarriage rate per pregnancy, adverse effects and QoL (Hamed 2010, Palomba 2004 & 2005), largely because the evidence was conflicting. One RCT reported that laparoscopic ovarian surgery was better than metformin for ovulation (OR 2.05; [1.4-2.9] Ovarian surgery evidence review 7 p=0.001) and pregnancy rate (per cycle: and the other study reported that metformin was better than laparoscopic ovarian surgery for live birth rate (metformin: 82.1%, (Palomba 2004 & 2005). Both medium quality single centre studies had a small sample size and moderate risk of bias and therefore need to be interpreted with caution.

Metaanalyses found that clomiphene citrate plus metformin (CC+M) was better than laparoscopic ovarian surgery for live birth rate, but there was no difference for pregnancy rate per patient, multiple pregnancy rate, or miscarriage rate per pregnancy (Farquhar 2012).

Laparoscopic ovarian surgery versus aromatase inhibitors Three RCTs with low risk of bias (Abu Hashim 2010, Abdellah 2011 and Ibrahim 2017) compared letrozole to laparoscopic ovarian surgery and found that there was insufficient evidence of a difference between letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian surgery. One of the RCTs in 147 women with clomiphene citrate resistance found that letrozole was better than laparoscopic ovarian surgery for ovulation rate per cycle, however the evidence is of low certainty. The systematic review by Farquhar 2012 combined these studies in metaanalysis for pregnancy rate per patient, multiple pregnancy rate per pregnancy and miscarriage rate per pregnancy and there was no statistical difference between the two interventions.

Recommendations EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATION Laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be second line therapy for women with polycystic ovary syndrome who are clomiphene citrate resistant, anovulatory, and infertile, with no other infertility factors. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT If undergoing laparoscopic ovarian surgery, the patient should be advised of the risks (see below). CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION Laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be used as first line treatment if laparoscopy is indicated for another reason for infertile and anovulatory women with PCOS with no other infertility factors. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT Where laparoscopic ovarian surgery are to be prescribed, the following should be considered: Cost of either intervention for ovulation induction Expertise required for the use of either intervention for ovulation induction Laparoscopic ovarian surgery in women who are overweight or obese are associated with both intraoperative and postoperative risks Laparoscopic ovarian surgery may be associated with a small risk of ovarian reserve or loss of ovarian function Laparoscopic ovarian surgery may be associated with periadnexal adhesion formation. Research recs Further research is required to understand how LOS restores ovulatory function. Further adequately powered, well designed, conducted and reported RCTs are required to compare LOS with other ovulation induction agents in women with PCOS. Further research is required in identifying profiles of women with PCOS who may respond to LOS. Further research is required to determine the minimal effective intervention of LOS (i.e. how many drillings, at which energy level and modality and unilateral or bilateral). Ovarian surgery evidence review 13 GRADE framework Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework In women with PCOS, is ovarian surgery effective for improving fertility outcomes?

Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice point If undergoing laparoscopic ovarian surgery, the patient should be advised of the risks (see below). Where laparoscopic ovarian surgery are to be pr escribed, the following should be considered: Cost of either intervention for ovulation induction Expertise required for the use of either intervention for ovulation induction Laparoscopic ovarian surgery in women who are overweight or obese are associated with both intra-operative and post-operative risks Laparoscopic ovarian surgery may be associated with a sma ll risk of ovarian reserve or loss of ovarian function Laparoscopic ovarian surgery may be associated with periadnexal adhesion formation. Subgroup considerations This may be even more indicated for patients who require endoscopic surgery for other treatable pelvic pathology. Implementation considerations Adequate surgical skill training of surgeons and faciliti es. Access to satisfactory first line ovulation induction treatments prior to LOS. Monitoring and evaluation Longer term effects of ovarian drilling on onset of menopause may need to be monitored. Research priorities More RCTs with reduced bias are needed. Ovarian surgery evidence review 18 More studies examining the \"minimal effective dose\" of LOD: how many drillings, at which energy and for how long? Confirmation is needed that unilateral LOD is as effective as bilateral LOD. We need evidence to show that repeat procedures are effective when the initial response wears off.

Prevalence and Problem Obesity is increasing in prevalence throughout the world, with higher rates generally seen with higher levels of economic development. In some areas of the world, though obesity rates have plateaued, rates of more severe obesity, i.e. morbid obesity (BMI 40 kg/m2), especially in females, continue to grow.(Sturm and Hattori 2013) PCOS may be more common in countries with higher obesity rates (up to 80% of women in the U.S. with PCOS may have obesity)(Sam 2007) and though the association of obesity and PCOS is debated,(Yildiz, Knochenhauer et al. 2008) there is evidence of increasing rates of PCOS with increasing obesity.(Alvarez Blasco, BotellaCarretero et al. 2006) Women with PCOS may also experience greater weight gain over time than other women.(Teede, Joham et al. 2013) Clinical Practice Gap: Need for Guidance Obesity has been shown to be adversely associated with female fertility. Weight loss is generally thought to improve reproductive outcomes in overweight or obese women,(Clark, Thornley et al. 1998) though delaying pregnancy for the purpose of weight loss may over time lead to lower pregnancy rates in women with obesity.(Mutsaerts, van Oers et al. 2016) However in women with PCOS, it may increase the safety and effectiveness of ovulation induction,(Legro, Dodson et al. 2015) and lead to higher pregnancy rates than immediate infertility treatment.(Legro, Dodson et al. 2016) Most studies suggest even modest weight loss improves spontaneous pregnancy rates in women with PCOS(Kiddy, Hamilton Fairley et al. 1992) and this has also been observed following bariatric surgery. One recent review reported conception rates ranging from 33100% after bariatric surgery.(Butterworth, Deguara et al. 2016). Moreover surgical studies examining fertility outcomes are generally poorly designed (Shah and Ginsburg 2010), and both types of studies fail to report the key perinatal outcomes in mother and infant necessary to judge the risk benefit ratio of the surgery. High quality randomized trials of bariatric surgery versus medical management of type 2 diabetes have documented the superiority of weight loss and bariatric surgery in curing or ameliorating diabetes,(Mingrone, Panunzi et al. 2012) that persist over long periods of time.(Schauer, Bhatt et al. 2017) Weight loss or preventing weight gain using established lifestyle interventions is a common sense recommendation for all reproductive aged women with PCOS, if not for optimizing reproductive health, than for improving long term health outcomes in women with PCOS, such as the prevention of type 2 diabetes.(Knowler, BarrettConnor et al. 2002) More intensive lifestyle interventions or weight loss medications may be indicated for women with PCOS depending on the degree of obesity. Multiple guidelines for the treatment of PCOS including The 2009 American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' and the 2013 Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines recommend bariatric surgery as a treatment option for obese women with PCOS (American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology 2009, Legro, Arslanian et al. 2013). Current controversies relevant to PCOS include whether PCOS should be considered an obesity related condition as BMI cutoffs for bariatric surgery may be reduced in this circumstance (e.g. poorly controlled DM2 with BMI 30kg/m2) (Rubino, Kaplan et al. 2010), however evidence is insufficient to recommend bariatric surgery with a BMI 35kg/m2 (Mechanick 2009). The most recent U.K. clinical guidelines for obesity management in the general population (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2010) recommended consideration of bariatric surgery in patients with a 2 BMI 35kg/m2 with presence of one or more severe complications, which are expected to improve with weight reduction. Completion of a structured lifestyle intervention, not resulting in significant and sustained weight loss is also required (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2010). Obesity surgery can be considered after nonsurgical treatment has been attempted unsuccessfully for at least 6 months in adults with a BMI 40kg/m2 and that obesity surgery can be first line treatment instead of lifestyle interventions or drug treatment in adults with BMI 50kg/m2 (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2006). Other guidelines, for example the 2013 U.S. Obesity guidelines offer a quicker course to obesity surgery with a BMI > 35 and comorbidities or anyone reaching a BMI > 40. (Jensen, Ryan et al. 2013) There are emerging data that delaying surgery until the upper limits of obesity are reached (e.g. BMI 50) mean that these patients are extremely unlikely to ever even approach overweight status (< 10% of such patients) with bariatric surgery.(Varban, Cassidy et al. 2017) The best type of bariatric surgery for women with PCOS is unknown. Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) has overtaken the RouxenY Gastric Bypass (RYGB) as the most commonly performed bariatric surgery due to its lower operative morbidity, though cumulative weight loss is somewhat less. (Lager, Esfandiari et al. 2017) Currently gastric banding, once the choice for women planning pregnancy as the band could be adjusted during pregnancy, has fallen out of favour because of complications related to the presence of the band and the overall lower weight loss achieved compared to VSG and RYGB.(Lager, Esfandiari et al. 2017) Bariatric methods can result in malabsorptive states, poor food tolerance or psychological issues which may compromise nutritional status, particularly with ongoing vomiting and or disordered eating. Rates of eating disorders are higher in women with PCOS than in the general population (21% vs 4%) (M\u00e5nsson, Holte et al. 2008) and may contribute to a greater nutritional risk which may impact adversely on fertility, maternal and neonatal complications. Average energy intake is around 1600kcals/day following bariatric surgery (Kruseman 2010) and nutrient density therefore becomes an issue affecting nutritional status. Women may be at particular risk of deficiencies in iron, folate and iodine in addition to other nutrients as the recommended daily intake increases in pregnancy. While supplement use is widely recommended following bariatric surgery and for pregnant women, there are reports of poor compliance with supplement use in the general population of pregnant women with only 10% taking adequate folate (Nilsen, Vollset et al. 2006). This may be further compromised because of poor food tolerance in bariatric patients, particularly of foods fortified with iodine and folate such as bread. Malabsorption and poor nutrition during pregnancy may play a role in the unexpectedly poor pregnancy outcomes noted in women who have conceived and delivered after bariatric surgery. Studies from Sweden linking multiple national registries (surgery, pregnancy, infants, etc.) have noted that obese women who underwent bariatric surgery and conceived compared to similarly obese controls had a higher prevalence of small for gestational age babies, shorter gestations, and a concerning trend towards increased neonatal mortality.(Johansson, Cnattingius et al. 2015) The higher prevalence of SGA babies after bariatric surgery was also noted in a retrospective study in the Spanish population.(Gonzalez, Rubio et al. 2015) Though these studies have also tended to report lower rates of gestational diabetes and large for gestational age (LGA) babies after bariatric surgery, the smaller babies and shorter gestations remain a significant public health concern. In severe obesity, lifestyle interventions have very limited efficacy but given the substantial efficacy of bariatric surgery in women who are severely obese, including in women with PCOS, it is important to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on infertility in women with PCOS. The potential benefits also need to be balanced with the risks of bariatric surgery and the potential risks of pregnancy after bariatric surgery. 3 Evidence to answer the question We did not identify any evidence about the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in women with PCOS to inform this recommendation and therefore a clinical consensus recommendation has been made based on the clinical expertise of the multidisciplinary guideline development group, informed by existing evidencebased clinical guidelines for bariatric surgery in the general population. In general populations, bariatric surgery is recommended in those who have a BMI 35kg/m2 and the presence of comorbid conditions that are expected to improve significantly with weight reduction (Mechanick 2009, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2010). PCOS is a comorbid condition that improves significantly with weight reduction and is strongly associated with other comorbidities including DM2, obstructive sleep apnoea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and increased CVD risk. However given the concerns about the potential perinatal adverse effects of bariatric surgery in women with PCOS, no recommendation can be made at this time about the use of bariatric surgery to improve fertility in women with PCOS Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION Bariatric surgery, for the purpose of having a healthy baby in women with PCOS, should be considered an experimental therapy. The risk/benefit ratio is too uncertain at the moment to advocate this as a fertility treatment. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS If bariatric surgery is to be prescribed, the following key issues should be considered: Patients should be appropriately counselled about perinatal risks (SGA, shorter gestations, possibly increased infant mortality) and benefits (less LGA, less GDM) Pregnancy should be avoided during periods of rapid weight loss and for at least 12 months after bariatric surgery and appropriate contraception advised (Apovian 2009, Heber 2010) If pregnancy occurs, the patient should be made aware of the risk of preand postoperative nutritional deficiencies and should ideally be managed in a specialist interdisciplinary care setting. Fetal growth should be monitored during pregnancy A structured weight management program involving diet, physical activity and interventions to improve psychological, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health should continue postoperatively. Guideline development group decided GRADE was not required since no action was recommended. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS Further methodologically rigorous trials are important to address the efficacy, safety and role of bariatric surgery in polycystic ovary syndrome including to improve fertility. Further studies of women who conceive after bariatric surgery are needed to understand factors contributing to poor fetal growth and shorter gestations. Interventions during pregnancy should be tested to prevent or correct these abnormalities REFERENCES 4 AlvarezBlasco, F., J. I. BotellaCarretero, J. L. San Millan and H. F.

Prevalence and problem The prevalence of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a heterogenic condition is high at 20% (1). The diagnosis can be a challenging one, the most accepted criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS being published in 2004 by the Rotterdam Consensus Group (2). Women desiring a pregnancy and presenting with PCOS and anovulation receive ovulation induction therapy: first line with antioestrogens and second line therapy with gonadotropins. This low intervention therapeutic step has its challenges: side effects of and resistance to antioestrogen therapy, poor compliance, need for ultrasound monitoring, multiple pregnancy and OHSS, the last two occurring mainly with gonadotropin use. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) therapies like IVF and ICSI are offered to patients after investigation of infertility and usually when other therapies have failed. While IVF is offered where the semen quality is within normal parameters, ICSI is usually reserved for situations where a male factor is present. In the PCOS context, women that do not conceive after ovulation induction therapy are advised to proceed with IVF/ ICSI. The challenges of performing IVF for PCOS patients are significant namely, overresponse to stimulation, high oestradiol levels, accelerated endometrial maturation and the need for a \"freeze all\" intervention due to the risk of OHSS, particularly if the long, GnRH analogue protocol, is used. Clinical practice gap: need for guidance Among reproductive age females, PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility (3). For PCOS patients presenting with infertility, reported as high as 40% in some studies (4), ovulation induction is the first line therapy. While ovulation rates are satisfactory, longterm cumulative pregnancy rates are below 50%. Gonadotropin stimulation, as second line therapy, is used when no response to first line therapy is present and has risks similar to IVF. Alternative therapies like IVF offer, in one cycle of treatment pregnancy rates that can reach 50%, particularly in women younger than 37 years old. The clinical practice questions are if women with anovulatory PCOS should pursue IVF/ICSI sooner rather than after failed ovulation induction and if IVF is effective in improving outcomes when compared to preIVF interventions? There are no randomised trials comparing preIVF therapies with IVF in anovulatory PCOS women. The ability to advise such patients as to what is the preferred choice of intervention is very limited. IVF has risks and limitations, yet patient relevant aspects like quality of life and costs have never been studied in depth. Summary of key information There are no randomised controlled trails comparing stimulated IVF/ ICSI therapy with alternative therapies like aromatase citrate, gonadotropins, ovarian surgery, IUI and IVM or no intervention, in women diagnosed with PCOS. The risks associated with gonadotropin use in this group of patients are better controlled in an IVF treatment. Exclusive use of a GnRH antagonist protocol (5) coupled with a GnRH agonist trigger avoids the major risk of OHSS and elective single embryo transfer policies significantly reduces the risk of multiple pregnancy. Control of multiple pregnancy rates is not possible outside the IVF therapy. Access related to cost of therapy remains a major limiting factor for IVF compared to other nonIVF related therapies. The patient and societal benefits of preIVF therapies compared with IVF treatments in anovulatory PCOS women require systematic analysis in randomised controlled studies. Outcomes as time to conception, cost of therapy, quality of life, risk of OHSS, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage and livebirth rates should be investigated. Recommendations Clinical Consensus Recommendations 1. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF/ICSI, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF if first or second line ovulation induction therapies have failed. Clinical Practice Points 1. In women with anovulatory PCOS, the use of IVF is effective and when elective single embryo transfer is used multiple pregnancies can be minimised. 2. Women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment should be counselled prior to starting treatment about the increased risk of OHSS and options to reduce the risk can be offered.

Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to evidence or narrative review. Panel discussion IVF is the logical progression from previous unsuccessful treatment. The pregnancy rates per cycle started in IVF are higher than after ovulation induction.

Panel discussion Using other IVF stimulation protocols can place PCOS patie nts at a high risk of OHSS and potentially lethal complications. The cost of IVF is prohibitive for many patients. Disagreement arose from discussion around choice of treatment and childless-ness Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was co nducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Conception and delivery are the two important outcomes for all patients. Many will pursue these even when high risks must be assumed. Physicians must weigh be nefits and risk when advising PCOS patients. Balance of effects Does the balance between desi rable and undesirable effect s favour the option or the comparison?

(2012) The gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist protocol - the protocol of choice for the polycystic ovary syndrome patient undergoing controlled Clinical question: In women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment, is the GnRH antagonist protocol or GnRH agonist long protocol the most effective for improving fertility outcomes? Contents Background ............................................................................................................................... ........................... 2 Summary of evidence 3 Findings 8 Recommendations included studies .............................................................................................. 19 GnRH protocol in IVF 2 Background Women with PCOS are particularly vulnerable to a significant complication of IVF/ICSI treatment, whereby they have a florid response to stimulation with gonadotrophins, (as they have multiple follicles within the ovary), and this can be associated with fluid extravasation from the vascular system a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (ASRM 2012). A woman with this condition experiences; abdominal distension (due to the development of ascites) which causes significant discomfort, and she will also experience shortness of breath, nausea and constipation. Consequently fertility doctors should endeavour to avoid undertaking IVF treatment for women with PCOS, unless it is absolutely essential, or consider invitro maturation of oocytes, to completely avoid the risk of OHSS (Walls et al, 2015). Hence approaches to minimise the risk of OHSS are important to consider for a patient with PCOS undertaking an IVF cycle (ASRM 2016, Boothroyd et al. 2012). One of the proposed methods to reduce the risk of OHSS is to use a GnRH antagonist (as opposed to an agonist) to suppress pituitary secretion to prevent an endogenous LH surge and precipitate ovulation, as it believed the pituitary suppression leads to a lower serum oestradiol concentration (Mancini et al, 2011, AlInany et al, 2007, Lin et al 2014, ASRM 2016). A high serum oestradiol concentration is one of the potential warning signs of incipient OHSS. Although not the subject of this review the use of an GnRH antagonist enables the final trigger injection for oocyte maturation, prior to oocyte retrieval, to be a GnRH agonist, triggering an endogenous LH surge, which has a shorter halflife than the traditional hCG trigger reducing the duration of the OHSS symptoms (ASRM 2016). Hence in a patient at risk of OHSS, where all embryos generated will be frozen and no fresh embryo transfer performed to let incipient OHSS settle (ASRM 2016), the use of an GnRH agonist trigger after downregulation with a GnRH antagonist offers an approach to reduce the duration of the OHSS symptoms. Further, if the GnRH antagonist approach offered a favourable risk of OHSS compared to the traditional 'long down regulation' with a GnRH agonist, this would further endorse this approach. Understandably the most important endpoint for any woman embarking on fertility treatment is the livebirth rate from her IVF cycle. Paradoxically, despite this being an apparently obvious endpoint, it is increasingly difficult to provide easily interpretable data. The main reason for this is confusion is that for many young women with PCOS, the IVF cycle commenced may be a planned 'freezeall' to minimise the risk and duration of OHSS, and to completely avoid the discomfort of 'secondary' OHSS which occurs when a woman conceives, and the hCG now continues to stimulate follicular development, perpetuating the OHSS. Hence the livebirth rate from that cycle is zero; however, particularly if she is young with PCOS, she will generally generate many oocytes and indeed, ultimately, may have her entire family resulting from that single oocyte retrieval. Hence increasingly IVF specialists may quote cumulative pregnancy rates per cycle commenced to a patient, generating significant confusion for the patient interpreting the data. Hence an outcome of livebirth rate should be interpreted with a degree of caution; perhaps a more useful endpoint is the cumulative pregnancy rate per cycle started, and the IVF cycle cancellation rate. Women with PCOS have multiple follicles, and hence many oocytes will be collected and multiple embryos generated, and there potentially could be a difference between the two groups for these endpoints, and hence ultimately to a potential difference in the rate of miscarriage. Additional endpoints that may be of interest are the duration of stimulation, as potentially a patient may have to selfinject for fewer days with one preparation in comparison to the other, and further there may be cost benefits to the patient and health care providers if one treatment regime was cheaper than another if they were equally efficacious on clinical grounds. GnRH protocol in IVF 3 Summary of evidence Included studies One systematic review (Pundir 2012) which included 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which met the inclusion criteria for this evidence review (Bacheci 2005, Hwang 2004, Lainas 2007, Kurzawa 2008, Lainas 2010), and 3 additional RCTs 2015, Haydardedeoglu 2012, 2010), investigated whether GnRH antagonist protocol or GnRH agonist long protocol is most effective for improving fertility outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI. We have adopted the risk of bias/quality appraisal of the Pundir 2012 systematic review for the five RCTs it includes which meet our inclusion criteria, but are unable to use the metaanalyses since they include four additional studies which do not meet our inclusion criteria (one study which does not describe randomization and three abstracts which do not have sufficient information for inclusion).

Studies of moderate to high risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. The most common reasons for the ratings assigned include: unclear whether allocation to the intervention group was concealed; unclear whether participants, investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention group; unclear if all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated; power calculations were not reported; and a lack of conflict of interest statements. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Generalisability The populations studied are generalisable to the target population for this evidence review. The included studies were conducted in Turkey, Greece, Poland, Iran, and Taiwan between the years 20042015. Findings Due to the heterogeneity within protocols included in this evidence review, metaanalyses have not been performed. Endpoint outcome data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. In the eight included studies (ranging in size from 56 to 220 participants) of low, moderate and high risk of bias, there is low to moderate certainty for outcomes: total dose of gonadotropin (IU); duration of ovarian stimulation (days); OHSS (n,%); per oocytes retrieved; cancelled rates; miscarriage rates; and multiple pregnancies. Statistically significant differences in the amount of gonadotropin required (5 studies in favour of the antagonist protocol), in the duration of gonadotropin use (6 studies in favour of the antagonist protocol), in OHSS rates (2 studies in favour of the antagonist protocol) were identified between the two groups. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for clinical pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, number of oocytes collected, cancellation rates, and multiple pregnancy rates. A number of included studies did not report between group comparisons (p values) for outcomes.

GnRH protocol in IVF 11 Recommendations EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATION For women with PCOS embarking on an IVF/ICSI cycle, GnRH antagonist protocol could be used rather than GnRH agonist long protocol to reduce the duration of stimulation, the total dose of gonadotrophins and the incidence of OHSS. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT The lowest effective dose of hCG should be used to trigger final oocyte maturation. For a woman with PCOS embarking on an IVF/ICSI cycle with a GnRH antagonist protocol at an increased risk of developing OHSS or where it is planned to not perform a fresh embryo transfer, consideration should be given to triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist and freezing all suitable embryos. In women with PCOS embarking on an IVF/ICSI cycle using the GnRH antagonist protocol, consideration should be given to an elective freeze all of embryos. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Adequately powered, well designed, conducted and reported RCTs are required to study cost effectiveness, quality of life, clinical outcomes including cumulative live birth rate, for the GnRH antagonist protocol with a GnRH agonist trigger. GnRH protocol in IVF 12 GRADE framework Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework In women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment, is the GnRH antagonist protocol or GnRH agonist long protocol the most effective for improving fertility outcomes? ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to evidence or narrative review. Panel discussion The duration of stimulation with a GnRH antagonist approach is roughly a day shorter than the standard 'long-down regulation' approach with a GnRH agonist. The rate of OHSS is less with a GnRH antagonist approach in comparison to the standard 'long-down regulation' approach with a GnRH agonist. The effect size is difficult to quantify, as all 7 out of the 8 studies used a high dose hCG trigger (10,000iu) in both arms, and one study used 5,000iu, where in practice many IVF specialists would use 5,000iu of urinary derived or 250 g of recombinant hCG. Undesirable effects How substantial are the unde sirable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion The does not appear to be an increase in undesirable si de-effects with an antagonist down-regulation approach Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Judgement No included studies Very low Low Moderate High GnRH protocol in IVF 13 Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion The body of evidence included here is of low certainty with se rious risk of bias; particularly in relation to the blinding of participants, and the assessors, furthermore three studie s were industry sponsored leading to a potential publication bias. Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was co nducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion The benefit from a shorter duration of stimulation derived pati ents is difficult to quantify as a significant minority of patients are needle phobic, and hence would derive substantia l benefit from one day less of injections, although for most patients the difference would be insignificant. The benefit derived through the avoidance of OHSS for some patients should be considered a very important health benefit. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and unde sirable effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion The balance of evidence would favour the use of a GnRH anta gonist approach over an agonist approach for the benefit of a reduced duration of stimulation with a reduction in the rate of OHSS, without there being a difference in the rate of any clinical outcome studied. How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement GnRH protocol in IVF 14 Don't know Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion There are no expected resource requirements for the implementation of the recommendation. Depends on resources in country. Vari es according to geographic location. Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion The cost-effectiveness of the use of a GnRH antagonist appr oach (which may be more expensive) in favour to a GnRH agonist approach (which may be cheaper), but with the bene fits of a reduced requirement for gonadotrophins, a lower incidence of OHSS; and hence reduced hospitalisation cost s, should be thoroughly assessed in each health care setting to determine the cost-effectiveness of this proposed approach. Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement Don't know Varies Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion There are not expected to be any barriers to the implem entation of the recommendation for disadvantaged groups. Depends on resources in country.

Panel discussion It would not be expected that th ere are any barriers to key stakeholders adopting these recommendations. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion It is feasible to adopt these recommendations, as there are not expected to be any barriers to key stakeholders adopting these recommendations. Depends on resources in country.

GnRH protocol in IVF 16 CONCLUSIONS Evidence-based recommendation 1 For women with PCOS embarking on an IVF/ICSI cycle, GnRH antagonist protocol could be used rather than GnRH agonist long protocol to reduce the duration of stimulation, the total dose of gonadotrophins and the incidence of OHSS. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Practice points The lowest effective dose of HCG should be used to trigger final oocyte maturation. For a woman with PCOS embarking on an IVF/ICSI cycle with a GnRH antagonist protocol at an increased risk of developing OHSS or where it is planned to not perform a fresh embryo transfer, consideration should be given to triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agoni st and freezing all suitable embryos. In women with PCOS embarking on an IVF/ICSI cycle using the GnRH antagonist protocol, consideration should be given to an elective freeze all of embryos. Justification Evidence exists for a reduction in the rate of OHSS for wome n who use a GnRH antagonist for pituitary down-regulation in combination with an agonist trigger to effect oocyte maturation prior to oocyte retrieval (ASRM 2016). Subgroup considerations It is not apparent if there are any sub-groups of populati ons in the world to whom a different recommendation were to apply, unless the ease of access or co st of the drugs were sufficient to favour one approach over another. Implementation considerations The only potential barriers to the implementation to these re commendations relate to the av ailability of the drugs and the cost of the drugs which may vary according to the healthcare setting. It would be expected that these impediments will be limited. Monitoring and evaluation As there are several methods to reduce the incidence of OHSS for women undergoing IVF/ICSI, it would be difficult to evaluate the benefit of the implementation of these recommendations. Research priorities Adequately powered, well designed, conducted and reported RCTs are required to study cost effectiveness, quality of life, clinical outcomes including cumulative live birth rate, for the GnRH antagonist protocol with a GnRH agonist trigger.

No \"Based on our previous results we assumed an ongoing pregnancy rate of 35 % in women younger than 35 years who had PCOS. Testing for 5 % difference in favor of one protocol, which could be regarded as the minimum clinically significant difference would require approximately 1,500 patients in each arm to achieve 80 % power at 5% significance level. This was not deemed feasible for a single center trial, and we decided to conduct an interim analysis when 10 % of this sample size, i.e. 300 women, was reached. The trial would be continued if there was a difference of 3 % between trial arms. However, the difference between ongoing pregnancy rates was <1 % and we decided to terminate recruitment due to futility. We anticipate that our data can contribute to future metaanalysis on the issue\" If statistical analysis was undertaken, was this appropriate?

Prevalence and problem IVFtreatment PCOS is the most common cause of anovulation in infertile women (810%). Conversely, anovulation is not an indication for IVF, however in case of permanent failure of different ovulatory treatments or gynecological associated pathologies IVF should be considered. Since there are different needs for IVF in PCOS infertile women, data are not feasible to know the anovulatory component of this health demand. Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome One of the prominent causes of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the occurrence in women with PCOS undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF particularly in hCG as ovulation triggering. Clinical gap and need for guidance Early in 1990 an alternative to exogenous hCG triggering emerged. Initial pituitary flare effect on LHFSH release by GnRHagonist administration as an additional ovulatory option for IVF. The choice to trigger final oocyte maturation with GnRH agonist, instead of hCG, prevents OHSS in PCOS patients at risk. The clinical feature of this pharmacological approach supports the clinical determination of making this protocol the first choice. Nevertheless in the initial steps pregnancy rate was very low. GnRHagonist hCG administration efficacy Interesting a single bolus of GnRH agonist administration during late follicular development of PCOS women treated with gonadotropins resulting in a surge of endogenous FSH and LH for final oocyte maturation and fertilization. GnRHa trigger and the subsequent results an extremely pregnancy loss despite a standard luteal support. Defective luteal phase following GnRHagonist triggering causes restrained LH pulsatility favoring luteolysis and diminish implantation rate. Regarding OHSS high -risk patients who are mainly PCOS patients, different approaches for luteal phase rescue have been suggested after GnRH agonist trigger. The different approaches emerged from Scandinavian scientist for luteal phase rescue after GnRHagonist trigger. They suggest the administration of a bolus of 1500 IU of hCG the day of oocyte retrieval. In addition a conventional luteal support was also included. An alternative option in patients at high risk of OHSS is to freeze oocytes or embryos after GnRH agonist triggering and transfer in subsequent either natural or subtitutes freeze -thaw cycles. Luteal phase support included vaginal progesterone and estradiol. This modifies approach after GnRH agonist trigger resulted in a live birth close to 50 %. Shapiro in the USA reported similar data. An alternative option in patients at high risk of OHSS is to freeze embryos after GnRHa trigerring and transfer in subsequent either natural or substitutes freeze -thaw cycles. Embryo transfer in OHSSrisk patients. The motive of lower pregnancy rate after GnRH agonist triggering of final oocyte maturation and fresh embryo transfer is unknown. It is likely associated a defective luteal phase. Interesting a number of investigators found lower clinical pregnancy rate in fresh embryo than frozen thawed embryo replacement in cycles from the same 2 cohort. These data suggest that the better pregnancy rate is dependent of the endometrial quality than the origin of the embryo. It would be advisable to study in details male factor. In our setting the majority of PCOS women undergoing ovarian hiperstimulation following IVF are due to male factor infertility. Obviously additional women reproductive dysfunctions must be considered. The relatively new protocol for hyperstimulation of PCOS women following IVF including GnRHantagonist GnRH agonist and low doses of hCG should be confirmed by a large number of participants. This research should be international including large RCT trials analyzing OHSS syndrome Pregnancy rates birth rates etc. FINAL COMMENTS I do have some concerning the clinical question of the present survey. I think that the understanding of efficacy could be oriented in how to reduce the OHSS (There are several types of OHSS) or only improving fertility outcomes \" per se \" due to both are very important issue. Previously it was debated whether or not long GnRHagonist protocol was superior to the GnRHantagonist protocol in term of reproductive outcomes. Metaanalysis showed no difference in the birth rate between the two analogs. Interesting the GnRHa protocol associated with the administration of a bolus of 1500 IU of hCG immediately after oocyte pickup following by a standard luteal phase support, exhibits a significant reduction in OHSS and improve pregnancy outcomes. This option is highly recommended. Initial information suggest that this approach might better. However a large clinical trial RCTS is needed to confirm these initial data. Frozen thawed embryo is an attractive option for PCOS patients due to satisfactorily endometrium that can be accomplished with estradiol and progesterone in the presence or absence of GnRH agonist. This option makes possible the selection and numbers of embryo transfer. It is important to highlights that these techniques and skills are not available in many reproductive clinics. Recommendations CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT Practice point made for GnRH protocol question also relevant here: For a woman with PCOS embarking on an IVF/ICSI cycle with a GnRH antagonist protocol at an increased risk of developing OHSS or where it is planned to not perform a fresh embryo transfer, consideration should be given to triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist and freezing all suitable embryos. Clinical considerations Desirable effects The choice to trigger final oocyte maturation with GnRH antagonist instead of hCG is a critical point to prevent OHSS. Undesirable effects hCG alone induces oocyte maturation but it is associated with OHSS. Values The pharmacological approach is a valuable option. Balance affects The balances between the options favour desirable suggestion. Subgroups 3 Women with BMI30 presumably will need high doses of gonadotropins which is associated with high risk of OHSS. Certainty of evidence of required resources The centre should have fast oestradiol measurements, standard ultrasound machines and access to an intensive care unit in case of complex OHSS. The medical group should be professionals with clinical experience in this complicated health condition. Costs is a problem. This is an important issue in developing countries where many participants do not have health insurance and the National Health Service does not support IVF. Costeffectiveness Yes Equity already mentioned Acceptability The benefit of the new treatment is an attractive option. Combine treatment: Antagonist Agonist hCG (1000 1500 IU) at the time of ovum pickup. Feasibility It possible to set up the recommendation. However the centre has to have the ad hoc connection in the case of severe OHSS. Implementation The physicians should present clear information about the potential risk in addition to a welldefined informed consent. Monitoring and evaluation Number of couples that accept the potential risk. The professionals of the centre should monitor the patients nearby. Evaluation of the results should be clearly aware. Research Priorities I do think that this new combine approach is not an experimental treatment. However is imperative to develop clearly strict design and guidelines.

Contents Background ............................................................................................................................... ........................... 2 Summary of evidence 2 3 Recommendations table included study .................................................................................................. 11 Choice of FSH for IVF 2 Background Different preparations of FSH exist. FSH can be purified from human urine (uFSH) or it can be synthesised by animal cell lines using recombinant DNA techniques (rFSH). Urinary preparations have varying levels of LH activity and other impurities. The LH activity in urinary gonadotrophin preparations is known to stimulate androgen production in theca cells and it plays an important role in completing maturation of the follicle. However, it is known that less than 1% of follicular LH receptors needs to be occupied in order to elicit maximal steroidogenesis and it is therefore possible that enough endogenous LH is present during controlled ovarian stimulation to promote androgen synthesis and oocyte maturation without the need for extra LH activity in FSH preparations. The perceived clinical benefits of rFSH versus uFSH are the subject of ongoing debate and both types of preparations remain commonly used. Summary of evidence Included studies One randomized controlled trial (level II) was identified by the search which investigated whether the choice of FSH affects fertility outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing IVF.

Choice of FSH for IVF 3 Methodological quality/risk of bias This study of moderate risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. While it is a randomised study, reasons for the moderate risk of bias rating include: it is unclear whether allocation to the intervention group was concealed; it is unclear whether participants, investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention group; it is unclear which groups participants lost to follow up were from; it is unclear if all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated; and a power calculation was not reported. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. It is also important to consider that the study does not report cancellation rate either before egg retrieval (i.e. for excess OHSS risk) or after. Hence, it is unclear whether it is certain that the outcomes for total FSH dose, egg yield are per couple randomised or per patient having an egg collection. Oocyte number (and other outcomes) could be biased if data was not included if patients were cancelled. Generalisability The population studied is generalisable to the target population for this evidence review. This study was conducted in a research hospital Turkey in 2008, although it is important to note that the sample size is small. Findings In this small study (80 participants) of moderate risk of bias, there is moderate certainty for outcome data: total dose of gonadotropin (IU); duration of OHSS (n,%); maximum level cycle (%); number of oocytes retrieved; take home baby rate per cycle (%). There were statistically significant differences between the two groups for: the duration of ovarian stimulation required, the maximum serum estradiol level, and the number of oocytes retrieved. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for the total dose of gonadotropin used, OHSS rate, clinical pregnancy rate per cycle and take home baby rate per cycle.

Choice of FSH for IVF 4 Recommendations CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION Women with PCOS undergoing (controlled) ovarian (hyper) stimulation for IVF/ICSI can be prescribed urinary or recombinant FSH as there is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular type of FSH preparation. CLINICAL PRACTICE POINT Availability, convenience and costs considerations may be an important factor in the decision. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Further adequately powered, well designed, conducted and reported RCTs are required to compare the different types of FSH preparations in women with PCOS undergoing (controlled) ovarian (hyper) stimulation for IVF/ICSI using GnRH antagonist or GnRH agonist long protocol with important outcomes such as live birth rate per cycles started, cumulative live birth rate from one egg retrieval, OHSS and cost effectiveness . Justification Only one small study has been identified investigating two different FSH preparations (uFSH versus rFSH) in women with PCOS undergoing (controlled) ovarian (hyper) stimulation for IVF/ICSI. Nevertheless, the moderate evidence available from this study is broadly in line with a systematic review and metaanalysis looking at this same question in a general IVF population. A total of 42 trials with a total of 9606 couples comparing rFSH against three different uFSH preparations were [Cochrane Rev. 2011 Feb 16;(2):CD005354. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD005354.pub2.]. Comparing rFSH to any of the other gonadotrophins irrespective of the downregulation protocol used, did not result in any evidence of a statistically significant difference in live birth rate or a difference in the OHSS rate. The authors conclude that clinical choice of gonadotrophin should depend on availability, convenience and costs and that further research on these comparisons is unlikely to identify substantive differences in effectiveness or safety.

Clinical problem Ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI in patients with PCOS is characterized by a risk of multiple follicular development leading to a high incidence of OHSS and multiple pregnancies. The chronic low dose stepup protocol with exogenous FSH in securing single (fewer) dominant follicle selection is an alternative method to avoid multi follicular development. During late follicular development, LH is essential to achieve adequate ovarian steroidogenesis and develop the subsequent capacity of the follicle to ovulate and luteinize. Is recombinant LH supplement recommended during IVF/ICSI in patients with PCOS for improving fertility outcome? Prevalence and problem PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. Increased LH secretion or elevated LH/FSH ratio in women with PCOS has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of decreased fertility. The proposed mechanisms include inhibition of oocyte maturation leading to premature oocyte maturation as well as its deleterious effects on granulosa cell steroidogenesis and endometrial receptivity (1,2). Additionally, elevated serum LH is associated with an increased incidence of early pregnancy loss (3). Summary of key information Obese women with PCOS more often experience menstrual disturbance and are more likely to be anovulatory. Additionally, they are less likely to ovulate in response to either clomiphene citrate or gonadotropin (FSH) administration than their lean counterparts (4). Therefore, reduction of insulin levels by insulinlowering medicine or improvement of insulin status by weight loss for anovulatory women with PCOS may lead to a resumption of ovulatory function and fertility (5). Hyperinsulinemia in anovulatory women with PCOS likely results in the premature maturation of ovarian granulosa cells. Indeed, in vitro studies have shown that granulosa cells obtained from anovulatory women with PCOS response to LH at a relatively earlier follicular stage (and are significantly more responsive to LH) than those from ovulatory women with PCOS or normal menstrual women (2). These findings indicate that granulosa cell differentiation is prematurely advanced due to the effects of LH in anovulatory women with PCOS. Collectively, high serum levels of LH in women with PCOS may inhibit granulosa cell proliferation and prematurely promote granulosa cell differentiation and steroidogenesis. Controlled ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development is a fundamental step of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), which significantly increases pregnancy rate in IVF/ICSI. Many optimal stimulation protocols have been designed and refined to benefit the effectiveness and safety of fertility outcome while minimizing the related risks and complications. Systematic reviews and metaanalysis have demonstrated that there is no significant difference between different ovarian stimulation protocols (hMG, purified FSH, recombinant FSH) regarding the fertility outcomes. Therefore, the clinical choice of gonadotropins should depend on drug availability, convenience, and cost. In standard IVF/ICSI protocols, the types of controlled ovarian stimulation (FSH alone or addition of LH as a supplement) have little impact on the fertility outcomes (6,7). It has been proposed that the endogenous LH levels may fall too low in some older women (> 35) during the ovarian stimulation protocol especially when they are receiving GnRHantagonist as an adjuvant treatment and that these women could benefit from LH supplement. However, a multicentre RCT study has shown that exogenous LH supplement during the second half of follicular phase has no benefit on the fertility outcomes (ovarian response, implantation rate, or pregnancy rate) in women older than 35 years (8). At present, no study has been designed to investigate the efficacy of exogenous LH supplement for improving fertility outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI. Careful monitoring of follicular development during ovarian stimulation is critical because women with PCOS are very sensitive to the ovulation induction medication. Starting lowdoses of daily 37.575 IU FSH are recommended with a stepwise increase in FSH supply to determine the FSH threshold. An increase in the FSH dose is added if follicular development is not observed after one week. The same dose of FSH is maintained until follicular growth is observed and selected (9). Recommendations CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION In women with PCOS undergoing (controlled) ovarian (hyper) stimulation for IVF/ICSI, exogenous recombinant LH treatment in combination with FSH should not be used routinely.

Hum REVIEW Clinical question: In women with PCOS undergoing (controlled) ovarian (hyper) stimulation for IVF/ICSI, is adjunct metformin effective for improving fertility outcomes? Contents Background ............................................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................... .. 1 included studies ............................................................................................................................... ..................................................................... 21 Background IVF/ICSI treatment in women with PCOS is usually recommended either as a thirdline treatment (after failed first or second line therapies including clomifene citrate, gonadotropin or LOD ovulation induction) or in the presence of other infertility factors such as tubal damage, severe endometriosis or male factor infertility (Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group 2008). IVF/ICSI treatment in women with PCOS poses a number of clinical challenges, in particular that of an increased risk of moderate to severe Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) (Lin 2007). The aetiological hypotheses of PCOS are continually developing with the understanding and incorporation of the evolving evidence of the syndrome, which appears to be both multifactorial and polygenic and includes hypothalamic pituitaryovarian and adrenal axis contributions, ovarian thecal cell steroidogenesis dysfunction, and insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia (Baskind 2016). Based on the association between insulin resistance and anovulation in both lean and obese PCOS women, insulinsensitising drugs, such as metformin, have been added as a promising therapy to restore ovulation and enhance pregnancy in PCOS (Costello 2006) . Metformin is a biguanide which reduces hepatic glucose production by reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis, improves insulin sensitivity by increasing insulin mediated glucose uptake by Adjuvant Metformin in IVF 2 skeletal muscle / liver / adipose tissue, reduces intestinal absorption of glucose, reduces lipogenesis and increases fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle / liver / adipose tissue, and reduces ovarian androgen production both directly by a reduction in CYP17 enzyme activity and indirectly via a reduction in hyperinsulinemia. It is estimated that 1015% of its efficacy in type 2 diabetes is due to peripheral improvement in insulin sensitivity, primarily in skeletal muscle. Thus, metformin is not primarily an insulin sensitizing drug, although it is often labelled as such in the treatment of women with PCOS (Legro 2016, Sivalingam 2014, Naderpoor 2015). There is a good physiological rationale for believing that suppression of insulin levels, through the use of insulin sensitising agents such as metformin, may be useful in women with PCOS who are undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Suppression of insulin levels might ameliorate the adverse effects of ovarian stimulation and improve treatment outcomes in IVF/ICSI. It has also been suggested that metformin may reduce serum estradiol levels during ovarian stimulation and it has also been hypothesized that metformin may reduce the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), both of which are important factors involved in the pathophysiology of OHSS (Tso 2014). Therefore, it is important to determine the effectiveness and safety of metformin as a cotreatment in achieving pregnancy or live birth and reducing OHSS in women with PCOS undergoing IVF or ICSI treatment. Summary of evidence Included studies One Cochrane review (Tso 2014) which included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which met the inclusion criteria for this evidence review (Fedorcsak 2003, Kjotrod 2004, Kjotrod 2011, Onalan 2005, Palomba 2011, and Tang 2006), investigated whether adjuvant metformin is most effective for improving fertility outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI. A further four systematic reviews (Huang 2015, Costello 2006, Moll 2007, Palomba 2013) also met the inclusion criteria for this evidence review but did not include any additional studies which met our inclusion criteria to the Tso 2014 systematic reviews. We have adopted the risk of bias/quality appraisal of the systematic review for the six RCTs they include but are unable to use the systematic review's metaanalyses as they include three additional RCTs which did not meet the inclusion criteria for this evidence review (all three do not describe their method of randomization, and one of them is also not in English and metformin treatment began on the day of ovulation induction).

Studies of moderate to high risk of bias should be interpreted with caution. The most common reasons for the ratings assigned include: unclear whether allocation to the intervention group was concealed; unclear whether participants, investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention group; unclear if all participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated; power calculations were not reported; direct comparisons between groups not being reported; and a lack of conflict of interest statements. These methodological issues are likely to have an impact on the direction of bias and reliability of the findings. Generalisability The populations studied are generalisable to the target population for this evidence review. The included studies were conducted in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Turkey, Italy, and the UK between the years 20032011. Findings The six RCTs, ranging in size from 17 to 149 participants, were of low, moderate and high risk of bias; and there is very low to moderate certainty for outcomes: total dose of gonadotropin (IU); duration of ovarian stimulation (days); OHSS (n,%); per retrieved; cancelled rates; miscarriage rates; and pregnancies. IVF with adjuvant metformin was better for OHSS, clinical pregnancy rate, cancellation rate and live birth rate. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for the amount of gonadotropins used, the duration of ovarian stimulation, miscarriage rates, number of oocytes collected, and multiple pregnancy rates. A number of included studies did not report between group comparisons (p values) for outcomes.

Adjuvant Metformin in IVF 10 Recommendations EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATION For women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment with GnRH agonist protocol, adjunct metformin therapy could be used before and/or during FSH ovarian stimulation to improve the clinical pregnancy rate and reduce the incidence of (or risk of developing) Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome. CLINICAL CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION For women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment with GnRH agonist protocol where adjunct metformin therapy is being used, the following recommendations could be considered: commence metformin at the start of GnRH agonist treatment use metformin at a dose of between 1000mg to 2550mg daily stop metformin therapy at the time of the pregnancy test or period (unless the metformin therapy is otherwise indicated) Clinical practice point Women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment could be counselled that there may be benefits to using adjunct metformin in a GnRH antagonist protocol to reduce OHSS. Patient side effects may be minimised by gradually increasing the dose of metformin. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION Further adequately powered, well designed and conducted RCTs are needed to assess the benefits and harms of adjunct metformin treatment before and/or during IVF/ICSI treatment using a GnRH antagonist protocol in women with PCOS. Further adequately powered, well designed and conducted RCTs are needed to determine the appropriate time to cease metformin with regard to pregnancy rate, live birth rate and infant outcomes. Justification for clinical consensus recommendations (CCRs) CCR1 a) Only 3 of the 8 individual RCTs in Tso 2014 systematic review showed a significant reduction in OHSS and metformin was started either at the start of GnRH agonist treatment [Tang 2006; Palomba 2014] or on the day of starting FSH injections (Visnova 2003) in these 3 RCTs b) Some patients (and clinicians) may not find delaying IVF treatment for up to 4 months (due to adjunct metformin treatment) acceptable despite the potential benefits of an increase in clinical pregnancy rate and a reduction in the risk of developing OHSS CCR2 The evidence is overall applicable to metformin dosage from 1000mg daily (lowest) to 1500mg daily to 1700mg daily to 2000mg daily to 2550mg daily (highest) as used in the RCTs in Tso 2014 systematic review . Adjuvant Metformin in IVF 11 CCR3 All 8 RCTs in the Tso 2014 systematic review stopped adjunct metformin therapy at varying times including on the day of the hCG trigger (earliest) to day of egg collection to day of embryo transfer to day of pregnancy test (or period) to 12 weeks of pregnancy (\"12 weeks of pregnancy\" was for 1 RCT using antagonist protocol not assessing live birth rate or clinical pregnancy rate and not showing a reduction in OHSS [Doldi 2006]) (latest). Also, continuing metformin after the egg collection and to the day of pregnancy test (or period) would potentially cover the time frame when early cases of OHSS may present. Important considerations for GRADE Desirable effects How substantial are the desirable anticipated effects/benefits of the option proposed in the recommendation? Moderate: see below i.e. Tso 2014 Systematic Review metaanalyses for the outcomes of (i) Live Birth Rate (LBR): no evidence of a difference with adjunct metformin (ii) Clinical Pregnancy Rate (CPR): increased CPR with adjuvant metformin i.e. extra (+) 96 per 1000 women (95% CI +15 to +181) with OR 1.52 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.15) moderate quality evidence as per Summary of Finding Table (iii) Miscarriage rate (MCR): no evidence of a difference with adjunct metformin (iv) Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS): reduced OHSS with adjuvant metformin: fewer () 173 per 1000 women (95% CI 208 to 117) with OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.49) moderate quality evidence as per Summary of Finding Table (v) Number of oocytes collected: no evidence of a difference with adjunct metformin (v) Days of ovarian stimulation: no evidence of a difference with adjunct metformin (vi) Cycle cancellation rate: no evidence of a difference with adjunct metformin Undesirable effects Are there any undesirable/harmful effects of the option you are recommending and how substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects?

(ii) For the outcome of OHSS, 7 RCTs were GnRH agonist long protocol (reduction in with 0.29; 95% CI 0.16 to 23%) and 1 RCT was GnRH agonist protocol (no evidence of a difference in OHSS with OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.03 to 3.15; I2 not applicable) and the results for pooling all 8 RCTs showed a reduction in OHSS with OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.49; I2 = 11%. The evidence is overall applicable to starting metformin before and/or ovarian stimulation for the GnRH agonist long protocol as 7 of the 8 RCTs started metformin from at least 16 weeks before (earliest) to the first day (latest) of GnRH agonist administration. The one RCT that started metformin on the day of starting FSH injections (i.e. adjuvant metformin only during ovarian stimulation) (Visnova 2003) demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of OHSS (as opposed to 2 [Tang 2006; Palomba 2014] of the 7 RCTs starting metformin prior to IVF showing a significant reduction in the incidence of OHSS). Both these RCTs [Tang 2006; the start of GnRH agonist treatment. Therefore, only 3 of the 8 individual RCTs showed a significant reduction in OHSS and metformin was started either at the start of GnRH agonist treatment [Tang 2006; Palomba 2014] or on the day of starting FSH injections (Visnova 2003). The evidence is overall applicable to metformin dosage from 1000mg daily (lowest) to 1500mg daily to 1700mg daily 2000mg daily to 2550mg daily (highest). The evidence is probably overall applicable to all severity of OHSS combined (mild, moderate and severe) as opposed to only severe OHSS. Of the 8 RCTs in the OHSS metaanalysis, 5 RCTs did (mild + moderate + severe) (Kjotrod 2011; Palomba 2011) and 1 included only severe OHSS (Tang 2006). Adjuvant Metformin in IVF 13 GRADE framework Interactive Evidence to Decision Framework In women with PCOS undergoing (controlled) ovarian (hyper) stimulation for IVF/ICSI, is adjunct metformin effective for improving fertility outcomes? ASSESSMENT Desirable effects How substantial are the desi rable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence Refer to evidence or narrative review. Panel discussion Undesirable effects How substantial are the unde sirable anticipated effects? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion Gastrointestinal side effects may be present and resolve wi thin a short period of time. Side effects are usually mild, self-limiting and may be minimized wi th lower metformin starting dose. Extended release preparations and administration with food might also decrease gastrointestinal side effects. Certainty of the evidence What is the overall certaint y of the evidence of effects? Judgement No included studies Very low Low Moderate High Research evidence See above in 'Desirable effects'. Panel discussion Adjuvant Metformin in IVF 14 The body of evidence included here is of very low to modera te certainty with some studies at serious to very serious risk of bias, serious risk of imprecision, serious indirect ness, and serious to very serious risk of publication bias. Values Is there important uncertainty about, or variability in, how much people value the main outcomes? Judgement Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Research evidence The GRADE outcome prioritisation exercise was co nducted before evidence synthesis commenced. Panel discussion Patients (and clinicians) would generall y strongly value (with probably no importa nt uncertainty in or variability in) an increased clinical pregnancy rate (with no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rate) and a reduced risk for developing OHSS (with its associated morbidity and rarely mortality). Patients (and clinicians) would generall y mild to moderately value (with pr obably no important uncertainty in or variability in) not having an increased incidence of gastro-intestinal side-effect. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and unde sirable effects favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Panel discussion The balance between desirable (increased CPR with reduced OHSS) & undesira ble (increased S/E's) effects (benefits & harms) probably favours the intervention (met formin) but with low certainty of evidence. How large are the resour ce requirements (costs)? Judgement Don't know Varies Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs or savings Moderate savings Large savings Research evidence Adjuvant Metformin in IVF 15 No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Cost of oral metformin therapy small for up to 4 months. Cost of managing OHSS moderate to large depending on severity and whether or not outpatient management or hospitalization required. Cost-effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the opti on favour the option or the comparison? Judgement Favours this option Probably favours this option Neither favours this option or other options Probably favours other options Favours other options Research evidence No evidence was identified to address this criterion. Panel discussion Cost of oral metformin therapy small for up to 4 months. Cost of managing OHSS moderate to large depending on severity and whether or not outpatient management or hospitalization required. Equity What would be the imp act on health equity? Judgement Don't know Varies Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion The ability to afford oral metformin therapy uncertain as de pendent on many factors including, but not limited to, the health care setting (IVF/ICSI funded, partly funded, or not funded) and socioeconomic status of the patient. Acceptability Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Adjuvant Metformin in IVF 16 Patients (and clinicians) probably likely to find the interv ention (metformin) acceptable. However, some patients (and clinicians) may not find delaying IVF treatment for up to 4 m onths (due to adjunct metformi n treatment) acceptable despite the potential benefits of an increase in clinical pregnancy rate and a reduction in the risk of developing OHSS. Feasibility Is the option feasib le to implement? Judgement Don't know Varies No Probably No Probably Yes Yes Research evidence Evidence was not sought to address this criterion. Panel discussion Probably feasible to sustain the option recommended and probably no important potential barriers to implementation of the recommendation (apart from patients unable to tolerate oral me tformin due to side-effects which affect approximately 5% of patients) CONCLUSIONS Evidence-based recommendation 1 For women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment with Gn RH agonist protocol, adjunct metformin therapy could be used before and/or during FSH ovarian stimulation to improv e the clinical pregnancy rate and reduce the incidence of (or risk of developing) Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome. Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Consensus recommendation For women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment with Gn RH agonist protocol where adjunct metformin therapy is being used, the following recommendations could be considered: commence metformin at the start of GnRH agonist treatment use metformin at a dose of between 1000mg to 2550mg daily stop metformin therapy at the time of the pregnancy test or period (unless the metformin therapy is otherwise indicated) Judgement Strong recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation against the option Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison Conditional recommendation for the option Strong recommendation for the option Adjuvant Metformin in IVF 17 Practice point Women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment could be co unselled that there may be benefits to using adjunct metformin in a GnRH antagonist protocol to reduce OHSS. Patient side effects may be minimised by gradually increasing the dose of metformin. Subgroup considerations None. Implementation considerations Potential barriers (of limited impairment of implementation) to implementation of the recommendations relate to the availability of drug metformin and costs of the drugs which ma y vary depending on many factors including, but not limited to, the health care setting (IVF/ICSI f unded, partly funded, or not funded) and socioeconomic status of the patient. Monitoring and evaluation It would be difficult to monitor and measure the success of implementing these recommendations as there are many individualized strategies to improve clinical pregnancy rate and reduce the incidence of OHSS. Research priorities Further adequately powered, well designed and conducted RCTs are needed to assess the be nefits and harms of adjunct metformin treatment before and/or during IVF/ICSI treatmen t using a GnRH antagonist protocol in women with PCOS. Further adequately powered, well designed and conducted RCTs are needed to determine the appropriate time to cease metformin with regard to pregnancy rate , live birth rate and infant outcomes.

Prevalence and problem Many women with PCOS are required to undergo IVF treatment, perhaps due to unsuccessful ovulation induction treatment, due to compromised fallopian tube function or her partner has a poor sperm count. Women with PCOS who require IVF treatment are at an increased risk of the sideeffect of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) if they undergo ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins. Invitro maturation of oocytes is a procedure whereby ovarian stimulation is either omitted altogether, or a shorter duration of ovarian stimulation is employed. Often no priming 'trigger' injection is given prior to the oocyte retrieval procedure and the woman undergoes oocyte retrieval when her follicles are a smaller diameter than with standard IVF treatment. After retrieval the oocytes are allowed to continue their maturation in the laboratory for 2448 hours prior to insemination with sperm. This approach completely avoids the risk of OHSS (1), and in addition has the perceived benefits of fewer injections, less monitoring and a lower cost (2). Clinical practice gap: need for guidance The definition of an IVM cycle requires clarification as ideally the definition should exclude all cycles where a trigger injection has been used (3), as cycles employing an hCG trigger injection are generally associated with asynchronous oocyte maturation rates and poor embryo implantation rates and a reduction in the clinical pregnancy rate (4, 5). There are no randomized studies of IVM versus ICSI for women with PCOS who required assisted reproduction and there are no randomised trials of ovulation induction treatment with any agent versus IVM. Furthermore there are now longterm followup studies of the health of the children born resulting from IVM treatment. Summary of key information There are no randomised controlled trials of IVF versus IVM treatment for the management of women with PCOS (2), however retrospective studies of women with PCOS who undergo IVM treatment suggest the IVM approach is just as successful at achieving a livebirth after the transfer of a frozen embryo generated with IVM treatment as for a woman with PCOS who had a transfer of an embryo generated by standard IVF treatment (1). However pregnancy rates are reduced and miscarriage rates are higher if a fresh embryo transfer is performed (1). Furthermore the embryo development appears slower when IVM is employed with a greater degree of embryo multinucleation and embryo arrest (6). Recommendations CLINICAL PRACTICE POINTS The term IVM treatment cycle should be applied to \"the maturation in vitro of immature cumulus oocyte complexes collected from antral follicles\" (encompassing both stimulated and unstimulated cycles, but without the use of an hCG trigger). Retrospective studies of women with PCOS who undergo IVM treatment suggest the IVM approach can be just as successful at achieving a livebirth after the transfer of a frozen embryo generated with IVM treatment as for a woman with PCOS who had a transfer of a frozen embryo generated by standard IVF/ICSI. IVM treatment obviates the risk of OHSS associated with a fresh stimulated cycle. Research recs There is a need for randomised controlled trials of IVM versus standard IVF/ICSI treatment for women with PCOS assessing outcomes such as clinical and cost effectiveness, and quality of life. Longterm followup of the health of the children born resulting from IVM treatment is required. There is a need for randomised controlled trials in women with PCOS undergoing IVM treatment comparing standard insemination versus ICSI for insemination of in vitro matured oocytes. References 1.

Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 1 CHAPTER SIX Guideline development methods This guideline was developed as outl ined in National Health and Medical Research Council ( NHMRC ) standards and procedures for rigorously developed external guidelines [1] and according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach [2]. These methods were aligned with European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology ( ESHRE ) approaches to guideline development [3]. The work builds on the original Australian guideline in PCOS [4], the update in 2014 as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO ) guideline in infertility management [5] and Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AEPCOS ) Statement on improving emotional wellbeing in PCOS [6]. The International evidence -based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS underpins an international initiative to engage women affected by PCOS and their health professionals to improve health outcomes. Extensive international health professional and consumer engagement informed the gaps, need s, priorities and core clinical outcomes for the guideline . Thirty -seven organisations were engaged with formal partnership with ESHRE and American Society for Reproductive Medicine ( ASRM ). Guideline development groups (GDGs) included members nominated by the engaged international societies. Society -nominated panel members includ ed women with PCOS, paediatricians, endocrinologists, pr imary physicians, reproductive endocrinologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, dietitian s, exercise physiolog ist, public health experts, researchers and other co -opted experts as required. They were supported by an experienced project management, evid ence synthesis and translation team to develop the guideline. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the evidence and formulate recommendations using the GRADE Framework. Governance and process Governance included an international advisory board from six continents, a project board, five GDGs , a paediatric advisory panel, advisors and a translation committee (See Figure 1). The Australian Centre for Resear ch Excellence in PCOS (CREPCOS) and the NHMRC partnered with the ESHRE and ASRM to deliver the guideline. The majority of the funding was provided by the Australian government, with contributions from ESHRE and ASRM. Four advisory, five project board and fifteen GDG face to face meetings occurred across Europe, USA and Australia over 15 months, and enabled guideline training, development and informed translation. Sixty prioritised clinical questions were addressed with evidence synthesis involving 40 system atic and 20 narrative reviews, generating 170 recommendations and practice points. Feedback from the thirty -seven engaged societies and their c onvened special interest groups of experts and consumers as well as public consultation have inform ed the final g uideline. Multidisciplinary international guideline development groups GDGs were convened to address each of the five key clinical areas. Expertise was sought through PCOS networks t o ensure multidisciplinary participation within each GDG . Each GDG comprised a chair, professional group members with specific expertise in PCOS and the clinical area of interest (i.e. psychologists/psychiatrist in the emotional wellbeing GDG ), a consumer representative , evidence officers and representative to consider cultural aspects. See Appendix III . Co-opted experts were also included as needed. Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 2 Consumer participation In the development of this guideline, we have sought not only to inform or consult with women aff ected by PCOS, but to partner with and empower women with PCOS, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of this work. We have engaged with international consumer bodies in PCOS and infertility to this end. This included Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association Aus tralia (POSAA) (Australia), Verity (United Kingdom), PCOS Challenge (United States), RESOLVE : The National Fertility Association (United States), and Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority (VARTA) (Australia) , who were actively engaged through out the guideline process. An international survey was completed by 1800 women and focus groups were held with women with PCOS to inform gaps in care, guideline priority questions, prioritised outcomes for each intervention and to inform guideline translat ion, education and support needs and preferred methods of delivery. Consumer representatives participated in the development of the Centre for Research Excellence funding submission, in the guideline Project Board, International consumer advisory group and in the GDGs . Consumers have been involved in every stage, including development of the guideline scope, public consultation on the scope and developing and refining the clinical questions and recommendations as part of the GDGs . Consumer representatives are also extensively engaged and are partnering in the guideline translation activities. Indigenous representation and CALD (culturally and linguistically diverse) Ethnicity and culture was considered when making all recommendations. Indigenous representat ion was present on the PCOS Australian Alliance Strategic Advisory Group (a member of the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association) and the GDGs comprised clinicians with experience working with CALD and Indigenous communities. The translation of the guid eline allows for adaptions on cultural and ethnicity grounds. Conflict of interest and confidentiality Conflict of interest has been proactively managed throughout the guideline development process as outlined in NHMRC standards and procedures for externally developed guidelines [1]. All members of the GDGs have provided signed declarations of interest and a confidentiality agreement. Additionally, declarations of interest were a standing agenda item at each mon thly meeting and GDG members were requested to detail areas for potential conflict. The process for managing conflict of interest and confidentiality and recorded declarations can be provided on request (MCHRI -PCOS -Guideline -Group -l@monash.edu ). Training of GDGs in evidence review and guideline development methods All GDG members attended a workshop, where the methods of reviewing evidence and guideline development were described in detail. The purpose of this workshop was to familiarise the chairs and GDG members with: the process of guideline development overall the process of identifying, appraising and synthesising evidence in a format to facilitate the formulation of evidence -based recomme ndations grading the strength of evidence and its suitability to support evidence -based recommendations when to facilitate discussion and clinical judgement to formulate clinical consensus recommendations in the absence of evidence. Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 3 Clinical question devel opment and prioritisation An International survey and Delphi exercise was conducted to develop and prioritise clinical questions to be addressed. A further prioritisation exercise was conducted within the topic specific GDGs and consumer advisory groups t o rank the importance of clinical questions to guide the evidence team and to reach consensus on which clinical questions were to be addressed by a systematic review or by narrative review. Systematic reviews were performed for highly prioritised questions and for those areas of greatest controversy . Narrative evidence reviews were completed : a) where recent or concurrent systematic reviews were being completed by GDG members that could be captured on narrative review; b) where questions were less well suited to a PICO systematic review format; c) for lower prioritised questions or d) where there was insufficient evidence identified for a question where a systematic review was conducted. Forty questions were addressed by guideline systematic review s, many others by systematic reviews captured in the narrative reviews and some by narrative reviews of isolated PCOS studies s upported by systematic reviews /guidelines in the general population. The clinical questions addressed by each GDG are as follows : GDG 1 - Screening, diagnostic assessment, risk assessment and life -stage At what time point after onset of menarche do irregular cycles indicate ongoing menstru al dysfunction related to PCOS?

Where evidence was inadequate only rese arch recommendations were made and are captured in a separate document. Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 6 Outcome prioritisation using the GRADE method The most relevant o utcomes were prioritised by ranking their importance by health professionals and consumers to help resolve or clarify disagreements and assist with grading the evidence. The importance of outcomes may vary across cultures and from different perspectives e.g. patients, public, health professi onals or policy -makers . Table 6 outlines the considerations when deciding importance of outcomes [2]. GDG members , includ ing consumers also participated in this exercise. Table 6: Steps for considering the relative importance of outcomes What Why How Evidence Assessment and prioritisation of outcomes as critical, important but not critical, or low importance. Requires judgement of the balance between the desirable and undesirable health outcomes of an intervention. To focus attention on those outcomes that are considered most important when conducting evidence review and to resolve or clarify disagreements. To support making a recommendation and to determine the strength of the recommendation. Scoping the relevant literature. By asking GDG members, including consumers to prioritise outcomes in light of the considerations for 'what' and 'why'. These judgments are ideal ly informed by a systematic review of the literature focusing on what the target population considers as critical or important outcomes for decision - making. Prior knowledge of the research evidence through systematic reviews; and information about values , preferences or utilities has been explored in the original guideline, that was systematic in nature, will inform this process. Additionally, the collective experience of the GDG members, including consumers, will be used using transparent methods for documenting and considering them, such as a Delphi process. To facilitate ranking of outcomes according to their importance the f ollowing scale w as be used [2]. Rating scale: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 of least importance of most importance Of limited importance for making a decision (not included in evidence profile) Important, but not critical for making a decision (included in evidence profile) Critical for making a decision (included in evidence profile) Outcomes considered critical (rated 7 -9) most greatly influence d a recommendation and the overall quality of evidence supporting the recommendation and the st rength of the recommendation. Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 7 Adaptation of existing evidence -based guidelines Given the time and resource -intensive nature of guideline development, existing h igh quality evidence -based guidelines that address the clinical questions and PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) of interest should be sought for adaptation before starting a new one. Apart from the original Australian guideline, to date no international PCOS guideline covering all health aspects related to the syndrome is available. The evidence -based sections of the WHO guideline, supported by this evidence synthesis team is aligned with the scope here, yet is now out of date. The NICE guideline is limited in scope and is not available electronically outside the UK. It too is adapted from the 2011 Australian guideline. Professional society positions statements or clinical practice guidelines are more limited in scope, do not follow AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) process, involve more limited expertise and geographical representation and are often conflicting in recommendations. Here we have updated and expanded the scope and evidence contained in the 2011 Australian guideline and, where appropriate methods have been applied, integrated the WHO guideline. Evidence reviews to answer the clinical questions Evidence reviews were conducted for each clinical question and from the evidence reviews , the GDGs were able to develop guideline recommendations. The evidence reviews for each question can be found in the supp lementary Technical report . The link s between the body of evidence, the clinical need for the question and the clinical impact of the resulting recommendation(s), including potential changes in usual care and the way care is organised, acceptability, feasibility and resource implications are clearly explained in the accompanying GRADE evidence to decision framework supporting the recommendation. Selection criteria The PICO framework was used by the GDGs to explore the components of each clinical question and finalise the selection criteria for each question. These components were used to include and exclude studies in the evidence review. Detai ls of the selection criteria for each question can be found in the supplementary Technical report . The highest form of evidence, the most current (within 5 years), comprehensive (with the most outcomes relevant to PICO) and high quality systematic review t hat meets our benchmark criteria (see table 7) and meets the selection criteria , was used to inform a recommendation. Additional systematic reviews that met benchmark and selection criteria were used if it report ed additional outcomes relevant to the PICO, that were not addressed in the first, most comprehensive systematic review. Additional randomised controlled trials ( RCT(s) ) that met the selection criteria and were not included in the systematic reviews were also used. Where a systematic review me t the benchmark criteria but did not meet the selection criteria, or synthesised studies that did not meet out selection criteria , the risk of bias appraisals from that systematic review were adopted. Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 8 Table 7. Benchmark criteria for a systematic review to be included: 1) Must have completed a search in at least Medline and another relevant database; 2) Must have listed key search terms; 3) Must have listed selection criteria; 4) Must have used an appropriate framework to assess risk of bias/quality ap praisal; and 5) Where the evidence is sought for an intervention question and a systematic review has included non - RCTs, the analysis must be subgrouped by RCTs to be eligible for inclusion. Systematic search for evidence A broad -ranging systematic search for terms related to PCOS was developed by the evidence team. This PCOS search string was then combined with specific searches tailored for each clinical question according to the PICO developed by the GDG . The search terms used to identify studies addressing the population of interest ( i.e. women with PCOS) w ere only limited to PCOS terms. Therefore , studies addressing women with PCOS in all cultural, geographical and socioeconomic backgrounds and settings would be identified by the search. Further more, while a formal analysis of cost effectiveness was not performed in this guideline, any study addressing a clinical question that also reported on cost effectiveness would be captured and addressed in the GRADE process. The search strategy was limited to English language articles and limits on year of publication are specified in the PICO for each clinical question according to whether an update search was conducted or in cases where interventions were only available from a particular point in time . The following electronic databases were employed to identify relevant literature: CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) The Cochrane Library Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews) Database of Abstracts of Rev iews of Effects (Other Reviews) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials) Cochrane Database of Methodology Reviews (Methods Reviews) The Cochrane Methodology Register (Methods Studies) Health Technology Assessment Database (Technology Assessments) NHS Economic Evaluation Database (Economic Evaluations) EMBASE EBM Reviews (OVID) Medline (OVID) Medline in -process and other non -indexed citations (OVID) PsycI NFO (OVID) The bibliographies of relevant studies identified by the sea rch strategy and relevant reviews/meta -analysis were also searched for identification of additional studies. Details of the search strategies and search results for each evidence review can be found in the supplementary Technical report . Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 9 Inclusion of studies To determine the literature to be assessed further, a reviewer scanned the titles, abstract s and keywords of every record retrieved by the search strategy. Full articles were retrieved for further assessment if the information given suggested that the study met the selection criteria. Studies were selected by one reviewer in consultation with colleagues , using the PICO selection criteria established a priori . Where there was any doubt regarding these criteria from the information given in the titl e and abstract, the full article was retrieved for clarification. Appraisal of the methodological quality/risk of bias of the evidence Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using criteria developed a priori according to study design ( i.e. quality appraisal criteria used for an RCT is different to that used for a cohort study) [7]. Individual quality items were investigated using a descriptive component approach. Any disagreement or uncertainty was resolved by discussion among the GDG to reach a consensus . Using this approach, each study was allocated a risk of bias rating ( see Table 8). Quality appraisal tables for each evidence review can be found in the supporting document titled Technical report . Table 8. Risk of bias ratings [7] Rating Description Low All of the criteria have been fulfilled or where criteria have not been fulfilled it is very unlikely the conclusions of the study would be affected. Moderate Some of the criteria have been fulfilled and those criteria that have not been fulfilled may affect the conclusions of the study. High Few or no criteria fulfilled or the conclusions of the study are likely or very likely to be affected. Insufficient information Not enough information provided on methodological quality to be able to determine risk of bias. Data extraction Data, according to the selection criteria, were extracted from included studies using a specially developed data extraction form [7]. Information was collected on general details (title, authors, reference/source, country, year of publication, setting), participants (age, sex, inclusion/exclusion criteria, withdrawals/losses to follow -up, subgroups), results (point estimates and measures of variability, frequency counts for dichotomous variables, number of participants, intention -to-treat analysis) and validity results. Data extraction tables for each evidence review can be found in the supporting Technical report . Data synthesis In order to make a summary statement about the effect of the intervention and thus inform evidence -based recommendations, d ata were presented qualitatively by presenting the findings narratively in tables or discussion text; or quantitatively, using statis tical methods such as meta -analyses. A meta -analysis is a statistical technique for combining (pooling) the results of a number of studies, that report data for the same outcome for the same intervention, to produce a summary statistic to represent the ef fect of one intervention compared to another. When high -quality trials are used, a meta -analysis summary statistic can be more powerful than an individual study to confirm or refute effectiveness of an intervention and thus to Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 10 inform an evidence -based reco mmendation. Data were summarised statistically using meta -analyses if data were available, sufficiently homogenous, and of sufficient quality. Clinical homogeneity was satisfied when participants, interventions, outcome measures and timing of outcome meas urement were considered to be similar. The Review Manager 5.3 software was used for meta -analyses. Where appropriate, subgroup analysis was conducted according to factors that may cause variations in outcomes , are likely to be a confounder , or may change the way the treatment works e.g. age, subtype or duration of treatment. These can be found in the supporting Technical report . Quality (certainty) of the body of evidence using GRADE evidence profiles A GRADE evidence profile was prepared for each compari son within each clinical question addressed by a systematic review. For each prioritised outcome, a certainty rating was documented with consideration of the following: information about the number and design of studies addressing the outcome; and judgments about the quality of the studies and/or synthesised evidence, such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and any other considerations that may influence the quality of the evidence. The definitions of these factors are descri bed below : overall quality of evidence rating using the judgments made above (see ratings in table 9); key statistical data; and classification of the importance of the outcome. The certainty of evidence reflects the extent to which our confidence in an estimate of the effect is adequate to support a particular recommendation [2]. Although the quality of evidence represents a continuum, the GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades (adapted from GRADE [2]). Table 9. Quality of evidence High We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate o We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different . Low oo Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substan tially different from the estimate of the effect. Very Low ooo We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect . GRADE note that the q uality of evidence is a conti nuum; any discrete categorisation involves some degree of arbitrariness. Nevertheless, advantages of simplicity, transparency, and vividness outweigh these limitations [2]. Evidence profiles can be found in the Technical report . Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 11 Formulation of recommendations using the GRADE evidence to decision framework The Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework was used to document the judgments and decisions using the GRADE method for development of evidence -based recommendations. The framework prompts transparent documentation and discussion of decisions through assessment of the evidence, clinical expertise and patie nt preference for factors including: desirable and undesirable effects of the intervention; certainty of the evidence; values associated with the recommended intervention; balance of considerations; monitoring and evaluation; and research priorities. Using the framework, e ach of the evidence -based and consensus recommendations are given an overall grading of conditional or strong [2]. Clinical practice points have also been includ ed, where important issues (such as safety, side effects or risks) arose from discussion of evidence -based or clinical consensus recommendations. Table 10. Recommendation types EBR Evidence sufficient to inform an evidence -based recommendation (EBR) CCR In the absence of adequate evidence in PCOS, a clinical consensus recommendation (CCR) was made CPP Evidence not sought. A clinical practice point (CPP) was made where important issues arose from discussion of evidence -based or clinical consensus recommendations The strength of the recommendations can be identified throughout the guideline by the following (adapted from ESHRE ma nual for guideline development [3] and the GRADE approach [2]): Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 12 Table 11: Strength of recommendations (adapted from GRADE [2] and ESHRE Manual [3]) Target group Strong recommendati ons* Conditional (weak) recommendations for the option (test or treatment) Conditional (weak) recommendatio n for either the option or the comparison Research only recommendations Clinical practice points (CPP)** Consumers Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not . The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but some would not. There is considerable lack of clarity over whether the majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action or not . The test or intervention should only be considered by patients and clinicians within the setting of a research trial for which appropriate approvals and safety precautions have been established . Clinicians, patients and policy makers are informed on the clinical implications relevant to implementa tion of recommend ations . Health Professionals Most patients should receive the recommended course of action. Recognise that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that greater effort is needed with individuals to arrive at management decisions consistent with values and preferences. Decision aids and shared decision making are important here. The test or intervention should only be considered by patients and clinicians within the setting of a research trial for which appropriate approvals and safety precautions have been established . Policy makers The recommendati on can be adopted as policy in most situations . Policy making needs to consider perspectives and involvement of diverse stakeholders . Policy decisions remain unclear . Policy makers need to be aware of the need for evidence gaps and health professional and consumer prioritised research gaps . * Strong recommendations based on high quality evidence will apply to most patients for whom these recommendations are made, but they may not apply to all patients in all conditions; no recommendation can take into account all of the often -compelling unique features of individual patients and clinical circumstances. ** A clinical practice point (CPP) is developed by the GDG to support recommendations. Advice can be provided to enhance shared decision making, and on factors to be considered in implementing a specific test or intervention Chapter 6: Guideline development methods 13 The words \"should\", \"could\" and \"should not\" do not directly reflect the strength (strong or conditional) allocated to a recommendation and are independent descriptors intended to reflect the ju dgment of the multidisciplinary GDG on the practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. Where the word \"should\" is used in the recommendations, the GDG judged that the benefits of the recommendation (whether evidence -based or clinical consensus) clearly exceed the harms, and that the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. Where the word \"could\" is used, either the quality of evidence was underpowered, or the available studies demonstrated little clear advantage of o ne approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harm was unclear. Where the words \"should not\" are used, there is either a lack of appropriate evidence, or the harms outweigh the benefits. Evidence to decision frameworks can be found in the supple mentary document titled Technical report . Each recommendation is supported by a discussion (in the chapters of this document) about the clinical need for the question, the body of evidence identified to answer the question and a clinical justification for the recommendation(s) . The GDGs acknowledge that lack of evidence is not evidence of lack of effect and ha ve attempted to reflect this in the strength of the grading given to recommendations on interventions that are not supported by evidence . In additio n, some interventions were not supported by evidence in the recommendations due to lack of evidence of effect. The GDGs acknowledge that this refers to lack of evidence of effect over placebo; that is, patients may receive some beneficial outcomes from the intervention but these do not exceed the beneficial effects that can be expected from a placebo therapy [8]. Public consultation Public and targeted consultation w ill be conducted for a period of thirty days commencing 10th February to 12th March 2018 in accordance with the legislative requirements set out in section 14A of the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 as outlined in the NHMRC standards and procedures for externally developed guidelines (2007) [1].
