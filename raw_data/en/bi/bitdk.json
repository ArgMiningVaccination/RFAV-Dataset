In healthcare, PD bridges the gap betweenwhat healthcare workers know and what they do. Healthcare workers know infection reduction protocols, but they do not always follow them. The PD approach al-lows healthcare workers to discover for themselves thebest ways to foster consistent adherence to known infec-tion prevention protocols at all times by every person whocomes in contact with patients. It also allows them toidentify barriers to adherence, and design the best way toremove these barriers. PD is based on recognition that in every community there are certain individuals whose uncommon practices orstrategies enable them to solve prevalent communityproblems better than neighbors and colleagues who haveaccess to exactly the same resources. They are the \"Posi-tive Deviants.\" PD is tailored to the specific community inwhich it is used, and it rests on the principle that solutionsalready exist within the community. The idea is to engage every person in the environment \u2014 doctors, nurses, aides, housekeepers, lab technicians, cler-ical workers, clergy, and anyone who comes in contactwith patients \u2014 and elicit their ideas for preventing infec-tion. When people discover unnoticed solutions that al-ready exist and insights that can be translated into action,they contribute to the birth of PD practices. These prac-tices can then be shared, person to person, and sharedwith others. In other words, colleagues with a commongoal invite each other to enjoy the successes they them-selves have developed and polished. 4 APIC has recently cited the addition of a cultural compo-nent to its MRSA prevention guidelines. PD can be an ef-fective behavior change process. 5 Formoreinformation,visitwww.positivedeviance.org.

To raise awareness that these infections can be acquired in any healthcare setting and increase what is expected of hospital leadership and of in-fection control programs. The goal of an effective Infection Control Program is to reduce the risk of acquisition and transmis- sion of HAIs. The new standards, now more than three years old, require that hospitals have organiza-tion-wide infection prevention and control programs and state that hospitals should assign responsibilityfor managing these programs to individuals formally qualified in infection prevention and control andepidemiology. According to JC Standard IC.7.10: \"Qualifications [for the individual(s) responsible formanaging the Infection Control Program] may be met through ...certification [such as that offered bythe Certification Board for Infection Control (CBIC)] in prevention and control of infections.\" This JointCommission endorsement of certification through CBIC serves as an incentive for infection preventionand control professionals (ICPs) to become certified and maintain certification. This Joint Commissionendorsement also provides the impetus for healthcare institutions to require certification for individualsresponsible for managing their infection prevention and control programs. This year promises to be an exciting and productive one for CBIC. Much work has already begun. During our February Board meeting we welcomed new members Barbara Russell, MPH, RN, Committee, chaired by Rita Tjoelker, MS, RN, CNS, CIC, is working on a newSelf-Assessment Recertification Examination that will be ready for those who choose to recertify in 2009.Other Board and committee work includes collaborating with APIC and AJIC on several lengthy proj- ects; one will be continued for the next three years. The three-year project is an initiative to increase the number of certified infection prevention and control professionals to at least half of the APIC membership, which is just over 11,000. Only 3,929 ICPsaround the world are currently certified. Eventually we'd like to see eligible APIC members becomeBoard Certified in infection prevention and control. The significance of the JC's endorsement and the increasing number of advantages associated with being certified in your specialty practice are two subjects I will address on June 16th at the APIC AnnualConference in Denver, Colorado. If you're not already registered for APIC's 35th Annual Educational Conference and International Meeting, June 15-19, I encourage you to do so. As a past Conference Committee Chair and someonewho attends educational meetings held by other healthcare associations, I can tell you that APIC's An-nual Meeting is not to be missed. The value of networking with your peers and hearing the most currentinformation on topics that truly interest you cannot be matched. The updates really add value to youand your professional practice because they enable you to share what you learn with others in your re-spective organizations and, perhaps, add to their efforts to prevent and control in-fections. An added benefit of this conference is that some of the informationprovided may contribute to your success with the Certification Exam. I hope to see you at the APIC Annual Conference and that, while there, you will stop by the CBIC booth to say hello to the Board members. Warm wishes for the remaining year ahead.
