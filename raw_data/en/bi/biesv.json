My intention is to always practice with a kind heart.\" Dr. Chen earned her Doctor of Medicine degree in Acupuncture at China's Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and teaching hospital, where she taught and practiced for many years. At NUNM, she teaches acupuncture and moxibustion, and supervises observers and interns on teaching shifts at the NUNM Clinic. Dr. Chen treats a wide variety of conditions at NUNM's clinics and in her private practice at Kwan-Yin Healing Arts Center using acupuncture, moxibustion, herbs, diet, qigong and Chinese massage.
