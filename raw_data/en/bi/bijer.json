Key points: - An anti-vaccination film was screened in Melbourne clinic in 2016 - The chiropractor has publicly questioned the safety of vaccines, an area he doesn't specialise in - The comments were not related to COVID-19 vaccinations Medical regulators have welcomed the suspension of Simon Floreani for professional misconduct, bringing a two-year court process to an end. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) heard Dr Floreani permitted the screening of the movie Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe at his Melbourne practice in 2016. He also participated in an interview, which was later published on YouTube, titled \"Nazi vaccine regime in Australia\". While discussing vaccines in the video, Dr Floreani said \"the evidence is not there to suggest that people are safe and our kids are safe\". \"Parents are trusting their gut and saying, 'I don't want to do this. I can't inject this poison in my baby's body and be OK with that',\" Dr Floreani said. Dr Floreani was referred to VCAT by the chiropractic regulator, with the tribunal finding the statements he made were \"flawed, inaccurate and dangerous\". The tribunal noted Dr Floreani's comments were not linked to the current pandemic or COVID-19 vaccines. \"While no individual patient has been shown to have been harmed by Dr Floreani's conduct, there is potential for significant harm to the community when false claims are made which can directly impact on public health,\" the tribunal found. Dr Floreani was suspended from practising for six months and several conditions were placed on his registration. They included not displaying anti-vaccination material and not making public comments discouraging vaccinations. Dr Floreani has previously held senior positions within his industry, serving as director and president of the Australian Chiropractors Association. In 2019, he was criticised by surgeons and cautioned by the chiropractic board for promoting the practice of cracking the backs of babies who were suffering from conditions including colic, asthma and cerebral palsy.
