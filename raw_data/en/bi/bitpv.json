This review analyses medically attended infectious events following parenteral vaccination in terms of their microbiological aetiology and pathogenesis. Like 'clean' surgical site infections, the major pathogens responsible for these events were Staphylococcal species, implicating endogenous con-tamination as a significant source of infection. As 70% isopropyl alcohol swabbing has been shown to effectively disinfect the skin, it would be medico-legally difficult to defend a case of sepsis with the omission of skin disinfection unless the very low risk of this event was adequately explained to the patient and documented prior to vaccination. There was a significant cost-benefit for skin disinfection and cellulitis. Skin disinfection in the context of parenteral vaccination represents a new paradigm of medical practice; the use of a low cost intervention to prevent an event of very low prevalence but of significant cost. Introduction Skin disinfection [1](#cit0001) has been shown to significantly reduce surgical wound infection, [2](#cit0002) infection associated with vascular catheters, [3](#cit0003) blood cultures [4](#cit0004) collection of blood components [5](#cit0005) and yet is not routinely recommended prior to parenteral administration of vaccines and other therapeutic agents. This procedure is not addressed in the National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) guidelines from Argentina, [6](#cit0006) Canada, [7](#cit0007) Dubai, [8](#cit0008) India, [9](#cit0009) Sri lanka [10](#cit0010) and USA [11](#cit0011); is considered unnecessary in Australia [12](#cit0012) and the UK [13](#cit0013); if used in Ireland [14](#cit0014) and New Zealand, [15](#cit0015) the skin site should be allowed to dry for 30 seconds and 2 minutes after alcohol swabbing respectively, while in Brazil [16](#cit0016) the skin should be cleaned for 30 seconds and allowed to dry for 30 seconds. There is very limited evidence for the omission of skin disinfection prior to parenteral injection. Hutin et al [17](#cit0017) provides data from 6 small studies with insulin (n = 176) in 2 retrospective and 4 retrospective studies, 16/21 case reports where exogenous sources of infection were implicated and an experimental study [18](#cit0018) involving introduction of coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus into the skin of 26 young healthy adults. Del Mar et al [19](#cit0019) reported 3 very small randomized trials, 2 venous access studies (Sutton et al, [20](#cit0020) n = 194 and Grabe et al, [21](#cit0021) n = 187) and one small insulin site comparative study (Koivisto & Felig, [22](#cit0022) n = 13). It is noteworthy that Del Mar et al [19](#cit0019) made recommendation about skin disinfection prior to intramuscular injection yet none of their collated studies involved this route of administration. Clearly, accepting these limited data is supporting the null hypothesis that there is no difference between skin disinfection and no skin disinfection in terms of sepsis post parenteral injection is likely to be a type II error. [23](#cit0023) 70% isopropyl alcohol swabbing has been shown to effectively disinfect the skin. Sherman et al [24](#cit0024) reported it decreased the proportion of contaminants (odds ratio 21, 95% CI 3.1-142.2), with 20 of 26 patients who were initially culture positive being culture negative after disinfection. One patient remained culture positive despite disinfection. Reichel et al [25](#cit0025) observed that disinfection depended on skin site (lumbar area 81-90%, abdomen 57-82%, upper back 55-60% and forehead 32-34%) but was not time dependent with 3 and 4 minutes not being significantly better than 2 minutes. Khawaja et al [26](#cit0026) concluded that skin disinfection was unnecessary to prevent skin sepsis in a small study (n = 51) where a 47% reduction in colony forming units was found with cultures taken prior to the skin being swabbed for 30 seconds with a drying time of 30 seconds and post injection at the prepared site. Medically attended infectious events [27](#cit0027) following parenteral vaccination range from any condition for which medical attention is sought to more serious adverse events resulting in hospitalisation, persistent or significant disability and death. Due to their more significant nature, they are likely to be brought to the attention of healthcare workers who report them as case reports and/or to vaccine surveillance programs. However due to their method of reporting [28](#cit0028) there is likely to be a bias toward under-reporting of less severe events like cellulitis, often treated on an outpatient basis without probable report. In this review, medically attended infectious events data following parenteral vaccination were collated with a view to assessing the role of skin contamination in the microbiological aetiology and pathogenesis of sepsis following vaccination. Results Medically attended infectious events following parenteral vaccination can be subdivided into 2 groups: - Syndromes (cellulitis, infectious abscess, Systemic Syndromes (bacteraemia and sepsis, septic [toxic] shock syndrome) often complicating local syndromes. Clinical syndrome reports were collated only for healthy patients with case reports with overlapping syndromes entered only once as the most significant syndrome. Localized clinical syndromes Cellulitis Cellulitis is the most common infectious event following parenteral administration of vaccines. It has been defined [29](#cit0029) by the Brighton Collaborative Local Reaction Working Group as \"an acute, infectious and expanding inflammatory condition of the skin.\" Level 1a of diagnostic certainty - includes at least 3 of the following signs/symptoms: localized pain or tenderness (pain to touch) erythema, induration or swelling and warmth AND reaction at the injection site and laboratory confirmation by culture. Level 2 of diagnostic certainty - at least 3 of the signs/symptoms for level 1a and reaction at the injection site and diagnosed by a qualified healthcare provider. Exclusion criteria - spontaneous, rapid resolution and fluctuance. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Scheme (VAERS) database Search of the VAERS database for cellulitis codes listed in the methods section, retrieved 5 cases of cellulitis satisfying the Level 1a of diagnostic certainty, 4 due to staphylococcal species (1 MRSA) and 1 due to mixed |F/53||Influenza (seasonal)(Afluria\u00ae)||Site: swelling, pain, rednessCulture: Strep/Staph positive| 576 entries from the VAERS database satisfied the Level 2 of diagnostic certainty (major vaccines; combination 179, pneumococcal 166, varicella 90, DTPa 64 and influenza vaccine 41). The rate of hospitalization for cellulitis in these VAERS patients was 16.2% which is much greater than rates observed n other studies [30,31](#cit0030) and presumably reflects a bias to reporting more severe reactions in passive surveillance systems like the VAERS. Goettsch et al., [30](#cit0030) using data from the National Morbidity Registration in the Netherlands, estimated that 7% of all patients with bacterial cellulitis and erysipelas of the leg required hospitalization while McCall et al [31](#cit0031) noted a 4% admission rate for cellulitis in Medicare + Choice (M + C) enrolees in the USA. Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) program Review of studies drawn from data collected through the Vaccine Safety Datalink program, [32](#cit0032) an active collaboration between a number of health maintenance organisations and the National Immunization Program of the Center for Diseases Control, also gave reports of vaccine related cellulitis. Improved diagnostic certainty of these data was made by chart review and only studies with this level of analysis were included in this review. In 5 studies, 288 cases of cellulitis were reported ( [37](#cit0037) Other vaccine surveillance programs Two reports of injection site cellulitis have been reported for influenza vaccines by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program [38](#cit0038) and the Korean National Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System. [37](#cit0037) Choe et al. [38](#cit0038) reported cellulitis in 7/45 vaccine recipients with serious adverse events following administration of trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine over the period 2003-2010, with 2 satisfying the level 1 and 5, the level 2 of diagnostic certainty. Kim et al [39](#cit0039) reported an 8 y old male who developed cellulitis following injection of a novel influenza A (H1N1) vaccine. In the Italian region of Veneto, 13 patients were reported [40](#cit0040) as having cellulitis as a serious event following vaccination during the period 1992-2008. In the Canadian Province of Ontario, 19 cases of cellulitis were reported [41](#cit0041) in recipients of DTaP-IPV over the period 2009-2013. Post-marketing vaccine safety studies Schmidt et al [42](#cit0042) reported 36 cases of cellulitis in a retrospective study in Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) clinics, 7/13,210 patients who received 2 doses of an inactivated, trivalent influenza vaccine within 28 days and 29/59,905 patients who received a single dose of this vaccine. Burwen et al [43](#cit0043) reported 42 cases of cellulitis/abscess (ICD-9-CM code 682.3) requiring hospital admission in a retrospective study of Medicare vaccination data. Case reports of cellulitis Twenty-three reports of vaccine related cellulitis have been made in 6 studies ( in adults [51](#cit0051) and trivalent inactivated influenza in children aged 24-59 months, relative of 1.30 (95%CI 1.18-1.44) and (95% CI 0.36 - 29.70) were reported for cellulitis and infection and cellulitis and skin reaction respectively. Also in a study [53](#cit0053) of emergency department visits and hospital admission following quadrivalent human papilloma vaccines, vaccination odds ratio for skin infection days 1 to 14 post vaccination was 1.8 (95% CI 1.3-24). However in those 3 studies the number of patients satisfying the case definitions for cellulitis are unknown. Infectious abscess The Brighton Collaboration Local Reaction Working Group level 1 of diagnostic certainty for abscess of infectious aetiology requires [54](#cit0054) \"spontaneous or surgical drainage of material from the mass\" and \"laboratory confirmation (Gram stain, culture or either test) of microbiological organisms with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes in material drained or aspirated from the mass.\" VAERS database infectious abscess (Level 1 of certainty and microbiology) Fifty three cases of infectious abscess with level 1 of certainty were retrieved from the VAERS database, 30 Staphylococcus aureus (including 5 MRSA, 5 coagulase negative strains), 6 group A (GAS) Streptococcus, 4 mixed growth (Staphylococcus/Streptococcus), 3 Serratia Marcescens, 2 acid fast bacillus and 1 of Streptococcus viridans, Haemophilus and flora. The vaccines involved were Combination 18, DTP 10, influenza 7, Hepatitis B 5, TD/TT 5, pneumococcal 3, DTaP 2, Hepatitis A 2 and DaTP - IPV/Hib/Hepatitis B 1. Published reports of infectious abscess formation Mycobacteral infection (254/307) accounted for the majority of infectious abscess formation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (167 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae Mycobacterium (40 Oka and Sato [55](#cit0055) and Tamura et al [56](#cit0056) reported 62 and 102 cases of cutaneous Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection following vaccination with pertussis and typhoid vaccines respectively. Although the role of infected vaccinators is uncertain, the potential for needle contamination as the source of these infections is supported [57](#cit0057) by a recent outbreak of Mycobacterium tuberculosis following acupuncture in which failure to disinfect needles was implicated. Table cutaneous tuberculosis (PCTB) caused by M. tuberculosisc ontamination of the needle could not be excluded. M. fortuitum and M. chelonae are rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) with contaminated tap water considered to be major reservoir of these pathogens. [61](#cit0061) This source is more likely to explain the 47 cases reported by Borghans & Stanford, [62](#cit0062) than the contamination of a number of vials with the same mycobacterial strain over a 6 month period. Similarly, this source could explain the 40 cases of M. fortuitum reported by Owen et al. [63](#cit0063) Exogenous source of infection also accounted for infectious abscess formation in another 43 cases (7 contaminated vaccinator, 4 Group A Streptococcus [GAS] [64](#cit0064) and 3 the Panton-Valentine-Leukocidin and contaminated multi-dose vials (9 children Colorado, [66](#cit0066) 12 children Georgia and 7 children Oklahoma [67](#cit0067) and 7 children Indiana [68](#cit0068)). In 10 cases, (8 Singapore, [69](#cit0069) 1 Turkey [70](#cit0070) and 1 USA [71](#cit0071)) the source of infection was not identified. Abscesses following vaccination have been reported in clinical trials, number in parenthesis, from Niger [72](#cit0072) (5), Burkina Faso [73,74](#cit0073) (16, 1), Kenya [75](#cit0075) (17), India76(16) and Ethiopia [77](#cit0077) (10) and also in the review by Klar et al. [41](#cit0041) However as microbiological data were not provided in these reports it is uncertain whether these were infectious or \"sterile\" abscesses. Necrotizing fasciitis Necrotizing fasciitis is an infection of the subcutaneous tissue (between the skin and the underlying muscle) which often overlaps with myconecrosis and is complicated by sepsis. [78](#cit0078) It has been classified [78](#cit0078) in 4 groups; Type 1 (polymicrobial), Type 2 (Group A Streptococcus), Clostridium fasciitis and Clostridium myonecrosis. Seven case reports of this condition have been reported post vaccination with an additional 5 cases being retrieved from the VAERS database ( [Table 5](/pmc/articles/PMC5084982/table/t0005/)). Definitive treatment of this condition involves early debridement of all necrotic tissue. a very uncommon primary infection of skeletal muscle mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. [85](#cit0085) Bae et al. [86](#cit0086) reported this condition in a 17 month old female patient due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis following Hepatitis A (Havrix\u00ae) vaccination. The case was considered to have incidentally occurred at the vaccination site \"rather than being a syringe-transmitted infection or that it was associated with BCG vaccination..\" Two cases of pyomyositis were retrieved from the VAERS database; A 17 y old female vaccinated with HPV (Gardasil\u00ae) vaccine developed an oval, tender, swollen and erythematous reaction with fever. Blood culture and aspiration culture negative, WCC 13.7\u00d7109, (80% neutrophils), CT scan showed subcutaneous infiltration, no abscess formation and MRI positive for inflammation. A 4 y old female vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax\u00ae) developed severe leg pain, fever and difficulty walking. MRI and Ultrasound revealed diffuse fasciitis with abscess formation and patient was diagnosed with cellulitis and myositis. Osteomyelitis Osteomyelitis is a not uncommon disease [87](#cit0087) of bone which can be divided into 3 categories in terms of its source of infection; haematogenous, contiguous spread with or without vascular insufficiency. Search of the VAERS database retrieved 10 cases of osteomyelitis, 9 due to contiguous spread and one due to haematogenous spread ( [Table hours after injection.| CT scan right humerus - osteomyelitis.

This condition can be divided into complicated and uncomplicated bacteraemia with the criteria for the latter [91](#cit0091) being: - Exclusion of endocarditis - No implanted prosthesis - Negative results of follow-up blood cultures drawn 2-4 d after the initial set - Defervescence within 72 hours after the initiation of effective antibiotic therapy and - No evidence of metastatic infection Uncomplicated bacteraemia A case of uncomplicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was drawn from the VAERS database. A 64 y old male given influenza (H1N1) [Sanofi\u00ae] vaccine had induration, swelling and pain at the injection site with blood culture positive for coagulase negative S. aureus. Using the 5 predictors of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) validated by Elzi et al [92](#cit0092) to differentiate between blood culture contamination and blood stream infection due to coagulase-negative S. aureus, the probability of blood stream infection in this case was 42.4%, as the while cell count was greater than 12 \u00d7 109/l. Complicated bacteraemia Complicated bacteraemia has been reported [93](#cit0093) to include a wide range of metastatic infectious syndromes al. [94](#cit0094) reported a case of multiple subcutaneous abscesses complicating Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in a 42 day old female vaccinated with BCG. One case of haematogenous osteomyelitis ( [Table 6](/pmc/articles/PMC5084982/table/t0006/)) was drawn from the VAERS database, a 73 y old female vaccinated with influenza vaccine developed L3/4 vertebral osteomyelitis. Four cases of septic arthritis ( [Table 7](/pmc/articles/PMC5084982/table/t0007/)) were drawn from the arterial stroke was also drawn from the VAERS database, a 1.1 y old male presented with febrile seizure and left arm weakness the morning after vaccination with a combination of hepatitis A (Vaqta\u00ae), 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar7\u00ae) and varicella (Varivax\u00ae) vaccines. MRI showed thrombosis of the right middle cerebral artery and blood cultures were positive for S. aureas. Fullerton et al [95](#cit0095) have concluded that \"infection may act as a trigger for childhood arterial ischaemic stroke, while routine vaccinations appear protective.\" Two other cases of complicated bacteraemia were obtained from the VAERS database. A 72 y old male vaccinated with influenza H1N1 (Novartis\u00ae) developed sudden onset of pain and swelling in right wrist and arm and left ankle had GAS cultured from the right wrist. A 0.6 y old female vaccinated with a combination of Hib and Hep B (Comvax\u00ae), DTaP meningitis. (toxic) shock syndrome Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), is characterized [96](#cit0096) by more than one of the following clinical findings: body temperature higher than 38\u00b0c, heart rate higher than 90/minute, hyperventilation evidenced by respiratory rate higher than 20/min or PaCO2 lower than 32 mm Hg or white cell count higher than 12\u00d7109/l or lower than 4\u00d7109/l. Sepsis [96](#cit0096) is defined as SIRS in the presence of infection with severe sepsis being associated with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion or hypotension and septic shock being sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Septic/Toxic shock is rarely seen following vaccination and then likely to be due to contamination of needles/syringes or vaccines or transfer of infectious agents from the vaccinator to the vaccine recipient ( Age||Vaccine||Clinical Details||Source of Infection| In total 1534 reports of sepsis following parenteral vaccination were retrieved from databases and published reports in this review with this number being dominated by cellulitis, 1011 (65.9%). Discussion \"Clean\" surgical site infections (an uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital or uninfected urinary tract is not entered) have been suggested [101](#cit0101) to be due to endogenous Staphylococcal species at the site of incision. This contention has been supported [102](#cit0102) by a study using Technetium-99 m pertechnetate labeled albumin microspheres to differentiate between surgeon and patient derived infection. Staphylococcal species infection prevalence at \"clean\" surgical sites varies from 54.8% (orthopaedic surgery), [103](#cit0103) 67.3% (superficial site, open heart surgery) [104](#cit0104) to 87.9% (post arthroscopy) [105](#cit0105) with the latter authors concluding that \"their predominance supports the need for careful skin preparation and sterile technique when performing arthroscopy.\" Similarly in this review, Staphylococcal species were identified in 59/92 (64.1%) cases, when suspected/proven cases due This implicates endogenous contamination as a significant source of infection during parenteral vaccination, a thesis supported by the probable/proven exogenous contamination in only 421 of the 1534 (27.4%) of the medically attended infectious events collated in this review. Consequently it would be difficult to defend [106](#cit0106) a case of sepsis if skin preparation was omitted unless the risk of this very low prevalence event was adequately explained to the patient and documented prior to vaccine administration. Cellulitis, a syndrome of uncertain microbiological etiology, [107](#cit0107) was the major event post parenteral vaccination in this review, 1011/1534 (65.9%). In a review [108](#cit0108) of prospective and retrospective laboratory studies of the 16% of patients with positive needle aspirate and/or punch biopsy cultures from intact skin, the ratio of Staphylococcus aureus to group A streptococcus was almost 2:1 (51% : 27%). This trend was reversed when microbiological diagnosis was made with blood culture [109](#cit0109) and serology, 57-75% and 70% respectively). A Kaiser Permanente of Northern California study [111](#cit0111) of the microbiology of skin and soft tissue infections (2006-2009) held beta haemolytic streptococci accounted for 9% of cultured cellulitis and abscess. In the presented review, GAS accounted for 13.5% of cultured cellulitis and abscesses when mixed growth culture with Staphylococcus aureus were combined. Cutaneous tuberculosis can be classified [112](#cit0112) as, inoculation tuberculosis from an exogenous source, tuberculosis from an endogenous source and haematogenous tuberculosis. In this review Mycobacterial infection was dominant in the infectious abscess post vaccination group, 254/307 (82.7%), 167 cases due to Mycobacterium tuberulosis and 87 cases due to rapid growing mycobacteria (Mycobactyerium chelonae 47 and Mycobacterium fortuitum 40). These infections are \"inoculation\" tuberculosis due to inadequately sterilised needles [112](#cit0112) in the M tuberculosis group and probable use of contaminated tapwater, [61](#cit0061) the major reservoir of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) in the cluster of cases of Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium fortuitum. A cost benefit analysis for skin disinfection with 70% isopropyl alcohol swabs can be made for cellulitis from the data collated in this review. The prevalence of cellulitis in the 6 randomized, controlled trials collated [45-50](#cit0045) in this review ranged from 1/143 to 1/22,070 injections with the mean being 1/5290 injections. If the 2 extreme outliers are excluded then mean prevalence of cellulitis is 1/2383 injections. The cost per swab is 2.2 c USA [113](#cit0113) and 2.9c Australian, [115](#cit0115) As decontamination rates after swabbing with isopropyl alcohol have varied from 47% to 77%, with the former measurement made after injection, a mean effectiveness of swabbing of 66% would seem to be acceptable with this presumably translating into a similar rate of reduction of injection site cellulitis. The cost of swabbing 2383 patients is $52.5 USA and $69.1 Australia. The cost of managing a case of cellulitis includes outpatient and inpatient components. The outpatient component is $37.05 standard consultation (concession card holders) and $68 (private billing) jwith $6.10 to $10 respectively for a course of Cephalexin in Australia. In the USA the consultation charge would be $10-50 for insured patients and $50-200 for uninsured patients respectively with $7 for a course of Cephalexin. An inpatient component is added to the cost of managing cellulitis as 4-7% of these patients require hospital admission. [30,31](#cit0030) In the USA this is costed at between $6,000 to $25,000 while in Australia (2011-2012) this was costed [116](#cit0116) at an average of $3800 with a range of $1900 to $4000 for major metropolitan hospitals and at an average of $4000 (range 2700 to 5300) for major regional hospitals. If this is averaged at $4000 per admission in 2016 and the mean rate of admission for cellulitis is also averaged at 5.5% then the increment of cost added to the care of all cases of cellulitis is $220. The total cost per patient for the management of cellulitis in Australia is thus $263.15 and $298 for concession card holders and privately billed patients respectively and as 66% of patients are protected against cellulitis by swabbing the cost saved per patient is $173.6 and $196.7 for these groups. The cost-benefit for skin disinfection prevention of cellulitis is the cost saved per case ($173.6 and $196.7) minus the cost of swabbing to prevent 1 case of cellulitis (2.9 c \u00d7 2383 = $69.1), $104.5 and $127.6. This significant cost-benefit takes no account of indirect costs such as loss of income. Evidence based medicine has been championed [117](#cit0117) as a paradigm which results in improved medical practice. However, it is evident from the body of data collated in this review that very large randomized trials would be needed to adequately address the issue of skin disinfection prior to vaccine administration and the prevention of sepsis. Consequently, a new paradigm [118](#cit0118) might be evoked to cover this clinical issue, namely the use of a very low cost intervention (disposable skin swab) to prevent a very low prevalence event (sepsis related to parenteral vaccination) of high cost (medical attention including hospitalisation with morbidity/ mortality). Methods Data for this review were sought from the following databases: Medline via Ovid (1996 to present), Embase via Ovid (1980 to present, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCO (1982 to present), using search terms vaccine safety.\" Additional data were obtained by hand searching journals for \"safety data\" and \"vaccine studies/trials.\" The following journals were searched for these data from the date in parentheses to December 2015; Acta Paediatrica (1998), Acta Tropica (1989), American Journal of Medicine (1946), American Journal of Public Health (1971), American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (1998), Annals of Internal Medicine (1960), Archives of Diseases of Child Health (1926), Bio Drugs (1998), Biologicals (1990), British Medical Journal (1991), Canadian Medical Association Journal (1911), Clinical Infectious Diseases (1999), Clinical Therapeutics (1995), Clinical and Vaccine Immunology (2006), European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (1997), European Journal of Pediatrics (1997), Infection and Immunity (1970), Infection (1997), International Journal of Infectious Diseases (1996), Journal of American Medical Association (1983), Journal of Hygiene (1903), Journal of Infectious Disease (1999), Journal of Medical Microbiology (1996), Journal of Pediatrics and Childhood (1998), Journal of Pediatrics (1999), Journal of Travel Medicine (1997), Journal of Tropical Pediatrics (1996), Lancet (1990), Medical Journal of Australia (2004), New England Journal of Medicine (1993), Pediatrics (1966), Pediatric Infectious Diseases Journal (1995), Public Health (1995), Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Disease (1997), Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (1920) and Vaccine (1983).
