Chair: Jarron Saint Onge, PhD Tami G urley -Calvez, PhD D. Ellis, PhD Jessica A.R. Williams, PhD Christopher Crenner, PhD Date Defended : January 24, 2020 ii The dissertation committee for Tiffany M. Pothapragada certifies that this is the approved version of the following dissert ation: The Association Between Immunization Information Systems and Immunizations in Children 19 -35 Months of Age in the United States. Chair: Jarron Onge, only 70.4% of U.S. children ages 19 -35 months were up -to-date (UTD) for their routine series of vaccines, a rate that consistently miss es the national target of 80%. Recent evidence has demonstrated that those rates are declining . As a result o f an under -vacci nated population, vaccine preventable disease outbreaks are becoming more frequent and places vulnerable populations at risk for disease, disability, or death. Contributors to sub -optimal immunization rates include challenges in identifying vaccination nee ds, incomplete or inaccurate vaccination records, missed opportunities, and vaccine hesitancy among parents and providers. One strategy to improve immunizations in the U.S. is through the utilization of immunization informatio n systems (IIS s). Although lar ge investments into their infrastructure, implementation, and operation have led to widespread adoption of IISs by state immunization programs, research evaluating the impacts of these systems on immunizations is still in earl y stages and h as resulted in mixed findings . The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the relationship of IISs on immunizations. Using data from the National Immunization Survey, The IIS Legislative Survey, and the IIS Annual Reports (IISARs), I an alyze the asso ciation of IIS p olicies and participation on immunization status in children 19 -35 months of age. Following a three -essay format, I utilize a series of multiple logistic and linear regression models to examine the relationship between IIS participation on UTD status and i nvalid doses, and IIS policies and provider participation on state-level immunization rates. Consistent with the previous literature, my overall findings on IIS participation resulted in mixed findings. While there was little to no associat ion between IIS participation and the odds of a child completing their full vaccines series, I did find a statistically significant relationship between IIS participation and the odds of invalid doses. Further, previous iv studies found no assoc iation between mandate or cons ent policies on state -level UTD immunization rates. While supporting previous work, I also find a statistically significant interaction between mandate and consent policies as it relates to UTD rates . This work contributes to the literature by expanding wh at is known about how IIS policies and participation relate to immunization rates. These studies further highlight the dynamic but important relationships between policy, and participation by providers and parents that can inf orm future immunization improv ement strategies. v Acknowledgements I would like to acknowledge my amazing group of mentors, colleagues, family and friends.

Since the uptake of widespread vaccination, along with impr ovements in hygiene, sanitation, clean water, and antibiotics discov ery, morbidity and mortality of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) has been reduced by more than 99% for most dis eases (Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention, 1999; Roush & Murphy, 2007) . They are widely cited as one of the greatest public health achievements and cost - effective preventive health measures of the 20th century saving the U.S. an estimated $295B in direct and $1.38T in society cos ts over the same twenty -year period (Control & Prevention, 2011; Whitney et al., 2014) . In ord er to maintain the current disease reduction a nd gain ground on further reducing the incidence and burden of disease, hi gh levels of vaccination need to be sustained (Andre et al., 2008b) . U.S. immunization po licies focus primarily on childhood vaccines. Younger children are more at risk for contracting and spreading infections and for complications that can cause significant disability or death (Andre et al., 20 08a). For most vaccines, rates of childhood vaccination have been relativ ely high (Hill, Elam -Evans, Yankey, Singleton, & Kolasa, 2015) , but recent evidence over the last three years suggests that those rates are declining (Hill, Elam - Evans, Yankey, Singleton, & Kang, 2017) and c onsistently miss national immunization targets (Healthy People 2020 [Internet], Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion) . Sub - optimal rates leave un -vaccinated or under -vaccinated individuals susceptible to vaccine - preventable disease s and have spurred increases in the frequency and sizes of outbreaks in communities (Constable, Blank, & Caplan, 2014; Malone & Hinman, 2003) . 3 The contributors to lower immunization rates are well -established in th e public health literature. Inc reases in the number of vaccines needed and the changes to the immunization schedule create difficulties in tracking immunization status by parents and providers (Butte, Shaw, & Bernstein, 2001) . Tracking is further complicate d by record fragmentation and scattering (Stokle y, Rodewald, & Maes, 2001; Yusuf et al., 2002) whic h can result when a child has multiple providers or moves out of state since the U.S. lacks a universal electronic health record (Feikema, Klevens, Wa shington, Hinman, 2005) . Oftentimes, providers do not have access to a child's full vaccinat ion history which prevents determining vaccination needs while at the point of care (Gostin & Lazzarini, 1995) . Aside from electronic data factors, other reasons for low vaccination rates include increasing vaccine hesitancy by providers and parents which has increased the utilization of alternative, and unvalidated, vaccine schedules (Feemster & Offit, 2013; Offit & Moser, 2009). The failure of the U.S. to increase immunization coverage motivate d large investments into Immunization Information Systems as a stra tegy to improve rates IISs are confi dential, centralized, electronic repositories that house vaccination data and offer many features designed to improve the overall quality and delivery of vaccines . IISs were designed to assist providers, hospitals, public health officials, and other stakeh olders such as Medicaid plans (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) . They offer clinical decision support tools to assist provid ers in providing the age -appropriate vaccines using embedded algorithms ba sed on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended schedule and the patient's IIS vaccination history (Rajamani, Bieringer, & Muscoplat, 2015) . IISs also help providers im prove immunizations and quality through its Assessment, Feedback, Incentiv es, and eXchange (AFIX) program (American Immunization Registry Association, 2015) . IISs can 4 provide immunization histories directly to patients or parents that can be useful for care coordination or for proof of vaccines for school entry (Galem ore, 2011) . Several states even have policies allowing for data exchange agreements that allow IISs to share immunization data across other stakeholders (Hinman et al., 2007) and these agreements can consolidate m ultiple sources of vacci ne information to improve rates (Kempe et al., 2001) . The capabilities of IISs are designed to promote and encourage improvements in immunizations but the effectiveness of IISs in the liter ature is less clear . This is likely because individual states have a large influence over the effectiveness of their IISs. In the U.S., the Federal government makes immunization recommendations and conducts immunization surveillance nationally, but immuniz ation policies are enacted by State governments. Today, most of the operat ing IISs are operated by State immunization programs though some la rger cities and regions also operate an IIS separately from their state IIS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018b) . Policies that g overn the operation of IISs are complex in design and interpretatio n, have been described in detail elsewhere (Horlick, Beeler, & Linkins, 20 01; Martin, Lowery, Brand, Gold, & Horlick, 2015) . These policies include the type of governing authority under which states oper ate their IIS. States may have an explicit law to operate an IIS or may operate under a more general public health statute by which they extrapolate their authority as a public health interest (Horlick et al., 2001) . Additionally, these pol icies dictate the immunization entities that are mandated to report immuni zations to the IIS (if any), the type of patient consent required to include information in the IIS (opt -in, opt -out, or mandatory), and who will have access to this data (authorized access and interoperability laws). While t he laws have been described in detail in the IIS literature, there remains a gap in the research examining these laws effects on immunization rates. 5 Early research examining whether the probability that a child w as up-to-date (UTD) on all of their vaccines demonstrated no effect betwee n provider IIS participation and UTD status (Kim, Frimpong, Rivers, & Kronenfeld, 2007; Mennito & Darden, 2010) . However it is possible that IISs were not well -established at the time of the studies. Research in Au stralia demonstrated a 30% increase in overall immunization rates ten years after the implementation of an IIS (Groom et al., 2015) . Rates for individual immunizations, such as the seasonal influenza vaccine, showed that IIS utilization to conduct proactive outreach and send vaccine remi nders increased immunization rates (Bluml, Brock, Hamstra, Dombkowski, Harrington, Dong, & Clark, 2012) . It is possible that progress in improving rates with I ISs is slow and that is why previous research did not demonstrate an effect on UTD status and more time is neede d. Research so far has not looked at individual vaccine improvements for incremental progress or assessed whether IISs improve the quality of va ccines by reducing the number of inval id doses - doses that are delivered too young or too close together. Severa l studies have examined invalid doses, though these studies are also quite dated. The rate of invalid doses in U.S. children is around 10%. IISs have the capacity to forecast vaccine needs, using immunization histories housed within the IIS and ACIP recomm ended guidelines, to support providers at the point of care. Thus far, research has not examined whether IISs are effective at reducing the numb er of invalid doses. To support state immunization programs' goals for increasing immunization rates and improv ing quality using IISs, a series of Functional Standards were developed through a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC), National Center for Immu nizations and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), the Immunizations Information Systems Support Branch, IIS managers and other technical experts (Immunization Information Systems 6 Support Branch within CDC/NCIRD, 2013) . These standards promote the utilizat ion of IISs to improve immunization de livery at the point of care, maintain accurate and complete immunization r ecords while maintaining confidentiality, and working with all authorized stakeholders within the purview of state laws and statutes (Immunization Information Systems Support Bra nch within CDC/NCIRD, 2013) . These functional standards offer a framework for IISs to measure their progress and effectiveness, but to date, literature has not measured these functional standards to evaluate IISs. Research Aims Vaccines are highly effec tive at preventing disease which can c ause complications such as disability and death (Andre et al., 2008a) . Although child immunization rates are relatively high, the U.S. consistently misses its targets a nd rates show evidence of declin es (Hill et al., 2017) . These decli ning rates leave communities vulnerable, with vaccine -preventable disease outbreaks increasing in frequency and size. Since the mid -1990s, numerous investments have been put into the development of IISs to improve immu nization rates and help reduce the bur den of VPDs (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003; Hinman et al., 2007) . Although widespread adoption of IISs by states has occurred, research on their effectiveness at improving the quality and rates of vaccination are unclea r. Proponents of IISs have claimed that IISs have the capacity to improve immunization rates, but only when providers part icipate and when patient data is sent to the IIS (Clark, Cowan, & Bartlett, 2006; Freeman & D eFriese, 2003) . However, early research suggests IIS participation is not associated with improvements in completion rates for the full combined childhood vaccine series (Kim et al., 2007; Mennito & Darden, 2010) . Work from Australia suggest this change may occur over a longer period of time, and it is possible (Groom et al., 2015) . Few studies have 7 explored deeper the participation by prov iders and patients ' influences over this participation and utilization of IISs (Kim et al., 2007; Luman, McCauley, Stokl ey, Chu, & Pickering, 2002). Both provider beliefs and parental characteristics have been asso ciated with improved immunization rates (Kempe et al., 2017; Luman, McCauley, Shefer, & Chu, 2003) . And while details about IISs policies ar e available in the literature (Horlick et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2015) , a gap exists in how IIS policies affect immunizat ion rates. Further, studies on IIS utilization and effectiveness are often limited to targ eted populations, localized areas, or specific immunization needs, all of which prevents generalizability to the broader population (Groom et al., 2015) . The purpose of this disse rtation is to examine relationships between IIS policy and participation on immunizations in pre-school aged children. Throughout this dissertation, I incorporate data from the natio nal, state, provider, and aggregate individual levels to examine the assoc iation of IISs with immunizations using three sources of publicly available data from the CDC: The National Immunization Survey (NIS), the Survey of State Immunization Information System Legislation (IIS Leg), and the Immunization Information Systems Annua l Reports (IISARs). To address this overarching aim, I conducted three separate studies usin g the following research aims: Research Aim 1 : Evaluate the relationship between provider participation in an IIS and up-to- date vaccination status for the full com bined series of routine vaccines in children aged 19 -35 months in the United States . Hypothesis 1: Children whose providers participate in an IIS have a higher probability of receiv ing the full combined series of age -recommended vaccines than children who se providers do not participate in an IIS. 8 Research Aim 2: Examine the relationship between IIS utilization and invalid vaccinations in children 19 -35 months of age. Hypothesis 2: Children whose providers participate in an IIS will have fewer invalid vacci nes administered outside of the required age and interval between doses . Research Aim 3 : Analyze the relationship between mandate, consent, and vaccine forecasting as proxies for mea suring the IIS functional standards and state up -to-date immunization rate s. Hypothesis 3a: States with full reporting mandates and mandatory con sent policies will be associated with higher state UTD rates. Hypothesis 3b: States that forecasted vaccines to an electronic health record will be associated with higher state UTD rate s than states that did not forecast vaccines. Dissertation Contribution s This dissertation research adds to the growing literature on IIS evaluation by examining the relationships of IISs on vaccination status. This work contributes to the literature in th ree ways. First, it supports the previous literature in finding no effe ct of IIS participation on child UTD status but adds new data on the association between IIS participation on i nvalid doses. Second, this research aligns with previous studies on the ef fect of mandate and consent types on state immunization rates and adds new findings about the effect of an interaction between mandate type and consent. The finding that s tates with no provider mandate are associated with higher immunization rates highligh ts the importance of provider beliefs on immunizations. This dissertati on also contributes meaningful data as to the role of states influence on immunizations. States with higher odd s of child UTD and lower odds of invalid doses may have policies, programs , and resources that prioritize quality of immunizations over quantity compared with 9 states that are associated with higher odds of child UTD and higher odds of invalid doses. Finall y these studies further highlight the dynamic but important relationships between policy, and participation by providers and parents that can inf orm future immunization improvement strategies. Dissertation Organization This dissertation is organized into six chapters following a hybrid three -essay format. In Chapter 2, I presen t a review of the literature that provides background information and conceptualizes the impacts IISs have on immunizations, critiques the current research, and identifies the gaps t hat I will address in the remaining chapters. This literature chapter adds context and background that is not present in the literature sections of the three essays to help the reader understand the structure and function of IISs. In Chapters 3 -5, I presen t my three research essays examining the association of IIS participation on the up -to-date vaccination status in children 19 -35 months old (Chap ter 3), the relationship between IISs and invalid doses (Chapter 4), and lastly I evaluate the association of I IS policies and provider participation on state -level immunization rates ( Chapter 5.). I will then provide concluding remarks and future directio ns for IIS research in Chapter 6. 10 Chapter 2 Literature Review 11 Background Immunization information systems (IISs) ha ve been widely adopted to increase immunization rates, reduce record frag mentation, and improve the overall quality of vaccines. Research is needed to understand how large investments in immunization information sy stem technologies are generating improveme nts in vaccine coverage and reducing vaccine preventable diseases that ar e predicted by theory . Existing studies offer mixed evidence regarding the relationship between IISs , and vaccinations . Several studies find that IISs help improve immunization delive ry by improving immunization record keeping and increasing immunization rates through features such as clinical decision support (Bluml et al., 2017; Dayton, 2014; Groom et al., 2015; Zimmerman, Bartlett, Enger, Gos ney, & Williams, 2007) . Others fail to reject the null of no effect of IIS participation on immunizati on rates (Kim et al., 2007; Mennito & Darden, 2010) . Several gaps exist in current IIS evaluative research. Th ere is a dearth of literature on the effect s between state IIS policies o n immunization rates. Functional standards have been designed to promote the utilization of IISs to improve immunization rates and help programs measure the effectiveness of IISs, yet research on how well IISs achieve these fu nctional standards is remarkab ly absent. In the following paragraphs, I provide the background on immunization information systems and their relationship to vaccine -preventable diseases to better understand how th ey can function to improve immunization rat es and quality of vaccines administered, as well as identify gaps in the current research. Links Between Vaccinations and Vaccine -preventable Diseases Vaccinations are one of the greatest public health achievemen ts (Control & Prevention, 2011) . Widespread adoption of vaccines has led to dramatic decrea ses in morbidity and mortality 12 worldwide. Although there has been more th an a 99% decrease in disease and deaths attributable to these diseases (Roush & Murphy, 2007) . However, recent evidence sugges ts that immunization rates are declining (Hill et al., 2017) , and vaccine -preventable disease outbreaks are increasing in frequency and size (Gahr et al., 2014) . Contribu tors to these low rates include record fragmentation and incomplete vacci nation histories, the inability to determine vaccination needs, and rising prevalence of vaccine hesitancy (Larson, Jarrett, Eckersberger, Smi th, & Paterson, 2014; Stokley et al., 2001) . Currently, the ACIP recomme nds vaccines to protect child ren against 16 vaccine - preventable diseases (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2015a) . The age and timing of immunization is important to maximize the protective b enefits of vaccination. The c omplex childhood vaccination schedule increases the difficulty in tracking immunization status by providers and parents and increases the likelihood of mi ssed opportunities or receiving inappropriate doses (Feikema et al., 200 0; Luman et al., 2002) . Additionally, children frequently have multiple providers or receive immuniza tion outside of their primary care provider's office which leads to fragmented records (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003; Yusuf et al., 2002) . To increase immunization rates, it is important to have a system that can track immunizations across providers and provide real -time immunization histories (Gostin & Lazzarini, 1995) . The use of immunization information systems is one strategy that has the potential to achieve these benefits and to improve immun ization rates. Operation of IISs In the U.S., IISs are operationalized pr imarily at the state level and are governed by a variety of state laws and statutes (Martin et al., 2015) . As a result, state IISs are at var ious stages of maturation which affects how they perform and function. Al though states have varying 13 priorities, a series of functional standards guide state immunization programs on how to maximize the benefits of the IIS and provide a framework for evalua tion (Immunization Information S ystems Support B ranch within CDC/NCIRD, 2013) . Generally, there are six functional standards that IISs strive to achieve: 1. Support the delivery of clinical immunization services at the point of immunization. 2. Support the activities and requirements for publ icly-purchased vaccine, including the Vaccines For Children (VFC) and sta te purchase programs. 3. Maintain data quality (accurate, completely, timely data) on all immunization and demographic information in the IIS. 4. Preserve the integrity, security, availabil ity and privac y of all personally -identifiable health and demographic dat a in the IIS. 5. Provide immunization information to all authorized stakeholders. 6. Promote vaccine safety in public and private provider settings. Operationally, IISs contain a list of co re data elemen ts that are suggested for collection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013) . Examples of the types of data include patient -specific information (e.g. name, address, birth date, birth facil ity, demograph ics and other identifiers, historical vaccine/disease data) , vaccine -specific information (e.g. manufacturer, lot number, expiration date), and vaccine -administration information (e.g. site of delivery, date of administration, vaccine informa tion statement version number) and provider -specific information (e.g. pr ovider facility, ordering providers, administering provider) (Immunization Information Systems Support Branch within CDC/NCIRD, 2013) . The core data elements are critical for information data exchange, for example, when multiple records from different systems are being 14 merged or transfer red to a new system. The core data elements are also vital for ensuring complete and accurate records in the IIS. IISs consolidate immunization records to improve immunization rates Historically, t here has never been a standardized way to document, track, and access vaccination information in the U.S. leading to fragmented or scattered records (Yusuf et al., 2002) . Fragmentation of immunization records across multiple providers led to the admini stration of vaccines at inappropriate ages or intervals bet ween doses, extra immunizations, or allowed for completely missed opportunities for vaccination (Feikema et al., 2000; Stokley et al., 2001; Y usuf et al., 2002) and is considered a barrier to completion of the immu nization series (Klevens & Luman, 2001) . While electronic medi cal records have standardized documentation practices for vaccinations, t hey did not fix the problem of record scattering or fragmentation. Many children have multiple immunization providers (Yusuf et al., 2002) . In a rapidly changing vaccine delivery system, the likelihood of multiple providers is increasing with the abili ty to now receiv e vaccines from school settings, pharmacies, or other wellness clinics (Orenstein et al., 2005) . Additionally, Am ericans today ar e increasingly mobile thereby creat ing fragmentation of medical records if records are not migrated to the new location (Stokley et al., 2001) . In one study, 30% of children who were not up -to-date on their vaccines had changed providers since birth (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) highlighting the impact of record fragmentation on immunization rates. Today's i mmunization information systems (IISs) are co nfidential, centralized, electronic hubs that house immunization data and offer additiona l functionality to serve immunization programs (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2013) . IISs consolidate demographic 15 information and immunization records, from all sources (e.g. pharmacies, vital statis tics, etc.) while maintaining patient privacy and confidentiality (Hendrickson, Panchanathan, & Petitti, 2015; Wood, Saarlas, Inkelas, & Matyas, 1999) addressing the problem of record scattering and fragmentation. Multiple sources of vaccine information have been linked with higher accu racy of immunization histories and are more likely to result in complete records (Davidson et al., 2003; Hendrickson et al., 2015) . However, systems may not be linked to other data sources (Dayton, 2014) . Concerns over data accuracy have arisen over record duplications because of data mismatches (Davidson et al., 2003; Hendrickson et al. , 2015) . IISs rely on data submitted by partici pating providers electronically, or in some cases, by hard copy (e.g. paper records, faxed documents, etc.) (Hinman & Ross, 2010; \"Progress in development of immunization registries --United States, 1999,\" 2000) . Wh en a provider enters a dose on a patient into the EHR , that information is sent either in real -time or batched at specific times to the IIS (Martin et al., 2015) . For many IISs, this electronic linkage was unidirec tional meaning data went from EHR to IIS, but providers were not always able to retrieve the vaccine information from the IIS (Murthy, Rodgers, Pabst, Fiebelkorn, & Ng, 2017) . State -wide IISs will not completely sol ve the problem o f fragmented records since they are limited to the state where they opera te. Currently, there are no plans for a nationally linked IIS due to differences in policies and laws surrounding privacy, consent, and data collection. IISs improve rates by support ing providers at the point of care IISs can also improve rates by support ing providers at the point of care using clinical decision support tools. As IISs were further developed, a bi -directional communication pathway was created that allow ed other provide rs, health officials, or school nurses to query the system to obtain a va ccination record or retrieve a vaccine forecast that recommended vaccines that were 16 \"due\" for a specific patient (Immunization Information Systems Support Branch within CDC/NCIRD, 2013) . This enable s providers to provide appropriate vaccinations and reduces errors in vaccine administrat ion or prevent s a missed opportunity to vaccinate (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) . Due to the complexity and expanding ACI P schedule of routine vaccines, the clinical decis ion support feature helps physicians choose the appropriate vaccine at the right time for a specific patient. It has been difficult to evaluate how well these features work due to the inability to conduct evaluations at the clinical sites on how providers utilize IIS features (Groom et al., 2015) . Additionally , not every IIS has forecasting capabilities which further limits evaluation. Few studies have examined clinical decision support tools in proactive influenza campaigns and demonstrat ed improvements in immunization rates (Bluml et al., 2017; Zimmerman et al., 2007) . These studies, however, di d not look at complex vaccine series and were conducted in adult populations. In theory, by offering a c entralized hub for immunization data, public health officials, providers, and other stakeholders can actively monitor immunizations, deliver better patient care, and use the information in the IIS to improve the overall immunization program. IIS policies c an influence participation and overall immunization rates Every state tha t operates an IIS has policies that dictate the capabilities, participation, and utilization of the vaccine information. The type of authority that states use to operate an IIS vary among the states from being explicit about operating an IIS to the operati on of one under an assumption of a public health statute (Horlick et al., 2001) . In addition to the authority are policies that dictate participation in the IIS. Mandates for reporting immunizations to the IIS affect providers, pharmacies, and other facilities that administer immunizations (Centers for Disease Control & Prevent ion, 2015b; Madewell et al., 2017) . They may be full mandates that 17 apply to all facilities and all age groups, or they may specify restrictions that only apply to some facilities or providers, such as those who participate in the VFC program, or to specif ic age groups (e.g. children under 6 years, or all ages) (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2015b) . Participation also extends to those patien ts who have the ir data in an IIS which is determined often by the IIS consent policy. So me states have an explicit consent process which requires patients to actively opt -in to having their vaccines submitted to the IIS. This requires recruitment of patien ts, often by th e participating providers, who would have to educate and provide informed consent to patients prior to submitting data (Berry et al., 2013; Boom, Sahni, Nelson, Dragsbaek, & Franzini, 2010) . Other states use an imp licit consent process which is an implied consent that automatically opts patients into the IIS. They are still educated and notified of the IIS, and in some cases, are given information on how to opt -out should they wish to have their data excluded from t he IIS (Berry et al., 2013; Hedd en, Jessop, & Field, 2012) . However, there are states that mandate patient participation in an IIS with no ability to opt out with the rationale that vaccinations are a public health issue and included in statutes that govern other public health d ata in t he state. Finally, data sharing policies and interoperability are a critical component in the operation and success of an IIS. The presence of data in an IIS is not useful if there i s no access or policy for using or sharing the data with other im munizati on stakeholders (e.g. other providers who may need records) (Hendrickson et al., 2015; Hinman et al., 2007) . States determine which users can have access to the data, and what type of access they will have (read -only or capable of making changes to the information) (Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention, 2018b) . Additionally, states will sometim es have agreements with other IISs for data -sharing, but these 18 agreements are complicated by differences in confident ial data-sharing laws and privacy of health data through Health Information Portabili ty and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003; Hendrickson et al., 2015) . The policies mentioned above have been well -documented in the literature and updated over time to reflect policy changes (Hedden et al., 2 012; Horlick et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2015) , however, there has been little research about how these policies that govern the operation of an IIS affect immuniz ation rates. Madewell et. al., (2017) states that provider participation will be lower in t he presence of a reporting mandate, yet another group says that mandates are required for increasing provider participation (Groom et al., 2015) . Consent policies are a little clearer in the literature. Participation will be highe r with implicit or mandate policies and lower with explicit opt -in policies that require extra steps by the patients to opt -in (Berry et al., 2013; Boom et al., 201 0). Studies have not examined the effects of these policies on actual participation, highlighting an important gap in the literature and for policymakers considering other policy typ es for their state IISs. The gaps identified throughout this revie w serv e as the impetus for the research aims outlined in Chapter 1. This dissertation will address the IIS literature by examining the relationship between IIS participation on child UTD st atus, IIS participation on invalid doses, and IIS policies and prov ider p articipation on state UTD rates in the next three chapters. 19 Chapter 3 Immunization Information Systems' and the Association with Up -to- Date Status in U.S. Children 19 -35 Months of Age 20 Introduction Vaccines are widely accepted as safe and cost -effective st rategi es for preventing the contraction and spread of vaccine -preventable diseases (VPDs). In many cases, morbidity and mortality have been reduced by as much as 99% (Andre et al., 2008b; Roush & Murphy, 2007) , and rate s for individual vaccines have remained \" high and stable\" (Hill et al., 2015) over the last decade. However, as successful as vaccines have b een, in order to maintain the protection against VPDs, high rates of vacc ination must be sustained (Brunson, 2013) . Evidence that protection may not be at optimal levels remains present throughout the United States (Diekema, 2012) . Several recent examples of outbreaks in the U. S. have demonstrated the vulnerability of under -protected populations. Between 2001 and 2015, more than 1,789 confirmed meas les were recorded and at least 70% of those occurred in unv accinated individuals (Clemmons, & multi -state outbreak of measles origina ting in a crowded theme park in 2016 demonstrated the speed and mobility of a highly contagious infection to spread throughout an under -protected population (Chemerinsky & Goodwin, 2016) . In 88% of those confirmed cases (110/125), patients were eithe r unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status (Porteous et al., 2016) and the close contact within a crowd further increased the risk of spreading the disease. In 2017, Minnesota experienced an outbreak of measles with 75 confirmed cases including at least 20 hospitalizations (Hall et al., 2017; Minnesota Department of Health [MDH], 2018) . Ninety -five percent of those cases were in unvaccinated peop le (Hall et al., 2017) . That outbreak also demonstrated the capacity for these diseases to cause serious illness in modern day society. Outbreaks have not been str ictly due to measles; the number of pertussis cases is also increasing ev en after accounting for the natural cyclical incidence of the pertussis organism (Carrico & O'keefe, 2013; Cherry, 2012) . In 2014, California documented 10,831 cases 21 of pertussis including two infant deaths and hundreds of hospitalizations (Minnesota Department of Health [MDH], 2018 ). In these examples, most infected patients were unvac cinated, though it remains unclear how many were simply under -vaccinated , or were not able to be vaccinated, and how many infections could have been prevented. While the U.S. has been successful in achieving relatively high rates of vaccination (Hill et al., 2015) these outbreaks have b een associated in the literature with decreases in vaccination (Aloe, Kulldorff, & Bloom, 2017) and provides the impetus for further investigation into the vaccination status of the U.S. population. The U.S. national vaccine program has differen t recommendations for vaccination dependent upon age, health status, and other risk factors. Children are frequently the focus of vaccin ation efforts to increase vaccine uptake for several reasons. First, they represent a vulnerable population as their imm une systems are not fully mature (McDade, 2003) placing them at increased risk of infection and complications. Often, people with immune system defects are identified i n early childhood and represent a smaller population who should not be va ccinated with certain types of vaccines (Cooper, Pommering, & Koranyi, 2003; Rubin et al., 2013) . These children rely on herd immunity for pr otection against those diseases wher e vaccines are contraindicated. Secon d, the majority of routine childhood immunizations are given in the first three years of life and it can be challenging for parents to adhere to an increasingly complex vaccination sc hedule thus reducing the likelihood that a child receives all of the nece ssary doses for full protection (Zell, Ezzati -Rice, & Wright, 2000) . Third, when un -vaccinated children reach school -aged they may become carriers for these infections which places classmates, younger children in day cares, grandparents, and other potentially vulnera ble people at risk for contracting s erious infections (Salmon et al., 2005) . 22 The progress of the U.S. national immunization program is measured in part by estimating rates of vaccine completion (Murray & Frenk, 2000) . The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is a group of leading experts on immunizations who evaluate the scientific evidence perta ining to the safety an d effectiveness of vaccines (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC], 2016) . They release updated schedules which recommend the type, number, spacing, and ages for each dose of a vaccine that would be required for a child to be optimally protected (Ahmed, Temte, Campos -Outcalt, Sch\u00fcnemann, & ACIP Evidence Based Recommendations, 2011) . These recommend ations are available p ublicly, along with information about the vaccines themselves so that parents and providers can make informed choices. The immunization schedule represents the standard by which vaccination progress is measured. In the U.S., immuniza tion information is co llected using the National Immunization Survey (NIS ), the current gold -standard since 1994 for estimating vaccination rates (Zell et al., 2000) . This two -part survey culminates with the collection of immunization data on age -eligible children whose households were selected for participation. The information is submitted by a child's vaccination providers and , following a complex survey design, is weighted to be representative of the population of children in target age ranges (e.g., 19 -35 months, 4 -6 years, etc.). Rates derived from the NIS are used to measure progress toward achieving the Healthy People 2020 immunization objectives (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2011a) . When comparing the NIS vaccination rates published in an annual Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the U.S. consistently fails to reach the immunization targets of 90% for ind ividual vaccines and 80% for the routine full combined series by the age of three years 23 (US De partment of Health and Human Ser vices, 2011c) . This has motivated the public health community to improve the national rates. Multiple strategies have been utilized to improve vaccination rates in children since th e Healthy People initiative began publi shing immunization goals in 1979 (United States Department of Health Education Welfare, 1979) . Aggressive campaigns were created for increasing vac cine awareness, acceptance, and uptake. Programs to improve access to vac cines at lower out of pocket costs, such as the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program and a preventive health mandate in the Affordable Care Act which included vaccines at no out of poc ket costs, have helped families through out the U.S. (Koh & Sebelius, 2010; Lee et al., 2007) . Additionally, stricter requirements for school entry motivated many parents to get their children up -to-date on their vaccines (Orenstein & Hinman, 1999) . To help parents with the complicated vaccine schedule, provider -based reminder/recall systems were able to inform parents when their children were due f or a vaccination (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) . Even though efforts to improve vaccination rates have been somewhat suc cessful, progress has been attenuated b y several threats to vaccine uptak e which have simultaneously gained momentum in recent years. Currently, there is no real -time and precise method to determine vaccination rates, or gaps of unvaccinated within a commu nity which would allow public health of ficials and clinicians to target i mmunization interventions (Freeman & DeFriese , 2003) . Estimated rates are only reli able at a national level and may n ot represent the true coverage within a community and potentially increases the risk for outbreaks of VPDs in communities that are not fully protected (Luman et al., 2002) . It is important to mention these challenges that public health officials face because it helps to explain why achieving ta rget vaccination rates remains elusive. First, parental and 24 provider vacc ine hesitancy is increasing in the U.S. with many parents perceiving the risks of vaccination greater than the risk of the disease it prevents (Chatterjee & O'Keefe, 2010; Smith et al., 2011) . Though risks of contracting a VPD may be low within a person's community, the increasing mobility of society has led to an increase in outbreaks due to importation of an infection. Importation of an infection into an under -protected comm unity has the potential to be catastrophic (Boggild et al., 2010; Gushulak & MacPherson, 2004) . Second, the reduc ed incide nce rate of VPDs has led to a generation of providers' who lack experience in identifying and treating vaccine -preventable infections (Brooke s, 2017; Chatterjee & O'Keefe, 2010) . Third, safety -conscious parents co ncerned w ith the number of vaccines recommended at a single visit have sought providers willing to provide an alternative vaccination schedule, which arbitrarily spaces vaccines out o ver more time and additional visits (Offit & Moser, 2009; Pediatrics, 2012) . However, these alternative schedules only serve to delay vaccinations and the safety and effi cacy has not been supported by the literature at this time (American Academy of Pediatrics, 200 8). Finally, children are more likely to have multiple providers (National Center f or Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017; Stokley et al., 2001) , which in the absence of a universal electronic health recor d, creates the potential for fragmented vaccine records and raises questions about the true vaccination status for the child. One strategy to improve rates that is gaining national t raction are the use of Immunization Information Systems (IIS s) or immuniz ation registries. An Immunization Information System is an electronic repository that has the capability of housing all the specifics of a given vaccine dose in a population -based dat abase (Groom et al., 2015) . IISs rely on participating providers to supply vaccination data electronically . When a vaccine is given to a patie nt, the information is sent either in real-time, or batched at specific times, as an upload to the IIS (Martin et al., 2015) . 25 IISs also contain a feature which can recommend or f orecast vaccines for a specific patient, provided they are in the IIS dat abase, according to the ACIP schedule for that child's age and history of vaccination (Groom et al., 2015) . Depending on the data sharing and query capabilities of the IIS and facility, other providers, health officials, or school nurses, with consent, can query the system providing a bi -directional unified flow of vaccine information which would ideally lead to improved adherence, documentation, tracking and rates of vaccination. The real -time capability could also allow public health officials to use geographical coding to look at local ized immunization rates in specified areas for targeted interventions or outbreak investigations if data quality and assurance could be optimized. Additionally, it could potentially solve the problem of record scattering (Martin et al., 2015) since the IIS houses all vaccine information on a specific patient which was uploaded b y participating providers. This means for example , that if a child has four immunization providers and all are participating in an IIS, they would be able to receive the vaccine information from each other using a single query and without the need for thei r EMRs to be directly linked. A potential drawback remains if a child were to leave the catchment area of the IIS, which frequently happens when children move out of state. Though IIS s have been stated as a proven strategy for improving immunization rates, and large investments have been made by states' and the federal government (Freeman & DeFrie se, 2003; Rask, Wells, Kohler, Rust, & Cangialose, 2000) , there is a pau city of research regarding the effect IISs have had on immunization rates. There is currently no national IIS since immunization programs are implemented at the state level, but there are 55 IISs operating at state, local, and regional scopes (Murthy et al., 2017) . These independent IIS s can capture and coordinate records within a sta te or region but sharing information b etween these IIS s is 26 complicated by the various state laws and statutes that govern their operation (Gro om et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2015) , and thus leaves the U.S. without a linked system for vaccine tracking. The interoperability of II Ss is outside the scope of this paper and is covered elsewhere in th is dissertation. There has been little research spe cifically on the role that provider's participation in an IIS has on the impact on childhood vaccinations. The goal of this chapter is to evaluate the relationship between provider participation in an IIS and up-to-date vaccination status for the full comb ined series of routine vaccines in children aged 19 -35 months in the Unit ed States . Conceptual Framework Vaccination policies occur at the national and state -levels in the U.S., while vaccine uptake results from a series of complex and dynamic relationship s between public health entities, providers, and parents. To guide my res earch, I developed a conceptual framework (Figure 3.1) that depicts the most important relationships relevant to childhood vaccination status. In this paper, child's vaccination statu s will be measured by whether a child is fully up -to-date on the full combined series of routine vaccinat ions recommended by the ACIP which is determined at a national level in the U.S. Specifically, I am interested in the relationship between provider participation in an IIS and the likelihood that a child has received the ful l series of recommended vaccines , also known as being up -to-date (UTD). In my model, I include child characteristics as controls, as well as maternal characteristics since a child's m other is often the most influential person in vaccine decision -making, I include characteristics that are potential influencers of the mother's knowledge and behavior since this cannot be directly measured by this dataset. Finally, as my predictor of inter est, I include a variable that proxies for provider participation in an I IS. 27 Figure 3.1 Conceptual Framework for Child Vaccination Status Methods Data source . The National Immunization Survey data is coll ected through a two -phase process described in detail in the literature (Smith et al., 2001; Zell et al., 2000) and throughout this dissertation . The first phase is intended to identify households with children in the targeted age range of 19 -35 mont hs during the 2016 calendar year. The NIS uses random -digit dialing survey (RDD) and a dual-frame design that encompasses sampling techniques for both telephone landlines and mobile numbers due to the decrease utilizatio n of household landlines. During the first phase, demographic information and some vaccine information is collected from the person in the household most knowledgeable about vaccines for the child - typically a parent or guardian; most frequently the mother is the respondent (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . During th is phase, the parent/guardian is ask ed to identify all the child's immuni zation providers and consent is obtained to contact those providers and request the immunization records. 28 The second phase of the NIS, the provider record check study, a survey is mai led to all of the identified provide rs for the eligible child(ren) identi fied in phase I. Providers are asked to list all vaccines in a child's record, type, and date given so that an age for each dose can be calculated. Study population . Children ages 19 to 35 months of age are included in the 2016 National Immunization Surve y data set in the fifty states and Washington, D.C. I exclude Puerto Rico and other territories since I am interested in understanding the effect of participation in IIS within the st ates and information about how IIS o perate in Puerto Rico, if any, is not within the scope of this research. The 2016 NIS data set include s 28,296 children with a completed household interview. Of those children, and excluding Puerto Rico, 14,988 have adeq uate provider data about the immuniz ations administered and are retained in the dataset. Children who are unvaccinated are also considered to have adequate provider data if a provider is identified by the parents and the provider responded with \"child has received no vaccines\". The sample wa s further reduced to exclude children who are missing values for the registry variable (N = 237) for a final sample size of 14,751 (Fig 3.2). 29 Figure 3.2 Study sample usi ng the 2016 National Immunization Survey Design . In this study, I analyz e the relationship between the up -to-date vaccination status and whether the provider reported a participant child's vaccination data to an IIS. I conduct a secondary analysis using t he 2016 NIS. Survey w eights (Dual -Frame RDD weights) are utilized for the summary statistics and Chi -squared analyses to examine bi -variate relationships. Provider weights are suggested in the NIS Data User Guide for conducting immunization assessments on children with adequat e provider data and are utilized in the regression a nalyses (National Cente r for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . The complex survey d esign makes the dataset representative of the U.S. population of 19 -35 months old children. Lastly, to examine the effect of registry participation on UTD status, I use a logistic reg ression model that is guided by the conceptual framework. Dependent variable. For this analysis, the dependent variable is a dichotomous up -to- date (UTD) indicator for whether a child received the full combined series of ACIP routine ly 30 recommended vaccine s. This series includ es 4 DTaP, 3 Polio, 1 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 HepB, 1 Var, and 4 PCV doses by 35 months of age (Hill et al., 2015) , also known as the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series , hereafter referred to as the full combined series. I examine the full series of routinely recommended vaccines since it is the most representative of a child's overall protection against vaccine preventable diseases and is the series recommended for school entry. Independent variables . The independent variable of interest is whether a child's data was submitted to a regist ry or IIS. This data is collected in response to a question on the provider record check survey in phase II of the NIS and is proxying for provider participation in an IIS o r registry . This categorical variable is re-coded as No Participation if the child is recorded as \"None\" of the child's providers submitted the immunization information to an IIS, Any Participation if the child is recorded as having \"Some but possibly or d efinitely not all\", or \"All of the providers\" submitted to an IIS , and Unknown Part icipation for children whose p roviders marked \"Unknown\" when asked if child's records were submitted to an IIS. Provider characteristics. This dataset does not capture much informati on about the provider, however, the type of provider(s) a child has (e.g. All public, All private, All hospital) is included and is used to proxy for provider's beliefs since providers choose their type of practice which is potentiall y influenced by their beliefs. In the NIS, provider type is aggregated at the child level, howe ver, making analyses of individual providers not possible . State -level influence . Current state of residence is included to help control for state -level immuniz ation policies. There are currently no national laws, however, the ACIP makes national recommen dations which are then carried out by state immunization programs. These immunization policies also affect state -run IIS and may influence provider behavior. Additionally, I include a variable that assesses mobility measured by whether a child currently 31 lives in a different state from where they were born to adjust for state selection effects of vaccination history Maternal characteristics . Previous literature on vaccination behaviors suggests that mothers are the most influential person in childhood vaccin ation decisions (Luman et al., 2003); their attitudes toward vaccination were significantly predictive of infant vaccination status (Fadel et al., 2017) . There is no direct way to measure maternal beliefs and behavior, so I proxied for it in several ways. I select variables that have been identified in the literatu re as influential on a mother's vaccine knowledge and decision -making (Luman et al., 2003) including: maternal age, maternal ed ucation, a household income and poverty variable, and whether a child received a birth dose of Hep B vaccine. Younger maternal age has been associated with l ower child vaccination rates (Luman et al., 2003) , so controlling for maternal age ( 29 yrs or > 29 yrs) is important when evaluating the effect of IIS on rates. The effect of maternal education is less clear on child vaccination status. For example, older studies have shown that advanced maternal educa tion is associated with higher rates of childhood vac cinations (Luman et al., 2003) , however, more rec ent studies have shown there are clusters of individu als with graduate or professional school education who are less accepting of vaccines (Healy & Pickering, 2011) . Therefore, I incl ude maternal education (< 12yrs, 12 yrs, > 12 yrs - non-college grad, College Grad) as a control to help improve the fit of the model. Disparities in vaccination rates have also been identified based on socio -economic status (Reich, 2014) , therefore, I inc lude a poverty status variable, available for all children, that is based on the 2011 through 2015 Census data for poverty thresholds (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention , 2017) . This variable is coded as \"below poverty\", \"above poverty but less than 32 $75k\" and \"above poverty and more than $75k\" and an \"unknown/refused to answer\" group. Poverty thresholds are determined annually using the using data from the Census Bureau (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . I control for year fixed effects in my models to adjust for the annual change. Fi nally, the birth dose of Hep B may proxy for maternal beliefs and behaviors towards vaccination and has been used elsewhere in the literature as a covariate or control (Mennito & Darden, 2010; Yusuf, Daniels, Smith, Coronado, & Rodewald, 2000) . Accepting the birth dose of Hep B might provide insight to the maternal beliefs about vaccination at a critical time in parent and child -development. Child characteristics . Child characteristics are included in the model as c ontrols. The ACIP recommendations for the full seri es of routine vaccination, excluding the annual vaccines for Flu prevention and the Rotavirus series, to be completed by 18 months of age, therefore, th is sample of 19 -35 months of age old children should all have completed the series at the time of data c ollection (Zell et al., 2000) . I use child age group in months (19 -23, 24 -29, 30-35), gender (Male/Female) and race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, White, Multiple/Other) as controls. I include the child's race/ethnicity as a control in the model since there are known disparities i n the immunization rates for vulnerable populations w hich are typically racially diverse (Hill et al., 2015) . Lastly, I include an indicator for first -born status (Yes/No) because children at lower birth orders are more likely to b e UTD (Brenner, Simons -Morton, . Bivariate Statistics . First, to look for potential sources of selection bias, I conduct a series of corrected, weighted Pear son chi -square statistics or design -based F statistic s to determine statistical significance ( = .05). In Table 3.1, I use the survey tabulate function in Stata to obtain design -based F statistics for the variables in my regression model while accommodat ing for the complex survey design (Kreuter & Valliant, 2007) to compar e those 33 childre n whose providers answered the provider -check portion of the NIS (those with adequate provider data) using provider survey weights , to those who did not hav e adequate provider data and therefore, n o vaccine information . This allows for evaluation of differ ences in those who are included in the dataset and those who are excluded. Provider information is not available since one of the comparison groups did not complete the provider record check portio n of the survey. Table 3.2 presents bivariate statistics co mparing children's provider IIS participation so that any differences can be attributed to IIS participation and not because of differences in participation levels. Finally, I use bivariate statist ics to test for relationships between 1) the dependent variable (UTD status) and independent variables, and 2) multicollinearity between that may bias regression coefficients. Regression Analysi s. To address the ma in research question, I analyze the 2016 NIS data using a logistic regression model and cluster the error terms at the state -level, as described previously (Cameron & Miller, 2015) , and r eport the adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) in T able 3.3. These states' fixed -effect s treat all data within a state the same with respect to unobserved variables such as state immunization policies. The full model for the regression analysis, based upon my concep tual framework, is shown below. All varia bles in the model are categorical with variables in bold represent ing categorical variables with more than two levels. Full Model : utdstat i= 0 is the dependent dichotomous variable for UTD status and 0 is the probability that a child is UTD holding all other variables constant at zero. Provider -level variables include IISParticipation as the indicator for provider participation in an IIS and Pr oviderType as the 34 facility type (s) that the child's provider (s) are employed within . Maternal facto rs include the MaternalAge, MaternalEduca tion, and IncPov, a measure of income and poverty threshold . Child factors included as controls are ChildAge group, ChildRace/Ethnicity, child Gender , first-born status, and a Mobility variable to indicate if a chil d has moved from their birth state. State is also included as a geographic control since immunization programs are implemented at the state level and this ch apter examines state -level IISs. Results Summary statistics . Table 3.1 includes the weighted propor tions, using the dual -frame sampling weig hts, for the full sample, those with adequate provider data, and those without adequate provider data. State -level data can be found in Appendix A. Children with adequate provider data d id not have statistically sig nificant differences from those without a dequate provider data by child age group ( p = .85 ), child gender (p = .11) , or first-born status (p = .67) . There are statistically significant differences by child race /ethnicity (p = .004) and whether the children were living in a state different from wh ere they were born ( p = .026) . Children who are White or Multiple/Other race/ethnicities ha ve higher rates of representation in children with adequate provider data (47.9% and 14.1% resp ectively) than those without adequate data (44.6% and 13.5%) ; however, the reverse pattern is seen for Black and Hispanic children. Black children represent 14.6% and Hispanic children 27.3% of children without adequate data compared to the 12.1% and 25.9% respectively for children wi th adequate data.

For children wit h adequa te provider data, I compare the child, maternal, geographic, and provider variables by IIS participation in T able 3.2 to evaluate whether IIS participation varies for the independent variables. No variation in IIS participation is noted based on ch ild age group (p = .05) , first -born status (p = .10) , or whether children live in a different state from where they were born (p = .26) . However, differences are demonstrated for child gender ( p = .04), and child race/ethnicity (p < .001) , maternal age and educati on (p = .03 and p < .001 respectively), poverty status ( p < .001), provider facility type ( p < .001) and for state of residence ( p < .001) ( state data not shown but available in Appendix B). When testing the relationship between variables, I find a statis tically significant relationship between UTD status and IIS participation ( p < .001). As a check for robustne ss, I also test IIS participation as a dichotomous categorical variable (recoding the \"Unknown \" categori zed as missing da ta) to show that the stati stical significance remains regardless of how the registry participation is categorized (not shown).

Results from regressing IIS participation on child up - to-date status controll ing for child, maternal, and provider characteristics are shown in Table 3 .3, except for individual state data that is excluded from the table due to the number of categories (See Appendix C). There is no association between children whose providers submit ted data to an IIS and child UTD vaccination status , however, children whose providers were unsure whether data was sent to an IIS are associated with lower odds of being UTD for the full combined series of vaccines (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64, 0.83) when compa red to children who had no providers reporting to an IIS. Provider type is associated with UTD status for some prov ider types. When compared with all public Providers, children who had all private, all mili tary, or mixed provider types were associated with significantly higher odds of being UTD than those with all public providers ( aORs= 1.29, 1.38, 1.27 respectively, 95% CIs 1.12 -1.48, 1.02 -1.85, 1.04 -1.53) though the association is strongest for all privat e providers ( p < .001) . Where children live and whether that differs from where they were born are both associated with c hildren's up -to-date status (Figure 3.3) . Variation among state of residence range s (See Appendix) from states associated with signific antly lower odds (Oregon, 0.65, 95% CI 0.62 , 0.69) of up -to-date children to those that are associated with significantly higher odds of being up-to-date (Massa chusetts, aOR= 2.12, 95% CI 2.04, 2.20) when compared to California . Forty -five states and D.C. are associated with UTD status when compare d to the reference state, with 4 states (LA, NM, OR, and WY) associated with lower odds and the remaining 41 states a nd D.C. associated with higher odds of being UTD. Regional differences were only notable fo r states in the Western region; compared to stat es in the 39 Table 3.3 Adjusted Odds Ratios of IIS Participation on Up-to-Date status on Children 19 -35 months in the NIS Outcome: UTD Status aOR 95% CI IIS Participation None Unknown/ Don't Know 0.73*** [0.64, 0.83] Prov Public Ref [0.95, 1.33] All No Ref [0.46, 0.62] Maternal Age 29 years 0.85*** [0.78, 0.93] > 29 years Ref Maternal Education < 12 years (non -HS grad) 0.69*** [0.58, 0.83] 12 years (HS grad) years, Non -Coll Grad 0.79*** [0.71, 0.88] College Grad Ref Income/Poverty Status Above Poverty, $75k Ref Above Poverty, Ref Female 1.00 [0.93, 1.08] Child First < 0.05, ** p < 0.0 1, *** p < 0.001 Note: State is also in the model as a control (Ref: CA), results not shown due to space. 40 Legend: Black (Reference), White bars (no statistical significance), Gray bars (statistically significant, OR < 1.0), Shaded bars (statistically significant, OR > 1.0) Figure 3.3 Adjusted Odds Rat ios from Logistic Regression of States on UTD Status 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5ALAKAZARCACOCTDED.C.FLGAHIIDILINIAKSKYLAMEMDMAMIMNMSMOMTNENVNHNJNMNYNCNDOHOKORPARISCSDTNTXUTVTVAWAWVWIWY Odds RatioState41 Northeast region, states in the Western region have lower odds of being UTD (aOR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.61, 0.95 - data not shown). Further , children who reside in a state different from where they are born have significantly lower odds of being UTD compared to those who remain in their birth state ( aOR=0.53, 95% CI 0.46, 0.62). Maternal fa ctors income ) are all highly correlated with children's UTD status. Younger maternal age ( 29 years) is associated with lower odds of having a child who is UTD compared to mothers > 29 years ( aOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78, 0.93). Similar tren ds are seen for maternal education . Mothers with less than high school, high school degrees but no college, and some college but no degree were all associated with lower odds of UTD status when compared to mothers with college degrees, however, odds do increase with levels of education (aOR 0.69, whose household income is above $75k ha ve higher odds of having UTD children than those below poverty (aOR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.66, 0.84) , as well as those above poverty $75k (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66, 0.83) . Some child -level characteristics are also associated with UTD status. Odds of being UTD increases in older children. Compared to children 19 -24 months, children 25-29 months and 30 - 35 months were associated higher odds of being UTD ( aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.35, 1.64 and 1.48, 95% CI 1.34, 1.63 respectively). Child race/ethnicity is only associated with UTD status for one group. Hispanic children ha ve significantly higher odds of being UTD ( aOR= 1.34, 95% CI 1.15, 1.56) than White children. Lastly, birth order demonstrates a stat istically significant relationship with UTD status. Children who are f irst-born children have higher odds of being UTD than t hose of higher birth order ( aOR= 1.49, 95% CI 1.37, 1.63). 42 Discussion Freeman and Defriese stated that one of the intentions of re gistries was to increase immunization rates in the U.S. (Freeman & DeFriese, 200 3). Measuring the effects of the investments in IIS, using data directly from the IIS, is still in early stages as many of the state and local IIS s are still validating their data and experiencing complications with data quality (Khare, Piccinino, Bark er, & Linkins, 2006; Robison, 2015) . The NIS is the largest, most established, data source that publicly provides information on vaccines and IIS participatio n. This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it provides an updated analys is on the relationship between providers who have submitted data to an IIS and the odds of a child being up -to-date on routine vaccines. Two studies examined I IS participation on UTD in various ways, but the studies are more than a decade old (Kim et al., 2007; Mennito & Darden, 2010) . Logically, states with IISs in those studies (exact number not available) are more mature and in theory would be expected to show larger impacts on vaccination rates over time. Simila r to previous stud ies that reported on this relationship with NIS data from 2004 -2006, I find no association between IIS participation and increased rates of UTD vaccination (Kim et al., 2007; Mennito & Darden, 2010 ). Consistent with the study by Kim et. al., children 's providers who are unsure whether vaccines were submitted to an IIS h ave lower odds of completing the full combined series of vaccines compared with children whose do not have providers that participa te in IISs . This finding suggests a persistent knowledge gap (Kim et al., 2007) or that providers ' awareness of IISs, or other immunization policies and programs, may be associated with child vaccination status . Second, I find that state of residence and geographic mobility is significantly correlated with UTD status for this sample. Although state immunization rates can be found in the 43 literature, few studies have included it as a significant contributor to the d iscussion on immunization rates (Hill et al., 2015; Luman, Barker, McCauley, & Drews -Botsch, 2005) as most discussions focus on national -level estimates or in small targeted location s. I find that UTD status for chi ldren ages 19 -35 months varie s significantly across the states after accounting for potential e ffects of State policies by clustering the error terms . The range of results ( aOR: 0.65 (Oregon) to 2.12 (Massachusetts) ) suggest that states may have a signific ant influence on child vaccination status and is further explored in Chapter 5 of this disserta tion. Additionally, mobility appears to be an important indicator of childhood vaccination status. C hildren who resided in a state different from their birth st ate are significantly less likely to be up -to-date which may increase the risk for medical reco rd fragmentation by increasing the overall number of vaccine providers (Hamlin, Wood, Pereyra, & Gr abowsky, 1996) . Children who moved out of state were also less likely to have all their providers respond to the survey according to the findings in this study . Transferring care to another provider can create challenges in care continuity and it is pos sible that not every immunization provider was identified during the household interview p hase of the NIS and thus were left out of the provider record check phase of the survey or that providers may be uncertain about their role in the NIS if their patien t is new or perhaps no longer under their care. The magnitude of this finding was surprisi ng and supports the need for IIS linkage or a national IIS that providers can access in real-time. Third, this study also adds to the overall discussion of childhood vaccination rates. Child, maternal , and provider factors are all known contributing facto rs in whether children receive their recommended vaccines (Luman et al., 2003; Sturm, Mays, & Zimet, 2005) . In studies reporting findings using NIS data, child age group is not frequently discussed as a significant 44 predictor of immunization rates (Hill et al., 2015; Stokley, M aurice, Smith, & Klevens, 2004) . In this study, children in the older two age groups are associated with higher odds of receiving the full combined series of vaccines when compared with those less than 24 months old. This may be explained by vaccination policy variations by child -care providers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, younger children are more likely to have child -care arra ngements with relatives or non -center -based environments , and as they age, may be more likely to be enrolled in center - based day cares and pre -schools like Head Start (Laughlin, 2013) . Center -based organizations typically have vaccination policies similar to those of schools which have been associated with increases in vaccination rates (Diekema, 2014; Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) . My findings are also inconsistent with the literature on immunization disparities by c hild race/ethnicity . Hill et. al. reports on this racial disparity in the NIS frequently through the MMWRs published by the CDC. The authors find that black children have lower rates of vaccination compared with white children (Hill et al., 2017; Hill et al., 2015) . I find no difference in the UTD status for black children or child ren with multiple/other race ethnicities compared to white children in this stud y. However, I do find that when adjusting for maternal factors, location, and IIS participation, Hispanic children are associated with significantly higher odds of UTD vac cinat ion, a finding that differs from other studies (Hill et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2007) . These differences may be methodological as I control for states of residence, mobility, birth order, and record of a Hep B birth dose; when state is removed from my model, I find a shift in the effect to be more in alignment with previous studies - statistically lower odds in black children and no effect for children of Hispanic ethnicity. First-born status' positive correlation wi th UTD status is a significant finding in this study . Birth order, while occasionally mentioned in the vaccine literature, is not frequently 45 discussed. I find that c hildren who were first -born ha ve significantly higher odds of being fully vaccinated than t hose who were not first -born. In one case, it is plaus ible that mothers with multiple children would have increased awareness, knowledge, and exposure to vaccinations leading to more informed decision -making. However, it has been demonstrated that lower bi rth order is correlated with higher vaccination rates (Dombkowski, Lantz, & Freed, 2004; Schaffer & Szilagyi, 1995) . This may be due to the challenges with coordinating preventive care services for multiple childre n, who may h ave different vaccination requirements, since the schedules change by age, and the perceived barriers by larger families trying to stay compliant (Sabnis & Conway, 2015) . This finding sug gests that a dditional support may be needed for larger families to ensure timely vaccines for all children. Results in this study also show that the odds of a child being up to date on their vaccinations varie s by maternal characteristics. These data are largely consistent with the literature and suggest that higher incomes and increased education are associated with higher likelihood of vaccine uptake (Hill et al., 2015) . Additionally, the literature suggests moth ers will choose vaccina tion providers that align with their own beliefs on vaccination which may be correlated with age, education, exposure, and access to vaccines (Dombkowski et al., 2004; Luman et al., 2003; Merg ler et al., 2013) . In this study, I find that c hildren with all private providers are correlated with higher odds of complete vaccination compared to children with all public providers, a finding consistent with a study by Luman et al. (2002) , but inconsistent with a previous report of no effect by provider type (Kim et al ., 2007) . The parent -provider relationship regarding vaccination behaviors is particularly interesting and these findings could indicate a potential interaction between maternal behavior and provider characteristics . 46 Finally, my study contributes to the l iterature by providing a fuller model to examine the relationship between IIS participation and UTD status for the full combined vaccine series. According to the study b y Freeman and colleagues , 30% of children in an under -vaccinated group had changed prov iders since birth which can increase the possibility of record fragmentation, poor continuity of care, and missed opportunities (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) . In this study, 10.7% of children with adequate provider data were no longer living in their birth state with a statistically highe r proportion of mobile children lacking adequate provider data ( p = .026). Mobility may also be associated with different socioeconomic status and parental behaviors since a long -distance move requires resources may not be available to vulnerable families . Geography can also play a key role in childhood immunizations; immunization programs a re implemented and governed by the individual states in the U.S. I include state as a control but also use states' fixed -effects improve the specification of the model . Limitations There are several limitations in this study. First, the cross -sectional d esign of the NIS limits the ability to conclud e a causal effect. Initially, I explored an instrumental variable approach because of anticipated endogeneity, but when tested, none of the variables were deemed endogenous nor was a good instrument discovered. Second, there were some differences in childr en whose providers returned the provider -check survey compared with those who did not, as well as differences in providers who submitted data to an IIS compared with those who did not. Questions in the provider record check such as whether data was sent to an IIS, are self - reported by providers and are not verified as to the existence of an IIS or directly validated with an IIS and are subject to reporting errors. Survey and provider weights were used at differe nt points of analysis to try to account for di fferences among the groups in this study . Third, the 47 regression model did not explain a large portion of the variance in UTD status in this study and wide confidence intervals and a decrease in coefficient prec ision from clustering the error terms may have affected the statistical significance as it reduced the sample size to the number of clusters (N = 51). I decided on a conservative approach to not over -inflate the importance of the findings. I also anticipat e that some of this explanation is lost in the recoding of the raw data for public -use or is not able to be captured through the NIS. Accessing the raw data through a Federal Research Data Center may improve the fit of the model, however, it is more likely that the NIS may not be sufficient as a stand -alone data source to answer this research question. Finally , I made several assumptions to the data, based on my conceptual framework, by proxying for maternal beliefs and provider beliefs by including matern al characteristics and type of provider facili ty in the regression model. Prior to 2012, parental knowledge of childhood vaccines was collected in phase I of the NIS, however, those questions were removed to reduce the survey length. Adding questions in Ph ase I of the survey on parental beliefs toward vaccines may help improve the model. The NIS is not sufficient to explicitly study \"providers\" according to the NIS Data User Guide. Finally, while the NIS is the gold -standard for analyzing immunization data in the U.S., there are children outside of the sampling frame, such as those without landline or cell phone service, who would not be screened for inclusion in the NIS. The NIS uses a complex stratified survey design and complex survey weights to account f or those children and to make the survey repre sentative, but information on those children outside the sampling frame is not available and affects the generalizability of these results. Conclusion Expanding the utilization of Immunization Information Syste ms is one strategy recognized by public health officials and policymakers to improve vaccination rates by providing 48 vaccine recommendations in real -time while the child is in a provider's office an d improving vaccine inventory tracking and ordering. Over t he last twenty years, substantial investments have been dedicated to improving the infrastructure and utilization of Immunization Information Systems but there is scant literature regarding the imp act of IISs on progress toward meeting the nation's immuniz ation goals. Findings in this study suggest no relationship between child up -to- date status for the full combined series of vaccines and whether their providers submitted data to an IIS, though chi ldren whose providers were unsure of their IIS participatio n status were associated with lower odds of vaccine series completion. Several factors were identified as significant contributors to up -to-date status including state of residence, mobility, and f irst-born status suggesting a complicated dynamic between c hild, maternal, provider, and state immunization programs. A deeper examination into how these factors are associated with immunization rates would help public health officials understand these rel ationships and lead to potential new interventions to impro ve immunization rates. 49 Chapter 4 The Association Between Immunization Information Systems and Invalid Doses in Children 19 -35 months of Age in the National Immunization Survey 50 Introduction Relatively hi gh and sustained rates of vaccination have resulted in reduc tions as much as a 99.9% in vaccine -preventable diseases in the U.S. (Chen, 1999; Roush & Murphy, 2007) . However, waning immunity and decreases in vaccination rates threatens the progress of vaccination efforts. Fo r example, recent studies have shown that immunity to the current child formulation of the Diphtheria Tetanus and aceullar Pertussis (DTaP) vacci ne begins to wane as early as five years after administration of the fifth dose (Klein, Bartlett, Rowhani -Rahbar, Fireman, & Baxter, 2012; McGirr & Fisman, 2015) , yet current vaccines sched ules approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) do not include recommendations for additional boosters for most people; an additional dose is recommended once during teenage years, during each pregnancy, in adults with no or uncert ain history of pertussis vaccination and in people over 65 who are expected to have close contacts with infants and children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011) . Additionally, the protective effect of the vaccine, measured as a titer, or the level of antibodies in circulation, following the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR ) vaccine has also demonstrably decreased over time resulting in vulnerability to the highly contagious infecti ons (Davidkin, Jokinen, Kontio, Paunio, & Peltola, 2012; LeBaron et al., 2007) . In addition to waning immunity, rates of vaccination have declined for several vaccines when compared to previous years and is correl ated with increases in vaccine hesitancy and decreas ing confidence in vaccines (Hill et al., 2017; Salmon, Dudley, Glanz, & Omer, 2015) . In 2016, 70.7% of children 19 -35 months of age were up -to-date (UTD) for the full series of recommended vaccines including 4 DTaP doses, 3 Polio doses, 1 Measles Mumps and Rubella dose, 3 Haemophilus influenzae b doses, 3 Hepat itis B doses, 1 Varicella dose, and 51 4 Pneumococcal doses. That UTD rate is down 1.5% points compared to 201 5 and is the lowest since 2013 (Hill et al., 2017) . These rates also demonstrate a failure of the U.S. to meet one of the Healthy People 2020 immunization objectives of 80% v accination for the full series by the age of three years (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2011b) . As a result, the popul ation's protection toward vaccine -preventable diseases is reduced and outbreaks in vaccine - preventable illness are on the rise (Cherry, 2012; Phadke, Bednarczyk, Salmon, & Omer, 2016; Salmon et al., 2015) . Along with increases in morbidity and mortality, these outbreaks are associated with increased costs and utilization of health care system resources (e.g. physician visits, hospitalizations) (Ortega -Sanchez, Vijayaraghavan, Barskey, & Wallace, 2014) . The ACIP approves the child and adult recommende d vac cine schedules, including both the recommended ages and intervals between doses for each vaccine, which are based on \" age- specific risks for disease, age -specific risks for complications, age -specific responses to vaccination, and potential interferen ce wi th the immune response by passively transferred maternal antibodies\" (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2019) . The ACIP also publishes the minimum ages and inte rvals required between doses in a series based on vaccine safety data which vary from the ACIP recommended schedules (Ahmed et al., 2011; Hamborsky, Kroger, Wolfe, Control, & Prevention, 2015) . Children who receive a dose before the dose -required age have a higher likelihood of h aving a reduced or absent immunological response to the vaccine and leaves them susceptible to disease (Hamlin et al., 1996) ; they may also have higher risks of adverse reactions as the vaccines have not been tested fo r safety and efficacy at those ages (Luman et al., 2002) . Further, doses that are administered too close to each other may not stimulate robust immune responses (Butte et al., 2001; Jilg, Schmidt, & Deinhardt, 1989) and 52 may limit the overall protective effect of those doses even though they will appear to be vaccinated against disease. Vaccinating children outside of the validat ed ages and intervals, and failu re to receive a full series, may give the impression of a vaccinated and protected population, when , the protective benefits of individual and herd immunity are not optimal and may leave the population vulnerable to infectio n. For example, receiving vaccin es too early in age can interfere with the immune response . When administered before one year of age, the presence of maternal antibodies transferred during childbirth in a child's circulation may prevent the m from developing their own antibodies to the me asles, mumps, and . While the child would have an MMR recorded and appear vaccinated in their health record , their lack of response to the vaccine would not offer full protection against measles . This effect is also demonstrated in larger populations such as in the 1990 Pennsylvania measles outbreak. Of the more than 27,600 cases of measles reported during the outbreak, on ly 5,100 (18.4%) were appropriately vaccin ated, and 22,500 (81.4%) were unvaccinated, which includes children who may have received untimely or inappropriate vaccinations (Centers for Disease Co ntrol, 1991) . Of those children who were categorized as unvaccinated, 12,268 (44.3%) were inappropriately vaccinated and received their measles vaccine before the age of one year and demonstrates the importance of the timing of vaccines in addition to rec eiving the correct number of doses . These children did not have the benefit of optimal individual protection and because there were so many, likely lowered the protective herd immunity benefits. Doses that have been administered too young or too close toge ther are deemed \"invalid\" and require re -vaccination at the appropriate age and/or interval for optimal protection against 53 VPDs (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 201 9). Re-vaccination adds to the number of clinic visits, increased costs and utilization of vaccine resources, and represents unnecessary exposure to biological substances (Stokley et al., 2004) . These additional vaccinations may also increase the risk potential for adverse reactions. The full impact of i nvalid doses is unclear in the current immunization estimates since all doses given to a child are included in vaccine estimates regardless of whether they meet the required or recommended age and intervals for administration (Luman et al., 2005) . One study from 2000 examined the number of invalid doses, and the cost of re -vaccinating children who had received them , and determined that at least 11% of children ages 19 -35 months had one or more invalid vaccine doses when using the most stringent ACIP criteria (Stokley et al., 2004) . The authors' cost analysis estimated a vaccine purchase cost of $10M to $18M for re -vaccinating these children which demonstrates added cos t and burden of inappropriately timed vaccines. Reducing inv alid vaccines, and therefore increasing the overall quality of vaccine delivery, is a complex problem. The delivery of vaccines is complicated by increasing numbers of vaccine providers which cau ses fragmentation of immunization records (e.g. when a child sees a new provider or moves out of state and fails to migrate their records) (Hamlin et al., 1996; Stokley et al., 2001; Yusuf et al., 2002) . Increasingly complex immunization schedules (Butte et al., 2001) may add additional comp lications for providers and parents trying to track immunizations. Parental and provider vaccine hesitancy regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines also contributes to non -comp liance to the recommended vaccine schedule and missed vaccination targets. As a result of vaccine hesitancy, parental and clinician mistrust of vaccines, vaccine manufacturers, and other vaccine advocates, (Larson et al., 2014; Mills, Jadad, Ross, & Wilson, 2005) , many parents are opting to use alternative vaccination schedules (Feemster & 54 Offit, 2013; Offit & Moser, 2009) which further increases the opportunity for missed and under - vaccinated children. One suggeste d strategy to improve the quality of vaccinations administered, and reduce the number of invalid vaccines, is through the utilization of immunization information systems (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003; Stokley et al ., 2004). These population -based electronic repositories offer a centralized hub for not only storing immunization data, but sharing data with other providers and/or states and forecasting future immunization needs in real -time (Groom et al., 2015) so providers can administer the right vaccine to the right patient at the right time - a central tenet to patient -centeredness. These coordinated efforts are anticipated to reduce scattering and fragmentation of records, missed opportunities, and inappropriately delivered vaccines (National Vaccine Advisory Committee, 1999; Stokley et al., 2001; Yusuf et al., 2002) . Currently, there is no national immunization data tracking system (Gostin & Lazzarini, 1995) . In the U.S., the first IIS was established in 1974 (Ortega et al., 1997) . After several philanthropic efforts to expand their utilization stalled, the Clinton administration's immunization initiative allowed for federal dollars to be invested for the expa nsion and utilization of IIS at the state and local levels (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) . Although there have been subst antial changes in IIS s over the last ten years, and every state now operates at least one IIS either at a state, regional, or local level, there has been little research on the effects these IIS are having on vaccination rates a nd/or the quality of vaccine delivery (Kempe et al., 2001) . Using the National Immunization Survey (NIS), the current gold -standard for immunization data in the U.S., I examine the relationship between IIS utilization and invalid vaccinations in children 19 -35 months of age . In this paper, I address the following questions: First, how have invalid doses for the full recommended series changed from 2012 to 2016 ; and second, are 55 children whose providers submitted immunization data to an IIS less likely to have an invalid dose? Conceptual Framework Vaccination policies occur at the national and state -levels in the U.S. In order to achieve immunization goals, vaccine uptake strategies are enacted through a series of complex and dynamic relationsh ips between public health entities, providers, and parents. Usin g the Conceptual Framework from Chapter 3 (Figure 4.1) , I analyze the effect of IIS participation on invalid doses. Using my conceptual framework and the ACIP's criteria for minimum required age and interval between doses, I determine the validity of each dose in the most recent five years of National Immunization Survey Data. In my model s, I include child characteristics as controls, as well as maternal characteristics since a child's mother i s often the most influential person in vaccine decision -making (Luman et al., 2003) . I include charact eristics that are potential influencers of the mother's knowledge and behavior since this cannot be directly measured by this dataset, such as whether a child received a birth dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine. Finally, provider characteristics are included in the model as covariates to determine if certain provider types are associated with the quality of vaccines (e.g. invalid doses) and as my predictor of interest, I include a variable that proxies for provider participation in an IIS. 56 Figure 4.1 Conceptual Framework for Child Vaccination Status as presented in Ch . 3 (Fig 3.1) Methods This study is a retrospective secondary analysis of an annually conducted, nationally representative, cross - survey of hou seholds with children ages 19 -35 months of age and their immunization providers from 2012 to 2016 . Data source . Five years of data from the 2012 -2016 National Immunization Surveys (NIS) are included in this study. The NIS is conducted via a two-phase proc ess summarized here but described in detail elsewhere (Smith et al., 2001; Zell et al., 2000) . The first phase screens for households with children in the targeted age range of 19 -35 months. Household screening is conducte d using random -digit dialing (RDD) and a dual frame design that encompasses sampling techniques for both telephone landlines and mobile numbers. During this first phase, demographic, household, and vaccine provider information is collected from the person in the household with the most knowledge about the eligible child's vaccines - typically a parent or guardian (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . Additionally, the 57 parent/gua rdian is asked for consent to contact the child's vaccination providers to obtain their immunization records. The Provider Record Check is the second phase of the NIS where a survey is mailed to all providers for the eligible child(ren) who were identified in phase I. Providers are asked to list all vaccines in a child's record (including historical vaccines), vaccine type/manufacturer, dates administered, and if the provider reporting the vaccine is the one who administered the doses. Additionally, a quest ion pertaining to whether the child's vaccines were reported to a registry is included in the survey. Study sample . Children aged 19 to 35 months during the survey periods in the 2012 to 2016 NIS, with adequate provider data, and residing in the fifty sta tes and Washington, D.C. are included in this analysis. Children living in Puerto Rico and other territories were excluded from this analys is since information about how IIS s operate was inconsistent and/or incomplete at the time of this study. The pooled 2012 -2016 NIS data set included 126,657 children with completed household interviews (Phase I). Of those children, 75,346 (59.5%) were con sidered to have adequate provider immunization data (Phase II) and were retained in the dataset. Children who have received zero doses are also considered to have adequate provider data if a provider was identified by the parents and the provider responded with \"child has received no vaccines\". However, since this study examines the validity of vaccines, I exclude childr en with zero vaccines in the data set (N = 980) for a final sample size of 74,366 . Determination of vaccine dose validity . All doses in th e recommended full series for children aged 19 -35 months are evaluated for validity. The full series includes 4 DTaP, 3 Polio, 1 58 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 HepB, 1 Var, and 4 PCV doses (Hill et al., 2015) . No changes were noted in the vaccine schedules and recommendations over the five -year study period. Doses (e.g. DTaP 1, DTaP2, etc.) are evaluated using strict interpretations of the recommendations and flagged as \"invalid\" if they failed to meet the minimum required ACIP criteria for age and /or interval between doses. Doses that were administered before the minimum age criteria are \"invalid due to age\" whereas doses that were delivered too soon are considered \"invalid due to interval\". In many cases, childr en had received mo re than the recommended number of doses for a given series, for example, five polio doses when three are recommended. In these cases, the criteria for the \"last\" dose in the series is used to evaluate these doses for validity (e.g. a fift h DTaP dose was ev aluated using the criteria for dose 4, or interval 4). There is no upper limit to the age and/or interval for classifying a dose as valid. The flags are created based on the specified ages and intervals as depicted in Figure 4.2 below. Flags are created as binary variables for each possible dose and interval and indicated that the dose is valid (flag=0) or invalid (flag=1). Validity of the birth dose of Hep B is not determined since there is no minimum age, however, the interval between th e birth dose and second dose of Hep B is evaluated. Additionally, for retrospective analyses of immunization records, the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention recommend s a 4-day grace period in most vaccine situations, 59 Figure 4.2 Minimum Required Ages and Intervals for Doses in the Full Combined Series According to ACIP Guidelines except where noted (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2015a ). The ACIP rec ommends applying this grace period when determining vaccine dose validity to account for errors in entry or when providers miss a \"vaccination window\" due to weekends and/or holidays. This allowance also helps to provide conservative esti mates in those chi ldren who might be receiving doses \"close\" to the required timing. One challenge of retrospective analyses of NIS data is that the ACIP provides recommendations in weeks (up to 4 months) and in months thereafter, while the NIS captures ages of doses in da ys and months. I convert the ACIP recommendations into days by multiplying the number of weeks by 7 days or months by 30 days. The purpose of using days for the ages is to make it easier to apply the four -day grace period for retrospectiv e analysis. This m ay introduce potential error into the dataset due to the different numbers of days per month . This method of determining age and validity has been used previously by Stokley et. al. (2004) , but 60 was modified slightly to reflect the four day grace period and include the full recommended series. Dependent variables . Three dependent variables are created for invalid do ses: 1) any invalid, 2) invalid due to age, and 3) invalid due to interval. Each variable is first created as a dichotomous variable based on a series of flags created from the ACIP age and interval table described previously in Figure 2. First, a dose -level flag was created, followed by a vaccine -level flag, and then a full -series flag for each of the three dependent categories with \"any invalid\" combining both age and interval flags. However, since it is possible that one vaccine dose co uld be invalid for both age and interval, invalid doses were not additive. Figure 3 below demonstrates this multi -level flagging. Figure 4.3 Diagram of Multi -level Flag Creation for Invalid Doses Independent variables . The independent variable of interest is whether a child's data was submitted to a registry, hereafter called IIS s. This data is collected in response to a question 61 on the provider record check survey in phase II of the NIS and is pro xying for provider particip ation in an IIS. This categorical variable was initially provided in the data set as \"no providers\" submitted data to a registry, \"some but probably or definitely not all\" providers, \"all providers\", and those who marked \"Unknown /Don't know\". Because of th e uncertainty around \"some but probably or definitely not all\", I recode the registry variable to reflect no participation, any participation, and unknown participation. I assume that those providers who are unsure of their regis try participation may be di fferent from those who opted to leave the survey question blank, and thus left them as a separate category. The following independent variables are also included in the previous chapter of this dissertation. Provider characteri stics. This dataset does no t capture much information about the provider, however, the type of provider(s) a child has (e.g. All public, All private, All hospital, All military, or Mixed) is included and is used to proxy for provider's beliefs since provid ers choose their type of pr actice which may be influenced by their personal health beliefs. In the NIS, provider type is aggregated at the child level, however, so analyses of individual providers are not possible. State -level influence . Current state of residence is included to he lp control for state -level immunization policies. There are currently no national laws, however, the ACIP makes national recommendations which are then carried out by state immunization programs. These immunization policies also affect state -run IIS s and m ay influence provider behavior. Policies and behavior at within a state may change over time, so I also control for year fixed effects and an interaction between year and state. Additionally, I include a variable that assesses mobility 62 (Yes/No) measu red by whether a child lives in a different state from where they were born to adjust for state selection effects of vaccination history. Maternal characteristics . Previous literature on vaccination behaviors suggests that mothers are the most influential person in childhood vaccination decisions (Luman et al., 2003) ; their attitudes toward vaccination wer e sign ificantly predictive of infant vaccination status (Fadel et al., 2017) . There is no direct way to measure maternal beliefs and behavior, so I proxied for it in several ways. I select variables that have been identi fied in the literature as influential on a mother's vaccine knowledge and decision -making (Luman et al. , 2003) including: maternal age, maternal education, a household income and poverty variable, and whether a chil d received a birth dose of Hep B vaccine. Younger maternal age has been associated with lower child vaccination rates (Luman et al., 2003) , so controlling for maternal age ( 29 yrs or > 29 yrs) is important when evaluating the effect of IIS on rates. The effect of maternal education is less clear on child vaccination status. For example, older studies ha ve shown that advanced maternal education is associated with higher rates of childhood vaccinations (Luma n et al., 2003) , however, more recent studies have shown there are clusters of individuals with graduate or professional school education wh o are less accepting of vaccines (Healy & P ickering, 2011) . Therefore, I include maternal education (< 12yrs, 12 yrs, > 12 yrs - non-college grad, College Grad) as a control to help im prove the fit of the model. Disparities in vaccination rates have also been identified based on socio -economic s tatus (Reich, 2014) , therefore, I include a poverty status variable, available for all chi ldren, that is based on the 2011 through 2015 Census data for poverty thresholds (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2017) . This variable is coded as \"below poverty\", \"above poverty but less than 63 $75k\" and \"above poverty and more than $75k\" and an \"unknown/refused to answer\" group. Poverty thresholds are determined annually using the using data from the Census Bureau (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . I control for year fixed effects in my models to adjust for the annual change. Finally, the birth dose of Hep B may proxy for maternal beliefs and behaviors towards vaccination and has been used elsewhere in the literature as a covariate or control (Mennito & Darden, 2010; Yusuf et al., 2000) . Accepting the birth dose of Hep B might provide insig ht to the ma ternal beliefs about vaccination at a critical time in parent and child -development. Child characteristics . Child characteristics are included in the model as controls. The ACIP recommendations for the full series of routine vaccination, exclud ing the annu al vaccines for Flu prevention and the Rotavirus series, to be completed by 18 months of age, therefore, this sample of 19 -35 months of age old children should all have completed the series at the time of data collection (Zell et al., 2000) . I use child age group in months (19 -23, 24 -29, 30 -35), gender (Male/Female) and race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, White, Multiple /Other) as c ontrols. I include the child's race/ethnicity as a control in the model since there are known disparities in the immunization rates for vulnerable populations which are typically racially diverse (Hill e t al., 2015) . Las tly, I include an indicator for first -born status (Yes/No) because children at lower birth orders are more likely to be UTD (Brenner et al., 2001) . Analysis . The analysis plan for this research qu estion consist s of a series of bivariate statistical tests and a set of regression models which are developed with guidance from the conceptual framework. Bivariate statistics . First, to look for potential sources of selection bias, I conducted a series o f corrected, weighted Pearson chi -square statistics or design -based F statistics to 64 determine significance ( = .05). I present the summary statistics using column percentages to compare the distribution of characteristics over the five -year study period us ing the provider survey weights in the public -use file as recommended by the data user guide (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . Next, in order to attribute any meaningful change to the predictor (IIS Participation), I test for statistically significant differences on the sample, aggregated across years, by provider IIS participation. Invalid dose assessment . Invalid doses are analyzed at the child -level and presented as counts (number of children) and percent of children with at least one invalid dose due to age, interval, or combined age or interval. Children with zero recorded vaccines are excluded for this analysis. Each vaccine (e.g. DTaP, Hib, etc.) for each year had a different denominator because of excluding children with \"zero DTaPs in 2012\" resulted in a different number than those children with \"zero Hi b in 2014\", as an example. The number s of children are counted and then divided by the new denominator to get th e proportion of children with invalid doses. Regression analysis . To address my research questions, I utilize a series of three logistic regression models and cluster the error terms at the state -level to account for policies and programs enacted at the st ate level. This approach allows the error terms to be correlated within each cluster (Cameron & Miller, 2015) . The states' fixed -effects capture state -level factors, such as preferences o r cost difference, that are stable over time. Including state effects means that the IIS effects are estimated within state and then averaged acros s states. Three separate models were used to examine the effect of IIS participation on valid doses. The full model for the regression analysis is shown below, with descriptions of the three models by dependent 65 variables. All variables in the models are ca tegorical with v ariables in bold represent categorical variables with more than two levels. Full Model : InvalidVars i= 0 + where InvalidVars represents three different dependent variables for invalid doses including a variable for \"any inval id dose\" (Model 1), \"any invalid dose due to age\" (Model 2), and \"any invalid dose due to interva l\" (Model 3) and 0 represents the invalid dose status for children when all predictor variables are held at zero. Provider -level variables include IISParticip ation as an indicator for provider participation in an IIS and ProviderType as the facility type (s) that the child's provider (s) are employed within . Maternal factors include the MaternalAge, MaternalEducation, and IncPov, a measure of income and poverty t hreshold, as well as a dummy variable for whether any of the child's providers reported a HepBBir thDose which proxies for maternal attitudes and behaviors toward vaccination. Child factors included as controls are ChildAge group, ChildRace/Ethnicity, child gender , first-born status, and a Mobility variable to indicate if a child had moved from their birth state. In addition to the provider, maternal, and child factors described in the Data section, the model includes state -by-year fixed effects. These indic ators for state and year ar e meant to capture changes in state policies or economic conditions that affect immunizations (e.g. changes in funding for public health departments). 66 For each regression model, I report the adjusted odds ratios ( aORs) and the Mc Kelvey & Zavoina's R2 which most closely approximates the R2 achieved by Ordinary Least Squares' regression (Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDR E), n.d.) . Results Summary statistics . There are 126,657 children ages 19 -35 months in the 2012 -2016 NIS datasets, of which 75,346 (59.5%) ha ve adequate provider data for inclusion in this study . The sample is reduced further when children with zero re corded doses for the 7 vaccines are excluded (N = 980) for a final sample size of 74,366 for the five years of pooled data with yearly sample size shown in Table 1. IIS status was available for all children retained in the data set. There are no statistica lly signific ant differences in the proportion of children with zero vaccines over time (data not shown); less than 1% of children each year, with adequate provider data, have zero recorded doses ( p = .80). In Table 4.1, using provider survey weights, I present a sum mary of the variables by year to assess whether there are any differences in my variable composition over time. There are no statistically significant differences over time for child age group ( p = .99), gender (p > .99), race/ethnicity ( p = .25), first -born status ( p = .38), and receipt of Hep B birth dose ( p = .13). However, o ver time, children are more likely to be living a state different from where they were born ( p = .002) suggesting increas ing mobility in the country. For children with adequate provi der data, maternal characteristics varies over time . Mothers of these children tend to be older ( p < .001), more educated ( p < .001) with an increase in the number of mothers with college degrees, and nominally more affluent ( p < .001) with an increase in the number of families reporting household incomes greater than $75k. Finally, the proportion of provider types, which may be reflective of shifts in family dynamics and behaviors, is notable for a slight 67 Tabl e 4.1 Weighted Summary Statistics for Children 19 -35 Months of Age in the 2012 -2016 National Immunization Surveys with Adequate Provider Data and 1+ Reported Vaccines Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total p Child Age Group 19-23 36.0 35.9 36.2 35.8 36.1 Child Gender Male 51.2 51.2 51.1 51.2 51.3 51.2 > .99 Female 48.8 48.8 48.9 48.2 48.7 48.8 Child Race/ Ethnicity Black 13.6 12.7 13.6 12.5 13.1 13.1 .25 Hispanic 27.3 27.2 26.4 26.8 26.7 26.9 Other/Multiple 11.9 12.2 13.4 12.4 14.0 12.8 White 47.2 47.9 46.6 48.3 40.0 Hep B Birth Dose < 1 Providers reported 24.1 21.8 23.2 23.6 24.1 23.4 .13 1 Provider(s) reported 75.9 78.2 76.8 76.4 89.9 89.8 88.6 90.0 .002 Yes 8.7 9.8 10.1 10.2 11.4 10.0 Maternal Age 29 years 44.7 44.6 42.4 40.7 37.9 42.1 < .001 > 29 years 55.3 55.4 57.6 59.3 62.1 57.9 Maternal Education < 12 years 18.8 18.3 17.7 15.7 15.1 17.1 < .001 12 years (HS degree) 27.1 25.7 25.1 26.1 25.4 25.9 > 12 years, no college 22.4 22.2 23.6 23.2 23.0 22.8 College Graduate 30.7 33.8 33.6 35.1 36.5 34.2 Income/Poverty Status Above, > $75k 25.2 27.4 27.1 29.3 31.2 28.0 < .00 1 Above, $75k 33.3 33.9 33.9 33.3 Below 36.8 33.4 33.6 32.8 29.2 33.2 Unknown 4.7 5.3 5.6 5.8 6.5 5.5 Provider Type All Public 12.1 12.7 11.8 12.0 12.9 12.3 .008 All Hospitals 11.4 12.5 12.5 12.4 13.9 12.6 All Private 58.2 56.7 55.6 57.5 56.2 56.8 All Military/Other 2.1 2.4 3.1 2.1 2.7 2.5 Mixed 16.2 15.7 17.0 16.0 14.3 15.8 N 16,480 13,450 14,730 14,973 14,733 Hep B recorded as \"No providers ma rked Hep B birth dose given\" or \"At least one provider marked that a Hep B birth dose was given\". 68 shift in the number of respondents seeking vaccinations \"all hospital\" providers or \"mixed\" ( p = .01). In Ta ble 4.2, I summarize the children in the dataset by whether their providers sent data to an IIS. There are no statistically significant differe nces in IIS participation by child age group (p = .78), gender ( p = .14), or whether a child resided in a state d ifferent from their birth state ( p = .10). Differences in IIS participation are demonstrated in all other variables: race/ethnicity, first-born status, receipt of a Hep B birth dose, maternal characteristics (age, education, poverty status), and provider t ype. For those with no IIS participation, 8.0% were Black, 20.1% Hispanic and 57.4% White compared to those with some/all IIS participation (14 .1%, 27.8%, and 46.0% respectively, p < .001). Children with unknown IIS participation were more likely to be fir st- born (43.4%) compared to those with no participation (40.0%), or some/all participation (39.7%, p < .001). Maternal characteristics also demonstrated important differences. The maternal age is only available as dichotomous information, however, a stat istically significant higher proportion of mothers whose children ha ve zero records in an IIS is seen for the older age g roup when compared to those with some/all providers reporting immunizations to an IIS (68.4% vs 55.6, p < .001). Mothers of children wh o are associated with non -IIS-participating providers also tend to be more educated and in higher income households. Of t hose with no IIS participation, 50.8% of mothers are college graduates compared to 30.5% of those with some/all IIS participation. Whil e the proportion of mothers above the poverty line, but with household incomes less than $75k , did not change much by IIS participation, the proportion of mothers above the poverty line with income greater than $75k is 44.7% in the no IIS participation gro up but only 24.3% in IIS 69 Table 4.2 Weighted Descriptive Statistics by II S Participation in Children 19 -35 Months of Age, with Adequate Provider Data, in the 2012 -2016 National Immunization Surveys No IIS Pa rticipation Some/All IIS Participation Unknown IIS Participation % Range % Range % Range p Child Age Group 19-23 29.6 28.1 / 33.9 30.3 29.1 33.6 .78 / 36.8 37.1 34.8 / 38.3 Child Gender Male 53.1 50.3 / 58.1 50.9 50.5 / 51.4 51.1 50.6 / 51.1 .14 Female 46.9 41.9 / 49.7 49.1 48.6 / 49.5 48.9 47.9 / 49.4 Child Race/Ethnicity Black 8.0 6.7 / 9.3 14.1 13.6 / 14.0 13.0 12.1 / 14.7 < .001 Hispanic 20.1 14.4 / 24.6 27.8 26.9 / 29.1 28.4 25.4 / 33.5 Other/Multiple 14.5 13.2 / 17.5 12.1 10.5 / 13.0 14.7 11.5 / 17.2 White 57.4 55.2 / 60.5 46.0 45.0 / 47.8 43.9 37.1 / 47.1 Status No 56.9 / 62.5 60.7 59.5 / 61.5 56.6 54.4 / 58.3 .001 Yes 37.5 / 43.1 39.3 38.5 / 40.5 43.4 41.7 / 45.6 Hep B Birth Dose < 1 Providers reported 27.4 22.6 / 29.9 22.1 20.4 / 22.9 25.6 23.0 / 26.9 < .001 1 Provider(s) reported 72.6 70.1 / 77.4 77.9 77.1 / 79.6 No 87.2 89.1 / 91.5 88.8 87.0 / 90.5 .10 Yes 10.1 8.6 / 12.8 9.8 8.5 / 10.7 11.2 9.5 / 13.0 Maternal Age 29 years 31.6 29.0 / 34.5 44.4 39.0 / 48.4 40.2 > 29 years 68.4 65.5 / 71.0 55.6 51.6 / 61.0 59.8 54.7 / 63.5 Maternal Education < 12 years 10.2 8.3 / 13.4 18.6 15.9 / 22.4 16.4 13.9 / 19.1 < .001 12 years (HS degree) 17.7 10.6 / 22.5 27.8 27.1 / 28.9 23.8 21.5 / 25.5 > 12 years, no college 21.3 18.7 / 23.5 23.1 22.5 / 23.7 23.1 21.2 / 25.7 College Graduate 50.8 46.1 / 58.2 30.5 27.3 / 33.8 36.7 35.2 / 38.2 Income/Poverty Status Above, > $75k 44.7 41.8 / 46.9 24.3 20.0 / 28.4 31.3 27.9 / 35.3 < .001 Above, $75k 32.0 31.0 / 33.0 33.5 32.1 / 34.3 32.8 29.7 / 36.7 Below 19.3 14.0 / 23.1 36.3 31.6 / 41.2 30.5 27.0 / 33.4 Unknown 4.0 3.0 / 6.7 5.9 5.2 / 6.3 5.4 2.8 / 8.1 Provider Type All Public 5.7 4.7 / 7.2 13.8 13.1 / 15 .3 10.6 7.8 / 12.7 < .001 All Hospitals 7.6 6.6 / 8.6 12.1 10.7 / 13.6 19.7 18.2 / 22.8 All Private 75.5 71.1 / 78.0 54.3 52.8 / 56.1 51.8 47.4 / 55.6 All Military/Other 5.9 4.9 / 10.3 1.4 0.9 / 2.1 4.8 3.5 / 6.8 Mixed 5.3 4.9 / 5.8 18.4 15.4 / 19.6 13.1 11.1 / 14.7 Unknown/Missing 0.0 - 0.0 - 0.0 - N= 75,346 Hep B birth dose flags are recorded as \"No providers marked Hep B birth dose given\" or \"At least one provider marked that a Hep B birth dose was given\".

This difference is inversely proportional to the women below the poverty line ( 19.3% and 36.3 respe ctively, p < .001). Finally, provider type is associated with IIS participation differences. Private providers comprise 75.5% of the no IIS Participation group compared to only 54.3% ( p < .001) of the IIS Participation group. This difference among IIS Par ticipation was distributed across All Public, All Hospitals, and Mixed provider types. These variables are included in the conceptual model as controls due to the many differences associ ated with IIS participation. Status of invalid doses. Invalid dose tre nds var y widely over the five -year data period. Data in Table 4.3 shows the count and percentage of invalid doses for age, interval, and combined age and interval . Overall, the number of children with invalid doses in the full series due to age and interva l increase s from 2012 (44.2%) to 2016 (50.4%). The two vaccines largely responsible for this increase are the Hepatitis B vaccine (+16.1%) and the Polio vaccine which saw initial decreas es but has been trending upward in the most recent 2016 sample (29.1% in 2012 to 14.8% in 2014 to 20.6% in 2016) mostly due to invalid age at administration. When examining Hep B by interval and age, most of this change in invalid doses is due to age (+16. 0%) when compared to the change in invalid intervals (+2.2%); invalid polio doses follow s a similar trend with initial decreases in invalid age doses from 2012 -2014 ( -14.3%) to increasing rates from 2014 -2016 (+4.7%) and an overall decrease from 2012 to 20 16 (-0.6%). For the other five vaccines, very few changes are seen over the five -year period. Invalid DTaPs decline over time ( -0.6% from 2012 -2016) with improvements in both invalid doses due to age ( -0.6%) and intervals ( -0.5%). The percent of children w ith invalid PCV, Hib, and VRC doses remain largely unchanged (0%, 0%, and -0.1% respectively) over the five -year study period, however, there may be the start of an increasing trend in invalid MMRs due to age (from 71 1.0% invalid in 2012 to 1.4% in 2016). La stly, from the data in Table 3, it is apparent that majority of invali d doses are due to doses that are administered at an age less than the minimum required age criteria published by the ACIP. Table 4.3 Freq uency and Percentage of Children in the 2012 -2016 National Immunizatio n Surveys with Invalid Doses Using ACIP Minimum Required Ages and Intervals Data presented as Number of Children (%) a Children with zero doses reported were excluded from this analysis. b Only 1 MMR and 1Varicella dose is recommended for this age group , however, all doses were evaluated for validity. Logistic regression of IIS participation on invalid doses. Three regression models are employed to examine the relationship betwe en IIS participation and invalid doses for the full series : the probability of having any invalid dose, having any invalid dose due to age, and any invalid dose due to interval as seen in Table 4 . After I determined Hepatitis B as the primary driver of inv alid doses (see Table 4.3), I made the decision to exclude the Hep B doses from the main regression models (Table 4.4) and present them separately in Table 4.5 of the results section of this chapter so as not to bias my interpretation of the regression res ults. Models (1) and (2) ha ve the same sample size (N = 73,189) and differ s from Model (3)'s sample size of N = 72,115 because intervals are calculated from the number of doses, and not 72 every child ha ve the same number of vaccines administered. For the thr ee models tested, the MeKelvey & Zavoina R2 values were similar and ranged f rom explaining 9.8% (Model 1) to 10.2% (Model 2) of the variance of the dependent variables. The regression results using two of the independent variables (\"any invalid\" and \"invalid due to age\") were almost identical, so I focus mainly on discussing inval id doses due to age or interval . Further, an int eraction term between IIS participation and year which resulted in similar coefficients and no statistical significance (data not shown), so the interaction was excluded from the final model. These data show that IIS participation is not a statistically si gnificant predictor of invalid doses for the full series for all three models (Table 4.4). When compared to children who had no providers reporting vaccines to an IIS, some/all IIS participation is not associ ated with invalid doses. State of residence pro vided some of the most interesting results from the regression models , using states' fixed -effects, suggesting that state immunization programs probably have a strong influence on immunization behaviors. In t his study, California is used as the referent st ate because of its size, diversity, and research on immunization programs in the state. For the fifty states, and D.C., aORs varied widely (Mean aOR = 1.48). Children from Rhode Island are associated with the lowest likelihood of any invalid doses ( aOR = 0 .35, 95% CI 0.33 -0.37) to children in North Dakota who are associated with the highest likelihood of any invalid doses (aOR = 4.50, 95% CI 4.17 -4.84) when compared to California . Children from two states (GA, and OR) are as likely as children from California to have any invalid doses. Fifteen (15) states were 73 Table 4.4 Adjusted Odds Ratios of Provider IIS Participation on Invalid D ose Status Excluding Hep B Dose s Logistic Reg.

(N = 33) were associated with higher odds of any invalid doses. Full state -data is available in Appendix D of this chapter. Time is also associated with differences in invalid doses for the full series but with varying results by model. A change in the number of invalid doses between 2013 and 2014, shown in Table 3, is also demonstr ated in the regression results. Compared to 2012, c hildren in the 2014 -2016 NIS are associated with lower odds of having invalid doses due to age (for 2016 the aOR is 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 -0.83) . When evaluating the effect of year on invalid doses due to interval, the trend is not consistent. Children in the 2 013 sample are associated with higher odds (aOR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.34 -1.40) of having an invalid interval dose, but in 2016 are associated with statistically significantly lower odds a(OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.52 -0.57) when compared to children in 2012. Provider types are associated with invalid doses in different ways. Statistically significant differences are seen in the regression results primarily in relation to invalid doses due to age. Those children with \" All Hospital\" ( 95% CI 1.04 -1.40) providers are associated with higher odds of i nvalid doses due to age when compared to those children with \"All Public\" providers. Conversely, those with \"All Militar y/Other\" 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 -0.71) of having invalid doses due to age when compared to those with the public providers. T hose with \"mixed\" provider types are associated with statistically significantly higher odds of invalid doses in all three models. In the invalid interval model, only \"Mixed Providers\" are statistically significant demonstrating an increase when compared t o all public providers ( aOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.43 -75 1.91). As a check on whether multiple providers were influencing the coefficients, I tested a dummy variable that categorized children with one or two identified providers, who all responded to the survey, to control for whether all providers responded, and the results were not different (data not shown). Mobil ity of children who have moved to a state different from where they were born is also associated with statistically higher odds of having invalid doses than children who did not move. Although both types of invalid doses are associated with higher likeliho od in children who have moved, the odds are higher for those invalid doses due to interval ( aOR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.65-2.12) compared to those due to age ( aOR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 -1.37). Receipt of a birth dose of Hep B is also associated with invalid doses. F or example, children who ha ve at least one provider report that the child received a Hep B birth dose have higher odds of an invalid doses due to age ( aOR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 -1.30) but have statistically significantly lower odds of having invalid doses due to interval ( aOR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 -0.81) when compared to those who did not receive the birth dose. Other child -level factors associated with invali d doses are child age group, race/ethnicity, and first -born status. Children in the 25 -29 months and the 30-35 months categories of higher odds of invalid doses due to age and interval compared to children in the 19 -24 months age group . This trend held acr oss all three models. For invalid doses due to age, both 25 -29 months and 30 -35 months groups were assoc iated with increased odds of invalid doses ( aOR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.11 -1.25; and aOR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.19 -1.32 respectively) and for invalid intervals (aOR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 -1.25; and aOR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 -1.29). There was some variability in different c hild race/ethnicit ies regarding invalid doses. When compared to White children, Black children are associated with lower odds of invalid doses due to age ( aOR = 0.90, 95% CI 76 0.83-0.97) while children of Multiple/Other race ethnicity have higher odds of inval id doses due to age ( aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 -1.21). Regarding invalid doses due t o interval, Black, Hispanic, and Multiple/Other racial/ethnic groups demonstrate higher odds of invalid doses ( aOR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.20 -1.66; aOR = 95% CI and aOR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.39 -1.79 respectively). Finally, children who are first-born in their families are more likely to have invalid doses due to age ( aOR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 -1.09) compared to those who ha ve older siblings. Maternal characteristics, includin g age group, income and poverty status, and some levels of education, are also si gnificant predictors of invalid doses. The y ounger maternal age group is associated with higher odds of invalid doses due to interval only ( aOR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 - 1.23). Mate rnal education is only associated with invalid doses due to age. Mothers with les s than high school education, high school degree, and some college but no degree all ha ve similar lower odds of invalid doses due to age when compared with mothers with colleg e degrees (range aOR = 0.87 -0.89, 95% CI range 0.79 -0.95). Finally, mothers who are in the highest income category (Above poverty, > $75k) are associated with lower odds of invalid doses due to interval than all other categories. As income decreased, or as households fell below the poverty line, the association with invalid doses due t o interval increased. Children in families above the poverty line, but income < $75k had an aOR = 1.19 (95% CI 1.08 -1.32) while children below the poverty line had an aOR = 1. 38 (95% CI 1.21 -1.58). Children in families who did not provide their income also had higher likelihood of invalid doses due to interval ( aOR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.82). Association between Hepatitis B vaccinations and invalid doses . In this section, I highlight differences between Hep B doses separate from those I present in Table 4.4 with state data in Appendix E . When including Hep B invalid doses (any, age, and interval) as the 77 dependent variables, IIS participation is associated w ith statistically sign ificant higher odds of having invalid doses when controlling for time, child, maternal, provider, and geographical characteristics. Shown in Table 4.5, t he aORs for invalid Hep B doses due to age and interval in children whose provide rs participated in an IIS are 1.25 and 1.24 respectively (95% CIs 1.08, 1.44 and 1.11, 1.38) compared to children whose providers did not participate . Those children whose providers' IIS participation was unknown, also have higher odds of i nvalid Hep B dos es (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1 .05, 1.34) compared to children whose providers did not participate in an IIS. As demonstrated in Table 4.3, over time, children were associated with higher odds of invalid Hep B doses due to age with the highest odds occurring in 201 5 (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1. 41, 1.47) , though it is unclear if the decrease from 2015 to 2016 (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.14, 1.23) will continue . This trend is in the opposite direction of what is seen in the full models presented in Table 4.4. There were few differen ces in provider type w hen compared to \"All Public\" providers. Children with \"All Private\" providers have lower odds of invalid Hep B doses due to interval (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69, 0.92). Conversely, children with \"All Military/Other\" providers were associate d with significantly h igher odds of having invalid Hep B doses due to age (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.32, 2.15). Maternal characteristics appeared less associated with invalid doses overall except for a few notable differences. Children who have at least one provi der reporting a birth dose of Hep B are associated with significantly higher odds of invalid doses due to age (OR 8.76, 95% CI 6.58, 11.67) compared to children with no reported birth dose. Maternal education and poverty indicators are not strongly associa ted with invalid doses . 78 Table 4.5 Adjusted Odds Ratios of Provider IIS Participation on Invalid Hep B Dose Status Logistic Reg.

Child race/ethnicity and first -born status are similarly associated with invalid Hep B doses as the full models discussed in Table 4.4. Discussion Immunizations are most effective when administered at the appropriate age and intervals betwe en doses (Butte et al., 2001; Stokley et al., 2004) . An increasingly complex vaccination schedule, increased utilization of multiple vaccination providers, and a lack of a unified national infrastructure for documenting and tracking immunizations are all obstacles to improving the accuracy and completeness of immunization histories, the timing and quali ty of vaccines, and increasing overall rates (Stokl ey et al., 2004; Stokley et al., 2001; Yusuf et al., 2002) . This study focuse s on inappropriate vaccinations through a retrospective evaluation of the validity of administered doses using strict interpretation of the ACIP's required ages and intervals bet ween doses and include s the recommended four -day grace period for retrospective review. The literature on invalid doses is scarce and dated and little attention has been paid to link between invalid vaccinations and quality and the potential effect s invali d vaccines have on overall immunity in the population. This study adds to the l iterature on invalid doses by providing an updated analysis of invalid vaccines for the full series including 4 DTaP, 3 Pol, 1 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 HepB, 1 Var, and 4 PCV doses over a five-year period . It also examines the relationship between IISs and invalid do ses using multiple logistic regression modeling and controlling for child, maternal, and geographical factors as well as type of immunization provider(s) and time to better unde rstand how electronic information systems may relate to the quality of vaccinat ions. 80 Over the study period , 49 out of the 50 states, and the District of Columbia, utilized IISs in some capacity. Since IISs have the capability of forecasting needed vaccine s in real -time, using algorithms incorporating the ACIP schedule, it is reasona ble to assume that the improved systems for tracking and documentation of vaccines would lead to decrease s in the numbers of invalid doses. Previously, invalid dose estimates ra nged from 8% to 35.5% (Butte et al., al., Luman et al., 2002; Stokley et al., 2004) , and in this study , which includes more vaccines and stricter adherence to ACIP guidelines for validity as sessments, I estimate that about half of all children in the NIS had at least one invalid dose, mostly due to inappropriate Hepatitis B and Polio vaccination which is consistent with other literature (Butte et al., 2001) . From 2012 to 2016, the rates of invalid doses decli ned slightly for DTaP and were relatively unchanged for MMR, Hib, PCV, and Var ; and overall rates were consistent with previous literature using the 2002 NIS (Stokley et al., 2004) . Frequency of invalid doses for Hepatitis B declined slightly from 2015 to 2016, but that was after a significant increase in rates from 2014 to 2015 and remains a large portion of overa ll invalid doses. Invalid doses for polio increase from 2015 to 2016 and is likely responsible for the overall invalid rate increase in the same time frame. The increases in overall invalid doses in this study may be explained in several ways. First, in th is study, I analyze more vaccines than what was included in previous studies. In 2000, a new vaccine for PCV was licensed for children (The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, n.d.) and would not have been included in the full series in two studies (Butte et al., 2001; Luman et al., 2002) and in the other two studies, a select few vaccines were selected for analysis and did not include the full series (Hamlin et al., 1996; Stokley et al., 2004) . Second, prior studies were not consistent in defining or differentiating invalid doses. For example, Luman et al. 81 (2002) did not evaluate invalid intervals and Stokley et. al. (2004) did not differentiate invalid age from invalid intervals. A third explanation is that, for various reasons, providers are administering doses at inappropriate times and at increasing frequency. There were no schedule changes in the five -year study period that I could associate with the increases in invalid Hepatitis B and Polio doses, so the reasons for these increases are unclear at this time and justify further investigation. The utilization of Immunization Information Systems (IISs) is one strategy wid ely recommended by public health officials to help improve the quality of doses delivered by recommending or forecasting needed vaccines in real -time and reducing vaccination record fragmentation which has the potential to improve the accur acy and complete ness of records (Groom et al., 2015; National Vaccine Advisory Committ ee, 1999) . Idea lly, data from IISs would be utilized to examine the effect of IISs on vaccination rates but currently still suffer from quality concerns and data are frequently incomplete (Khare et al., 2006) . The refore, utilizing a well-validated survey, such as the NIS, to examin e immunization data is more appropriate in this setting. From 2012 to 2016, more than 72% of the children in the sample had providers who reported immunization data to an IIS which allowe d for this analysis. Overall, I f ind no effect of IIS participation on invalid vaccine status, similar to a previous study (Davidson et al., 2003) , when I excluded Hepatitis B doses as an outlier vacci ne. However, when examined separately, I IS participation was associated with higher likelihood of invalid Hepatitis B doses. This is an interesting finding since only two of the three doses in the series were assessed for validity due to age, and all three were utilized in the interval validity determination. There is no minimum age for the birth dose of Hepatitis B and those who had providers that reported these birth doses were associated with higher odds of invalid doses than 82 children whose providers did not report one. Previous studies have d iscussed the complexity surrounding the Hepatitis B schedule, and the difficulty providers had in determining the patient's need for a HepB vaccine (Butte et al., 2001) , however, those recommendations have not changed in recent years and may not explain the significant inc rease in invalid doses especially in light of IISs ability to forecast vaccines that are needed in real -time. One factor that contributed to the frequency of invalid doses is the whether a child received the birth d ose of Hep B, the only vaccine currently recommended at birth. Children with at least one provider reporting that a HepB birth dose was administered were far more likely to have received invalid doses than children whose providers did not report a birth do se, however, that may also be due to the fact that those children were less likely to receive the Hepatitis B sequence overall. This study was unable to account for several potential factors that could influence IIS participation, demonstrated by how litt le variance the regression models explai ned. For example, provider characteristics are largely absent from the NIS. The type of practice of responding providers is available but only in aggregate at the child -level. Therefore, individual providers' behavio rs are not able to be explored with this data set. Providers are instrumental in providing immunization data to the NIS and low response rates and a lack of publicly available information regarding provider practices hinders analysis at the provider level. In the 2016 NIS, only 54.2% of children had adequate provider data so roughly half of children with completed household interviews were excluded from analysis because they lacked immunization data from their provider(s) (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . Second, parental behaviors are not captured in the NIS. I include the receipt of a HepB birth dose, so cioeconomic variables which are linked with attitudes and acceptance of vaccines, 83 and demographics (Luman et al., 2003) to proxy for parental immunization behaviors . Starting in 2012, the NIS ceased asking parents to recall childhood vaccinations in an attempt to increase response rates by shortening the screening in terview (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . However, this inform ation provided insight to parental aware ness of child vaccination status. Finally, since IISs are implemented and governed at the state -level, there is an important relationship between states, year, and IIS participation, which are difficult to uncover w ith the data used in this study. I contr olled for states fixed effects and year fixed effects, but other unobserved variables may have biased the findings of this study. In a study by Davidson et. al. (2003), the authors concluded that the \"p resence of a registry\" was not sufficient to improve vaccination rates, but this was based on three years of data and only evaluated DTaP, Polio and Hib vaccines. Implementing a control for the length of time since I IS implementation may offer additional i nsight into the IISs' impact on UTD status11. Limitations There are several limitations to this study. First, IIS participation was proxied for using a question in the provider record check phase of the NIS. Howeve r, in the public use dataset, the role of the person responding to the survey is not available. Further, for each child in the NIS, data from all providers who responded is aggregated in the public -use file so individual provider participation cannot be as sessed. Since the information is s elf-reported, the data are subject to errors in understanding of the IIS participation at the practice and/or provider level. 1 I attempted to collect the IIS implem entation year for each state IIS, and Washington, D.C., using a literature search, IIS website search, and contacts at AIRA, however data could not be obtained within the time frame for this dissertation. 84 Second, although rigorous criteria were used in determining validity of each dose in the NIS, it was not possible to determine val id \"re -vaccinations\". Therefore, some doses that were administered before the appropriate interval may have been valid if the interval was calculated based on different doses. I attempted to minimize the number of mis -classification errors by providing a c onservative estimate, adding the four -days grace period suggested by the CDC, and using the required ages and intervals for each dose in a series rather than the minimum recommended cutoff values. Third, I was only able t o analyze those with adequate prov ider data (those with immunizations that were reported), and therefore cannot tell if those whose providers did not participate would have changed the outcome. Also, The NIS is not able a viable source of provider -behavior and is not meant to be analyzed a t the provider -level. For the purposes of this analysis, it is possible that providers who chose not to participate in the provider record check phase of the NIS behave differently from those providers who did participate and may have introduced a source o f bias into the results. Fourth, the sample size was relatively small for each state. I attempted to improve the sample size by pooling five years of data, however, my findings demonstrate wide confidence intervals. Lastl y, there are known limitations to the NIS as a source of immunization information. The NIS provides stable and reliable estimates at a national level but is not reliable at the state level. Decreasing response rates by households and providers also add cha llenges in obtaining reliable vacc ine information, however, the NIS utilizes a complex stratified survey design and provides survey and provider weights that adjust for selection and non -response bias. In several cases, imprecise coefficients limited the i nterpretation of the findings. 85 Conclusion Protection against vaccine -preventable diseases relies upon timely and accurate vaccination of the population. Vaccines that are delivered at sub -optimal timing can result in a less robust immune response. Invalid doses are important to the overal l quality of vaccinations; counting all doses, including invalid ones, gives the appearance of being \"vaccinated\" but without the full protection of antibodies that are induced by vaccine exposure and leads to an under -protected community (Luman et al., 2002) . Further, the spread of vaccine -preventable diseases in communities that b elieve they are protected can prop agate vaccine hesitancy and a public perception that \"vaccines are ineffective\". Most i nvalid doses require re -vaccination which can also add significant costs and burden on the health care system (e.g. additional doctor's visits, vaccine supply costs). The findings in this study demonstrate a continued need for improving the quality of vaccination delivery in the U.S . and targeted efforts to reduce the numbers of invalid doses. Immunization information systems are populat ion-based electronic repositories with the capability of improving tracking, documentation, and forecasting of vaccination needs in real - time, but their impacts on the timeliness and quality of vaccine delivery are still emerging. Although these data sugge st that IIS may not c ontribute to reductions in invalid doses, the NIS may not be the optimal dataset to address the question of IIS effectiveness. Efforts to further improve the quality and completeness of IIS data will ultimately allow for more nuanced evaluation of the full impact of IISs on vaccination status at state and local levels. Continued research into the impact of IIS on immunizations will help public health officials, providers, and policymakers determine the amount of investments and strategi es for improvement as the country continues to face increasing numbers of vaccine -preventable outbreaks. 86 Chapter 5 An Examination of Immunization Information Systems' Policies and State-level Vaccination Rates 87 Introduction High levels of vaccination are needed to achieve adequate protection against vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). In 2016, vaccination rates for the full combined series of routinely recommended childhood vaccines missed the Healthy People 2020 target of 80% in children 19 - 35 months of age (Hill et al., 2017; US Department of Health, Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention, & Health Promotion, 20 12). Only 70.7% of children 19 -35 months of age in the U.S. had received the recommended doses for the full combined series including 4 doses of Diphtheria Tetanus and acellular Pertussis (DTaP), 3 doses of Polio (Pol), 1 dose of Me asles, Mumps, and Rub ella (MMR), 3 or 4 doses of Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) depending on the manufacturer, 3 doses of Hepatitis B (Hep B), 1 dose of Varicella (Var), and 4 doses of the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV), which was 1.5 percentage points lower t han 2015 estimates (Hill et al., 2017) . When exami ned separately, rates for Polio, MMR, and Hep B met the Healthy People 2020 individual vaccine targets of 90%; but lower rates were reported for DTaP, Hib, and PCV which was consistent with the decline for the combined series. Declinin g rates and missed vaccination targets represent a continued public health priority and presents an opportunity for improving immunization rates and overall protection against vaccine preventable disease. Several factors contribute to these sub -optimal r ates of vaccination. Among those factors is the lack of an efficient, coordinated way of tracking and documenting vaccinations in the U.S., an important challenge considering the vaccination schedule has become more complex in the number and timing of rout inely recommended vac cines (Stokley et al., 2001) . Documentation of vaccines in a patient's medical chart is mandatory but those records of ten exist only at the provider or clinic -level (Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion, n.d.; Clark et al., 2006) . Additionally, children are seeing multiple vaccine providers with increasi ng frequency creating 88 the opportunity for fragm ented and incomplete records, record scattering across different health records systems, and increases the chances for missed vaccination opportunities (Stokley et al., 2001; Yusuf et al., 2002) . Incomplete records also increase the likelihood that children will receive duplicate vaccines due to an inability to accurately assess individual vaccination status which can lead to over -immunization, increased costs due to th e demand on vaccine supply, and increases in the number of provider visits needed to fully vaccinate a child (Linkins , 2001; Stokley et al., 2004) . Incomplete records can also lead to inappropriate vaccination, or the administration of vaccines at the wrong age or spacing between doses, and oftentimes requires re-vaccination so that an optimal immu ne response and subsequent protection toward VPDs can be achieved (Butte et al. , 2001; Stokley et al., 2004) . At the population -level, incomplete records present challenges when assessing the vaccination coverage at local, state, and national levels. Currently, the U.S. uses the National Immunization Survey (NIS), a nationally representative cross -sectional survey, to estimate the vaccination coverage in children 19 -35 months old and in teens 13 to 17 years old (Centers for Disease Control and Preve ntion; Zell et al., 2000) . However, the delay between data collection and release of survey results, as well as the small sample sizes in each state, makes estimating true vaccination rates challenging (Centers for disease control and Prevention; Hill et al., 2015; Salmon et al., 2006) . Further, although the complex design of the NIS tries to minimize the selection and non -response bias (Zell et al., 2000) , the data may still be subject to inadequate data resulting from record fragmentation, reporting errors, and in complete records leaving a need for more robust data sources. Immunization information systems (IISs) are confidential population -based electronic repositories that house immunization data and are one strategy recommended for reducing record 89 fragmentation and improving immunization rates in the U.S. (Stokley et al., 2001) . They have shown promise in increasing immunization rates by preventing missed opportunities (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) , consolidating fragmented records (Kempe et al., 2001) , decreasing immunization -related costs thr ough reductions in over -vaccination (Feikema et al., 2000) , or reducing re -vaccinations due to inappropriately delivered doses (Stokley et al., 2004) . They also offer the capability of real -time data access (Muscoplat & Rajamani, 2017) which would reduce the delay between data collection and analysis. Over the last three decades, numerous resources have been invested in IISs as a tool to increase vaccination coverage in the U.S. through expansion of their functionality and utility to standardize and coordinate vaccination documentation and tracking (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018b; Groom et al. , 2015) . IISs are operationalized primarily at the state -level and are therefore subject to wide variability in their design, implementation, operation, and utilization (Martin et al., 2015) . As a result, a series of functional standards, as described below, were created to help immunization programs standardize their IISs and allow for some degree of interoperability or functioning across different electronic systems (Immunization Information Systems Support Bra nch within CDC/NCIRD, 2013) . IISs should: 1. Support the delivery of clinical immunization services at the point of immunization. 2. Support the activities and requirements for publicly -purchased vaccine, including the Vaccines For Children (VFC) and state purc hase programs. 3. Maintain data quality (accurate, complete, timely data) on all immunization and demographic information in the II S. 4. Preserve the integrity, security, availability and privacy of all personally identifiable health and demographic data in the IIS. 90 5. Provide immunization information to all authorized stakeholders. 6. Promote vaccine safety in public and private provider sett ings. While the standards have provided structure for operationalizing IISs, and many IIS policies are created to align with the se standards, evaluation of IISs are mostly limited to state - level analyses that may not be broadly applicable (Groom et al., 2015) . Additionally, analysis of data from an IIS is still in early stages and data may not be reliable enough for accurate estimates. There are several studies in the literature regarding specific policies that govern the operation of IISs (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003; Hedden et al., 2012; Horlick et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2015) but the association of state -level policies immunization outcomes is not well -defined in the literature. In this chap ter, I analyze the relationship between policies as proxies for measuring the IIS functional standards and immunization rates at the state -level. To address this research aim, I examine two of the functional standards that guide the implementation and oper ation, supporting the delivery of immunizations at the point of service and data quality using several variables: the ability of states to forecast vaccine recommendations to electronic health records, the type of states' IIS reporting mandates, patient co nsent types, and IIS participation by providers. My working hypothesis is that states that have policies that meet the requirements of the functional standards, and those that encourage participation, will have a higher percentage of children who are up -to-date (UTD) for the full combined series of vaccines compared to states that do not meet the functional standards. 91 Conceptual Framework In this chapter, I analyze the asso ciation between IISs and state immunization rates for the full combined series of rou tinely recommended vaccines which was guided by the conceptual framework in Figure 5.1. F.S.= Functional Standard Figure 5.1 Conceptual Framework for Increasing State Immunization Rates Using Immunization Information Systems The Healthy People 2020 objectives describes several national programmatic immunization goals including an objective to vac cinate 80% of children with the full combined series by the age of two years (Healthy People 2020 [Internet], Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion) . It is large ly up to the individual states to govern their immunization programs and assess the progress and success of interventions designed to improve rat es within the states (Hedden et al., 2012; Horlick et al., 2001) . IIS policies influence state immunization rates b y affecting IIS participation, utilization, or indirectly through operational mechanisms. In 92 this chapter, I focus on Functional Standards 1 and 3 since they are standards specifically related to the utilizatio n of IISs and would theoretically have the lar gest impact on state immunization rates as I explain in the following paragraphs. I examine the ability of IISs to provide clinical decision support at the point of care (described in Functional Standard 1). In teroperability, or the ability of an IIS to co mmunicate with electronic health records (EHRs), is an important component of clinical decision support tools to assist providers with providing the right immunization at the right time (Dayton, 2014) . One type of clinical decision support is the ability of an IIS to \"forecast\" or recommend vaccines using complex algorithms informed by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) immunization guidelines (Muscoplat & Rajamani, 2017) . Theoretically, this would help ensure the patient is receiving the correct vaccination at the recommended age and appropriate interval between doses (Wood et al., 1999) . Clinical decision support tools should also improve the completeness of the vaccination history since forecasts are available at the point of care when EHRs and IISs are interoper able (Muscoplat & Rajamani, 2017) . This would reduce the chance for inappropriate or over -vaccination (Dayton, 2014) and should prevent missed vaccination opportunities whi le the patient is in the provider's office. Participation in IISs is critical for the operation of an IIS. Providers who administer vaccines are the main source of IIS data and directly impacts the level of data accuracy, timeliness, and completeness in a n IIS (described in Functional Standard 3) (Groom et al., 2015; Wood et al., 1999) . Record fragmentation and incomplete records, which happens when there are multiple vaccine providers (Stokley et al., 2001) , delays in reporting vaccines to an IIS (American Immunization Registry Association) , and inco mplete or inaccurate demographic information (Robison, 2015) are associated with lower immunization rates, inappropriately timed 93 doses, or extra doses of vaccines (Hamlin et al., 1996; Stokley et al., 2004; Wood et al., 1999). Providers' participation in IISs is driven by policies such as mandates that may require some or all providers/facilities to report immunizations to an IIS (Hendrickson et al., 2015; Horlick et al., 2001) as well as a provider 's personal beliefs and behaviors toward immunizations and IISs (Gregorio et al., 1997; Kempe et al., 2017) . It is difficult to capture provider behavior toward immunizing patients, so I pr oxy for this by including provider participation rates (Davidson et al., 2003) with the assumption that providers who are less motivated to immunize patients will not participate in IISs. In combinat ion with providers providing information to IISs, patient participation is also necessary. Patient participation occurs through a variety of mechanisms, and in this study, it will be proxied for using the type of IIS consent policy. IISs that us e an explic it \"opt -in\" consent policy require patients/parents to give informed consent to have immunization data sent to an IIS. While this type of consent policy might place more power in the patient's hands with regard to medical data, it also leads to lower parti cipation rates because it requires additional steps taken by the patients and providers to capture and document the consent (Boom et al., 2010) . Implicit consent, or \"opt -out\" policies, assume that consent is provided unless patients choose to have their data opted out of the IIS (Horlick et al., 2001) . This type of policy can lead to higher participation rates (Berry et al., 2013) but often parents are typically less aware of this exchange of pers onal data. Some states have strict mandatory consent policies that do not have an opt -out provision and in theory would have the highest patient participation rates. While the literature surrounding the design and implementation of IISs is robust, there i s a research gap in how well IISs are meeting the functional standards that guide them . This dissertation research explores this gap and adds to the literature on immu nization information 94 systems by evaluating the association between IIS policies and state immunization rates as a measure of IIS success in meeting two of the functional standards. Methods Design. This study was a state -level retrospective analysis of IIS policies and the relationship with state -level immunization rates using secondary data from the 2016 Immunization Information Systems Annual Reports, 2015 IIS Legislative Survey, and the 2016 National Immunization Survey. I utilize descriptive statistics in combination with regression analysis to address the research aim guided by the Conceptual Framework in Figure 1. Study sample. This study includes states (including Washington, D.C.) as the unit s of analysis (N = 51). New Hampshire was excluded because it did not operate an IIS during the study period, 2016, for a final N = 50. City -level IISs, Puerto Rico, and other territories were not considered for inclusion since information about how immuni zation programs and IISs were governed or operated was uncl ear, incomplete, or unavailable at the time of this study. Data sources. This study incorporated data from three sources: the 2016 National Immunization Survey (NIS), the Survey of State Immunizat ion Information System Legislation (IIS Leg) updated in 201 5, and the 2016 Immunization Information System Annual Reports (IISARs). The data sources are described briefly below with specific variables and descriptions for inclusion presented in Table 1. The IIS Leg and IISAR serve as the data sources for informati on on the IIS policies and progress toward meeting functional standards and achieving Healthy People 2020 immunization objectives (Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention, 2018b) . The IISAR is an annual repor t required by recipients of federal vaccine funding (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 95 2018b) . Variables to proxy for the IIS functional stand ards, including clinical decision support, interoperability , and data completeness, were obtained from the IISARs for each state. The IIS Leg survey contain s information specifically on IIS policies. Respondents are state immunization program personnel who are knowledgeable about the implementation and functionali ty of their state's IIS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018b) . IIS policies, such as governing authority, consent and reporting mandates, were used from this data set to proxy for participation in IIS. Information from both surveys are self -reported and respondents supplemented their responses with additional data sources such as census estimates (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2015b) . Finally, state immunization rates w ere estimated from the NIS, the gold standard for immunization data in the United States (Khare et al., 2000) . The N IS is a nationally representative population -based survey of households with children aged19 -35 months and their immunization providers. Full details about the NIS methodology are available elsewhe re in this dissertation. Immunization rates were estimated from the aggregated child -level immunization data collected from providers who participated in the record -check portion of the survey. I merge the IIS Leg and IISAR datasets into a single data file matching on the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) state codes. State -level immunization rates are first estimated in the NIS, as described in the Dependent variable section, and then coded direct ly into the merged data file. Dependent variable. The dependent variable in this study is a state -level estimate for the percent of children 19 -35 months old who are up -to-date (UTD) for the full combined series of vaccines defined as 4 doses of Diphtheria Tetanus and acellular Pertussis (DTaP), 3 doses of Polio (Pol), 1 dose of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella ( MMR), 3 or 4 doses of Haemophilus 96 influenzae b (Hib) depending on the manufacturer, 3 doses of Hepatitis B (Hep B), 1 dose of Varicella (Var), and 4 dos es of the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV). I select the full combined series, rather than another combination of one or more of the vaccines in the series, for two reasons. First, the overall rate of children up -to-date (UTD) for all routinely recommended child hood vaccines has consistently missed immunization programmatic targets (Healthy People 2020 [Internet], Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion) and, secon d, IISs help by reducing record fragmentation and missed opportunities (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003; Muscoplat & Rajamani, 2017) ; using an indicator for whether children received their full -series of vaccines reduces the need for determining whether there were missed opportunities because children who are UTD have received all necessary doses of vaccine . The rates are estimated from the 2016 NIS using the recommendations from the 2016 ACIP child immunization schedule (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2015a) . Aggregated child -level immunizatio n information was collected from providers who participated in the record -check portion of the NIS using provider w eights included in the dataset. Children were included in the estimate if they resided in 49 states (excluding NH) and Washington, D.C., and if they had adequate provider data. Adequate provider data was defined in the NIS as having two or more doses repor ted by at least one provider (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . During the data -verification stage, duplicate doses determined by date of administration were excluded (National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2017) . The full combined series flag is a dichotomous variable within th e NIS that is coded as a Yes/No the child received the full combined series. Based on the state of residence, I estimate the percentage of children in each state that ha ve the full combined series flag. State 97 estimates are comparable to previous state rate s from NIS -based rates from previous years (Hill et al., 2015) . I code th e state-level rates as a continuous variable (0 -100%) into the IIS Leg dataset in Excel using FIPS codes prior to merging the IIS Leg with the IISAR dat a. Independent variables. For this study, I select variables to serve as proxies for measuring how well IISs are achieving IIS Functional Standards (See Table 1). Table 5.1 Independent Variables Definitions and Descriptions Measure Variable Data Source Description Measurement IIS Participation Mandate IIS Leg Item: Are any entities mandated (by legislation, regulations, rules or policy) to report immunizations to the IIS? No Mandate, Partial Mandate, Full Mandate Patient Participation Consent IIS Leg Item: What type of consent is required from a parent before reporting immunization information for their child to your IIS? Implicit, Explicit, Mandatory Provider Participation Private Non - VFC Provider Participation IISAR Questions 40b & 41b: Number of enrolled and reporting Private Non - VFC providers. ) Continuous (0-100%) - Calculated Interoperability Vaccine Forecasting Capability IISAR Question 9: In 2016, did your IIS send an immunization forecast to another system via HL7? Yes/No Participation. State mandate (Mandate), coded as \"no mandate\" if a state did n ot have a reporting mandate or reported that no entities are required to report; \"partial mandate\" include s those states that listed one or more entities (e.g. pharmacies, schools, public enti ties, private entities, VFC providers, schools) but not \"all\"; o r \"full mandate\" if a state require s all immunization providers to report vaccines to an IIS. This data is captured in the IIS Leg Survey in response to the question, \" Are any entities mandate d (by legislation, regulations, rules or policy) to report immun izations to the IIS?\". I include the mandate as one way to examine participation and the relationship between reporting laws on state immunization rates to measure 98 how well IISs maintain accur ate, complete and timely data in an IIS as outlined in Functiona l Standard 3 (Horlick et al., 2001) because requir ed reporting should theoretically improve the comprehensiveness of vaccination records. Consent type is categorized as \"Explicit\" for those states requiring patients to opt -in, \"Implicit\" for those states requiring patients to \"opt -out\", and \"Mandatory\" f or states that require participation. Consent policies determine whether patients, or parents/guardians, allow their immunization data to be sent to an IIS and directly affects the completeness of records within the IIS (Murthy et al., 2017) ; it can be thought of as less restrictive if patients have to manually provide explicit consen t, or most restrictive if participation is mandatory. Of the 13 states with mandatory consent policies, only one state (MA) allow s patients to opt out under specific circumstances and is included with the other mandatory consent states. This information is drawn from the IIS Leg survey in response to the question, \" Wha t type of consent is required from a parent before reporting immunization information for their child to your IIS?\" Provider participation is necessary for the success of an IIS (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003; Kim et al. , 2007) , particularly in the private sector (Linkins & Feikema, 1998) State participation rate for private non -Vaccines For Children (VF C) providers is included as a continuous variable (0-100%). The VFC prog ram is a federally funded program and provides routinely recommended vaccines to uninsured/underinsured children, children on Medicaid, Alaskan Natives, and American Indians (Rein, Honeycutt, Rojas -Smith, & Hersey, 2006) . Provider participation is collected in the IISARs as four different rates: public VFC providers, public non -VFC providers, private VFC providers, and private non -VFC providers (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2015b) . 99 Because many of the partial mandates req uire public and/or VFC providers to report data to an IIS (Centers for Disease Control & P revention, 2015b; Horlick et al., 2001) , I expect the public and VFC provider rates to be highly correlated both with each other and with the mandate variable. I select \"Private non -VFC provider\" rates because they are the providers least likely to be man dated to report immunizations to an IIS, as they are not participating in programs using federal funding for vaccines, and generally have lower participation rates compared to VFC providers (data not shown) (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) . Participation rates by these providers would provide a conservative estimate of the effect of provider participation on state immunization rates. I calculate the private non -VFC provider participation rate by dividing the number of actively participating providers by the number of enrolled providers in an IIS. One state (SC) did not report private provider rates so I impute a rate using mean substitution (Donders, Van Der Heijden, Stijnen, & Moons, 2006) in order to retain SC in the model. I test the model with and without S C to ensure that the imputed value would not introduce bias. I utilize th e private non -VFC provider participation rate as a second proxy for data completeness because as provider partici pation increases, so should the overall number and completeness of the records in an IIS. Interoperability. I include a binary variable for whether IISs actively sen d vaccine forecasts to providers' EHRs to proxy for the capability of an IIS to support the delivery of vaccinations at the point of care as described in Functional Standard 1. Improving immunization rates is partially dependent on accurately identifying the vaccines recommended for a specific patient, and then administering those doses at the right age and interval between doses (Dayton, 2014) . At the state level, this can be accomplished by policies that guide the interoperability between IISs and provider EHRs (Dayton, 2014) . Forecasting capability is collected by IISAR 100 respondents' answers to the question, \"In 2016, did your IIS send an immunization forecast to another system via HL7?\", a standard language for messaging between electronic systems (HL7 International, n.d.) . An answer of \"Yes\" means t hat the IIS sent at least one vaccine forecast directly to a provider's electronic health record while \" No\" means it either did not have the capability or has the capability but is not currently being utilized by the IIS . An IIS's forecasting ability suppo rts providers by enabling them to deliver vaccines at the point of care during an office visit and improves the quality of the vaccines by ensuring compliance with the vaccine schedule and helps prevent missed vaccination opportunities (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003) . Analysis. The analysis plan for this study includes summary statistics and multiple linear regression to add ress the research question. For summary statistics, I present frequencies in Table 5.2 for mandate type, consent type, ability to send vaccine forecasts, and display the range of rates for private non -VFC provider participation. I also present these data b y state in Table 5.3. I utilize two robust multiple linear regression models to examine the association between IIS policies for reporting mandate, consent t ype, interoperability, and the private non -VFC provider participation rates, and state -level UTD ra tes for the full combined series of childhood vaccines using two models shown below. In Model 1, I examine the direct effects between a reporting mandate, co nsent type, interoperability, and provider participation, and the state immunization rates for the full combined series. It is possible there is an interaction because policies and laws governing IISs often intersect with each other in complicated ways (Hedden et al., 2012) . In Model 2, I exa mine the interaction between mandate and consent and report the predicted probabilities using the Stata margins command for this interaction in Figure 5.2. To 101 determine if predicted rates were different from each other, I examine the 95% confidence interva ls for overlap. In the regression model below, italicized variables are continuous and bolded varia bles represent those categorical variables with more than two categories for each state i: Model 1: state_rate i= 5*PrivNonVFCrate i5 + i 0 is the estimated state up -to-date vaccina tion rate for the full combined series associated with no mandate and holding all other variables constant at zero; \"Mandate\" is the presence and type of mandate each state utilizes for reporting vaccinations to an IIS; \"Consent\" is the type of consent pol icy for each state for patient p articipation; \"Mandate X Consent\" is an interaction term between the mandate and consent variables and is included because of potential for one policy, such as a \"full\" or strict mandate requiring everyone to participate , increasing the likelihood of anoth er strict policy such as consent type; \"VaxForecast\" is whether an IIS forecasts vaccine needs to provider EHRs; and \"PrivNonVFCrate\" is the percentages of private non-VFC providers who participate out of the number who enro lled in a state IIS. All analyse were performed with Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp, 2017) . Results Summary statistics. The average state rate for receipt of the full combined vacci ne series in children 19 -35 mont hs of age is 74.1% with the lowest rate (66.1%) in West Virginia and the highest rate (85.8%) in Maine. 102 Summary statistics for the predictor variables are shown in Table 5.2. Nineteen states reported no provider mandate to report vaccines to an IIS. Of th e 31 states with a mandate, 18 (58.1%) had a full mandate requiring all immunization providers to report immunizations to an IIS and 13 (41.9%) required at least one, but not all, providers to report immunizations. Five (10% ) of states required Explicit co nsent for patient's immunization data to be sent to an IIS while many states (N = 32) operated under an Implicit consent policy. Thirteen states (26%) have a consent policy mandating that child immunization data be reported to an IIS.

When examined together, absence of a mandate and implicit consent occurred most frequently (N = 15) followed by partial mandate and implicit consent (N = 11) and full mandate with mandatory consent (N = 9). Two states, MO and NC, have no reporting mandate for providers but reported mandatory consent policy for patients' 103 participation. Partial mandates with Explicit and Mandatory co nsent policies are only reported in one state each, KS and OR respectively. States are divided in their ability to forecast vaccines to provider electronic health systems; twenty states (40%) s ent vaccine forecasts while thirty states (60%) did not demonst rate interoperability by sending vaccine forecasts to providers. Private non -VFC provider participation rate, calculated from the number of providers reporting two or more immunizations out of the total number enrolled, average s 56.1% across the states wit h the lowest reported rate (0%) in three states: CT, ME, and SD and the highest reported rate (100%) in RI.

For every 10% increase in participation, states' UTD rates would be expected to decrease by 0.7 percentage points ( p = .004, 95% CI -0.12, -0.02). The 56.1% mean private non -VFC provider rate (Table 5.3) mean s that in states with the average rate of participation, there would be a decrease of 4.9 percentage points on the UTD state rate compared to st ates where no private non -VFC providers 105 participated in an IIS. Private non -VFC providers do not participate in f ederally funded vaccine programs so their participation would be based largely on existing reporting mandates and their own behaviors, however, multi -collinearity between the mandate and non -VFC private provider rate was not demonstrable with this data. In Model 2 (Table 5.4) , the interaction between mandate and consent is statistically significant for partial mandate, but consent types did not v ary in states with no mandate. Using marginal effects, the mean predicted state UTD rate s for the interaction bet ween IIS mandate and consent policies (shown in Figure 5.2) are all statistically significant with an R2 = .4523. Figure 5.2 Predicted Up -to-Date Rates for the Interaction between Mandate Type and Consent Policies Using Margins State UTD rates varied by consent types dependent on the type of reporting mandate that was present. Overall, based upon the confidence intervals, the highest predicted rates would be expected in states with no mandate and either i mplicit (95% CI 73.9, 77. 9) or mandatory consent (95% CI 71.2, 84.6) , partial mandate with either 80.2) or Implicit (95% CI 72.8, 76.0) consent, and states with a full mandate and Mandatory (95% CI 72.0, 77.0) 106 consent. The lowest pre dicted rates are expected in states with No mandate and Explicit (95% CI 64.8, 75.2) consent, Partial mandate with Mandatory (95% CI 68.0, 71.2) consent, or Full mandates with Explicit (95% CI 61.7, 80.0) or implicit (95% CI 68.1, 71 .6) consent. Within sta tes that had no reporting mandate, rates generally increased as consent policies became more restrictive. Within states with no mandate, Explicit consent was predicted to have lower state UTD rates of 70.0% (95% CI 64.8, 75.2) than I mplicit (75.9%) and Man datory (77.9%) consent types which had overlapping confidence intervals (95% CI 73.9,77.9 and 71.2, 84.6 respectively) . The opposite trend is predicted in states with partial mandates. In these states, the predicted UTD rates are hig hest in Explicit (78.5% , 95% CI 76.9, states (69.6%, 95% CI 68.0, 71.2) . For states with full reporting mandates, there is no difference between Explicit and Implicit consent as their confidence intervals overla p (95% CI 61.7, 79.7 an d 68.1, 71.6 respectively), but mandatory consent policies were associated with higher predicted UTD rates at 74.5% (95% CI 72.0, 77.0) . the mean rates (None/Explicit, None/Mandatory, and Full/Explicit) have wide c onfidence intervals , likely due to the small number of states in those groups (Table 3), so I interpret these results with some caution. Discussion The U.S. consistently misses immunization targets published as part of the Healthy People Initiative. Utili zation of IISs has been suggested as a strategy to improve vaccination rates by forecasting recommended vaccines in real -time for specific patients at the point of care and reducing record fragmentation by consolidating all immunizations in a confidential population -based centra lized repository (Groom et al., 2015; Hedden et al., 2012; Stokley et al., 2001) . Previously, literature has highlighted the challenges with variation s in the design and 107 implementation of IISs at the state -level (Freeman & DeFriese, 2003; Hedden et al., 2012; Horlick et al., 2001) which ultimatel y led to the development of Functional Standards to guide the IIS implementation process (Groom et al., 2015) . The complex dynamics between federal, state, and local policies governing IISs and immunization data further complicate the ev aluation the success of these systems (Martin et al., 2015) . Policies governing the current IISs have been described in detail elsewhere by Horlick et al. (2001) , but the connection between states' policies and outcomes (immunization rates) are less clear and t here is scant evaluative literature on how well IISs are meeting the functional standards. This study contributes to the literature on IISs in three ways. First, I address a research gap in IIS evaluation research through an examination of policies governi ng the participation in IISs and state immunization rates . Individu ally, I find little association between mandate policies or consent types and UTD rates consistent with other literature on the effect of mandate types (literature on the effects of consent on immunization rates were not identified) (Kim et al., 2007; Mennito & Darden, 2010) . However, I do find a statistically significant interaction between mandate policy and consent types that has not been previously reported in the literature. Trends for the predicted rates vary by consent type depending on mandate category and were uniquely different for each mandate type . In states with no reporting mandate , predicted rates increase as consent type becomes more restrictive (from explicit to mandatory), however, a decreasing predicted rate is associated in states with partial mandates - higher UTD rates in explicit consent states and lowest rates in states wit h mandatory consent. In states with a full mandate, there appeared to be no difference between implicit and explicit but man datory consent was associated with higher UTD rates. 108 These findings add a new perspective to the a vailable literature on IIS consent policies which has largely focused on how consent types relate to patient participation and costs associated with obtaining patient consent . Patient or parental consent is related to whether immunization data is included in an IIS (Hedden et al., 2012) and directly impacts the completeness of immunization records since non -participation can result in record fragmentation for those with multiple providers . Implici t and mandatory consent types are associated with higher participation (and inclusion of rec ords) compared to explicit opt -in consent , though higher participation does not necessarily mean higher immunization rates as demonstrated in this study . In a rando mized -controlled trial by Berry et. al, only 4% of parents opted out of an IIS compared to the explicit arm where only 21% of parents opted -in when extra steps were required for action (Berry et al., 2013) . Boom et . al. explain that the effort, time, and cost required by health care officials and parents to opt -in are barriers to participation (Boom et al., 2010; Horlick et al., 2001) . It is plausible that parents who volunt arily participate have different immunization behaviors than those who do not; the same can be hypo thesized about parents who go through the effort to opt out of an implicit consent system though that rate is considerably lower. Additionally, the studies by Kim et. al. (2007) and Mennito et. al. (2010) on the association between IIS mandates and immunization rates are more than ten years old. This means IISs have had the opportunity to mature and mandates more time to have effects on provider participation . However, the persistent finding of no associati on between mandate and immunization rates seems to suggest that there is more to the story than policy alone. Efforts should be made to improve data quality and providers ' awareness about IISs and to have additional opportunities to comply with reporting m andates. My findings suggest that further 109 examination into the relationship between providers and parents may provide additional insight for improving rates and I discuss provider participation in the follow ing paragraphs. Participation in IISs is necessar y by providers and patients to achieve complete, timely, and accurate immunization records in an IIS (Davidson et al., 2003; Kempe et al., 2001) , a component of IIS Functional Standard 3. This study adds to the growing literature on provider participation in IISs. I found that increases in private non -VFC provider participation demonstrated a statistically significant negative associat ion with state immunization rates for the full combined series of vaccines. Increasing provider participation rate would theoretically improve the quantity of data included in an IIS which should improve the completeness of records (Groom et al., 2015) in alignment with IIS Functional Standard 3 , however, I found an inverse relationship. Several factors could contribute to this unexpected fi nding. Provider behaviors toward vaccinatio ns can impact immunization rates and may affect IIS participation it also influences parental immunization behaviors as they have been cited as the most important source of immunization information (Gellin, Maibach, & Marcuse, 2000; Taylor et al., 1997) . While reporting mandates are meant to increase provider participation by requiring different entities to report vaccinations to an IIS, one study showed that, in spite of a mandate, many providers do not participate (Groom et al., 2015) suggesting a behavior component to partic ipation . Most states (67%) do not have enfor cement procedures in place to ensure compliance with the mandate, though four states (AR, AZ, MI, and WV) do have penalties such as fines for not participating (Horlick et al., 2001) . Additionally, some states may incentiv ize providers into enrolling in their IISs in order to increase participation rates in the IIS (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008) . In states with penalties, overall provider participation was 79 110 to 86% (national mean = 68% across all provi der types) , except in WV which had a participation rate of 29% (data not shown) , suggesting that mandates with penalties may not have universal effects . As previously mentioned, IIS participation was not associa ted with UTD rates in this study except for lower odds when providers were unclear of their IIS participation, which may indicate a lack of knowledge about the availability and capabilities of IISs (Kempe et al., 20 17). Previous research offers so me support to this finding through reports of providers not utilizing IISs to their full potential (Clark et al., 2006) , but specifics about how providers are utilizing IISs in practice remains a persistent gap in the literature an d outside the scope of this disse rtation (Groom et al., 2015) . These findings suggest a possible associati on extending beyond policy and includes participant behavior, and the dynamics of provider -participant relationships. This study also adds to the literature on IIS interoperability and immunization rates as a third contribution . I find that states' abiliti es to forecast immunization to provider EHRs through IISs is not associated with state UTD rates. Interoperability between IISs and electronic health records has been previously documented as an important step in improving the completeness and accuracy of patients' immunization historie s (Groom et al., 2015) . The IISs' ability to forecast vaccines to provider EHRs is used as a proxy for interoperability, theoretically improving immunization delivery at the point of care as laid out in Functional Standard 1 . The literature suggests that forecasting vaccination needs to EHRs is important at the point of care to a ssist physicians with preventing missed opportunities and ensuring completion of the series on the age-appropriate schedule (Hinman et al., 2007) . However, I identified only one study that tests the ability of IIS vaccine forecasting to improve rates (Bluml et al., 2017) . 111 While Bluml et al. (2017) demonstrated improvements in the rate of adult influenza vaccines in a proactive study with pharmacists , I fo und no effect between the ability to forecast and UTD rates. Aside from methodological differences including a localized geographic region (Washington State), examination of a single vaccine rather than a complex series of routine vaccines, and differences in population, o ne possible explanation for the discordant results may be differences in IIS functionality. IISs are implemented in stages and because of variation in policies and resources, the systems mature at different rates (Linkins & Feikema, 1998 ). It is possib le that Bluml and colleagues benefitted from utilizing a more mature IIS as compared with other states. Washington State's IIS was implemented in 1998 around the same time as large investments in IIS infrastructure occurred by the federal and states' gover nment (Hinman et al., 2007) . Limitations My study is af fected by several limitations and I interpret my findings with caution as a result of these challenges. First, because this is a state -level analysis, my sa mple size of N= 50 increases the likelihood of type II errors and limits the statistical power. New Hampshire was excluded because it did not operate an IIS in 2016 . South Carolina did not collect data on private providers in the IISARs , so I used mean sub stitution to impute the private provider non -VFC rat e as described earlier . I tested the model with this rate and without SC included to test for an introduced bias and the results were similar . Second, I am cautious about the findings for the mandate and consent variables on UTD state rates. In Model 1, states with \"no mandate \" were associated with statistically significantly higher UTD rates compared with states with full mandates, a finding that is counterintuitive to the conceptual framework and findin gs in other studies. One potential explanation is that there is 112 an omitted variable that has not been identified or for which data is not available at this time. Omitted variables are correlated both with the error term and the dependent variable which biases the coefficient on the independent variable. I tried to reduce this bi as, without success, in the following ways: First, I considered whether states had expanded their Medicaid programs which would increase access to vaccines through the Vaccines For C hildren program and thus increase state immunization rates. Second, I cons idered whether the state was utilizing a \"home - grown\", or state -designed IIS, or if a known vendor with standardized infrastructure across multiple deployments was utilized which mig ht impact the operation and functional capability of a state's IIS. Third, I examined whether immunization exemption policies or exemption rates were influencing state immunization rates and found no statistically significant effect. Fourth, I examined whe ther political ideology, which have known differences in approaching vacci ne policies (Baumgaertner, Carlisle, & Justwan, 2018) , were affecting state immunization rates and found no association in my model. Lastly, I examined the effects of using a dichotomous mandate variable for any mandate or none and while results were consistent with the literature and found no association between mandate and UTD rates, the dichotomous variable treats states with partial mandates (who may require as f ew as one entity type to report to an IIS) the same as states that require s all immunization entities to report to the IIS and I want to explore the relationships of different types of mandates. Provider participation rates are self-reported by state immu nization program staff on the annual IISAR and were subject to errors in reporting as states may not have an adequate way to estimate provider participation . Three states reported a private non -VFC participation rate of 0.0% ( CT, ME, SD ) which seems unlike ly. I did not impute these values with the mean as these states provided a value unlike SC which left the question blank. Further, \"participation\" was 113 defined in the IISAR as the submission of two or more vaccines and I was unab le to determine the extent o f provider participation. It is possible that providers enrolled and sent minimal vaccines to the IIS, perhaps because of a reporting mandate, but do not routinely participate in IISs. It is also unclear if provider participatio n is ever re -evaluated for p articipation gaps once providers have sent immunizations. Finally, both the IIS Leg and IISAR data are self -reported by immunization program staff and are subject to errors. The CDC offers support in completing the se surveys and conducts follow -up intervie ws to verify any inconsistencies in reported data to identify and correct errors. Conclusion Immunization information systems are useful tools to consolidate fragmented records and improve overall immunization rates, however, the dynamic interactions bet ween policy, providers, and patients add a layer of complexity to the evaluation of IISs. In this study, I evaluate the association between IIS reporting mandates, consent policies, interoperability and provider participation. I find that consent types hav e different relationships with states' UTD rates dependent upon the state mandate. Further, private non -VFC provider rates are negatively associated with UTD rates. Together, these suggest a unique relationship between policy, participation, and the provid er-patient relationship that is worth further exploration. Finally, while interoper ability is important for improving the communication between IISs and electronic health records, I find no association between sending vaccine forecasts to an EHR and UTD ra tes at the state -level. My findings are consistent with previous literature expand s on the knowledge that exists about IISs and their potential for improving immunizations in the U.S. 114 Chapter 6 Conclusions 115 In the United States, immunization rates have consisten tly missed targets set forth by the Healthy People Initiative. Contributors to thes e sub -optimal rates are multi -faceted and include: 1) inefficient tracking and documentation of immunizations leading to incomplete or fragmented records and creates the pot ential for over -vaccination, 2) missed opportunities and the inability to determine vaccine needs at the point of care leading to under -immunized populations, and 3) the use of unapproved alternative vaccines schedules resulting from growing hesitancy amon g parents and providers. Coordinated investments into the design and implementation of immunization information systems (IISs) have led to widespread adoption of these electronic repositories to improve immunization rates. Previous research has demonstrate d mixed results in the effectiveness of IISs to improve immunization rates. The ai m of this dissertation was to examine the relationship between immunization information systems and vaccinations for the full combined series of seven routinely recommended vaccines in U.S. children 19 -35 months of age. Specifically, I conducted three related studies to examine the association between IIS policies and participation on child up -to- date status, invalid doses, and state -level UTD immunization rates. I focused on the utilization of IISs as well as policies as they relate to the functional stand ards that guide the operation of state IISs in the U.S. In two of the studies, I also controlled for provider type, and child and maternal factors that are known to affect i mmunizations. In studies 1 and 2, I use data from the National Immunization Survey and logistic regression modeling to examine the association between provider IIS participation and the probability of a child having the full combined series of vaccines and whether that participation was related to the probability of having invalid doses. In study 3, I use data from the IIS Legislative Survey, the IIS Annual Reports, and the National Immunization Survey and linear regression modeling to examine the relations hip between state -116 level provider reporting mandates, parental consent types, intero perability of IISs, and private provider participation on the state UTD rates. Summary of Findings In Chapter 3, I evaluated the link between IIS participation and child UTD status. I found no association between IIS participation and child UTD status. Chi ldren whose providers were uncertain of their IIS participation, however, were associated with lower odds of child UTD. These findings are valuable as it demonstrates that e ven as IISs have had the opportunity to mature, the predicted relationship between IIS participation and improved immunization rates is still not able to be demonstrated. In Chapter 4, the relationship between IIS participation and invalid immunizations w as examined. First, I provided an updated analysis over a five -year period on the s tate of invalid doses and demonstrated that invalid doses are still problematic. Almost half of all children had at least one invalid dose between 2012 and 2016. This is an important finding because current immunization estimates count all doses and doses that are administered too young, or too close together, may not stimulate a robust immune response. This leaves a child under -protected and may contribute to VPD outbreaks. Secondly, this study demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between IIS participation and invalid doses. Children whose providers participated in an IIS were associated with lower odds of invalid doses. This finding suggests that providers who access an IIS may be benefitting from the vaccine forecasting features that info rm a physician of vaccine needs. Lastly, in Chapter 5, I analyzed the effect of an IIS provider mandate, patient consent policy type, vaccine forecasting feature, and priva te non -VFC provider participation rate and the relationship to states' UTD rates. I found no direct effect between mandate and consent on state 117 UTD rates except for those states with no reporting mandate. In non -mandated states, UTD rates were 4.0 percenta ge points higher than states with full mandates. I also found a significant interac tion between mandate and consent type. States with no mandate and mandatory consent demonstrated the highest mean predicted UTD rates. Taken together, these findings suggest that provider participation is important for success, but a mandate may not be the best way to compel participation. For patients/parents, mandatory consent for participation in an IIS offers the highest benefit. Relationship between IIS participation an d immunization rates and quality Together, Chapters 3 and 4 examined the effect of IIS participation on child UTD status and the probability of having an invalid dose. I hypothesized that IIS participation would be associated with increased probabilities o f child UTD status and lower probability of invalid doses. Taken together, I fail t o reject the null hypotheses for these two questions, however, there was value in the findings. Similar to previous studies that examined IIS participation (Kim et al., 2007; Mennito & Darden, 2010) , I found that IIS participation was not associated with the probability of a child being UTD for their full combined vaccine series. In Australia, following the implementation of an IIS an d two years later an incentive pro gram for participation, an increase in immunization rates of almost 30% was demonstrated (Groom et al., 2015) . In 1995, the CDC launched a quality improvement program, AFIX, to help providers increase immunization rates and incentivized provider participation in IISs. Studies by Kim et. al. (2007) , and Mennito and Darden (2010 ), were conducted nearly ten years after the start of AFIX, and this dissertation work more than 20 years after its implementation. Failure to reject the null of no association between IIS participation and child UTD status persists despite the predicted t heory of 118 association. Further, my finding that children whose providers were uncertain of their IIS participation status were associated with lower odds of child UTD supports the work done by Kim et. al. (2007). These findings indicate that other factors, aside from participation, led to increases in immunization rates in Australia and have yet to materialize in the U.S. While there was no effect between IIS participation and child UTD status, there was a statistically significant and unique relationship be tween IIS participation and the od ds of having invalid doses that was not previously reported in the literature. Children whose providers participated in IISs were associated with lower odds of having invalid doses due to age or interval compared to those children whose providers did not p articipate. From 2012 -2016, invalid doses were largely driven by Hep B doses which led to separate analyses for Hep B. For Hep B doses, children whose providers participated in an IIS were associated with higher odds of invalid doses compared to those whos e providers did not use an IIS. Invalid Hep B doses have a history of being related to invalid doses (Luman et al., 2002; Stokley et al., 2004) . This is the first finding demonstra ting a relationship between IIS participation and immunizations, so I am cautious about the interpretation that IIS participation leads to higher rates of invalid doses due to the complex history behind Hep B invalid doses in the literature. States and res idential mobility relative to immunizations Most discussions on immunization rates occur nationally and state -level discussions. However, immunization programs, and IISs, are operationalized at the state -level or local levels and would be expected to have policies, programs, economic, and environmen tal factors that affect immunization rates. My research found significant variation across the states with respect to estimated immunization rates, invalid doses, and how policies and participation were associate d with immunizations. I selected California as the reference state for studies 1 and 2 119 because it is a large, diverse state with a relatively high UTD immunization rate (79.9%). Taken together, 28 states were associated with increased UTD odds but were als o associated with significantly higher odds of invalid doses compared to California. This finding suggests that some states may focus on the delivery of vaccines without regard to the timing or appropriateness of doses as all doses are counted in estimate s of coverage. Interestingly, 13 states with increased UTD odds were associated with lower odds of invalid doses suggesting that high rates and appropriateness of doses were considered. These findings suggest there could be public health priorities, polici es, or programs that exist to help states achieve higher quality immunizations. The findings could also indicate a difference in IIS maturity or availability of features, or an increased provider awareness of IISs and their capabilities. Residential mobil ity, residing in a state different from wher e a child was born, was also statistically significant for lower odds of child UTD and higher odds of invalid doses, consistent with the literature (Stokley et al., 2004; Stokley et al., 2001) . Thes e children were less likely to have adequate provider data; those without adequate data were excluded from the studies. This difference in adequate data likely reflects the problem of record scattering and fragmentation, or a difference in provider behavio rs toward immunizations (Dayton, 2014; Gaudino et al., 2002; Stokley et al., 2001) . Together, these findings contribu te valuable insight into the role of states on immunizations. Provide rs' IIS participation and behaviors toward immunizations Provider participation is mandatory for IISs to be effective, however, my findings, in conjunction with the literature, demonstrat e that not all provider participation is equal. Providers can be cate gorized in several ways: public vs. private, VFC provider vs non -VFC provider, 120 pediatrician vs. general practitioner vs. other immunization provider, or any combination listed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018a) . Although public providers are associated with lower immunization rates (Luman e t al., 2002) , private providers generally have lower participation rates than public providers (Gaudino et al., 2002) and may explain the following findings. In Chapters 3 and 4, I found no association between IIS participation and child UTD status or invalid doses for the full series, which appears counter to the claim that provider participation is necessary for improving immunizations rates. To add further complexity, in Chapters 3 and 4, children with \"All priv ate\" providers were associated with higher odds of child UTD status and higher odds of invalid doses. In Chapter 5, I found a negative association between private non -VFC provider participation and state UTD rates further supporting that idea. Participati on in the VFC program is not a ssociated with improved immunization rates (Kim et al., 2007) . Often, public providers participate in the VFC program since they frequently receive state and federal funds for either M edicaid and/or VFC eligible patients (Dayton, 2014; Wood et al., 1999) . In this dissertation, I did not include VFC provider rates in Chapter 5 because of the potential for multi -collinearity with the provider mand ate. Mandates often specific that VFC recipients must report immunizations. However, my inclusion of a private non -VFC provider group is the first to categorize providers using multiple factors. This adds valuable insight for health officials trying to det ermine which providers may benefit from intervention s to increase awareness and IIS participation might be needed. Lastly, provider participation may be influenced by individual provider beliefs (Dayton, 2014; Gaud ino et al., 2002) . This is supported by the findings in Chapter 5 that found the greatest effect on state UTD rates in states with no reporting mandate. It is possible that when states do not require participation, those that choose to participate are mor e engaged in immunizations 121 than those that are required to report but do not have intrinsic desire to do so , supporting the claim in the literature that mandates result in lower rates (Madewell et al., 2017) . Limi tations There were limitations to this work. First, the primary source for immunization data in the U.S. is the National Immunization Survey. Although the NIS is nationally representative and utilizes complex stratification, the cross -sectional design prev ents causal analyses. The CDC and NCIRD employ severa l strategies to compensate for selection and non -response bias, as well as several quality measures to reduce errors in data collection. However, the survey relies on parents to accurately identify all i mmunization providers for the provider record check p ortion of the survey. Additionally, the record check portion of the survey is subject to additional non - response bias and reporting errors in the self -reported immunization data. Although survey and provider weights were utilized where possible, I noted se veral differences in the groups that had adequate provider data and were included in the study compared with those who did not have adequate data. The NIS variables are available as mostly categorical va riables and provider data is aggregated at the child -level which limits the analytical abilities. Policy Implications and Conclusion This dissertation research adds to the growing literature on IIS evaluation by examining the relationships of IISs on vacc ination status. First, this work supports previous wo rk done on IIS participation on UTD status as well as adds new findings not previously reported on. Earlier work suggests no effect but over time, I expected that effect to materialize in alignment with IIS proponents' claims and work in other countries. M y study supports the previous authors' work of no effect of IIS participation on child UTD status after controlling for provider type, state of residence, maternal, and child factors. It also supports th e finding that there is a persistent 122 knowledge gap ab out IISs. Children with providers who were uncertain of their IIS participation were associated with lower UTD odds. This work contributes new insights into the role of IIS participation on immunization quality by finding that IIS participation was associa ted with lower odds of a child having invalid doses. These findings were driven largely by residential mobility and invalid Hepatitis B doses. Second, this dissertation contributes to the literature by e xpanding the knowledge of how IIS policies affect sta te-level UTD rates. Few studies have examined the impact of policies such as mandate and consent type on UTD status and none have examined the impact of vaccine forecasting on state UTD rates for the ful l combined series. While my findings support the literature of no effect of mandate type or consent policies, I did identify a statistically significant interaction between mandate and consent that offers additional insight into how policies may interact w ith each other to affect immunization rates. As manda tes influence provider participation, and consent influences patient participation, this interaction highlights the importance of the provider -patient dynamic. The third contribution this dissertation ma kes is by adding information about the role of the st ates in immunization work. While the previous contribution focuses on the state IIS policies, there were notable differences the role of states on immunization rates and invalid doses that extends beyond IIS policies. Taken together, the findings from the two studies on IIS participation and UTD status and invalid doses resulted in interesting findings. Compared to California, a state that has a diverse population, and higher immunization rates, only four states were associated with lower odds of child UTD and three states showed no effect. However, of the remaining 41 states and association of higher UTD status, 28 states were associated with higher odds of invalid doses. This finding is particularly inte resting because it suggests that 123 states are focusing on the numbers of vaccines rather than appropriate or quality vaccination. Thirteen states had higher child UTD odds but lower odds of invalid doses which suggests higher rates and higher quality of immu nization. Overall, this dissertation work demonstrat es the wide variation among states and their IISs on immunizations in the U.S. Improvement efforts should be focused on improving the quality of immunizations by reducing invalid doses and increasing pro vider awareness and participation in IISs. Further, I IS policymakers should take into consideration the interactions between different policy statutes. The lack of a reporting mandate was associated with higher participation rates than full mandates, when examining the interaction with consent policies, highlighting the influence of provider behavior on immunization rates and the provider -parent dynamic. Future Directions The studies in this dissertation contributed in several meaningful ways to the IIS literature and stimulated ideas for future research ques tions. First, the wide variation of the between the relationship of states and immunization status raises questions about the effects of IISs on individual vaccine rates and invalid doses. It is possible that IISs are more effective on doses that are deliv ered on a similar schedule (DTaP, Hib, and Polio for example) than trying to accommodate the full combined vaccine series. Second, when considering the child UTD status and invalid doses together, the re sults did not always align with the state UTD rates. A deeper investigation into different policy interactions by state IISs may also provide insight as to the different dynamics that contribute to higher state UTD rates. Lastly, this dissertation work sparked my interest in investigating the effects of prov ider beliefs and behaviors on participation in IISs. The highest mean predicted rates were in states with no provider mandate rather than 124 states that have a full mandate, counter to my conceptual framewo rk. Exploring the different attitudes and examining p rovider characteristics in more detail with respect to how they relate to immunization participation may shed light on why researcher fail to see an effect between IIS participation and UTD rates. 125 Refe rences Ahmed, F., Temte, J.
