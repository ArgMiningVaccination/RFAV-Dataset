At Advanced Acupuncture, Inc., we are offering following programs for cancer prevention: Strengthen Immune system- All cancers are resulting from the weak immune system that the system could not prevent our DNA from mutation, so the cells start generates abnormally to cause cancer. Therefore, strengthen our immune system is the key to prevent cancer before occurring. For the patients who already diagnosed cancer, it is curtail important that they can strengthen the immune system before or during chemo or radiation therapy, because it is the key to win the battles with medical treatment. Acupuncture and herbal therapy may reduces the anxiety, increases body metabolism, and balances the immune response, therefore strengthen the immune system. Like the bodies of other animals, the human body has a defense system, which can recognize and eliminate foreign bodies when it is invaded by such bodies. Since microbes have existed on earth for several billion years longer than human beings and animals have, both human beings and animals need a good defense system in order to survive healthfully. This defense system is called Immune System. When our immune system is functioning normally, we should not feel such symptoms such as fever, pain, swelling, or itching in our bodies. However, when the immunological activity decreased or too many antigens are over powering the defense system, then we will feel such symptoms until a normal condition is recovered. The symptoms of the different stages of immunological reactions can be assigned to the defense systems of inflammation and allergy. The two kinds of lymphocytes involved in the immune response are B-cells and T-cells. Pain management during chemo and radiation therapy Some of the chemo therapy and radiation therapy could cause inflammation after certain times of the treatment. Acupuncture could successfully to manage the pain by induce the endorphin release naturally form the body to minimize the pain. At the same time to anti-inflammation by releases the corticoids (a natural steroids that released same time with endorphin) and substance P to repair damaged tissue).
