Ease Painful Symptoms Naturally With Acupuncture Acupuncture is based on the theory that there is a continuous generation and flow of energy called 'chi' throughout an individual's body. Chi consists of two polarities, yin and yang. These are opposite forces but work mutually when balanced. Remember, yin and yang are complementary and not contradictory. As long as our body maintains this harmony and change of polarities, there is health. If these two are thrown out of equilibrium, disease occurs. Acupuncture works in restoring this balance. Let Us Balance the Flow of Chi in Your Body Acupuncture needles do not pierce nerves. There are 365 major acupuncture points located on our body surface. When special needles are inserted at certain points of the body, the balance and rhythm of the life force are stimulated. By balancing your body's chi, you can reduce the annoying and painful symptoms that you may suffer due to diseases.
