Free COVID-19 vaccination appointments are available at Commonwealth Vaccination Clinics, State Vaccination Hubs and participating Community Pharmacies - just check the [Australian Government website](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/getting-vaccinated-for-covid-19/getting-a-covid-19-vaccine-if-you-are-not-eligible-for-medicare) to find a booking. For the latest information, take a look at our [COVID-19 updates page](https://www.monash.edu/news/coronavirus-updates). COVID-19 vaccination information Find out what you need to know about COVID-19 vaccinations: when to get your booster dose, how you can get proof of your vaccinations, and more. If you're hesitant about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, take a look at the frequently asked questions. [Frequently asked questions](#commonly-asked-questions) When can I get my COVID-19 vaccine booster? We encourage you to book in for a booster dose as soon as possible. You're eligible for a booster dose if you're aged 18 or over, and if it's been six months since your last dose or COVID-19 infection(regardless of the number of prior doses received). Children and adolescents aged 5-17 who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19, or a disability with significant or complex health needs are also eligible for a booster dose. If you're unsure about whether you should get a booster dose, or you have any questions, book an appointment with your GP. For more information, see [getting a booster dose](https://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-2023-booster-advice#:~:text=ATAGI%20recommends%20a%202023%20COVID,aged%2065%20years%20and%20over). How long do I have to wait in between getting my COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine? You can receive your COVID-19 vaccine on the same day as your flu vaccine. Can I wait for a COVID-19 vaccine that isn't currently available? The best vaccine you can get is the one you can get now. It takes 7 to 14 days after your booster dose before you're fully protected from COVID-19, so getting fully vaccinated as soon as possible is the most important thing. Visit the [Vaccine Clinic Finder](https://covid-vaccine.healthdirect.gov.au/eligibility) to find a GP or vaccine provider near you. Why should I get vaccinated? Choosing to get vaccinated helps protect ourselves, our families and our community. Although it's no longer a requirement, we strongly encourage you to play your part for the health, safety and wellbeing of the entire Monash community by getting vaccinated. Visit the [Vaccine Clinic Finder](https://covid-vaccine.healthdirect.gov.au/eligibility) to find a GP or vaccine provider near you. Isn't COVID-19 a mild illness (like the flu)? COVID-19 and influenza (flu) are different viruses. COVID-19 causes a more severe disease than seasonal influenza. Globally, two to four percent of people reported with COVID-19 have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than one per cent of those infected. The virus is easily spread by people with few symptoms (or none). Even if you don't become unwell with COVID-19, you may pass the virus on to others without knowing it. The elderly and people with underlying medical conditions are at the highest risk. However, anyone, including healthy young people, can get a severe disease and die from COVID-19. Vaccinating most of the population will decrease the spread of COVID-19 in your community. Vaccination protects you, and those around you, from severe COVID-19 and death. For more information, visit the [facts about COVID-19 page](https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/facts-about-coronavirus-covid-19). Should I be concerned that the vaccines were developed too quickly? [COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines) have been developed without compromising quality, safety or effectiveness. It may appear they have been developed very quickly, but researchers around the world have been working hard to develop COVID-19 vaccines from the earliest stages of the pandemic. They have been able to speed up development of vaccines thanks to collaboration between scientists, manufacturers and distributors. The development and implementation planning phases have been run side-by-side - instead of one after the other (this has been made possible because of unprecedented global funding). In addition, research into how to respond to a pandemic has been occurring long before COVID-19. This research looks at data from previous coronaviruses such as SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, giving researchers a head start to building the COVID-19 vaccines. In Australia, the [Therapeutic Goods Administration](https://www.tga.gov.au/) (TGA) has been rigorously assessing the potential COVID-19 vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness. They will continue to do this with all vaccines before they are approved and made available to Australians. For more information, see the TGA's page on the [COVID-19 vaccine approval process](https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccine-approval-process). Once approved, each batch must also be checked to make sure it meets the same quality standards. Do COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility? There is no scientific evidence to support this. None of the [COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines) currently under review by the [Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)](https://www.tga.gov.au/) cause sterilisation or infertility. For more details, see the Australian Government page: [ Is it true? Do COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility? ](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/is-it-true/is-it-true-do-covid-19-vaccines-cause-infertility) What can I do if I have a needle phobia? Many people may find the experience of having a needle an unpleasant one. But for some people, the experience presents as a real phobia (characterised by both severe and persistent anxiety and fear). This needle avoidance can lead to hesitancy about getting vaccinated, which may result in some people being left susceptible to COVID-19. If you have a needle phobia, you might feel: - afraid you won't be able to go to the appointment - afraid of seeing or feeling the needle - worried that you'll have an embarrassing reaction to having a needle (like feeling faint or nauseous). When you come to your appointment, just let our staff know how you're feeling - we'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible (e.g. when we show you the product label, we won't show you the needle). The vaccinations are provided in a private cubicle where no one else can see you, and if you need to continue resting at the clinic after we've monitored you for 15 minutes, you're more than welcome to. There are a few things you can do that might help you feel better before or during your vaccination: - do something that calms you, like deep breathing or listening to music you like - distract yourself by looking at some pictures on your phone - remind yourself why you want to get vaccinated (e.g. you want to travel again, or to protect your loved ones) - lie down for your vaccination (instead of sitting) - check out some tension exercises that help with a [fear of needles](https://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/health-information/needle-phobia-and-overcoming-your-fear) - wear clothing that can easily expose your upper arm - remember, it only takes about two seconds to administer the vaccine. [Side effects and symptoms](#side-effects) If you're concerned about the side effects and symptoms of getting a COVID-19 vaccine, you can discuss this with your GP. Serious side effects or allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare. They usually occur within 15 minutes of receiving a vaccine (you'll be monitored at the clinic during this time). Our staff members are also trained to respond to immediate reactions. Most side effects reported have been mild to moderate, and short-lasting. They include: fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site. The chances of you experiencing any of these side effects differs depending on which COVID-19 vaccine you receive. If you do have any side effects, contact the clinic where you received your vaccination. You also can use the [COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effect Checker](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/covid-19-vaccine-side-effect-checker). [How to get an Individual Healthcare Identifier if no Medicare card](#how-to-get-an-individual-healthcare-identifier-if-no-medicare-card) If you don't have a Medicare card (e.g. because you're an international student), you can apply for an Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) so that you book your free COVID-19 vaccine appointment. [Applying for an IHI](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/individual-healthcare-identifiers/how-get-ihi) or getting a COVID-19 vaccination will not affect your visa status or your eligibility for government payments. Here's the quickest way to get an IHI: - Log into [myGov](https://my.gov.au/). - Select Services or Link your first service. - Select Individual Healthcare Identifiers service from the list. - You need your passport (with a valid Australian visa) and your Australian driver licence to verify your identity. If you don't already have one, you can easily [create a myGov account](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/mygov-help-create-mygov-account). [Proof of vaccination](#getting-an-immunisation-certificate) We encourage you to be vaccinated in order to protect the health of our broader Monash community, but you don't need to register your vaccination status or show proof of vaccination to attend an Australian campus (or other Monash locations in Australia). If you have a placement in a healthcare facility, you may need to provide your vaccination information - ask your faculty for details. If you're a student who is also a Monash staff member working in certain areas (including healthcare, residential aged care and emergency services) at a Monash location, you still need to register your vaccination status using the [Monash COVID-19 vaccination status form](https://forms.monash.edu/vaccinate-monash/) (make sure you log in with your staff account). Overseas vaccines recognised in Australia If you received a [vaccine that's approved or recognised in Australia](https://www.monash.edu/students/coming-to-campus/recognised-vaccines) and need to provide your vaccination information for placement or work, you'll need to get a vaccination provider in Australia to report this to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) after you've arrived. Once this is done, your vaccinations will appear on your COVID-19 digital certificate and you'll be able to provide proof that you're fully vaccinated. Our University Health Services team can enter your proof of vaccination into the AIR for you; however, there is a wait time of between 5 and 10 working business days. Please email [nurse.help@monash.edu](mailto:nurse.help@monash.edu) with the following information: - your first name - your family name (surname) - your date of birth (day/month/year) - your postal address (in Australia) - your Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) number or Medicare number. If you don't have a Medicare card, you'll need to [apply for an IHI number](https://www.monash.edu/students/support/health/medical/vaccinations/covid-19#2781862)before we can upload your proof of vaccination into the AIR. - evidence that you've been fully vaccinated with a recognised COVID-19 vaccine (translated into English, if applicable) - the document needs to include the brand of vaccine and the batch/lot number. For more information, take a look at the Services Australia page on [adding immunisations you've had overseas to the AIR](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/australian-immunisation-register/what-register/overseas-immunisations). Contact for enquiries If you have any questions, or you're worried about side effects: - call the University Health Service on 03 9905 3175 (between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday) or email [nurse.help@monash.edu](mailto:nurse.help@monash.edu)(for non-urgent matters - allow up to three business days for a response) - call Nurse on Call on 1300 60 60 24 (available 24 hours a day) - check your side effects using the Australian Government Department of Health's [Side Effect Checker](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/covid-19-vaccine-side-effect-checker) - call 000 if you're experiencing difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, or wheezing, or you're otherwise seriously unwell.
