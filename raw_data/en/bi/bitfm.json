We recommend up to 5 grams/day in powder form for acute immune system boost, intense prevention or exposure to a virus. Long-term recommendations are 1000 mg/day and for Children 500-1000 mg/day - Vitamin A For sustained immune system boost 10,000-15,000 Units/day. You should have your levels checked by your physician if taking higher doses of Vitamin A for more than 4 weeks. We recommend 5,000 Units/day for children age 4 and up. - Vitamin D Take 2000 to 10,000 Units/day to target goal level between 50 and 80. Newborns and Infants should take 400 Units/day, and children ages 4 and up can take up to 800 Units/day. - Zinc Take 50 mg/day. Lozenges can be used if you begin to feel symptoms like a sore throat or cough. - Probiotics ( Probiotics with Vitamin D) Probiotics have been shown to boost your immune system and decrease viral infections by 10-30% in Children. Lactobacillus is good for babies since their microbiome is immature. - Pre-biotic (Arabinex) Larch Arabinogalactan is very safe and has been shown to reduce viral infections in children (age 2 and up as well as boost vaccine responses for children and adults. - L-Lysine: Lysine decreases viral replication. We recommend 1-2 grams/day. Echinacea (Origins Virid) - NAC (N-acetylcysteine) We recommend 1200-2000mg/day which should be taken on an empty stomach or with a low protein meal. For Children age 2 and up we recommend 100mg/kg of body weight. So if your child weighs 35 pounds (divide by 2.2 to convert to Kg) you would administer 1600 mg of NAC per day not to exceed 2000mg. NAC is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. - L-Glutamine We recommend 2-5g/day which should be consumed on an empty stomach or with a low protein meal.
