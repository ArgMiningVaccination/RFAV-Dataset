Our mission encompasses both the discovery of new insights into the workings of the immune system and the application of this knowledge to engineer enhanced vaccines, immunotherapies, and diagnostics. Through our unique approach to immunoengineering, we combine clinical experience, immunology expertise, problem-oriented design, and quantitative analyses. Thrust Areas A unique ecosystem to accelerate bench-to-bedside translation Working With Us We invite you to partner with us in our mission! Scientific research and innovation are continuously evolving, and you can be involved! Our groups engage high school and undergraduate students looking to learn alongside us; graduate students developing theses; experienced researchers with unique interests, skills and backgrounds; and non-scientist partners through the various Polsky Center entrepreneurship programs! Quick Links Resources & Facilities Our team of scientists and technicians will work with you to propel your immunoengineering projects forward. We provide bridging support for projects to complete critical experiments that would strengthen the attractiveness of the project for larger federal, private, and venture funding sources. This support comes in the form of scientific input, technicians and hands-on-deck to carry out the experiments, as well as dedicated core facilities and research resources for data generation and collection.
