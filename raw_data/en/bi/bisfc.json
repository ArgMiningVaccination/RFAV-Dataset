After a baseline season, subjects (n 5181) were randomized and received 3 preseasonal injections of eitherplacebo (n 558) or a low dose (80 mg, n560) or high dose (160mg, n563) of BM32 in year 1, respectively, followed by a booster injection in autumn. In the second year, all actively treated subjects received 3 preseasonal injections of the BM32low dose, and placebo-treated subjects continued with placebo. Clinical efcacy was assessed by using combined symptom medication scores, visual analog scales, RhinoconjunctivitisQuality of Life Questionnaires, and asthma symptom scores. Adverse events were graded according to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Allergen-specicantibodies were determined by using ELISA, ImmunoCAP, andImmunoCAP ISAC.

This wasaccompanied by an induction of allergen-specic IgG withoutinduction of allergen-specic IgE and a reduction in the seasonally induced increase in allergen-specic IgE levels in year 2. In the rst year, more grade 2 reactions were observed inthe active (n 56) versus placebo (n 51) groups, whereas there was almost no difference in the second year. Conclusions: Injections of BM32 induced allergen-specic IgG,improved clinical symptoms of seasonal grass pollen allergy, and were well tolerated. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2017; nnn:nnn-nnn.) Key the only disease-modifying treatment for allergy and has long-lasting effects, even afterdiscontinuation. 1-5 It has been shown that allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is more cost-effective than pharmacotherapy.6However, there are several aspects of current allergen extract-based AIT that can be improved, such as safety and convenience.7There is a need for safe AIT forms requiring only few administrations. Recently, agrass pollen allergy vaccine (BM32) has been developed that is based on recombinant fusion proteins consisting of nonallergenic peptides derived from the IgE-binding sites of the 4 major timothygrass pollen allergens (Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6) andthe preS protein derived from the large surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). 8Allergen-specic T-cell epitopes were reduced in the recombinant fusion proteins of BM32. ThereforepreS was selected to serve as an immunologic carrier protein providing T-cell help for the production of blocking allergen- specic IgG antibodies. The immunologic characterization ofBM32 showed a lack of IgE reactivity and allergenic activity, and at the same time, the vaccine induced allergen-specic IgG in animals, which blocked allergic patients' IgE binding to thegrass pollen allergens and inhibited allergen-induced basophildegranulation. 8 In a subsequent clinical skin test study in human subjects, it was demonstrated that BM32 induced neither immediate type skinreactions nor T cell-mediated late-phase reactions, as evaluated by atopy patch testing. 9This conrmed the lack of allergenic ac- tivity and demonstrated that allergen-specic T-cell epitopes,which in previous synthetic allergy vaccines gave rise to systemic late-phase side effects, 10-13have indeed been eliminated to a large extent in BM32. A subsequent safety and dose-nding study conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in an allergen exposure chamber setting showed that 3 monthly injections of BM32 led toa signicant reduction of total nasal symptom scores during a6-hour grass pollen exposure in patients treated with 80 and 160mg of BM32, which was accompanied by a reduction of the total ocular symptom score and immediate-type skinsensitivity, as determined by using titrated skin prick tests (SPTs). 14The clinical effects (IgG 15IgG by inhibitionof IgE-facilitated allergen presentation through allergen-specic 14 Here we report the rst double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter eld trial, which investigated the clinical efcacy and immunogenic effects, as well as tolerability, of BM32. METHODS Study subjects To be eligible for the study, subjects had to be aged 18 to 60 years and of either sex, with a positive history of grass pollen allergy conrmed by a positive SPT response (wheal >3 mm) to grass pollen extract andallergen-specic IgE levels (measured by using ImmunoCAP; Thermo FisherScientic, Uppsala, Sweden) of at least 3.5 kU A/L to both grass pollen extract and rPhl p 1/rPhl p 5 at screening or within 12 months before inclusion. They also had to show moderate-to-severe symptoms of grass pollen allergy duringthe grass pollen season (GPS) of the screening year 2012. Major criteria forexclusion were symptomatic perennial or seasonal coallergies during the GPS, severe ongoing atopic dermatitis, uncontrolled asthma specied by an FEV of predicted nasal polyposis, sensitization to Phl p 7 with allergen-specic IgE levels of greater than 0.35 kU A/L, and participation in a grass pollen-specic immunotherapy trial or use of marketed grass pollen-specic immunotherapy in the 2 years before studystart. The complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found inthe study protocol in the Study Protocol andTable E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org .Table I shows that subjects were evenly distributed regarding age, sex, symptoms, and immunologic characteristicsregarding the treatment groups. Study design This study was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, prospective study to investigate the safety and efcacy of 2 years of treatment with BM32 in patients with grass pollen allergy with allergic rhinitis, mild asthma, or both. The trial has been registered underEudraCT no. 2012-000442-35 and ClinicalTrial.gov Identier NCT01538979. TheStudy Protocol is available in this article's Online Repository. This study was carried out in 11 centers in 5 European countries (5 sites in Germany,2 sites in Austria, and 1 site each in Belgium, Denmark, The Netherlands,and Slovenia) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

The study was conducted over 3 GPSs (see Table E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ) from May 2012 (rst patient in) until October 2014 (last patient out). A screening year (2012) was followed by 2 treatmentyears (2013 and 2014) with an interim analysis performed by an independentdata monitoring committee (IDMC) in December 2013 ( Figs 1 and2). We intended to recruit all subjects before or during the GPS of 2012 and collect data on their allergy symptoms and intake of allergy medicationthrough an electronic diary. However, the recruitment period had to beextended until January 2013. Therefore detailed data collected during the 2012GPS were available for less than half of the subjects. All other subjects completed a paper version of the diary retrospectively once to summarize theirallergy symptoms and need for allergy medication in the 2012 GPS. These data, as well as serologic data (allergen-specic IgE levels) and results from the titrated SPTs performed after the 2012 GPS (visit 3), were evaluated by an IDMC. The aim of this data review was (1) to identify andexclude subjects not eligible with respect to the inclusion and exclusioncriteria (in particular subjects with coallergies interfering with study end points and subjects with only mild symptoms during the GPS) and (2) to assign the 181 eligible subjects ( Fig 2 ) to one of 2 groups according to the severity of their sensitization to grass pollen (group 1, moderate; group 2, severe). To beallocated to group 2, subjects had to have grass pollen-specic IgE levels ofTABLE I.

Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with 20 mg of each of the 4 fusion proteins (ie, 80 mg of antigen in total, which was termed BM32 low), with 40mg of the 4 fusion proteins (ie, 160 mg of antigen in total, which was termed BM32 high), or with placebo. Randomization was carried out by the contract research organization as block randomization stratied for centers andseverity to ensure even distribution of the 3 study arms over all participatingcenters and even distribution of subjects with severe symptoms over the 3 study arms. Subjects received 3 preseasonal injections and an additional booster injection after the GPS of treatment year 1 (ie, 2013) and 3 preseasonalinjections in treatment year 2 (ie, 2014; Fig 1 ). Electronic diaries were used for daily documentation of the subjects' well-being by using a visual analog scale (VAS), 15grass pollen allergy-related symptoms, and intake of allergy medication (standby medication) during the GPS of the 2 treatment years.The study schedule indicating time points (visits) for injections, blood sampling, and titrated SPTs is shown in Fig 1 . As a result of a blinded interim analysis conducted at the end of the rst treatment year (ie, 2013) and after a subsequent study protocol amendment, allsubjects of the 2 actively treated groups received the low dose of BM32 in treatment year 2 and were pooled for statistical analysis of the results of year 2 (ie, BM32 pooled) to increase the power of the study. Study medication BM32 vaccine and placebo. BM32 is an equimolar mix of 4 recombinant fusion proteins consisting of hypoallergenic peptides derived from B-cell epitopes of the 4 major allergens from grass pollen, Phl p 1, Phl p2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6, which are fused to hepatitis B-derived preS. 8Details of the peptides, including a depiction of their sequences and arrangement, are presented in detail in a study by Zieglmayer et al.14These 4 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxidein a physiologic buffer containing 0.9% NaCl. Two different BM32 doses (BM32 low dose: 20 mg of each API, 80 mg of antigen in total; BM32 high dose: 40 mg of each API, 160 mg of antigen in total) were selected for the study based on the results of a previous phase IIa safety and dose-nding studyconducted in a pollen exposure chamber. 14The study medication was manufactured by Biomay AG (Vienna, Austria) and Polymun Scientic GmbH (Klosterneuburg, Austria). It was provided as suspension ' 'ready forinjection' ' containing either 0.2 mg/mL BM32 APIs and 1.5 mg/mL of Al 31 (BM32 low dose) or 0.4 mg/mL BM32 APIs and 3.0 mg/mL Al31(BM32high dose) in a physiologic buffer containing 0.9% NaCl. The placebo preparation contained 3.0 mg/mL Al31in the same buffer. The vaccine was administered as a subcutaneous injection. The dose volume was 400 mL. Concomitant antiallergic medication. All study subjects had access to predened concomitant antiallergic medication (topical antihistamine, oral antihistamine, nasal corticosteroid, and oral corticosteroid)to be used in a stepwise manner during the GPS when needed. Assessment of clinical efcacy parameters The primary end points of the study were the mean daily combined symptom medication scores (SMSs) calculated for the peak of the GPS in treatment years 1 and 2 (see the Study Protocol in this article's Online Repository). The SMS was calculated as the sum of the symptom score (SS)and medication score (MS). Secondary end points were the mean daily SMS in both years during the whole GPS, as well as the mean daily SS and MS during the pollen peak and the whole GPS. Six symptoms of allergicrhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C; ie, runny nose, blocked nose, sneezing, itchynose, gritty/red/itchy eyes, and watery eyes) in accordance with the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) position paper 16and 3 asthma symptoms (cough, wheezing, and tightness of chest/shortness ofbreath) were recorded once daily in an electronic diary. Diary entries were to be made in the evening, reflecting the past 24 hours, from approximately 4 weeks before until approximately 4 weeks after the GPS. The SS wascalculated as the sum of scores for the 6 symptoms of AR/C measured asfollows: 0, no symptoms; 1, mild symptoms; 2, moderate symptoms; and 3, severe symptoms. 16,17An asthma SS was formed from the sum of scores from the 3 asthma symptoms using the same scale (0-3), as described forthe SS. Stepwise standby medication (ie, concomitant antiallergic medication) use was scored as follows: oral antihistamine (2 mg of ceterizine) was dened as points per tablet; nasal was as 0.5 points per drop or puff; topical corticosteroid (50 mg of mometasone furoate nasal spray) was dened 1 point and oral corticosteroid (40-mg methylprednisolone tablet) was dened as 18 points per tablet. As additional secondary efcacy end points, the patient's well-being was assessed by 2 independent measures: mean daily VAS 15and mean weekly scores obtained with the standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of LifeQuestionnaire (RQLQ), 18both of which were calculated during the pollen peak, as well as during the whole GPS. Overall AR/C symptom-related FIG 1. Study design. Patients recruited during the screening year (2012) were randomized at visit 4 (R)and treated 3 times preseasonally during each of the 2 treatment years (2013 and 2014) and once in October 2013(investigational medicinal product [IMP] administration). Symptoms, medication, VAS, and quality-of-life data were obtained by using eDiaries from mid-April until mid-August (green background) . Titrated SPTs were performed at 8 time points, and blood samples were taken at 11 time points (red arrows) .J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL nnn20174NIEDERBERGER ET ALwell-being was reported by patients daily by indicating a point on a 10-cm-long line between the left (feeling good) and right (feeling very bad)on a VAS presented in the electronic diary. The RQLQ, consisting of 28 questions addressing 7 different aspects of quality of life that are impaired by AR/C on a 7-point scale from 0 (not impaired at all) to 6 (severely impaired)was completed once weekly in the electronic diary. The GPS was dened to start with the rst day with a pollen count of greater than 25 grains/m 3per 24 hours and to end on the last day with a pollen count of greater than 25 grains/m3per 24 hours. The grass pollen peak season was dened as the 15 consecutive days during the GPS with the highest cumulative pollen count for each site. Centers were excluded from the evaluation of the SMS if more than 50% of days in the peak season had a pollen count of 25grains/m 3or less. Pollen counts were purchased from the Research Unit of Aerobiology and Pollen Information at the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria ( https://www.pollenwarndienst.at/en/current-data/ daily-load.html ). Statistical analysis The safety analysis (SA) set (n 5166 patients) included all subjects who had received at least 1 injection (see Fig E1 in this article's Online Repository atwww.jacionline.org ). Subjects of the SA population with a valid set of diaryentries during the peak of the GPS in treatment years 1 and 2 were dened as full analysis set (FAS) 1 (n 5146) and FAS2 (n 5138), respectively (see Fig E1 ). Efcacy was evaluated in the FAS ( Fig 2 and see Fig E1 ). Apost hoc analysis was performed in a subset of the FAS population (FAS1*, n 5135; FAS2*, n 5129; see Fig E1 ), excluding subjects with grass pollen-specic IgE levels of less than 3.5 kU A/L at the time when treatment started (ie, visit 5) because these subjects had grass pollen-specic IgE levels of greater than the 3.5 kU A/L cutoff only in the 12 months before the study but not at visit 5. The sample size for the study was calculated by assuming apower of 80% and a 2-sided signicance level of 2.5% to account for multiple testing of 6 elementary hypotheses within the prespecied closed testing procedure, 19as described below. However, the procedure needed at most only half from the 5% 2-sided signicance level (ie, 2.5%) for controllingthe type I error for multiple testing in the strong sense for a test of an elemen- tary hypothesis and for a test of a seventh null hypothesis (ie, the intersection of the rst and second elementary null hypothesis) within the secondyear. Assumptions regarding effect size and variances were based on datafrom a previous subcutaneous immunotherapy study 20with a recombinant birch pollen allergen and a similar symptom and medication scoring system as in the present study, with the exemption that the SS and MS were evaluatedseparately. For the purpose of sample size estimation, the sum of the SS and MS, as well as the related pooled SDs, were calculated, resulting in a reduction110 did not meet inclusion criteria 11 withdrew consent 3 lost to follow-up BM32 low BM32 high Placebo SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED: n=60 n=63 n=58 (Dec. 2012) 1 withdrew consent 3 withdrew consent 3 withdrew consent 3 lost to follow-up 2 lost to follow-up 1 fell pregnant 2 did not meet inclusion criteria RECEIVED FIRST DOSE (SA): n=53 n=47 4 withdrew consent 2 had adverse event 3 withdrew consent 2 lost to follow-up 3 withdrew consent 2 lost to follow-up 1 fell pregnant 3 were non- compliant with study protocol 2nd treatment year n=47 lost to follow-up 2 lost to follow-up 1 fell pregnant 1 had concomitant disease Completed study n=47 n=49 n=45 (Oct 2014)n=305 subjects signed IC n=181 subjects randomized FIG 2.

The parameters of year 2 (which led to the more conservative sample size), together with a total dropoutrate of 25%, were assumed for the present study and resulted in a requiredsample size of 60 per treatment group (180 patients in total). Evaluation of the primary end point, key secondary end points, and well-being by using the VAS was performed by using ANOVAs with the factors treatment, allergyseverity (moderate/severe), and study center as covariates. For the primary end point (SMS), a closed testing procedure was used to adjust for multiplicity when testing differences between the 3 treatment groups (low, high, andplacebo) at 2 years (years 1 and 2). Therefore the closed testing procedureextends the testing strategy of Bonferroni adjustment for 2 years and hierarchically compares treatment groups within a year. The hierarchical preferences were rst priority of high versus placebo, second priority of lowversus placebo, and third priority of high versus low in year 1 and rst priorityof pooled high-low/low-low versus placebo, second priority of high-low versus placebo and low-low versus placebo, and third priority of high-low versus low-low in year 2. Absolute differences to placebo were calculatedbased on least-squares (LS) means (ANOVA). Percentage differences between treatment groups were computed based on ratio of geometric means. For all other efcacy end points, descriptive summary statistics were used(eg, mean, mean difference from placebo, and 95% CI for mean differencefrom placebo), and the Wilcoxon 2-sample test was used to compare the groups of BM32- and placebo-treated subjects. A rst or second priority test in a given year had also priority before a third priority test in the other year.Specic futility boundaries and stopping rules were dened for theprespecied interim analysis (details are provided in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). The software used for statistical analysis was SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The statistical analysis plan is provided as supplementaryinformation in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org . The post hoc analysis of the FAS1* and FAS2* subpopulations was done with GraphPad Prism software Software, La Jolla, Calif)by using an unpaired ttest to compare the groups. Welch correction was applied in cases of unequal variances. Assessment of safety The major safety end point was the frequency of adverse events (AEs) with regard to the occurrence, seriousness, intensity, and relatedness to the studydrug. AEs known to be related to specic immunotherapy (SIT) were analyzed separately, grouped into local and systemic reactions, and graded according to the grading system suggested by the EAACI and the World AllergyOrganization. 17,21Further safety variables included vital signs, physical examinations, and safety laboratory assessments (see the Study Protocol in this article's Online Repository). Safety end points were evaluated in the SA set, which includes all subjects who have been randomized and received at least 1 injection. All safety data obtained in this study were presented with descriptive statistics. Comparisons between the treatment groups were done with the x2or Fisher exact tests. Assessment of immunologic parameters Blood samples were drawn at a number of time points throughout the study (Fig 1 ) and analyzed for changes in levels of IgE and IgG (IgG 1and IgG 4) against the grass pollen allergens Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6 andmeasured as described by Zieglmayer et al. 14Immunologic end points were evaluated in the SA set. Changes in antibody levels were compared between treatment groups by using the Wilcoxon 2-sample test and the Wilcoxonsigned-rank test for comparisons between visits within treatment groups. RESULTS Preseasonal treatment with 3 injections of BM32improves the SMS during the GPS Mean SMSs observed in the different study groups during the peak pollen season of years 1 and 2 with Pvalues for the differencein LS means between the groups are shown in Fig 3 ,A. A reduction of the mean SMS during the pollen peak season of 17.9% (95% CI, 41.2% to 223.1%; P5.500) compared with the placebo group was observed for the BM32 low-dose and BM32 high-dose group in year 1, respectively. The reduction in SMS was more pronounced in year 2, reaching 22.0% (95% CI, 39.8% to 20.98%; P5.059) for group, although still missing statis- tical signicance in the primary end point ( P5.085 for difference in LS means between the BM32 pooled group and the placebogroup).

The reduction in the SMS compared with placebo was 24.8% (95% CI, 43.5% to the BM32 high-low group (ie, not signicant). The analysis of the SS produced similar results as the SMS.

Improvement of the SMS is best in subjects with high levels of grass pollen-specic IgE Apost hoc analysis for exploratory purposes showed that 11 of the 146 FAS1 subjects and 9 of the 138 FAS2 subjects (see Fig E1 ) had timothy grass pollen allergen-specic IgE levels at visit 5 ofless than 3.5 kU A/L (Table I ). Also, these subjects had low skin sensitivity to grass pollen allergens at visit 5 (data not shown). A grass pollen allergen-specic IgE level of greater than 3.5kU A/L was dened as an inclusion criterion for the screening visit (seeTable E1 ). When these subjects were excluded (ie, FAS*), we found a more pronounced reduction of the mean SMS compared with placebo in all groups.

Mean SMSs for all groups in both treatment years and nominal Pvalues for differences in LS means between the groups are shown in Fig 3 ,B. Therefore we analyzed whether the grass pollen allergen-specic IgE levels at screening and clinical treatment effects are associated. Fig E3 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org shows that the reduction in SMSs increases with grass pollen allergen-specic IgE levels and that the reduction in SMSs compared with placebo correlated highly (R250.878) with grass pollen allergen-specic IgE levels. Also for the mean SS and MS, the improvement was more pronounced in the FAS* populations after removal of subjects with timothy grass pollen-specic IgE levels of lessthan 3.5 kU A/L, reaching a 28.8% reduction of the SS to placebo (P5.017 for the difference in LS means) for the low-low group and a reduction of 26.7% ( P5.018 for difference in LS means) of the pooled group in year 2 (see Fig E2 ,BandD). Preseasonal treatment with BM32 improves well-being and rhinoconjunctivitis-related qualityof life during the GPS Assessment of the level of well-being during the peak pollen season by using a VAS showed that well-being in the rst year was19.5% better in the BM32 high-dose group compared with placebo and 25.2% better in the BM32 low-dose group than in the placebo group (ie, not signicant). In treatment year 2, thedifference in well-being between the actively treated and placebo groups was increased LS means; Fig 4 ,A). Likewise, we found an improvement regarding RQLQ parameters in year 1 (pollen peak season) for the actively treatedsubjects, as shown in the spider plot diagram ( Fig 4 ,B). In year 2 we observed a consistent and strong improvement regarding all RQLQ parameters for each of the actively treated groups compared with the placebo group, reaching small Pvalues for most of the RQLQ parameters and for the RQLQ overall quality of life ( Fig 4 ,C). For patients who kept an electronic diary in the baseline year (2012), we compared the improvement of well-being determined by using a VAS in the subsequent 2 treatment years with the baseline year (see Fig E4 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ). We noted an improvement in well-being also in the placebo group in treatment years 1 and 2. An at least 40% improvement in well-being in all actively treated groups(BM32 low-low, BM32 high-low, and BM32 pooled) was foundin year 2 compared with the baseline year (see Fig E4 ). Treatment with BM32 improves grass pollen-related asthma symptoms The study population included also subjects with grass pollen allergy with a history of grass pollen-associated asthma (BM32 low-dose group, n 520; BM32 512; placebo group, n 514;Table I ). Therefore we also analyzed the effects of BM32 AIT on asthma symptoms. The post hoc analysis of the asthma SS showed that there was a 24.3% and 39.2% reduction in the asthma SS in the BM32 low-dose and BM32 high-dosegroups, respectively, when compared with the placebo group intreatment year 1 (see Fig E5 in this article's Online Repository atwww.jacionline.org ; not signicant). In treatment year 2, the reduction in asthma SS compared with the placebo group in the BM32 pooled and the BM32 high-low group was 31.9%(P5.022 for difference in LS means) and 48.7% ( P5.012 for difference in LS means), respectively. In the BM32 low-low group the reduction in asthma SS in year 2 was 17.1%(P5.153 for difference in LS means; not signicant). Mean asthma scores for all groups in both years and Pvalues for differences in LS means are shown in Fig E5 . Vaccination with BM32 induces signicant increases in allergen-specic IgG, IgG 1, and IgG 4 responses We found that the rst course of 3 subcutaneous injections of BM32 given in monthly intervals induced strong increases inlevels of IgG antibodies specic for the 4 major grass pollen allergens Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6, whereas no such increases were found in the placebo-treated subjects ( Fig 5 ,A). No relevant difference regarding induction of allergen-specic IgG levels was noted when BM32 high-dose groups. Allergen-specic IgG levels decreasedbetween visit 8 (April 2013) and visit 9 (August 2013) but did not completely return to baseline levels ( Fig 5 ,A). One injection in October 2013 (visit 10) was sufcient to boost allergen-specicIgG levels up to those induced by the preseasonal course of 3injections. A decrease in allergen-specic IgG levels was noted also between visit 10 (October 2013) and visit 12 (January 2014), which could be boosted again by the 3 preseasonalinjections and remained at higher levels after the second GPS in August 2014 compared with treatment after the season in year 1 (Fig 5 ,A). When we analyzed allergen-specic IgG 1and IgG 4 subclass responses, allergen-specic IgG IgG 1responses increased after each course of injections to a similar level in year 1 as in year 2 and after the injections decreased always to similar levels ( Fig 5 ,B). By contrast, allergen-specic IgG 4levels continued to increase after each of the booster injections so that levels obtained after theboost in October 2013 were greater than after the rst course of injections in April 2013, and levels obtained after the third course of injections in April 2014 were greater than after the Octoberbooster injection ( Fig 5 ,C). Thus it seemed that continuous treatment with BM32 builds up a continuously increasing allergen-specic IgG 4response. Vaccination with BM32 does not induce increases in grass pollen allergen-specic IgE levels andprevents seasonally induced boosts of grasspollen-specic IgE production We also studied the effects of vaccination with BM32 on grass pollen allergen-specic IgE levels. Fig 6 ,A, shows that vaccination with both low-dose and high-dose BM32 did not induce relevant increases of grass pollen allergen-specic IgElevels. No relevant changes were observed after each of the 3injection courses (visit 5, January 2013 vs visit 8, April 2013; visit 9, August 2013 vs visit 11, November 2013; and visit 12, January 2014 vs visit 15, April 2014).

No adrenaline was needed during the complete study. The majority of side effects were late-phase local reactions ( Table II and see Table E3 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org ).Tables II andIIIrepresent a summary of the treatment-associated AEs ( Table II ) and the grading of systemic AEs ( Table III ). Systemic AEs are further specied according to MeDRA terms in Table E3 . Local reactions were late-phase reactions, which were more frequent and more intense in actively treated subjects than in placebo-treatedsubjects ( Table II ). Systemic reactions were late-phase reactions. They were more frequent in the rst treatment year and more frequent in the BM32 low-dose (ie, 23 events) and BM32 high-dose (ie, 18 events) groups than in the placebo group (ie, 6events). According to the EAACI grading, the systemic reactions observed in year 1 were graded 0 to 2, whereas no grade 3 or grade 4 reactions were observed ( Table II ). Two severe AEs were noted in the rst year. In 1 subject a chronic inflammatory central nervous system disease was diagnosed after the patient reported paraesthesia, but this patient had reported neurologic problemsalready before the study. A second subject who was also allergic to birch pollen and associated pathogenesis-related protein 10 allergen-containing food experienced an episode of angioedemaseveral hours after treatment and after consumption of anut-containing cereal bar. In treatment year 2, only a few systemic side effects were observed, and they were equally frequent in the active andplacebo groups (BM32 pooled group, 6 events/113 subjects; placebo group, 3 events/53 subjects). All but 1 of these reactions were late-phase reactions of grade 0 or 1 according to the EAACIclassication. One severe AE was observed in 1 patient of the BM32 low-low group who experienced an immediate flush after injection associated with an increase in blood pressure, whichthen returned to a normal levels. After consultation with 2independent international experts, this reaction was classied as a grade 3 reaction.DISCUSSION We report the rst multicenter, double-blind, placebo- controlled phase IIb eld study conducted with the recombinant B cell epitope-containing grass pollen allergy vaccine BM32 inpatients with grass pollen allergy for a period of 2 years. BM32 is different from other recombinant and synthetic allergy vaccines being evaluated in clinical trials. It consists of nonallergenicpeptides of the 4 major grass pollen allergens Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6, which are expressed as fusion proteins attached to the hepatitis B-derived preS protein. 8,14,22Whereas previously described recombinant hypoallergenic vaccines, such as rBet v1 fragments, 23rBet v 1 trimer,24a Bet v 1 folding variant,25and contiguous Bet v 1-derived overlapping synthetic peptides,26as well as synthetic peptides derived from the major cat allergenFel d 1, 27contain allergen-specic has been reduced, and hepatitis B-derived preS is used as an immunologic carrierprotein to induce allergen-specic blocking IgG antibody responses. 8We found that only 3 injections of BM32 given before the pollen season reduced SMSs, SSs, and MSs (not signicant)compared with placebo treatment in the rst year, and this effectwas much more pronounced in the second year. Although we failed to reach the primary end point (ie, daily combined SMS calculated for the peak of the GPS in treatment years 1 and 2),in the FAS population our study shows that treatment with BM32 improves symptoms of grass pollen allergy. Of note, in addition to the improvement in SMSs, SSs, and MSs, we notedthat patients also substantially improved regarding VAS and RQLQ scores. After a blinded interim analysis conducted at the end of the rst treatment year, an IDMC suggested to continue the study and to switch the 40- mg dose (ie, 160 mg of the 4 BM32 components) to 20mg (ie, 80 mg of the 4 BM32 components) to increase the power of the study. In fact, it also appeared that the improvementin SMSs was lower at the 40- mg dose. The latter can be explained by the fact that low-dose antigen favors antibody afnity maturation. 28-30TABLE II.

The improvement in symptoms in the second treatment year was accompanied by a continuous increase in levels ofallergen-specic IgG 4antibodies, as was also observed for allergen extract-based subcutaneous forms of AIT earlier.30,31 We observed that the allergen-specic IgG antibodies induced by BM32 were strongly boosted already by 1 booster injectionadministered in autumn after the pollen season and further increased after another 3 injections given monthly before the pollen season of treatment year 2. This study alsohighlighted another possible advantage of BM32 because unlike other forms of AIT (eg, sublingual immunotherapy), which induce only low levels of allergen-specic IgG antibodies buthigh boosts of allergen-specic IgE levels, 32treatment with BM32 did not increase grass pollen allergen-specic IgE production. There are several possible reasons for the observed preferential IgG induction. First, preS, the carrier protein, does not induce T H2 immune responses but rather T H1 responses.33Second, the vaccine did not activate or only mildly activated grass pollenallergen-specic T H2 responses. Third, removal of large parts of the grass pollen allergen sequences from the vaccine makes it less allergenic compared with the full allergen. Fourth, becauseof the low allergenic activity of BM32, high doses of the vaccine can be injected. High-dose immunization is known to favor IgG induction, whereas low-dose immunization favors IgEinduction. 34Moreover, we noted that treatment with BM32 reduced signicantly the boosts of allergen-specic IgE production caused by seasonal allergen exposure (ie, bluntingeffect) similar to what has been noted for allergen extract-basedvaccines 35and other recombinant and synthetic vaccines.10,36 A gradual decrease in allergen-specic IgE levels caused bysuch a mechanism might likely be one of the responsiblemechanisms underlying the long-term effect of AIT after discontinuation of treatment. Therefore we plan to investigate the long-term effects of BM32 in follow-up studies. Major advantages of BM32 are that only a few injections were needed to achieve clinical improvement, whereas other forms of AIT require daily administrations (eg, sublingualimmunotherapy) or multiple injections (ie, allergen extract-based subcutaneous AIT). 7Another major advantage of BM32 is that the vaccine was very well tolerated by the patients, althoughextremely high doses (ie, 80 or 160 mg) were administered without any updosing. 14 In a recently published phase IIb eld study conducted with contiguous overlapping synthetic peptides of the major birchpollen allergen Bet v 1 in which 50 and 100 mg was injected, systemic side effects were observed in more than 64% of the actively treated subjects, 13whereas in our study 22% of the patients had systemic side effects in year 1 and only 5% in year 2. In the study with synthetic Bet v 1 peptides, 2 patients required systemic epinephrine, whereas in our study systemic side effectswere mild, and no epinephrine was required. Because of theexcellent safety prole and due to the fact that BM32 did not boost allergen-specic IgE responses, the vaccine might be well suited for therapy of children. AIT in children is indeed an importantfuture research need because it becomes increasingly clear that early intervention can prevent allergic sensitization and/or progression of IgE sensitization to symptomatic disease andthen to severe disease manifestations. 37-39Of note, patients with grass pollen-induced asthma tolerated the BM32 vaccine very well and showed an improvement in asthma symptoms. Therefore BM32 can be considered also for the treatment of patients with grass pollen-induced asthma. Another unexpected advantage of BM32 was that it induced not only allergen-specic IgG antibodies but also antibodies specic for the hepatitis B surface antigen preS, which were found toinhibit in vitro infection of liver cells by HBV. 22This was the rst demonstration that vaccination with preS alone without S antigen can induce HBV-specic antibody responses in human subjects. Therefore it is possible that BM32-vaccinated subjectsare also protected against HBV infections. 40 Our study also has also limitations, such as low pollen exposure in certain study centers, leading to the exclusion of patients fromthe evaluation in line with predened thresholds for pollen exposure, which affected the power of the study negatively (Table E2 ). Nevertheless, our study shows that AIT with BM32 improves symptoms of grass pollen allergy, is convenient in appli-cation, and is very well tolerated so that it will undergo phase III evaluation as a next step. The fact that BM32 does not boost allergen-specic IgE production indicates also that BM32 canbe used in preventive vaccination studies to investigate whether the vaccine can be used to prevent the progression from rhinitis to asthma or eventually the progression from sensitization toallergic symptoms or even for prophylactic vaccination. Clinical implications: This study shows that a recombinant B cell epitope-based grass pollen allergy vaccine requires only a few injections, is safe, and improves symptoms of grass pollenallergy.
