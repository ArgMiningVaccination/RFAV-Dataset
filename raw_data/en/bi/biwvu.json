Methamphetamine is a highly addictive stimulant that influences the functioning of the central nervous system. The drug comes in various forms, including powders, bases, and crystals. Of the three forms, the most potent is crystal methamphetamine, also known as ice. In cases of attention-deficit hyperactivity, medical experts typically prescribe the substance for treatment purposes. It also helps in the treatment of sleep disorders in individuals. However, it is most often used illegally as a recreational drug. There are many ways to take meth, including smoking, swallowing, snorting, or injecting the drug. Common names for meth include uppers, crystal meth, chalk, ice, crank, speed, and glass. How Addictive is Meth? Meth is very addictive because of the intense high that it provides, especially when it is injected into the bloodstream. This quick and intense high is known as a rush or flash. Certain individuals may be prone to meth use disorder because the substance increases the amount of dopamine in the brain. Note that dopamine is a chemical that increases the likelihood that one will feel motivated to move their bodies, as they are energized by the drug, resulting in positive feelings in the brain. This feeling promotes frequent use of the drug. [1](#Resources_list) Continuous use of meth for its rewarding or calming effects makes an individual develop a dependence on the substance. Hence, it becomes difficult to discontinue use. When an individual ceases intake of meth after addiction, it results in mild to severe meth withdrawal symptoms. Signs and Symptoms of Meth Addiction [Meth addiction](https://greatoaksrecovery.com/meth-stay-in-system/) may be evident when individuals display symptoms like rotting teeth or meth mouth, a thinning body, acne or sores, paranoia, irritability, intense scratching, and confusion. Due to the extreme physical signs of intake, meth remains one of the most dangerous substances in the United States. [2](#Resources_list) Is Detox from Meth Necessary?

Timeline of Signs and Symptoms The specific timeline for meth withdrawal varies from person to person, but the acute withdrawal phase typically peaks the second day after intake. Physical meth detox symptoms, like agitation, drug cravings, and sleep disturbances, can span weeks at a time. Depression may last for up to twelve months or less as well, but it all depends. Here's the meth recovery timeline. First 48 Hours During the first two days, there are significant symptoms that arise when detoxing from meth. Nausea During the first two days of withdrawal, nausea and vomiting may arise as the most prominent meth detox symptoms.

It's also imperative to focus on resting during the first two days. Abdominal Cramping Individuals may feel colicky pain in the abdominal region within forty-eight hours of detoxing. At that point, the pain in the abdomen may suddenly intensify and reduce with time. When this symptom occurs, it's helpful to consume smaller meals as a way of reducing the intensity of the pain. A doctor may help by prescribing medications to reduce the discomfort. Sweating Many individuals experience perspiration and excessive sweating as early symptoms of withdrawal, especially during the first two days. The symptom of sweating is especially common with substances that raise the heart rate and cause blood vessels to dilate, like meth, as these reactions result in sweating.

Cravings occur within two weeks to twenty days of detox, but they can appear earlier on in some cases. It's important to note that the cravings don't last for long periods of time. Rather, they come in waves, at which point they intensify and then ultimately subside. Staying busy, exercising, and eating well can help people minimize their cravings. Continuing Fatigue Symptoms of fatigue, including the inability to complete daily tasks or activities, stick around even two weeks to twenty days into the withdrawal process. Individuals may continue to consume healthy meals and try exercising to feel better in an effort to reduce their symptoms of fatigue. Depression The severe depression that occurs from the third to tenth day following the last moment of intake may continue for a longer period of time, but most of the other physical symptoms will subside. During the period of depression, individuals may feel symptoms like low self-worth, hopelessness and may cry often. As such, the need for mental health professionals becomes imperative.
