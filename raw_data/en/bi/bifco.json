Needing to release old, stuck energy? Chakra Balancing/Energy Healing A Chakra Balance is like a spring clean for your energetic system as it helps to release old energy that has been stuck in the body's energy system. If we are holding onto old energy there is little space for clear, healthy energy to come in. The therapy works on a very deep emotional level, removing stagnant energy and blocks that are preventing us from moving forward with our lives. You may be exercising or eating healthy food, but are you neglecting the health of your energetic system? By releasing old, heavy energy, the path is then clear for healthy, clear energy to enter your system, allowing you to be in better health and optimising any health practices you already have in place. A regular Chakra Balance keeps your energy healthy and flowing, resulting in a more calm and fulfilled life, more in alignment with your goals. The Sanskrit word Chakra literally translates to \"wheel\". There are 7 main chakras aligned along the spine, starting from the base of the spine through to the crown of the head. These spinning wheels of energy draw in the vital life force, keeping us vibrant, healthy and alive. The Chakras correspond to major organs and nerve centres in the body, we well as our psychological, emotional and spiritual states of being. It is therefore essential that our Chakras stay balanced, open and clear. If there is a blockage, energy cannot flow. Lifestyle and life situations can unbalance and deplete a chakra, resulting in us feeling unwell, drained and out of sorts. The client relaxes deeply on the massage table as crystals are used in this therapy to clear, balance and energise each Chakra. You will feel calmer, lighter and have a clearer understanding of your life. (client is fully clothed).
