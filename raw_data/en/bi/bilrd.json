Massage, and the health care industry as a whole, has been challenged like never before. One major discussion regarding the work of massage therapists has involved how we can maintain our massage practices. Part of this involves keeping a strong, healthy immune system. The purpose of this article is to describe many ways massage therapists can bolster their immunity, thus allowing them to work with greater confidence in their ability to stay healthy during this time. COVID-19 [COVID-19](https://www.integrativehealthcare.org/mt/staying-safe-during-covid-19/) is present and will remain so for our lifetimes. Vaccinations for this viral disease will soon become as commonplace in medicine as MMR and Influenza shots. The average person, uneducated in health and pathology, may think vaccination is all one needs to prevent from acquiring pathologic diseases. However, we must educate the general public that keeping a robust immune system also curtails the likelihood of disease manifestation upon acquisition. Boosting White Blood Cell Count Boosting white blood cell count is a key component of bolstering one's immune system. A normal white blood cell count is possessing 5,000-10,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. ( [1](#references)) The number varies because, when someone is ill, the number of white blood cells naturally increases in response to an antigen (anything that elicits an immune response) or pathogen (a microorganism causing disease within the body). Exercise & Immunity Exercise has long been heralded to increase immunity. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science confirms that \"acute exercise,\" which is moderate to vigorous activity of less than an hour, was shown to increase white blood cell count. ( [2](#references)) Physical therapists and related professionals have encouraged many clients to improve exercise routines to stay healthy.

UV Light-Emitting Diodes [Using UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been proven scientifically to kill viruses](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/study-reveals-uv-led-lights-effectively-kill-the-human-coronavirus). Investing in these devices will surely create a safer, germ-free environment. ( [8](#references)) 2. Diet, Exercise, Sleep Practice being healthier regarding diet, exercise and sleep. Make these three a priority! 3. Stress Management Managing stress well also aids in keeping immunity strong. Be aware if you have a subconscious habit of touching your face. Slowing down in life, taking a moment to consciously breath helps us manage stress. 4. Sanitizing Stocking up on sanitizing agents (for surfaces) and soaps (for our hands) will be beneficial. Washing hands with soap and warm water is more effective than merely using hand sanitizer. 5. Reevaluate Hygienic Practices This is a great time to reevaluate hygienic practices of one's business. Ensure cleanliness of all potential fomites (anything that could convey pathogens such as door handles, keys, YOUR PHONE, anything touched often). Ensure plenty of time between sessions and after your work shift to clean thoroughly. Do an additional sweep of your massage space to avoid missing a spot. Read labels on products as some may indicate a longer time frame than anticipated to be effective. 6. Equipment If anyone used equipment such as cups, scraping tools or similar massage tools, be sure to thoroughly sanitize after each usage. If you use foam rollers, consider wrapping it a pillowcase when used on a client. 7. Zinc Zinc lozenges can be a great option to use if fatigue is setting in while working. Coffee, either regular or decaffeinated, can neutralize zinc so curtail coffee intake in this case. ( [9](#references)) 8. Air Purifier Using an air purifier will help keep viruses less potent and lessen disease transmission. Negative ionizers can also accomplish this same goal. ( [10](#references)) 9. Greeting Clients Consider another greeting than shaking hands or touching hands in any way. Touching elbows, kicking feet together, bowing, or nodding head respectfully are all good ideas to implement. 10. Nitrile Gloves Nitrile gloves can be a good option to use if you anticipate touching items such as gas station pumps, ATM, and grocery store checkout machines, or any front desk items at your establishment touched daily by many people. Nitrile is preferred over latex or vinyl in medical settings. ( [11](#references)) 11. Clean Fingernails Keep fingernails trimmed since nails can harbor plenty of bacteria. If you work with the general public, you might want to consider removing your acrylic nails. 12. Disposable Wipes Have disposable wipes handy with you at all times for those moments for \"spot\" cleaning treatments. "}
