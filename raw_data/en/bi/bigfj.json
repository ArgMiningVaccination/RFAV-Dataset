The moon sees your soul. This ancient proverb is a telling take on humanity's relationship with the moon. Often, we look to the sun to provide light and clarity, but it is the moon that sees us through the darkest hours. As people, we go through phases, just as the moon does every month. Here's how you can harvest the spiritual energy of the full and new moons to help you lead [a more soulful life](https://www.rituals.com/en-gb/mag-home-living-soulful.html). The full moon and forgiveness The appearance of a full moon symbolises many things. Cosmically speaking, it's the time of the month where energy peaks, and then releases\u2014something that writer Ariana Palmieri calls \"a cosmic sigh.\" But what does this mean for you personally? Simply put, the stronger your connection to the full moon, the more your heart chakra is aligned. Your heart chakra is home to kindness and forgiveness. This means that a full moon is actually the perfect time to let go of negativity. In this way, you prepare yourself for a new chapter, just as a full moon gives way to a new moon. A full moon ceremony in five steps Perform these steps to harvest the powerful energy of a full moon. 1. Breathe in silence [Turn off your smartphone](https://www.rituals.com/en-gb/mag-spirituality-without-smartphone-tips.html), and take 5 long breaths. Hold each for 5 seconds and try to train your focus only on than its cleansing effect. 2. Light a candle [The spiritual act of lighting a candle](https://www.rituals.com/en-gb/mag-lightning-candles.html) is linked to enhanced intuition. Intuition can be very helpful when it comes to releasing negativity. 3. Write down what's troubling you To truly let go, you need to identify the things that have been weighing you down.

A new moon for a new beginning A new lunar phase begins with the appearance of a new moon. The energy most associated with this phase is that of starting fresh. If you performed the full moon ceremony, your heart chakra is aligned and open for a new beginning. From a spiritual standpoint, the new moon is the perfect time to start a new project. Your energy from the last lunar cycle has been cleansed, giving you a spiritually clean slate. A new moon ceremony to achieve goals Whereas the full moon ceremony focussed on identifying and letting go of the negative influences in your life, this new moon ceremony uses similar tools to direct your attention towards reaching new levels of success. Breathe in silence and light a candle\u2014but this time, because your old energy is already cleansed, focus on the future. Instead of writing down what's bothering you, harness the power of the new moon to set your new intentions into motion. It's about affirmation without limits, so don't worry if what you're writing seems unrealistic at the time. Everything should be phrased positively to nurture the new energy you're welcoming. Once you've done this, sit under a new moon and imagine sending your desires off into the world. Think about tying your list to a balloon in your mind and imagine it floating towards the sky. Want to do something for real? Burn the list on the end of a stick and watch the smoke carry your wishes into the stars. As long as you're doing this in full view of the new moon, it's really just a personal preference. The moon affects all living things, but humans are the only beings who are able to experience this in full. Next time you look into the sky at night, pay attention to what phase the moon is in and remember how its energy can enrich your daily life. "}
