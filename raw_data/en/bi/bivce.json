In fact the spirit is the most powerful and most important factor in a complete healing. Spiritual therapy respects and accepts all the help a person can receive from other types of psychotherapy, provided that those also respect the fundamental principles of theological anthropology and the basic two are: 1) the faith in God - the Creator of all that exists; and 2) the belief in the Biblical teaching that Man was created in the image of God Himself, and that he is therefore free, responsible and transcendent (open to God and absolute values) finding the meaning to his life in realizing the plan God intended for him. Spiritual therapy aims to help a person establish contact with the living God, the source of life and joy. The human spirit receives its being from God and if this connection is disturbed in any way, the person in whole will feel those harmful consequences. When a human spirit returns to God and establishes an authentic communion with Him through faith, hope and love, the person flourishes on all levels of its personality. The author analysis mental illnesses and proposes successful therapy in order for a healthy mind through the soul and its impact on the body to confirm the well-known saying: \"A healthy mind in a healthy body\". The basic principles of spiritual therapy brought in this text are: 1) Residing in peace with God, other creations and yourself; 2) Activate main abilities of the spirit: faith, hope and love within yourself; 3) Live in the liberating truth; 4) Accept and devise in faith the inevitable suffering; 5) Strengthen the power of the spirit through trust in God, prayer and sacramental life.
