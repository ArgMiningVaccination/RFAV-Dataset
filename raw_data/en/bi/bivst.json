Largely non-psychoactive, it provides numerous health benefits without THC's intoxicating effects. CBD promotes restful sleep, supports normal cartilage and joint function, relieves occasional nausea, enhances relaxation, and more. We recommend consulting scientific publications, government resources, and your doctor for more information on CBD's benefits. Lazerus Naturals CBD Oils are for sale to the public here.
