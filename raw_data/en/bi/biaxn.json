I would again like to thank all my colleagues for their dedication to caring for our patients, supporting each other and rising to the financial and operational challenges which the past year has thrown at us. It has been an extraordinarily successful year for our hospital in being recognised in prestigious awards for services and individual colleagues, including our Unicef Gold Standard award for our maternity services. We also received various other national and regional awards across a whole range o f our services, including clinical, estates and facilities and catering. These achievements are a credit to the talent, resourcefulness and sheer hard work of our colleagues. I would like also to thank our many friends throughout Somerset for their ama zing support. We were delighted to have achieved our target of raising \u00a31 million for the new MRI scanner campaign, for which we are privileged to have HRH The Countess of Wessex as our Royal Patron. The support of our partners, the League of Friends and SURE, and of local communities and individuals throughout Somerset has been exceptional and humbling. It is an inspiration to all at the Trust and encourages us to try still harder to maintain the highest standards of patient care that we provide. We are delighted to have been awarded \u00a379.5 million by NHS England for a major upgrade to our theatres and critical care facilities which will be of huge benefit to our patients throughout Somerset - detailed planning for this major project is now in progress . We were also very pleased to be awarded a further \u00a311 million from NHS England to build an acute assessment hub on the Musgrove Park site and the preparatory works for that are already underway. I reported last year on our proposed merger with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust which provides community and mental health services throughout Somerset. This is designed to benefit our patients by removing organisational barriers and giving better joined up care. It recognises the fact that physical and mental health often cannot be separated. During the year NHS Improvement approved the strategic case for our merger and we are preparing the final business case for the required approvals. Strong collaborative working involving our partners at Yeovil D istrict Hospital and Somerset County Council has also continued to bring improvements for patients. For example, Somerset's Home First Service has helped reduce delays in discharge from Somerset's acute hospitals and get patients home sooner, with appropr iate support. We ended this year with a deficit of \u00a310.8 million (before asset impairments and the net effect of capital donations) which was heavily impacted by the continually increasing pressures on our emergency and unplanned care services resulting in additional costs. This deficit is part of a much larger total for the Somerset health system as a whole which emphasises the importance of the prevention agenda and 2 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 reinforces the need for greater integration between providers coupled with the aim of providing more treatment at or closer to the patient's home. For the coming year our focus remains on delivering the highest quality care we can provide. We are pushing ahead with our merger plans which provide a unique opportunity to develop and deliver h olistic and integrated care across our joint acute, community, mental health and primary care services. We will also continue to work with our other health and care partners in the Somerset Health system with the aim of providing care closer to where our patients and their families live and reducing pressures on our hospital and bed -based services. We are so proud of the highly committed and caring people working across our services, those on the front line and those in support. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their remarkable commitment to our patients, their car ers and families. We remain extremely grateful for the support we continue to receive from our patients, our carers, our volunteers and governors, and the wonderful contribution made by the charities that support us, including our League of Friends and SU RE who continue generously to provide donations that make a real difference to patients. We look forward to progressing our alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and working in an integrated manner with all our other partners in the So merset health and social care system to provide the best possible care to everyone who uses our services across Somerset and the wider region. ................................. Colin Drummond, OBE, DL, Trust Chairman, 23 May 2019 3 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Performance Report Overview of performance The purpose of the overview is to provide a short summary about Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust ( \"the Trust \" or \"Musgrove Park Hospital\" ), its purpose, strategic objectives (and any key risks to the achievement of those objectives) as well as details of how we have performed over the year. Brief history and structure of Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust was established in 2008 when we were awarded foundation trust status. The Trust is considered as a medium -sized provider of acute hospital services and serves a local population of over 340,000, as well as providing some specialist an d tertiary services for Somerset's whole population of around 544,000. In addition to inpatient, outpatient and emergency care services, the Trust operates a high dependency and intensive care unit, 16 operating theatres, and numerous medical and surgic al wards to provide care, meeting the full range of patient need. Musgrove Park Hospital has a fully equipped diagnostic imaging department operating 7 days per week, and a purpose -built cancer treatment centre which includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy facilities for both inpatients and outpatients. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust is registered without conditions as a healthcare provider with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Details of the Trust's governance and reporting arrangements are set out within the annual governance statement. In summary: 4 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Purpose, activities/business model and strategic objectives for Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust We are a values -driven organisation, conscious that \"together, we make the difference.\" Our values are at the heart of service planning, recruitment and the operational running of services for patients. These are: \"one team\", \"putting our the best\". The mission is \"working together for a healthy Somerset\", recognising the role that we play in the health of the whole population, working in partnership with other health and social care services in the county. These values underpin the Trust's strategic objectives and prio rities, which for 2018/19 were: Deliver levels of performance that are in line with plans and national standards Promote good practice, transform and innovate, including through digital working to improve safety, outcomes and efficiency Resource, e ngage and develop the existing workforce across the whole alliance whilst aligning and developing a positive and progressive culture to deliver high quality, cost effective care and ensuring the alliance is a great place to work. Work with partners to deli ver a joined up workforce resourcing and skills strategy, to increase sustainability, reduce reliance on temporary staffing and ensure that we recruit and retain the right staff Work well together as an alliance of two organisations, and work with primary care, social care, public health and voluntary sector partners to deliver integrated, high quality services Work with STP partners to deliver the joint objectives in the STP which will lead to a sustainable county health economy During 2018/19 , the Trust continued to provide the full range of the services expected of a district general hospital, primarily from Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton. We also provided clinics for various specialties at numerous community hospitals (e.g. endoscopy and orthopaedi c services from Bridgwater Community Hospital) and from other community venues across Somerset. The Trust continues to develop links with GPs and other primary care professionals so that care can be delivered in a way which reduces unnecessary hospital ad missions. The Trust's business model remains focused on the delivery of high quality and safe services. The Trust's largest source of income is NHS services paid for by the Somerset CCG, the local commissioners of NHS health services. The Trust had a turnover of \u00a3322.5m in 2018/19 (\u00a3308.9m in 2017/18 ). The Trust also provides a substantial number of specialist services, often at a sub - regional or regional level. These include radiotherapy and some dental services, as well as some specia list surgical areas. These are paid for by other commissioners including NHS England. 5 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The Trust has a private patient unit which operates all year round and delivers significant additional income, as well as expanding choice for local people. The enviro nment in which the Trust operates continues to be operationally and financially challenging. Like all hospitals in England, Musgrove Park Hospital has been busier than ever in 201 8/19, with record numbers of patients attending A&E, and increasing demand in almost all services. The Trust continues to explore innovative ways to address these challenges , particularly working in our alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. We have further developed the \"Home First\" service which allows patien ts to return to the ir place of residence more quickly and formulating onward care packages tailored more specifically for their need. The work we did over the summer to prepare for winter pressures, enhancing our bed capacity and relocating our outpatient physiotherapy services to Dene Barton Community Hospital, meant we were able to maintain our services over winter more effectively and provide consistent bed capacity and levels of care throughout the winter . Statement from the Chief Executiv e on the Trus t's performance/achievements and key risks / issues This has been a difficult year for the NHS as a whole and t he Trust continues to face profound operational and financial challenges. Demand for services continues to rise, and is at unprecedented levels. The population served by the Trust is growing and becoming proportionately older. The Somerset population is already older than the average for England, and is becoming more so. The ageing population is one of the reasons why demand for services continues to grow . The rural nature of much of Somerset presents a further challenge. There also remain significant shortages of doctors and nurses in some specialty areas. The Trust mainta ins a corporate risk register outlining what it perceives as its key challenges. This is supplemented by risk registers within directorates, to identify, manage and mitigate risk. The most significant risks identified in the corporate risk register are as follows: Financial challenges and f ailure to achieve control total. Operational pressures having an impact on the quality of care provision and the delivery of the Trust's operational performance standards (RTT, 62 day cancer, diagnostic waiting times and A&E). Management of demand across the system, particularly in emergency care. Age of the estate. Key clinical staffing vacancies, particularly in nursing. Recruitment, training and retention of key clinical staff. The Trust continues to work with partners as part of the STP and the alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to develop strategic plans to address these risks and strategic challenges . Key developments / achievements in 201 8/19 6 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Our midwifery services achieved Unicef Gold Standard status for our baby friendly care and support. This means that future generations of babies, their mothers and families under the care of Musgrove Park's maternity unit will continue to experience the very best baby friendly standards. Unicef ha s rated only five other hospitals in the UK as Gold Standard and Musgrove Park is the first in the south west. Keiley Tuck, our bereavement midwife at Musgrove , was also named midwife of the year at the Butterfly Awards Our interventional radiology servic e was awarded exemplar status for quality improvement by the British Society of Interventional Radiology (BSIR). The society said the department has demonstrated a commitment to the development of high quality interventional radiology services Quality Improvement Quality improvement (QI) methodology is core to the way our organisation develops. QI is essentially the application of the scientific method to the development of change projects and programmes. Careful analysis is made of the underlying probl ems, measures carefully identified and trials conducted to test the efficacy of change ideas. Over the last 12 months the improvement programme at Musgrove has worked on around 100 projects, and trained around 250 people in QI methodology. The programme h as delivered a wide range of benefits, improving health outcomes, patient experience, lowering costs and improving the overall satisfaction of our colleagues with their work (the quadruple aim of health care improvement). Notably multiple of benefits have been made in the productivity of theatres and the care of patients in our hospital beds. Digital and i mprovement programmes Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust is a Global Digital Exemplar site. The Trust has developed a clinically -led digital service, engaging with patients and clinicians to develop and implement new systems. Significant developments this year have been: Our Outpatient clinics operating almost paperless. This has made information more readily available to the clinicians for sa fe patient care. There has been a large reduction in paper notes stored and transported around the hospital. There has also been the introduction of kiosks in our outpatient clinics to support patients checking in for appointments. A new Critical Care syst em in ITU and HDU linking information direct from the monitoring equipment and laboratories to the clinical information. This supports the most vulnerable and poorly patients in the hospital and has enabled the unit to go almost paperless. Clinical testing of an Ophthalmology application to help deliver safe care for patients undergoing cataract surgery. Piloting of electronic whiteboards, electronic observations and tracking of acute medical and surgical patient to support care on the wards and flow throug h the hospital. 7 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Preparation for the hospital wide use of electronic prescribing to support safe medicines administration and reduce possible medication errors. We have focused on making sure that information is handled safely and securely. Cyber security is a risk to all organisations and one which we take seriously therefore we work with national experts to ensure that we have put the right measures in place. Across Somerset, as well as working closer with our colleagues in Somerset Partnership, we have been actively supporting county wide work. Examples include making GP information available to hospital clinicians and sending real -time emergency and discharge information to GPs. This makes sure that care information is in right place at the right time. We have also introduced the first part of the county - wide clinical shared care system, sharing care plans to help those planning end of life care. Some key headlines from the programme are contained in the graphic below: New surgical centre We are absolutely delighted that our hospital continues to receive national support to develop a new surgical centre, which will include new theatres and a critical care unit. For our patients and the people of Somerset, it means they will have access to modern, state of the art facilities, that are fit for the future. 8 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The \u00a379.5 million new surgical centre will replace much of Musgrove's ageing 1940s buildings that currently provide care for some of the most critically ill patients in Somerset. It will include: Six endoscopy rooms, patient recovery and clinical support areas. A modernised gynaecology unit Eight operating theatres (including two interventional radiology theatres), recovery areas and clinical support. 22 critical care beds, all specified for level 2 and 3 critical care patients A modernised decontamination unit The new building will be in a central location on the hospital site, close to other clinical services. Approval has now been received to work with an appointed main sbe submitted for final Treasury approval in 2020. During 2018 the Trust was also supported in its bid to enhance the provision of emergency services and develop an acute assessment hub. The development of the business case for this development will be completed in 2019. MRI charitable appeal During the year we concluded the fundraising campaign for the 3rd MRI scanner at the Hospital. Through the generosity of the donors we raised the \u00a31m required to secure his essential piece of diagnostic equipment, which will benefit a huge number of patients who may have cancers, cardiac or joint, tendon and muscle problems. The new scanner will help to ensure shorter waiting times for people in Somerset and beyond, as well as providing the hospital with greater overall scanning capacity. The new facility will be in use during the summer of 2019. Going concern International Accountin g Standards (IAS1) require the Directors to assess, as part of the accounts preparation process, the Foundation Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. In accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual paragraph 3.20, the accounts should be prepared on a going concern basis unless the directors either intend to apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolu tion of the Foundation Trust without the transfer of the services to another entity, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The Trust has developed detailed financial plans for the financial year to the end of March 2020 and these show a deficit position of \u00a36,000,000 on the NHS Improvement control total basis and \u00a35,652,000 after taking account of donated asset related movements. The planned level of deficit will potentially require the use of interim revenue support loan facilities from the Depar tment of Health and Social Care. The Trust has utilised interim revenue support loan facilities during both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years and expects these facilities to continue to be available. For this reason, the Directors consider it appro priate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 9 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Performance analysis The purpose of this section is to provide a detailed performance analysis and explain how the Trust measures performance. Clinical acti vity over the four years to 2018/19 pre -operative assessment clinic appointments, which were not previously included. Operational performance and infection control metrics Target/ threshold Performance April 2018 - March 2019 Maximum time of 18 weeks from point of referral to treatment (RTT) in aggregate - patients on an incomplete pathway** 92% 78.0% Number of patients waiting over 52 weeks from referral to treatment (RTT) Zero (year -end) 41 (end March 19) 6-week diagnostic wait 99% 77.8% A&E maximum waiting time of 4 hours from arrival to admission/transfer/discharge* 95% 88.9% Cancer 62 Day Waits for first treatment***: urgent GP referral for suspected cancer NHS cancer screening referral 85% 90% 77.3% 10 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Operational performance and infection control metrics Target/ threshold Performance April 2018 - March 2019 MRSA (Trust apportioned cases) 0 2 *A&E maximum waiting times - the indicator is expressed as a percentage of all A&E attendances where the patient spends four hours or less in A&E from arrival to transfer, admission or discharge ** RTT incomplete pathways - the indicator is expressed as the percentage of patients on an incomplete pathway (i.e. those still awaiting first consultant led treatment) who have waited less than 18 weeks from referral. *** Cancer figures are for April 2018 to February 2019 due to national reporting of March 2019 performance taking place in May. The Trust's performance against the 18 week referra l to treatment (RTT) standard has been under the national level all year due to levels of demand being higher than available service capacity. The number of referrals received was 3.5 % higher in 2018/19 than in 2017/18. However, the number of patients trea ted in the year was 1.9% higher than in 2017/18 and in line with plan. The high levels of demand resulted in an increase in the waiting list size and more patients waiting over 18 weeks for treatment. Over the year this also meant more patients waited over 52 weeks from referral to treatment, although during the second half of the year the Trust reduced the number of long waiting patients and is aiming to treat the remaining patients waiting over 52 weeks as quickly as possible in 2019/20. Trust performance against the target of treating all patients within four hours of their arrival at A&E was below the natio nal target for most of the year. However, performance remained strong relative to the national picture , with the Trust performing in the top third of trusts in the country for much of the year . During 2018/19 the Trust saw 2769 more patients in under four hours than in 2017/18 . Emergency demand remained high, with a 6.6% increase in attendances at the Emergency Department relative to 2017/18. Emergency admissions grew at a higher rate in quarter 4, but overall for the year were 2.0% above last year's levels. The Somerset A&E Delivery Board maintains oversight of a work programme aimed at reducing un -necessary emergency demand by providing alternatives t o patients being admitted and also schemes to reduce extended stays in hospital . This includes the development of rapid response hubs , work to support care homes and f ull implementation of Home First project, which commenced in 2017/18. The Home First mode l of care facilitates the discharge of medically fit patients out of the hospital. Patients receive an intensive period of reablement in three settings to promote independence and keep patients (for as long as possible) in t heir usual place of residence. Through Home First and ongoing system -wide work with partner organisations the Trust has been able to keep the number of d elayed transfers of care low this year. Performance against the four 31-day cancer standards remained strong throughout the year . These standards cover the waiting times between decision to treat and treatment, whether first treatment or subsequent treatments. But like many trusts, Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has struggled to meet the 62 -day 11 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 referral to treatment standar d for patients referred by their GP with a suspected cancer , with 77.3% of pat ients referred in by their GPs being treated within 6 2 days (against the 85% target) . However, the Trust's performance against the 62 -day GP cancer standard improved across all quarters of the year. The main reasons for the failure to achieve the standard include the complexity of patients being referred, referrals from GPs being 20% above the levels seen last year , patients choosing to delay diagnostic tests or treatment, and delays for patients being seen for specialist treatment at other providers. The 62 day screening standard was also narrowly misse d. A cancer improvement plan continues to be implemented and ad ded to, including actions to reduce the wait for the 2 -week wait step of the pathway, increase cancer diagnostic capacity, and introduce Optimal and Faster Diagnosis pathways across a range of tumour sites. Work on this will continue during 2019/20. The T rust's performance against the 6 -week diagnostic waiting times was below t he 99% national standard in 2018/19. Demand for diagnostic tests continues to be high and, like a number of trusts in the South West, the Trust had a shortfall in capacity to meet de mand , especially for MRI, endoscopy and echo scans . Additional echo and endoscopy capacity was put in place during the year, which significantly reduced the number of routine patients waiting over 6 weeks. Although additional MRI capacity was also provided through mobile scanning vans, this was insufficient to reduce the number of routine 6 week waiters with demand as a whole rising due to the growth in cancer referrals. However, during 2019 additional on-site CT and MRI scanners will be installed , which wi ll help to increase the number of scans we can undertake in the future . Unfortunately, the Trust had two cases of MRS A bloodstream infections in 2018/19 . Multi -disciplinary reviews were completed to identify the source of the infection and any areas of sub-optimal practice that may have contributed to the case. During the year the Trust also reported a total of 12 t rust-attributed Clostridium difficile cases (defined as specimen with a positive toxin test result taken on or after the fourth day of admi ssion) against a threshold for the year of 11 . This represents a reduction on the 18 cases reported in 2017/18. All trust-apportioned cases are thoroughly investigated to assess whether there was any lapse in care that may have contributed. These assessments are subsequently peer reviewed and validated with the Trust's commissioners. Learning has included ensuring appropriate compliance with environmental cleaning and hand hygiene standards. This learning h as been shared with the appropriate clinic al and non - clinical staff and improvement actions taken. Further information about this is contained within the quality report. How the foundation trust measures performance The Trust has a robust process for the measurement of performance, which triangulates quality, workforce and financial indicators. The Trust's approach is known as the PAF (performance assurance framework) process. Each directorate has its own PAF, split into four areas: patients, people, operational delivery and finance / impro vement. This is similar to a balanced scorecard approach, in line with the recommendations of Lord Carter's recent review of NHS services. 12 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The PAF is reviewed monthly. The process involves the directorate manager, directorate clinical director, representa tives from HR, finance, the operational performance and information teams and others. Each directorate reports on numerous indicators across the four PAF domains. These include all key clinical, operational and financial targets to ensure that the NHS mand ate, NHS constitution, local quality and financial targets are met. PAF meetings (and indeed Trust Board meetings) begin with a patient story to put the work of the directorate into a patient context and bring the indicators \"to life\" in relation to patie nt care. Where indicators are red, these are specifically discussed, as are areas of good practice. Selected early warning indicators are also analysed with a view to prevent them deteriorating. The PAF meetings also include a review of all high scoring ri sks (i.e. risks scoring 12 or above) to ensure the Trust is appropriately sighted upon the risks to service delivery, including access times, quality, workforce and finance. The Trust faces risks to its performance in a number of key areas, especially in r elation to high levels of demand, but continues to take action to mitigate these risks wherever possible. Along with its regularly reviewed business continuity plans, this allows the Trust, as far as possible, to respond appropriately to uncertainty. Environmental sustainability Introduction This report outlines the action taken during 2018/19 developing the Trust's Sustainability Strategy (Carbon Reduction Management Plan) which takes its priorities from the Sustainable Development Assessment Tool (SDAT). The SDAT has replaced the Good Corporate Citizen (GCC) and will provide more in depth detail on areas where focus needs to be directed to comply with the Carbon emissions reduction required by the Climate Change Act 2008. Challenges It has been a challenging year in terms of energy reduction in particular electricity consumption due to: a failure of the heating system pipework in the Jubilee building which has resulted in electric heaters being temporarily fitted in patient rooms. As a consequen ce 134 additional electric heaters have been installed during the winter period before replacement of the pipes begins in summer 2019. The relatively hot summer of 2018 required additional cooling for clinical areas to provide thermal comfort for patients and c 46 mobile air conditioning units were hired to facilitate this. Our Combined Heat and Power unit has remained out of action; the Trust seeks to remedy this with the installer in the coming year. Water usage has increased due to the need to cool e xternal air handling units positioned on the roof to enable their ability to function at peak temperature 13 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 times throughout the hot summer of 2018. This, together with a number of leaks on ageing pipework has increased water usage throughout the year. Achievements A building management analytics system is being trialled which identifies issues with individual heating control components throughout the energy and pipework system which is allowing early identification of plant failure and leaks. This system will enable a more proactive approach to rectifying issues and preventing financial and efficiency loses at an earlier stage. Funding has been secured from NHSI to upgrade the lighting in clinical areas within Duchess, Queens and Maternity Buildings at Mus grove Park and also at the medical records site in Priorswood to LED which will save 387,939 Kwh of electricity per annum and 148 tonne of carbon. A trial is currently being undertaken to use reusable sharps containers rather than single burn containers wh ich will save 50 tonne of carbon per annum and a decision on full roll out will be made in May 2019.

The reduction in CRC is due to the input of green renewable technologies, in particular the role of wind energy into the national grid which has been reflected in the conversion factor applied per kWh of both electricity and gas. Carbon emission costs have now risen to \u00a318.30 per tonne. This is the final year for the CRC scheme which will be replaced by streamlined energy and carbon frame work (SERC) on 1st April 2019, additionally the Climate change levy (CCL) has increased by 50% for electricity and 70% for gas. 2010/11 Base Year 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 % change from 2017/18to 2018/19 % 9,955 9,895 -1.5% The Trust's use resources compares favourably when compared with similar NHS Trusts, see data in table 4 below: 15 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Comparative Costs KPI National Median (Medium Acute) T&S Energy \u00a3/M2 Kwh/m2 26 475.5 27 391.5 Water \u00a3/M2 M3/M2 4.7 1.5 Waste - Clinical \u00a3/M2 \u00a3/ tonne 3.6 238 3.1 307 Annual Targets for 2019 -20 A Draft Sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP) has been prepared and is due to be updated to include the potential for a combined SDMP with Somerset Partnership. The newly merged organisation will have to review its baseline figures to incorporate both Tr usts, and calculate the changes required to meet the mandatory targets of the Climate Change Act 2008. The future SDMP will follow guidance from NHSI and the Sustainability Assessment Tool, structuring the plan around the follow key domains: Asset managem ent and utilities Travel and logistics. Adaptation Capital Projects Green space and biodiversity Sustainable Care Models Our people Sustainable use of resources Carbon / GHGs Environment, employee matters, social, community and human rights issues . Emergency preparedness, resilience and response (EPRR) The NHS needs to be able to plan for and respond to a wide range of emergencies and business continuity incidents that could affect health or patient safety. The Civil 16 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Contingencies Act 2004 outlines a single framework for civil protection in the United Kingdom. Part 1 of the Act establishes a clear set of roles and responsibilities for those involved in emergency preparedness and response at the local level. The Trust as a Category 1 responder is subj ect to the following civil protection duties: Assess the risk of emergencies occurring and use this to inform contingency planning Put in place emergency plans Put in place business continuity management arrangements Put in place arrangements to make information available to the public about civil protection matters and maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in the event of an emergency Share information with other local responders to enhance co -ordination. Co-operate with other local responders to enhance co -ordination and efficiency . NHS England Core Standards for Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response (2015) are the minimum standards which NHS organisations and providers of NHS funded care must meet. The Trust is required to follow the EPRR framework and delivery of the NHS England Core Standards. These are the minimum standards which NHS Organisations and providers of NHS funded care must meet and provide assurance around EPRR to the Commissioning Board. The 2018 audit reported that the Trust is considered to be substantially compliant with the EPRR core standards and has formally reported the same to NHS England and the Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group. The Trust has a rolling programme of live, table -top and communications exercises that are designed to test and develop our plans. The Trust is required to hold a live test every three years, a table -top test every year, and a communications cascade every six months. Whenever possible, the Trust strives to ensure that our testing is held in a multi -agency context. This is to provide familiarisation with other organisations and to assist with benchmarking our response with our partners. Exercises provide invaluable insight into the operational implementation of our plans and highlighted the areas of the plans that require further development. To facilitate information sharing, coordination and best practice the Trust is represented at the Avon and Somerset Local Health Resilien ce Partnership, the purpose of which is to ensure that effective and coordinated arrangements are in place for multi -agency emergency preparedness and response in accordance with national policy and direction from NHS England. This engagement provides a valuable platform to collaborate with partner agencies in terms of planning and to share valuable learning from events and incidents which have required a multi - agency response. The Trust also has an internal Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Gr oup to oversee its plans, key risks and mitigations and to develop staff training. Social, co mmunity and equality, diversity, anti-bribery and human rights 17 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Our strategic objectives, values and behaviours set out our commitment to treat everyone with dignity, kindness and respect, where we act fairly, without bias, accept difference and value diversity. We believe equality, diversity and inclusion are central to all that we do, both as a healthcare provider and as an employer. We have continued to focus on inclusion to ensure we improve the patient experience, we do this by ensuring our colleagues are engaged so we can make full use of their talents and diversi ty. The Equality and Inclusion Working Group has responsibility for ensuring the development, delivery and monitoring of an equality and inclusion action plan. The working group ensures the Trust acts in accordance with the statutory duties to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between people of different groups. The Trust utilises the Equality Delivery System 2 (EDS2) as this provides an excellent framework to ensure the Trust is continually rev iewing and improving performance for people with characteristics protected by the Equality Act 2010. The EDS2 is reviewed and updated annually to ensure evidence supports that services are commissions, procured and delivered to meet the health needs of the local community. In addition to this the Trust is part of a Somerset -wide equality networking group, Somerset Equality Officers' Group, and with our partners in health and social care have supported the development and subsequent adoption of the joint Som erset -wide equality objectives and joint Somerset Equality Impact Assessment framework. Some specific achievements this year have been: Raising awareness on equality, diversity and inclusion which started with a Board development day and the development of a Board equality, diversity and inclusion action plan; The Trust board formally pledged to support #TimeToTalk. Working together as an alliance, providing physical and mental health services, we pledge to support our colleagues to be ambassadors for rai sing awareness around mental health issues and always challenging stigma and discrimination. We will support our colleagues to do this and listen to the experiences of our colleagues, patients and carers; A new managed provider of interpretation and transl ation was secured this year and this service has been successfully rolled out across all Trust services; The adult Speech and Language Therapies service continues to provide support for transgender patients, with specialist support groups running for patients, providing practical as well as peer support for this group; The creation of a BME colleague network to better support our colleagues and ensure they are actively engaged in ensuring we are doing all that we can to support their development and prom otion within the organisation.

Details of overseas operations The Trust has no direct overseas operations. However, for any operations carried out on behalf of overseas visitors, the costs are recovered via a reciprocal agreement with the Somerset CCG. The Trust has no overseas operations and has no branches outsi de of the UK. Key post -year developments During 2017/18 the Trust entered into an Alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. This has been extended during 2018/19 to move towards a potential merger with Somerset Partnership. Approval of t he Strategic Case has been received from NHS Improvement and the Trust is currently developing a Full Business Case for submission to NHS Improvement in the autumn with final approval expected in early 2019/20. Full merger is expected in the spring of 202 0. Statement of comprehensive i ncome (SoCI) The fin ancial year ending 31 March 2019 has been challenging for the Trust due to a range of financial and operational pressures, particularly over the winter period. As a result of these pressures, the Trust ended the year with an overall deficit of (\u00a310.8 m) (on the financial reporting basis employed by NHS Improvement) b efore asset impairments of (\u00a34.3 m) and the net eff ect of capital donations of \u00a30.2 m, refle cting a statutory deficit of (\u00a314.9 m). Income 19 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The Trust's total income from ac tivities has increased from \u00a3308 .9m in the previou s financial year t o \u00a3322.5m in 2018/19, an increase of \u00a313.6m (4.4 %). The principal reason is that income from patient care activities has increased by \u00a314.8m (5.5%). Within this, \u00a34.5 m was from increased levels of n on-elective activity, \u00a32.2m increase in elective activity and \u00a33.5m in outpatient activity . In a ddition, the Trust received \u00a36.2m of provider sustainability funding (PSF ) income from the Department of Health and Social Care (\u00a36.7 m Sustainability and Transformation Fund in previous year). The greatest proportion of the Trust's income is derived from the provision of health care for patients in Somerset. Income generation from priv ate patient activity was \u00a32.2 m, a reduction of \u00a30.2m on the previous year . Expenditure and cost improvement pla ns Total operati ng expenditure increased in 2018/19 by \u00a324.0m (7.8%) to \u00a3332 .2m. In order to offset the impact of inflation and other cost pressures, the Tr ust set a savings target of c2.5 % of operational expenditure. The Trust set itself a stretch target of \u00a312.2 m savin gs and achieved a total of \u00a310.1 m. Total pay costs were \u00a3200.3 m in the year, an incre ase against the 2017/18 spend figure of \u00a3186.2m (7.5 %). The expenditure increases w ere mainly the result of the pay increase s awarded nationally to NHS staff along with additional staffing costs associated with workforce transformation and skill mix cha nges and dealing with increased demand particularly for non -elective and winter . Operating non -pay expenditure increased by \u00a39.2m (7.5 %) on t he pre vious year figure of \u00a3122.0 m. Expenditure on rechargeable high cost drugs prescr ibed to patients went up in 2018/19 and increased drug us age accounts for \u00a31.2 m of the overall increase in total operating expenditure. These costs are associated, in particu lar, with increased use of a number of approved high cost drugs in an increasing range of conditions, which are reclaimable through the specialised services commissioners and the cancer drugs fund. There has been one -off impairme nt costs of \u00a34.3m (\u00a32.0m in 2017/18 ) incurred within the financial year relating to the revaluation of building, equipment and land. A range of other non -pay costs have increased as a result of addressing the patient demand and waiting time pressures faced by the Trust during t he year. Statement of financial position (SOFP) Non-current assets (land, buildings and equipment) comprise the most significant elements, by value, of the SOFP and amount in total to \u00a3 185.6m as at 31 March 2019 (\u00a3182.3m as at 31 March 2018 ). Included within the net book value movements for the year were impa irments of \u00a34.3m and devaluations of \u00a31.1 m. These changes were made following the annual independent revaluations of land and buildings. 20 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The Tr ust's borrowing at 31 March 2019 amounted to \u00a3 38.8m (up from from \u00a328.8m at 31 March 2018 ). The increase has mainly resulted from the draw down of \u00a38.6m of loans from the Department of Health and Social Care to cover cash requirements resulting from the Trusts income and expenditure deficit during the period. Other significant investments in the hospital's infrastructure reflected in the SOFP include: Improvements to the Trust's estate and infrastructure (\u00a34.5 m). Continuing development of the new electronic patient records (EPR) system and global digital exemplar programme (\u00a32.9 m). IT upgrades (\u00a30.9 m). Major med ical equipment replacement (\u00a33.0 m). Radiology equipm ent and installation works (\u00a31.1 m) Oncology Equipment (\u00a33.1m) Winter Planning (\u00a30.8m) Development and planning of the theatres and acute a ssessment hub schemes to be funded from central STP capital allocations (\u00a30.7m) . Total capital investments i n 2018/19 amounted to \u00a317.0m (\u00a313.3m in 2017/18 ). Capital investment in 2019/20 is expected to be \u00a319 .6m including the planned development work o n the theatres redevelopment and acute assessment hub . Other features of the SOFP The level of cash deposits increased from \u00a34.9m at 31 March 2018 to \u00a38.2m at 31 March 2019 . Other accounting matters Note 34 of the accounts outlines any related party transactions. This shows that none of the Board members, or key management staff, or parties related to them, has undertaken any material transactions with the Trust. In line with the requirements for foundation trusts to prepare accounts in compliance with International Reporting Standards, the Trust has reviewed all of its accounting policies for the year ended 31 March 2019. Changes have been made to reflect the requirements of the newly introduced International Financial Reporting Standard 9 - Finan cial Instruments and 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Trust Board acts as the corporate Trustee for the Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust General Charitable Funds, registered with the Charities Commission.

The Trust plan for the 2019/20 financial year are for a small forecast surplus of \u00a30.3 m after taking i nto account savings plans of 2.5 % of turnover. The Trust continues to work closely with system partners to address the significant financial challenges in Somerset. ................................. Peter Lewis , Chief Executive, 23 May 2019 Accountability report NHS foundation trust code of governance disclosures Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has applied the principles of the NHS foundation trust code of governance on a comply or explain basis. The NHS foundation trust code of governance , most recently revised in July 2014, is based on the principles of the UK corporate governance code issued in 2012. How the Board of Directors and Council of Governors operate The Board and Council of Governors exercise their functions as se t out in the Trust's constitutional documents, relevant legislation and the regulatory framework. The general duty of the Board, and of each director, is to act with a view to promoting the success of the Trust so as to maximise the benefits for its membe rs. The Board has resolved that certain powers and decisions may only be exercised by the Board in formal session. Guidance is available in the Trust's standing financial instructions to determine the Board or Committee from which approval of decisions i s required. The Council of Governors is made up of elected and nominated governors who provide an important link between the hospital, local people and key organisations, sharing information and views that can be used to develop and improve services. It is chaired by the Trust Chairman. The Lead Governor is Kate Butler. The Council consists of 29 governors: 15 publicly elected governors from four constituencies (Taunton, West Somerset, East Somerset and Rest of England). Five staff governors e lected by self -nomination and constituency voting, representing a minimum of three out of the following five staff groups: - Medical and dental - Nursing and midwifery 22 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 - Hotel and estates services - Clerical, administrative and managerial - Allied professionals, scientific and technical. Eight partnership/local authority governors appointed by partnership or stakeholder organisations. A youth governor representative. The Council of Governors is responsible for appointing or removing the Chairm an of the Trust and other non -executive directors. This requires the approval of three - quarters of the members of the Council of Governors. The Council of Governors is also responsible for the following: During 2018/19, the Council of Governors carried out the following statutory duties: Approved the appointment of the Lead Governor (Kate Butler). Approved the re -appointment of three non -executive directors and the appointment of two joint non -executive directors from Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Board. Approve amendments to constitution Coun cil of Governors Hold non- executive directors to account for the performance of the board Represent the interests of members of the t rust and the inte rest of the publi c App rove significant transactions.

Engaged in the development of the Strategic Case for Merger with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The merger will need to be approved by governors later in 2019. Influenced the development of a new Constitution for the proposed merged Trust in partnership with representatives f rom Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Council of Governors', via a joint Constitution Review Group. Representatives of the Council of Governors' were members of the Joint Governor Appointment Committee, in relation to the composition of non - execu tive directors on the post -merger Trust Board. The Council of Governors has three sub -committees which meet outside the formal meetings of the full Council. The committees are chaired by public governors and focus on specific issues in relation to stra tegy, patient care and membership and communications. The committees provide reports and recommendations, as appropriate, for consideration by the Council of Governors. The Trust's non - executive and executive directors regularly attend the Council of Gov ernors and the sub-committee meetings on a regular basis, to develop an understanding of the views of governors and members. Governors are also encouraged to attend and observe meetings of the Board as part of their role. In addition, the Council of Go vernors has an Appointments Committee which is responsible for considering the remuneration, terms of employment and performance of the non -executive directors of the Trust Board (including the Chairman). The Appointments Committee is chaired by the Trust Chairman, except when it relates to him, when it is chaired by the Senior Independent Director. In the event of dispute between the Council of Governors and the Board of Directors, in the first instance the Chairman, on the advice of the Secretary, a nd such other advice as the Chairman may see fit to obtain, shall seek to resolve the dispute. If the Chairman is unable to resolve the dispute, he shall appoint a special committee comprising equal numbers of directors and governors to consider the circu mstances and to make recommendations to the Council of Governors and the Board of Directors with a view to resolving the dispute. If the recommendations (if any) of the 24 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 special committee are unsuccessful in resolving the dispute, the Chairman may refer the dispute back to the Board of Directors who shall make the final decision.

A copy is available on the Tru st's website at www.tsft.nhs.uk (as part of the Council of Governors' meeting papers) or by emailing governors@tst.nhs.uk It is not considered that there are any significant interests held by governors which may conflict with their responsibilities, but it should be noted that Judith Goodchild is also Chair of Healthwatch and as such does not comment on the Trust's quality report in this capacity. Engagement with members We recognise the importance of having a strong and engaged membership. With circa 16,053 members (public and staff combined), the Trust has access to the local population, interaction with which helps to i mprove hospital services. The focus of the Trust's membership strategy, which is set and monitored by the Board, is on improving meaningful engagement with its members. In support of this aim, the Trust engages with its members via email, through the pub lication of Members' Briefing (which is a popular communication tool) and through events and meetings such as the annual members' meeting held in September each year. The Trust's membership (which is reviewed by the Communication and Engagement Working Group on behalf of the Council of Governors and the Board), is broadly representative of the population it serves. According to 2011 census data, the 27 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 majority of Somerset residents are 'white British'. Somerset also has an increasingly older population, an d the Trust's membership reflects this trend.

Directors ' report The directors are required to prepare an annual report and accounts for each financial year. The directors consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for patients, regulators and stakeholders to assess the Trust's performance, business model and strategy. The Trust has complied with the cost allocation and charging guidance issued by HM Treasury. Statement of disclosure to the auditors So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Trust's auditor is unaware. The directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establi sh that the NHS foundation trust's auditor is aware of that information. Income disclosures The Trust has met the requirement set out in Section 43(2A) of the NHS Act 2006 (as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2012) that income for the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England has been greater than its income from the provision of goods and services for any other purposes. The Trust has made no political or charitable donations.

Internal audit function, appointment/reappointment and removal of external auditor and audit committee role The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board. As part of its role, the Audit Committee seeks assurance on the adequacy of internal control processes within the Trust. To achieve the required levels of assurance, the Committee utilises the various audi t functions of management, internal auditors (BDO) and external auditors (PwC /KPMG ) and counter fraud. This meets mandatory NHS audit standards. The Audit Committee also takes assurance from the views of other external agencies about the Trust's procedur es and from the Governance and Quality Committee and Finance Committee. The Audit Committee has the right to enquire into any area of the Trust's workings without hindrance. The Audit Committee agrees the internal audit work plan each year and receives the reports and follow -ups on the issues raised. The internal audit plan is based on the Trust's assurance framework and corporate risk register and is reviewed by the Trust's committee of the Board. Where audits of major issues or risks are identified, managers who are responsible for the areas reviewed are asked to attend the Audit Committee meeting and report on the steps taken to rectify the situation. As for 2017/18, the internal auditors, BDO, have provided a moderate assurance opinion for 2018/19 that the Trust has a sound system of internal control. The Audit Committee reviews and monitors the external auditor's independence, objectivity and effectiveness at least once per year. The Audit Committee also reviews any non -audit work carried out b y the external auditor to ensure that the objectivity and independence of the external auditor is not impaired. The Audit Committee discusses the audit of the Trust's annual report and accounts with the external auditor prior to the Board's approval, in p articular any areas of concern arising from work during the year. The Trust's external audit services were supplied by PwC until 1 July 2018. A procurement exercise was undertaken jointly with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in April 2018 with the aim to award separate contracts but to the same provider for the two trusts with a commencement date of 1 July 2018. This contract was awarded to KPMG for the period 1 July 2018 to 30 August 2021. The cost of other non -audit work undertaken during 2017/18 was \u00a32k. Other non - audit assurance services amounted to \u00a30k. 30 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The Audit Committee approved the external audit plan 201 8-19 which outlined how KPMG planned to discharge its audit duties for the financial year. The Audit Committee considered the ri sks which were thought to be significant in relation to PwC's audit for the year ended 31 March 2019 : Risk of management override of controls. Valuation of the Trust's land and buildings. Revenue recognition. Non-pay expenditure recognition Value for money . Throughout the year, the Audit Committee has received and reviewed progress reports from PwC /KPMG in delivering its responsibilities as the Trust's external auditor, together with other matters of interest such as key technical areas and sector updates. The Audit Committee has confirmed throughout the year that the risks identified in the external audit plan have remained valid. The Audit Committee receives and monitors the policies and procedures associated with counter fraud. The Trust's counter fraud manager produces a regular counter fraud progress report, giving updates on both reactive and pro -active work and assists the Tr ust in ensuring it has policies that are compliant with the NHS Counter Fraud Authority and all standards for NHS providers. NHS Improvement's well -led framework The Trust has a governance policy that describes the arrangements in place for quality go vernance, including committee structures, accountabilities and reporting requirements. These governance arrangements are discussed in detail in the annual governance statement and quality report. No material inconsistencies have been identified between t he annual governance statement and the report from the Trust's Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection in 2017. The quality report in appendix 1 details the range of work in which the Trust is involved aimed at improving patient care and stakeholder en gagement. Details about the Trust's implementation of NHS Improvement's well-led framework can be found in the annual governance statement. There is a system for internal control that includes the assurance framework and the Trust has an ongoing pr ocess for providing assurance on, and improving, the governance of quality, overseen by the Trust's Governance and Quality Committee.

Peter Lewi s, Chief Executive, 23 May 2019 43 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Remuneration Report Non-audited information The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises the non - executive directors and determines the level of remuneration, terms of service for the Chief Executive and other executive directors. It supports the work of the Chairman in assessin g the size, structure and skill requirements of the Board. The remuneration element of the Committee is chaired by the Senior Independent Director, Kate Fallon, and the nomination element of the Committee is chaired by the Trust's Chairman, Colin Drummond . At present, the Trust employs colleagues under a number of pay and conditions of service (medical and dental contracts, agenda for change and spot salaries). In determining pay, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee seeks to strike a balance between setting pay at a level sufficient to recruit, retain and reward individuals of a high calibre and ensuring best value in the use of public finances. Although s taff are not formally consulted on pay rates, increases are set in line with those staff on agenda for change national terms and conditions. In some cases, an additional responsibility payment may be paid where individual senior managers are required to take on significant responsibilities outside of their core role for an extended period. The allowance should be linked to the proportion of time spent on the additional responsibilities and would not normally exceed 10% of basic salary. Executive members of the Board are employed on contracts with no fixed or specified term, save for the Chief Medical Officer, who is subject to a three year fixed term in respect of his executive role. Notice periods for executive members of the Board are set at six month s. No provision is made for additional termination payments. The Remuneration Committee is the body charged with determining payments for loss of office. There is no policy for such payments. Instead, the Committee makes individual decisions on the ra re occasions where such payments may be warranted. These decisions relate to both the award of a loss of office payment and on the value of any such payment. The Committee is free to exercise its discretion, and bases its decisions on the circumstances of the loss of office, the performance of the office - holder, and any other factors deemed relevant. See page 45 onwards for salary and pension entitlements for senior managers. See page 31 onwards for details of the membership and attendance of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The Trust is required to disclose the steps it has taken to satisfy itself that the remuneration is reasonable in cases where senior managers are paid mor e than \u00a3150,000 p.a. There are two senior managers currently employed by the Trust who were paid more than \u00a3150,000p.a. (the Chief Executive and the Chief Medical Officer). The salaries for these posts have been benchmarked and are commensurate with natio nal, regional and local comparator roles within the NHS, reflecting the very high levels of responsibility associated with the posts, particularly 44 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 as these individuals have also been appointed to these roles within Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . Fair Pay - audited information The mid -point banded remuneration of the highest -paid director in Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust in the financial year 2018/19 was \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3205,000 (2017/18: \u00a3195,000 to \u00a3200 ,000). Reporting bodies are required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest paid director in their organisation and the median remuneration of the organis ation's workforce. This was 8.3 times (2017/18: 7.8) the median remuneration of the wo rkforce, was \u00a324,768 (2017/18: \u00a325,197 ). In 2018/19 , one employee received remuneration in excess of the highest -paid director (2017/18 : 1). Total remuneration includes salary, non -consolidated performance -related pay, benefits -in-kind of which there were non e in 2018/19 . It does not include severance payments, employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. The calculation is based on full -time equivalent staff of the reporting entity at the reporting period end date on an annualised basis. Where there is a sharing arrangement, it is the cost to the entity of an individual that identifies them as \"highest paid\" and not the total of that individual's remuneration. Termination benefits are excluded from the calculation of the highest -paid director's salary to avoid disturbing the ratio. During 2017/18 the Trust appointed a joint executive team with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. This increased the composition and the responsibilities of the executive te am, who now operate across both trusts as part of an alliance to deliver more joined -up health services for the population of Somerset.

The benefits v alued are the member's accumulated benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. The real increase in CETV reflects the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It takes account of the increase in accrued pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from another sc heme or arrangement) and uses comm on market valuation factors for the start and end of the period. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership o f the pension scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which the disclosure applies. The CETV figures, and from 2004 -05 the other pension details, include the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to t he NHS pension scheme. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing additional years of pension service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty of Actua ries. .................................

Sickness absence data and staff wellbeing - audited information The following figures are reported in the annual accounts and are based on the financial year: Total number of staff years 4028 Total days lost through sickness 52,213 Calculated absences per staff year 13 60 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The Trust experienced monthly levels of sickness during 2018/19 ranging from 3.6% to 4.4%. These levels are an improvement on the previous year that peaked at 4.6%. Analysis of the reasons for sickness absence showed the two main causes as stress/anxiety related and musculoskeletal. The Trust provides a range of interventions to maintain well-being; these were further enhanced during the year by the involvement in the NHSI wellbeing programme. This programme is designed to support Trusts to use improvement methodology to identify root causes impacting on sickness and identify actions to support improvement. These actions have been designed to support colleagues with building resilience and minimising the impact of stress. A wellbeing strategy was launched during 2018/19 and the Trust ran the first wellbeing conference for colleagues. The focus continues to be on prevention rather than the management of sickness absence; the strategy will be reviewed and updated during 2019/20. Health and safety There continues to be a positive health and safety culture within the organisation and this is recognised by external regulators such as the Health and Safety Executive. The Trust's Health and Safety Committee and the Safety Environment and Advisors Group (SEAG) are effective meetings that ensure structures and processes are in place to successfully manage health and safety. Safety topic leads report to SEAG either directly or via specialist safety meetings such as the Fire Safety Committee. SEAG is chaire d by the health and safety advisor who is responsible for ensuring that a structure is in place to manage the health and safety functions for the 24 topic leads that report into it. This includes policy consultation, development and approval, monitoring o f policy implementation plans, policy monitoring and action plan updates. This work schedule aligns with the Integrated Quality Assurance Board (IQAB). Policies are in place for health and safety related topics along with a robust system for policy monitoring. This reports in to the SEAG work schedule. Incidents reported to the HSE under RIDDOR The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulation (RIDDOR) requires the Trust to report deaths, certain types of injury, some occupa tional diseases and dangerous occurrences that 'arise out of or in connection with work'. An annual RIDDOR report has been prepared and considered in the relevant fora. All RIDDORs are fully investigated and monitored. An overview of all RIDDORs is a st anding agenda item on the safety committees. During 201 8/19, the Trust reported 2 3 incidents to the Health and Safety Executive as detailed in the table below. This is a slight decrease from the 2 4 incidents during 201 7/18. Of the 23 incidents, three were classified in the major incident category due to the nature of injuries that were sustained. The following two tables are an extract from the annual report and give an indication of the total number of RIDDORs year on year and breakdown by cause. 61 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Numb er of RIDDOR reports made to the Health and Safety Executive - 2014/15 - 2018/19 Number of RIDDOR NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Counter Fraud Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust supports the NHS Counter Fraud Authority strategy that aims to reduce fraud within the NHS. We are committed to the prevention, detection and investigation of any such allegations and will seek to apply criminal, disciplinary, regulatory and civil sanctions where allegations are upheld. This includes the recovery of identified losses to ensure that NHS resources are used for their intended purpose - the delivery of patient care. The Trust employs a counter fraud m anager who conducts both proactive and reactive work to ensure that resources are not wrongfully diverted from patient care and there is a robust anti-fraud, bribery and corruption policy in place. All colleagues, contractors, vendors and patients are enco uraged to report concerns to the Trust's local counter fraud manager or NHS Counter Fraud Authority. Support for colleague health and wellbeing The Trust works hard to look after its people and to keep them well. There is an employee assistance program me provided by Right Management Workplace Wellness which offers around the clock access to free and confidential advice and support for all staff. The workplace wellness team helps colleagues to proactively identify, plan and manage life events and helps them to stay in control, happy, healthy and fully focused on life and work. The Trust actively participated in Wellbeing Month in March to support colleagues in taking care of themselves, which in turn helps them to take better care of our patients. Staff policies and actions applied during the financial year The Trust's recruitment and selection policy ensures that full and fair consideration is given to applications for employment made by disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities . This is further enhanced by the Trust's special leave policy and probationary period policy , which have specific provisions to ensure that the needs of disabled persons are taken into account. Such policies apply to those who become disabled persons duri ng the year, and the Trust is also compliant with the Equalities Act, which requires the provision of tailored measures to ensure that the needs of disabled employees are met. Many of the Trust's policies in regard to training, career development and prom otion make no specific provisions for employees with disabilities. However, all employees are treated equally, and provisions are made for reasonable adjustments where required. We work hard to engage our people in all that we do. Our executive and non - executive directors, as well as our governors, visit areas across the hospital to hear feedback from staff directly. Also, the Trust's Chief Executive encourages colleagues to share their feedback honestly and easily and there are regular drop -in sessions for colleagues to meet with the executive director team. A variety of direct and confidential communication channels are provided through the intranet, email and paper forms. Employees are provided with information on matters of concern to them. There ar e a range of communication and engagement tools that are utilised: 63 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 A weekly staff bulletin, managers ' briefing, Board briefing and governors' briefing. Executive director drop -in sessions. A team brief (with key strategic messages and operational perf ormance) published on a monthly basis, key points from which are presented to colleagues (all of whom are invited) by the executive directors and dialogue encouraged. Urgent and important notices are sent by email to all colleagues. The use of social media as a form of interaction and communication (including Facebook and Twitter). Sharing information on the intranet, on which there is a comprehensive combination of organisational news, publications, database of policies and patient information, departmental information and information about colleague benefits. Some questionnaires are also hosted in this way. The Trust takes concerns raised by colleagues and patients very seriously and has processes in place to enable staff to rais e concerns without fear of reprisal, further information about this is available on the Trust's intranet pages. We aim to create a culture where colleagues, patients and carers are able to speak out when concerned about safety, quality or how we are demon strating our values. We know there will be occasions when we don't get things right; which is why encouraging colleagues and patients to raise concerns openly as part of normal day - to-day practice is an important part of improving the quality of the ser vice we provide, patient safety and experience. We have further invested this year in the time allocated to our freedom to speak up guardians who play a key role in helping to raise the profile of raising concerns. Colleagues can confidentially speak to them for advice and support in relation to concerns they have about patient safety and/or the way their concern has been handled. They help to fos ter an environment that is open and honest and to support a culture where colleagues feel comfortable about raising concerns and issues, no matter how big or small. During 201 8/19 the freedom to speak up guardians have been raising awareness of their role across the Trust - including during a dedicated freedom to speak up awareness week . We were also fortunate to be visited by the National Freedom to Speak Up Guardian, Henrietta Hughes to support the work we are doing. Staff Survey The 2018 staff survey was completed between September and December 2018 with a 38% response rate equating to feedback from 1,689 colleagues, which was a slight decrease on the response rate of 40% in 2017 and is below the average response rate of 44% of comparable Trusts. In 2018 the NHS Staff survey saw some key changes in the way the results were reported these changes included the following: 64 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 A move from 32 Key findings to 10 Key Themes A move from a 5 point rating scale to a 10 point rating scale The introduction of a new th eme under the heading Morale The 10 Key themes and the results for Taunton and Somerset can be seen in the table below: The table shows that there were four significant changes in the results falling under the themes of Health and Wellbeing, Quality of C are, Safety Culture and Staff Engagement.

The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care. Finance and use of resources. Operational performance. Strategic change. Leadership and improvement capability (well -led). Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with 71 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 maximum autonomy. A Trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. Segmentation The Trust has been placed in segment 3 under the new single oversight framework . This segmentation information is the Trust's position as at 31 March 201 9. Current segmentation information for NHS trusts and foundation trusts is published on NHS Improvement's website. Finance and use of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the single oversight framework , the segmentation of the Trust disclosed above might not b e the same as the overall finance score here.

The relevant responsibilities of the accounting officer, including their responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which t hey are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum issued by NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Accounts Directions which require Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust to prepare for each financial year a statement of accounts in the form and on the bas is required by those Directions. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Taunton and Somerset NHS foundation trust and of its income and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care's Group Accounting Manual and in particular to: Observe the Accounts Direction issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis. Make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis. State whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements. Ensure that the use of pub lic funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance and Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The accounting officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS foundation trust and to enable him/her to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets o f the NHS foundation trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Tru st Accounting Officer Memorandum . 73 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Peter Lewis, Chief Executive, 23 May 201 9 Annual Governance Statement Scope of responsibility As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am per sonally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Trust Accountable Officer Memorandum . The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of t he policies, aims and objectives of Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of inte rnal control has been in place in Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 201 9 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Capacity to handle risk The Trust has identified an executive director with r esponsibility for progressing risk management in the organisation. The Director of Governance and Corporate Development has clearly defined risk management responsibilities and is supported by the Associate Director of Integrated Governance. The Chief Op erating Officer has overall accountability for the day to day delivery of risk management activity within the clinical directorates. Responsibilities for risk management are clearly defined within job descriptions for all of these roles. The Trust's gov ernance support unit is responsible for providing appropriate training, support and guidance to enable all managers to carry out their risk management responsibilities. Specific training courses on risk management for managers, risk assessment, incident m anagement and investigation are supported by a corporate induction and mandatory update programme covering all regulatory requirements. The Director of Governance and Corporate Development and Chief Operating Officer are key members of the Trust's Executi ve Committee, where the risk register is reviewed monthly to ensure operational risks are being adequately controlled. The Director of Governance and Corporate Development co-chairs the Trust's key operational management group for governance, the Integra ted Quality Assurance 74 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Board (IQAB), with the Chief Nurse and Chief Medical Officer. T he Associate Director of Integrated Governance is also a key member of this committee. The IQAB meets monthly to monitor progress with corporate and operational plans an d receive assurance reports and improvement plans from nominated leads on all regulatory requirements in accordance with its reporting schedule. The Trust's Serious Incident Review Group meets regularly to share issues raised following incidents, complain ts, concerns and claims, along with information from other key sources, such as morbidity and mortality reviews. This enables sharing of good practice and lessons learned via directorate governance structures and allows for direct input into the Trust's i mprovement programme. The Audit Committee has responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the Trust's risk management systems and for reviewing and challenging the organisation's risk appetite and maturity. The risk and control framework The Trust's governance policy details how risk will be identified, evaluated and managed. It gives details of the monitoring arrangements and the authority for decision -making through identified posts or committees. The main methods for the identification of risk are: Review of compliance with key standards, for example the Care Quality Commission (CQC) registration requirements, and legislation such as the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974). Executive review of annual and strategic objectives to identify potential risks to meeting those objectives. Local risk assessment at departmental level, feeding up to divisional risk registers. Facilitated risk identification sessions at various levels in the organisation. Incident reporting and complaints informatio n. Information from external sources such as the Care Quality Commission's (CQC) inspection, audits and patient and staff surveys. All risks are assessed and evaluated using a standard form and scoring system, allowing direct comparison. From this evalu ation, risks are categorised into one of three accountability levels, and responsibility for the control and monitoring of the risk is allocated to the department, the directorate or the Trust's executive team, depending on the level identified. Responsib ility for completing actions is allocated to an individual manager, with monitoring carried out by the relevant directorate committee or Trust executive director. The three accountability levels are set based on the Trust's risk appetite, which is regular ly reviewed by the Board. Risk identification is linked to the setting of organisational objectives, as detailed in the Trust's board assurance framework. Capital planning includes an assessment of risk issues, and spending is prioritised on a risk basi s. All papers considered by the Board are referenced to the risks they are aimed at addressing. The board assurance framework links to the significant risks that may affect the Trust achieving 75 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 its objectives, how they are currently controlled and what so urces of assurance the Board has that the risks are being managed appropriately. It also details action that is necessary to reduce the risks or improve sources of assurance, with prioritisation based on the standard Trust risk evaluation process. Inform ation and data security risks are identified and managed through the Trust's risk assessment and incident reporting processes. The Trust has established an Data Security and Protection Group to monitor this process and provide assurance on the systems in p lace for managing information risks. As part of its ongoing commitment to risk management, the governance support unit develops an annual plan, monitored by the Governance and Quality Committee that includes key risk management objectives. The Trust's in ternal work plan is linked to key risks. Assurance on compliance with Care Quality Commission (CQC) registration requirements, along with other key regulatory requirements, is provided to the Governance and Quality Committee via the work of the Integrated Quality Assurance Board (IQAB). The IQAB reviews the assurances in place for all requirements in line with an annual plan, providing regular updates to the Governance and Quality Committee. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the CQC. The Trust involves its key stakeholders in managing risks which impact on them in a variety of ways and the Council of Governors has a key role in supporting and challenging the Board. The Trust's key risks for 201 8/19 were: Financial challenges and failure to achieve control total. Operational pressures having an impact on the quality of care provision and the delivery of the Trust's operational performance standards (RTT, 62 day cancer, diagnostic waiting times and A&E). Management of demand across the system, particularly in emerg ency care. Age of the estate. Key clinical staffing vacancies, particularly in nursing. Recruitment, training and retention of key clinical staff. In 2019/120 and into the longer -term, there are a number of similar, key strategic risks facing by Taunto n and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust relating to financial, operational and staffing challenges across the Somerset health and care system, including cash flow and the ageing estate. The Trust will continue to look at how these risks can be mitigated throu gh the alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and by working more closely with other partners in Somerset and in neighbouring counties and as part of the sustainability and transformation plan (STP). Developing Workforce Safeguards 76 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 In Oct ober 2018 NHSI released 'Developing workforce safeguards - supporting providers to deliver high quality care through effective staffing'. The report made many recommendations and highlighted good practice to support Trusts make evidenced decisions about sa fe staffing levels across all clinical areas, covering all staffing groups. The Trust has reviewed the safeguards and recommendations during the year and put in place, along with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, a series of measures to meet these requirements. Central to this is the resourcing principles, aims and plans set out in the joint People Strategy published in May 2018. We have in place regular reviews of safe staffing for inpatient ward areas with safecare data triangulated against ou tcomes such as incidents, red flag reports or any harm reported, professional opinion from clinical leaders about current risks or mitigation in all areas. There is a six -monthly report to the Trust Board on safer staffing in inpatient wards and it is pla nned to extend this to include all clinical professions in the next twelve months. The Trust does not as yet have a comprehensive workforce plan that extends to all clinical professionals but is working with colleagues and partner organisations through the Local Workforce Action Board to develop this. Any service changes, skill mix reviews and new roles are subject to a Quality Impact Assessment process that it shared with organisations across the county. Escalation processes are documented and are linked to system -wide escalation needs. Where these issues have continued or increase d, these are escalated to the Trust 's board. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation 's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Trust has an up -to-date register of interests for decision -making staff and will be publishing this, as required by the 'Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS' guidance, in June 2019. There are no significant risks relating to compliance with the NHS foundation trust condition four relating to corporate governance. As part of its internal audit plan, the Trust undertakes reviews of its governance and risk management arrangements. The Trust has further developed its risk management processes to ensure that relevant and up to date risk information is available at all key meetings, ensuring that decisions are based on robust assessments of risk. The Trust has an open and fair culture , encouraging incident reporting to enable the hospital to learn and improve as part of its core business. As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contai ned within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately up dated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. 77 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The trust has undertaken risk as sessments and has a sustainable development management plan in place which is being developed to take account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirem ents are complied with. Annual Quality Account The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare quality reports for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of those powers conferred on Monitor) ha s issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual quality reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual . The Chief Nurse leads the development of the annual quality report. Key stakeholders are involved in the development of the report. The development of the priorities and indicators was based on all types of patient feedback over the year, with the Council of Governors approving the final list of prioritie s. The Head of Integrated Governance, supported by the governance support unit, clinical information analysts, clinical audit facilitators and other specialists, has coordinated the preparation of the quality report. Controls are in place to ensure that all the Trust's employees have the appropriate skills and expertise to perform their duties. This includes the provision of relevant training and helps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data collected and prepared by employees and which is used to assess the quality of the Trust's performance. The quality metrics included in the report have been regularly reported through Trust governance structures, including the Governance and Quality Committee, Trust Board and Council of Governors where appropr iate. Data quality issues are addressed through the Trust's information governance systems in line with its information and data quality policy. The metrics include key measures developed with the Trust's principal commissioners, the Somerset CCG, to p rovide them with assurance that the Trust is providing high quality care. Additional measures relating to patient experience are provided by the monthly assessments that the Trust has established, overseen by the Trust's Patient Experience Committee. The quality report presents a fair and balanced view of the activities of the Trust, based on data which is subject to rigorous quality control as well as internal and external audit. The data used to inform the quality report is overseen by the Trust's Information team and the governance support unit, in compliance with the policies and procedures in place to ensure the quality of data. Information governance, cyber and data security 78 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The Trust manages its information governance agenda through a number of different approaches. The Governance and Corporate Development Director chairs the Data Security and Protection Group (DSPG), which is responsible for setting the framework for information governance standards in the Trust and ensuring delivery of action plans to improve compliance. A key part of the DSPG work is to review compliance against the Data Security and Protection Toolkit and to ensure evidence is externally assured through audit. In 2018/19 the Trust achieved 'Standards Exceeded' rating withi n the Data Security and Protection Toolkit. The information governance framework is supported by the Data Protection Officer, The Caldicott Guardian and the Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO). Information Governance SIRIs There were five data breach es which were required to be reported to the Information Commissioner's Office during 2018/19. No further action was taken by the ICO. Cyber Security Cyber and data security continues to be an important focus for Taunton & Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and the NHS in England. Throughout 2018/19, improved processes have been implemented for the management of cyber incidents as part of our routine business processes, with the corporate IM&T security team responding to threats and reporting any Cyber Serio us Incidents Requiring Investigation (CSIRI) to DH and NHS Digital where appropriate. No CSIRI were reported to NHS Digital in 2018/19. Action Plan During 2019/20 we will maintain compliance by completion of the Data Security and Protection Toolkit and c ontinuing our readiness and compliance with the Data Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulation. Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources An important part of the Trust's responsibility is that the Trust assesses and reviews the financial sustainability of the organisation. As such the Trust has considered the scale of the financial challenges it is facing over the next 12 month period. The Trust has developed detailed financial plans for the financial year to the end of March 2020 and these show a breakeven position on the NHS Improvement control total basis with a small surplus of \u00a3348,000 after taking account of donated asset related m ovements. The Trust has utilised interim revenue support loan facilities from the Department of Health and Social Care during both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years and expects these facilities to continue to be available should financial performan ce deteriorate significantly from the plan. For this reason, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparin g the accounts . 79 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Throughout the year the Finance Committee and the Board have closely monitored the financial position and the impact of the significant operational pressures on the delivery of the Trust's financial plan. The Trust ensures economy, efficiency and effectiveness through a variety of means, including: A robust pay and non -pay budgetary control system. A suite of effective and consistently applied financial controls. Effective tendering procedures. Continuous service and cost improvement. The Trust benchmarks efficiency in a variety of ways, including the national reference costs index a nd by comparison with the annual surpluses generated by all foundation trusts. Conclusion No significant control issues have been identified. ..................... ....................

Our vision is to work together with all our partners in health and social care in Somerset to improve the health and wellb eing of the people of the county by providing and supporting high quality, effective , physical, specialist, mental health and learning disability services. This year, maintaining and improving the quality of care we provide to patient across our many servi ces remained our overarching priority, even as, like many NHS providers, we made significant efficiency savings. We believe that our unrelenting focus on patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience has helped to ensure our success . Taun ton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has formed an alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust which provides community, mental health and disability services across Somerset, ahead of the two trusts merging. We are merging because we believe that, working as one organisation, we will improve outcomes for our patients and they will have a better experience. We already have a single Joint Executive Team for the two trusts and the report which follows will highlight some of the patient benefits w hich are already occurring. As our clinical teams across both trusts think through how we can integrate our community, mental health and learning disability, and hospital services in the future, one of our aims is to p rovide parity between the physical an d mental healthcare needs of all of our patients. This journey is seen in Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust's quality priorities for 2018/9, one of which aimed to increase our hospital colleagues' capability to recognise and respond to patients wi th mental health needs. To achieve this aim we have: continued to train frontline hospital staff with enhanced knowledge and skills to support people with menta l health conditions or distress; built clinical links between the adult and children's wards in mental health and Musgrove Park Hospital, with some c olleagues shadowing one another; Quality Account 2 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 expanded the liaison psychiatry service which provides input into the care of mentally unwell patients in the acute. The new enhanced service is being offered across the 24/7 period; worked with the liaison psychiatry team to improve the Emergency Department for patients with mental health con ditions; introduced activity co -ordinators on three elderly care wards to increase mental and physical stimulation for patients in o rder to reduce agitation. Our patients are our partners and their experience of the care we provide, their thoughts and feedback are central to the quality of care we provide. Patients provide feedback through a number of national surveys, for example the adult inpatient survey and the maternity survey; through our patient advice and liaison service; via feedback to our services themselves; and via additional qualitative work that our teams do. We want to go further than this because we know that if we co -design services with patients and service users our services will meet their expectations better. We are building on this approach and supporting improvement projects to bring colleagues and service users together in a co -design approach. Our aim is for pa tient partners to be on each of the improvement boards and for each new improvement project to use co -design methodology. Our colleagues, the thousands of staff who deliver our services, are central to the quality of care we deliver and to our patients' ex perience. There is a direct link between the engagement, development and wellbeing of our staff and the quality of care they deliver. This is recognised in our sixth quality priority which focusses on the wellbeing and retention of our colleagues. We have developed a detailed retention and wellbeing plan using quality improvement methodology. This retention plan was agreed in July 2018 and progress is monitored by a working group. In March 2018 we held our first wellbeing month focussed on the emotional, p hysical and mental wellbeing of colleagues across both trusts. We also ran a very successful wellbeing conference which brought colleagues from both trusts together to talk through this important topic. The quality of care we provide will continue to be o ur number one aim through 2019/20. Indeed, it is our central reason for merging with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in the future. Some of our quality priorities are longer term aims that we will continue to focus on in the coming year. I look f orward to updating you on our work next year. The Trust has a mechanism in place to identify any guidance issued by the Secretary of State and act upon it appropriately. To the best of my knowledge and belief, the information in the Quality Account is acc urate. Quality Account 5 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 from deaths' cannot be taken in isolation and is intricately linked to the Trust 's review of serious incidents via the Serious Incident Review Group (SIRG) and departmental/directorate governance. What did we want to achieve? The Mortality Surveillance Group (MSG) aim to achieve: Deaths within priority patient criteria are identified and included for both standard and group -specific review. Mortality reviews are completed using the Trust proforma and with clear judgement on quality and avoidability. Speci alty mortality and m orbidity meetings are held and discussion of outputs and learning documented. Cases with significant concerns are referred for investigation via the serious incident review process. Directorate and topic -based revie w takes place to identify further learning. Examples of action taken Specific examples of action taken include, teaching on end of life care within general surgery/vascular patients and the involvement of the learning disabilities team within respiratory m edicine. Performance to -date During A pril 2018 to March 2019, 1,303 patients at Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust died (including inpatients and patients in the Emerge ncy Department (ED) ). By 8 April 2019, 631 case record reviews and nine invest igations have been carried out in relation to 579 of the deaths. Six, representing 1.0% of the patient deaths during the reporting period , are judged more likely than not to have been due to problems in patient care. How this will be measured and monitor ed? The MSG is formed to support the Trust to monitor patient outcomes and ensure the Trust provides clinically effective care. It s objectives include develop ing and oversee ing the systems relied upon to review deaths within the hospital, including specia lty mortality and morbidity meetings , and to ensure an effective response to signals of quality concerns from relevant sources of intelligence about outcomes. MSG's responsibilities include review ing the benchmarked standardised mortality rates of the Tru st and specialty -based mortality and morbidity activity with a view to identify ing potential areas for investigation and gain ing assurance on the operation of effective review processes at service level. This will be achieved via Quality Account 6 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 structured reporting to ad dress specialty level mortality and morbidity resources, structures, process and outputs. Duties also include consideration of the mortality data , in conjunction with other qualitative clinical data , to identify areas for investigation. Areas for investig ation include consideration of the outputs of local case note review, mortality and morbidity activity alongside statistical (Standardised Mortality Rate Ratio) data , and other contextual information about the service and the data, and to investigate alerts and other outlier notifications received from the Care Quality Commission or identified systems (e.g. Healthcare and Evaluation Data , national databases, national audits). The mortality review policy is monitored at the MSG via the monthly mortality review report. MSG reports key metrics to the board on a quarterly basis. QIP 2018/19 - Priority 2 - Safer care Why is this important? The NHS has embarked on a journey to become one of the safest healthcare systems in the world. This can only be achieved by focussing on continuous learning and improvement in our efforts to reduce the risk of harm to p atients. What did we want to achieve? We focussed on safety in a number of key areas. Sepsis We aimed to achieve a sustained improvement in sepsis managemen t - with blood cultures and antibiotic management given within the first hour. As demonstrated in the graphs below, we achieved this aim: Quality Account 7 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Maternity By using the care bundle we aimed to continue sustain the reduction in the number of stillbirths. Although we have not sustained last year's excellent position, the Trust has worked with the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch through the year to review our care bundle and ensure we are sharing learning from other providers. Infections We aimed to ach ieve the local target of 90% compliance with handwashing guidelines to support us to meet challenging targets for avoiding infections. We achieved better than 90% compliance in each of the 12 months from April 2018 to March 2019. Falls We aimed to focus on two key areas for improvement to reduce the incidence of falls within Musgrove Park Hospital : Putting actions in place to reduce falls amongst acutely unwell, confused patients who are newly admitted to hospital or moved to a new environment. Patients are at particular risk when they are medically fit but are unable to be discharged due to functional or social issues. We aimed to work with the Quality Account 8 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 enablement lead and the Home First teams to coordinate the best approach for these patients. The planned actio ns have been delivered and the Falls Group is working to review available data to identify whether they have had the intended impact. The graph below is one of many now used to review falls information in detail, allowing targeted review of data. Strea ms We aimed to roll out a mobile application which allows multiple clinical staff to view a patient's observation s and National Early Warning Score at any one time and within any location within the Trust. This work has now been superseded by the developm ent of an application in -house as part of our digital work. Pressure ulcers We aimed to work in collaboration with our partners across Somerset to sustain the low levels of pressure damage of the previous year. We actually delivered an improved performan ce as demonstrated in the graph below: Quality Account 9 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Future plan Each of the workstreams detailed above ha s individual workplans that is overseen by the Patient Safety Improvement Board. The additional focus of the Board is on improving colleague engagement in pat ient safety as detailed in the driver diagram below: Quality Account 10 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 QIP 2018/19 - Priority 3 - Mental health and holistic care The aim of this priority is to i ncrease staff capability to recognise and respond to those with mental health needs (children, adults in crisis, and older people) . This is measured by training compliance in conflict resolution, eating d isorders, adolescen t mental h ealth , e-learning and establishment p sychiatric liaison pathways . Why is this important? As identified in the recent Nationa l Confidential Enquiry in Patient Outcome and Death report (NCEPOD, 2017), \"Mental Health in General Hospitals: Treat as One\" , the benefits of integrating care across boundaries (e.g. health, social care, employment and housing) are well understood. Howeve r, good integrated care for people with mental health conditions often appears to remain the exception rather than the rule, with physical and mental healthcare largely disconnected. This can lead to poor patient experience and reduced quality of care. What did we achieve? One of the fundamental drivers for the Trust's partnership and planned merger with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (the local provider of NHS mental health services) is to fully integrate mental and physical health services. This work has already resulted in closer working between physical and mental healthcare services , leading to an increased support and understanding of mental health issues for patients in the acute setting . We recognised that there is a limited amount of m ental health training provision for staff at Musgrove Park Hospital . The NCEPOD report \"Treat as One\" (2017) explored the care given to mentally unwell patients in acute hospitals. The report highlighted many issues with the quality of care given to mental ly unwell patients in this setting, and identified staff training as key to addressing some of them. The report found that: a. Fewer than half of hospitals have mandatory training in the management of patients with mental health conditions ; b. No hospitals offer training covering all aspects of management of patients with mental health conditions ; c. Staff reported significant training gaps. The Trust made an action plan for areas of development arising from the NCEPOD report and this included enhanced training fo r colleagues as a key driver for obtaining improved care for patients. The NHS Five Year Forward View for Mental Health also makes significant recommendations regarding mental health training for acute hospital colleagues . It Quality Account 11 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 says that \"staff across the NH S need to have training that equips them to understand mental health problems and to treat people with mental health problems with dignity and respect.\" It recommends that core training be provided in: - Basic mental health awareness and knowledge - Understand ing of mental health law - Public mental health - Compassion and communication skills . Performance to -date Over the last year we have continued to train frontline care colleagues with enhanced knowledge and skills in supporting people with mental health condi tions or distress. This training has been well received by staff and has continued to lead to a reduction in the need to bring in extra speciality colleagues to support complex patients. Alongside training for existing colleagues , training for new healthca re assistants has been reviewed and now includes this enhanced element . Clinical links have been built between the adult and children's wards in mental health and the acute trust. This has led to some shadowing in each other's environments to encourage sha ring of knowledge and networking. In some areas this has been slower to progress due to higher levels of vacanc ies, but plans to continue and expand this are in place. The liaison p sychiatry service , which provides input into the care of mentally unwell pa tients in the acute hospital , has been expanded as part of a targeted county -wide approach to improving care. The new enhanced servi ce is being offered across the 24/7 period . An area that cares for a higher proportion of people with mental health conditio ns and in crisis is the Emergency Department and the liaison psychiatry team have been working with colleagues in this area to improve how patients are assessed and treated. A working group has been set up that includes patient representatives who have be en sharing their experience and ideas for improving experience in this area. The Trust has participated in a national programme run by NHS Improvement aimed at enhancing the care of patients who are suffering from delirium or dementia or who are distressed in the acute care environment. As part of this work we have introduce d a trial of activity co -ordinators (to three elderly care wards) to facilitate increased mental and physical stimulation with the aim of reducing agitation. Colleagues , who are working in pilot areas, have be en trained to encourage increased levels of activity and self -care. This programme has yet to be fully evaluated, but early data is demonstrating a lower level of care needs and Quality Account 12 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 improved patient and family experience. A n additional ward is going to trial this role to see if a similar impact is experienced. Future plan Over the coming year a ll of the work streams described above will continue to further enhance colleague knowledge and patient experience. QIP 2018/19 - Priority 4 - Patient experience Why is this important? It has been evidenced that co -design between staff and service users results in services that better meet patient s' expectations and are more cost effective and sustainable. Co -design is a key component of our am bitions to be an exempl ar Trust for patient and family centred care . We therefore want to support improvement projects to bring colleagues and users together and grow our confidence and skills in th is co-design approach. What did we want to achieve? Patien t partners to be at each of the improvement boards supporting projects' prioritisation and decision making. For each new improvement project to use co -design methodology that bring s colleagues and patient users or representatives together from the outset. Examples of action taken Over the past year the patient experience team and improvement team have been working together to set the need for, and expectation of, partnership working with patient partners. The improvement boards have been recruiting their p artners (Musgrove Partners) and developing relationships and understanding. The Musgrove Partners have co -designed their role outline and framework with the patient experience team and have initiated the co -design of the Patient and Family Centred care bas eline measure ment tool(s) . In 2019 we are working with the improvement team to further develop partnerships with patients and service users in order to shape and influence the services we deliver. The aim is to simplify the recruitment process in order to recruit experts with experience who may not want t o become volunteers or patient p artners but are keen to contribute to improvement. Quality Account 13 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 How this will be measured and monitored? By m easur ing the patient involvement, influence and contribution to the improveme nt boards. By measuring the number of new improvement projects that use co - design methods. With f eedback f rom Musgrove Partners in relation to their experience in influencing change . By revisit ing terms of reference and role expectation for patient partner s, and begin the process of working with the Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust patient participation and involvement group in preparation for the merger of the two trusts. QIP 2018/19 - Priority 5 - Right care, right time, right place Why is this important? With the increasing demands placed on Musgrove Park Hospital, the need to improve the efficiency of the hospital and at the same time, enhance the quality of care for patients has never been more important. During 2018/19, the Trust has worked to improve the discharge of patients. This work will not only reduce the amount of time that patie nts have to wait for discharge , but wil l also ensure that the Trust is working effectively with partner organisations to reduce dependency on bed -based mode ls of care. Patients who are delayed in hospital are increasingly vulnerable to decompensation, deterioration in their physical and mental health and more likely to fall or contract a hospital acquired infection. For all these reasons, the Trust continues to strive to reduce delays in discharge which supports safety and promotes good patient outcomes. The Trust is committed to adopting an enablement -led culture to achieve these outcomes. What did we want to achieve? One of the key elements to make sure pa tients receive the right care, at the right time, in the right place , was to continue our work to improve discharge . For 2018/19, we planned to build on the work delivered in the previous year and ensure changes made in discharge pathways were sustainable . What have we achieved? Reduction in length of stay Quality Account 14 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 During 2018/19 the average length of stay in Musgrove Park Hospital has reduced from 3.7 days to 3.5 days , a reduction of 0.2 days . This reduction has been delivered due to a number of key change initiatives, several of which are detailed below. One of the most significant of these projects is Home First. The Home First project is a countywide programme to support frail, vulne rable people after discharge. It provides three pathways of care : home with assessment and support community hospital enablement care home enablement. This service has been in place for a year and an additional years ' funding has been agreed. 7,500 ni ghts in a hospital bed have been freed up, resulting in a system -wide saving of at least \u00a32m. The service has supported 2,403 patients to leave hospital with 1,460 of those discharged directly home from hospital. This success has only been possible beca use the whole system has worked together. Somerset County Council, Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust have all worked together to agree priorities, share staff and decision making and ensure pathways of care are frictionless. Within the last year this partnership working has extended, offering a range of new services to support people to leave hospital and return home. Quality Account 15 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Medical wards are the area where patients are most vulnerable to harm from long lengths of stay. Length of stay on the medical wards has fallen from 5.4 days to 4.8 days , a reduction of 0.6 days. 7-day services The Trust has expanded 7 -day services to support discharge at weekends and bank holidays. Both therapy services and the integrat ed discharge team now work seven days per week. Delayed transfers of care (DTOC) and partnership working During the year the number of patients fit for discharge who have been delayed has fallen further. The Trust is consistently overachieving against the national target of 2.5 % . Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust DTOC : As for length of stay, the work on delayed transfers of care has been due to how the whole system has worked together on Home First and other projects . Additional projects, building on the success of Home First, include: Quality Account 16 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Red Bag Project The Red Bag Scheme aims to improve patient experience in hospital and improve communication when individuals are bein g admitted from or discharged to a care home by keeping all important information and belongings together . The Red Bag project now works with all care homes within the Taunton and Bridgwater area. Village Agents Somerset County Council commissioned a vil lage agent project. The Trust now has a village agent based in Musgrove Park Hospital who plays a key part in linking patients with their local communities to support and enhance their lives upon discharge. Change proje cts to deliver improvement in in patient care NHSi collaboratives This is a 90 -day programme which enables the Trust to work with experts and other organisations. The Trust was successful in joining this collaborative which is supporting two teams: 1) Enablement - The aims of this project is t o improve patient outcomes and reduce length of stay. This will be achieved by adopting an enablement approach, which will challenge traditional care models in an acute setting. This approach focuses on all colleagues enabling patients to carry out meanin gful activities of daily living to promote independence and recovery. 2) Criteria led discharge - This is an initiative that enables nurses and therapists to discharge patients against a set criteria. This is now being rolled out within the surgical directo rate and is particularly beneficial in supporting discharge at weekends. Digital supporting improvements in care The eWhiteboards will enable a complete overview of delays and outstanding actions for discharge which will streamline current processes (prac tice development forums, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and social work reviews, community psychiatric nurse and Home First referrals). It's anticipated that the eWhiteboards will lead to a reduction in length of stay. The eWhiteboards will be tested during this financial year with the intention of rolling out to all ward areas in spring 2019. Early supported discharge The Red Cross has continued to work as partners with the hospital to support patients with discharge. They ensure that the patient is s ettled at home with care, food and warmth. This is designed to reduce readmissions to hospital . Patients Quality Account 17 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 have really valued this service and the Trust has had positive feedback. I live alone so no one at home to collect me from hospital. I had no money o r card with me. The RX *Red Cross service was a great relief to help me get home. Between 1 October and 31 December 2018 the Red Cross supported 175 patients to return home. This resulted in 170 bed days saved. Extended length of stay project In summer of 2018 NHS Improvement set acute trusts a n objective of reducing the number of patients with a length of stay of 21 days or more by 25%. In an attempt to achieve this, in August 2018 the Trust began to pilot methodology from both NHS improvement and The Ad visory Board. Action -focused board rounds, the creation of escalation guidance and a tracker which monitors all patients with a length of stay of 17 days or more has helped to reduce the number of long stay patients on the pilot wards. This new methodolog y was trialled from August 2018 (see graph below) . The pilot has been rolled out to six wards and the plan is to roll it out to the rest of the organisation within the next six months. Quality Account 18 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 QIP 2018/19 - Priority 6 - Staff retention and well being STAFF R ETENTION Why is this important? Shortages in a number of roles make it difficult to recruit colleagues in adequate numbers. While it is important to focus on recruitment to ensure the supply of colleagues, it is even more important to retain existing coll eagues. They have already received investment in time, resou rce in training and development, and they understand the requirements of working in Somerset. There is no single action that will improve retention . Retaining colleagues involves a number of ini tiatives designed to create a positive culture tha t colleagues want to be part of , and become attached to , and therefore are likely to remain. Wellbeing is more than just an individual's responsibility . Successful organisations have recognised that good h ealth is a key enabler to good business. The health and wellbeing of colleagues directly contributes to organisational success and poor workforce health has a high cost. What did we want to achieve? To have a detailed retention and wellbeing plan developed through quality improvement methodology which sets out a multifaceted approach to improve colleague retention and wellbeing. Examples of action taken Nationally time has been spent on understanding where the greatest impact can be made. The programmes pr ovide access to best practice, masterclasses and support to develop longer term improvement plans. Performance to date A retention improvement plan was agreed in July 2018 with regular working group meetings to track progress against our plan. A number of improvements have been made to streamline systems to create easier working practices for colleagues and remove duplication. Detailed analysis of data has enabled targeted work to engage and retain nursing colleagues. In March 2018 the Trust launched the first \"wellbeing month \" which saw a month of various activities to support the emotional, physical and mental wellbeing of colleagues across both Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trusts. We also ran the firs t joint wellbeing Quality Account 19 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 conference in April , which brought 150 colleagues from both t rusts together to spend time discussing, thinking and sharing experience around wellbeing. The retention and wellbeing work are key deliverables as part of a three year People Strategy for the alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. How this will be measured and monitored? Assessment is through a mixture of hard and soft measures, including regular monitoring of sickness absence, turnover, temporary staffing c osts and usage, vacancy fill rates, national staff survey results , pulse check results , exit interviews plus both informal and formal feedback. Measurement of wellbeing comes from the internal pulse check which is run twice a year across the whole Trust , and from the health and wellbeing theme from the annual NHS Staff Survey. Latest results from both can be seen in the tables below: Pulse Check Results 2018/19 Q1 & Q2 April - Sept Q3 & Q4 Sept - March Wellbeing Index (amalgamation of following two questions) 65.5% 64.7% My immediate manager places a strong emphasis on promoting safety and wellbeing of colleagues 76.4% 75.9% I felt work related stress within the last 12 months 54.6% 53.4% NHS Staff Survey Results - Health and Wellbeing 2018 The Heal th and Wellbeing theme is made up from the following five questions Question 2018 2017 2016 2015 Acute Hospitals 2018 Difference against National Benchmark +/- The opportunities for flexible working patterns 51.7% 53% 52% 49.8% 51.9% -0.2% Does yo wellbeing? 28.5% 32.3% 29.1% Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Question 2018 2017 2016 2015 Acute Hospitals 2018 Difference against National Benchmark +/- have you experienced musculoskeletal (MSK) problems as a result of work activities?

QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES 2019/20 As part of th e on-going work to align processes in advance of the merger with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, we have developed a list of joint quality priorities with Somerset Partnership. As in previous years, our Chief Nurse and Chief Medical Officer, li nking with Executive Team colleagues, undertook a review of quality performance during 2018/19 to consider areas where we might wish to focus our priorities for quality improvement during 2019/20. This included a review of the issues identified by the Car e Quality Commission (CQC), during their inspection visits, undertaken in 2017 and 2018. This process also took into account: national patient safety and patient experience initiatives; Quality Account 21 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 patient, carer and public feedback on our services; learning from complaints, PALS, incidents and quality reviews; patient surveys and patient satisfaction questionnaires; feedback from Leadership Quality Walkrounds and other staff listening events; feedback from other external reviews of our services (Healthwatch , external and internal audit); feedback on last year's Quality Account; our strategic objectives and service development plans. From this work, i n March 2019 , the Trust's Council of Governors agreed the following key quality improvement priorities fo r 2019/20, building on performance in 2018/19, as reported above: Priority 1: Delivering parity of esteem between physical and mental health services Priority 2: Learning from incidents complaints and mortality reviews Priority 3: Improving the quality of discharge summaries Priority 4: Improving sepsis recognition Priority 5: Improving implementation of the Rapid Response service Priority 6: Developing co -design and service -user involvement QIP 2 019/20 - Priority 1 - Delivering parity of esteem betw een physical and mental health services The Health and Social Care Act 2012 created a new legal responsibility for the NHS to deliver 'parity of esteem' between physical and mental health. Parity of esteem means equal access to effective care and treatmen t; equal efforts to improve the quality of care; equal status within health care education and practice; equally high aspirations for service users; and equal status in the measurement of health outcomes ( Royal College of Psychiatrists 2013 ). In essence, it means valuing mental health equally with physical health. It is also about ending the stigma which stops people with serious mental health pro blems getting treated with the same vigour as if they had a physical illness such as, say, diabetes. Parity is also about tackling the physical illnesses of people with severe mental health problems. Currently they have the same life expectancy of people who lived in the 1950s - some 10 to 15 years shorter than average. Quality Account 22 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 As part of our work as an alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust , the principle of provide parity of esteem for mental and physical health for children, adults and older ad ults is at the core of our emerging clinical model, linked to the priorities and investment set out in the NHS Long Term Plan. We will look to improve the early detection and intervention for health risks for people with mental health problems and work wit h our partners to address the social issues that can lead to poor mental health and wellbeing. What do we want to achieve? The driver diagram below shows the key aims for this priority . QIP 2019/20 - Priority 2 - Learning from inci dents, complaints and mortality reviews Why is this important? When things go wrong in care, it is vital that we investigate the circumstances to ensure learning can take place. By learning, we mean working out what has gone wrong , and why it has gone wrong, so that effecti ve and sustainable actions can be taken to reduce the risk of similar things happening again. What do we want to achieve? Quality Account 23 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 For 2019/20, the Trust will align the systems it has in place for learning from incidents, complaints and deaths to ensure real change s are made and embedded when we identify any potential concerns following review and investigation. We aim to implement the planned new national guidance as soon as it is released and have already begun implementing some of the expected areas of focus from this guidance, including improving the way we work with families and carers as part of our investigation and action planning. How this will be measured and monitored? The Trust has an established Serious Incident Review Group for the oversight of learning from serious incidents, including on -going measurement and audit to ensure that planned actions have resulted in the changes our investigations identified as necessary. The role of this group will be extended to focus on learning from all incidents, compl aints and mortality reviews across the alliance, including the measurement and audit methodology. QIP 2019/20 - Priority 3 - Improving the quality of discharge summaries Why is this important? The impact of poor quality documentation is hard to quantify, but it has a significant impact on patient care. Good discharge summaries facilitate continuity between secondary and primary care and are essential for safe transitions from hospital to home and good continuity of care. The NHS has produced a range of gu idance on different aspects of discharge summaries, including key content and timeliness requirements relating to specific parts of the discharge pathway and conditions (e.g. acute kidney injury, end of life care), with a key current focus on emergency car e discharge. What do we want to achieve? Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust had previously focussed on the timeliness of discharge summaries, with a key measure being the percentage of summaries issued within 24 hours. The graph below shows perfor mance over 2018/19 (c. 89% for the year): Quality Account 24 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 For 2019/20, the Trust plans to focus on the quality of the information included in the discharge summary in addition to the timeliness. An audit and measurement programme will be developed, based on Royal Coll ege of Physicians guidelines, to identify key quality issues and inform the development of an improvement plan. QIP 2019/20 - Priority 4 - Improving sepsis recognition Why is this important? Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the United Kingdom with a reported 44,000 cases every year. The successful management of sep sis requires prompt recognition; appropriate interventions to identify and control the micro -organisms; the restor ation of oxygen delivery to tissues ; appropriate escalation and decisive medical management within the first hour of a sepsis flag being identified. The continuous audit of patient notes for the CQUIN is important to monitor the progress within the Trust and take every opportunity to learn how we can improve care each time. This includes learning from serious incidents via the Serious Incident Review Group (SIRG) and departmental governance meetings. What do we want to achieve? There is an established Sepsis Steering Group (SSG) that meets monthly and includes representatives from governance, the improvement team, medicine, surgery, admission areas, pharmacy and maternity. The SSG reports directly to the Quality Assurance Group and the Trust B oard through the monthly integrated performance report. The SSG monitors performance again st sepsis targets, and implements actions to improve any areas of poor performance. Quality Account 25 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The SSG aims to ensure all patients have their observations correctly performed by trained healthcare professionals who recognise abnormal parameters and escalate the patie nt according to policies ( National Early Warning Score 2 [NEWS2 ] Adults over 18; Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score [ MEOWS ] - Maternity, Paediatrics Early Warning Score [ PEWS ] - paediatrics). All colleagues involved in performing and responding to obs ervations have an understanding of when and how to use the appropriate sepsis screening tool. Sepsis education is included in medical, and nursing / healthcare professional induction. Weekly one hour sessions are available for all clinical and non -clinical staff to book on to. Once a patient has been screened for sepsis using the correct screening tool, Red Flag signs are recognised and the appropriate treatment pathway of the sepsis six is initiated and completed within the hour. This should be documented on the back of the screening proforma with the reasons for any variance in treatment. If the patient 's deterioration is not thought to be due to sepsis this should be clearly documented on the proforma and then placed in the notes. Any significant concern s regarding sepsis are referred for investigation via the serious incident review process. To enable the SSG to monitor any potential areas of concern , three codes have been added purely for sepsis. These are: X01 - Failure to sep sis screen when NEWS 5 (National Early Warning Score) or above; X02 Failure to give ABX within one hour of Red flag; X03 Failure to adequ ately monitor escalate care in r ed flag patient. Examples of action taken A competition has been held between wards in Somerset Partnership NHS Found ation Trust hospitals and Musgrove Park Hospital for a sepsis display in each area. Development of sepsis support group - monthly meetings for patients treated with sepsis to reduce the risk of post sepsis syndrome. This has been highlighted by the S epsis Trust as an exemplar project. Sepsis Thursday has been launched within the Trust to increas e awareness and simple ward -based audits to monitor local progress. High profile sepsis star awards are available for all staff who screen and treat patients within the hour time frame. Local champions are in place in each area to promote sepsis screening and treatment Quality Account 26 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Performance to date Inpatients areas: Inpatient performance results have significantly improved since the Clinical Quality Commission inspectio n with over 82% of inpatients screened for sepsis in December 2018. This is a significant improvement from August 2017 when the figure was less than 20%. Inpatient screening rates for the CQUIN 2018/2019 Q4 were 82.7%. Antibiotics given to patients within one hour who had red flag sepsis was up to 100%. Admission areas: The latest CQUIN results for Q4, 95% of patients who required screening for sepsis were screened and 91% of patients (21 out of 23) were given antibiotics within the hour. How this will be measured and monitored? CQUIN: 50 sets of notes for inpatients and 50 sets of notes for admission areas are audited by the g overnance team each month. If there are any concerns raised in the audit the lead sepsis nurse reviews the notes in the local area to see if there are any potential areas for learning or improvement. Local audits are regularly undertaken in the Emergency Department, acute medical unit, surgical assessment unit, paediatrics and m aternity and the results are reported to the SSG. There a re monthly multidisciplinary team meeting s in each area to discuss missed screening or a delay in sepsis treatment or escalation. QIP 2019/20 - Priority 5 - Improving implem entation of the Rapid Response S ervice Why is this important? The new Somerset Rapid Response Service (RRS) was commissioned by th e Somerset A& E Delivery Board is in response to rising numbers of patients attending Emergency Departments and needing to be admitted to acute hospitals across the county This compromises the ability of local acute trusts to deliver national standards for referral to treatment times and meet the needs of those patients most in need of inpatient care. This new Rapid Response S ervice is one of the initiatives introduced to help reduce the pressure on the healthc are system by re ducing the number of admissions, and was a priority to establish by t he winter of 2018/19. This new community service provides a credible alternative to patient admissions . The main objective of this is to support patients to stay at home . Support could be provided from a number of sources, thus avoiding an admission to hospital . Quality Account 27 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The service targets patients who have had a fall, a loss of mobility or who are unwell (for example, with a urinary tract infection ), but do not need acute medical investigation or treatment . Without additional support at home by RRS such patients would ne ed to be admitted to h ospital. What do we want to achieve? Moving forward, the n ew RRS will aim to build on the initial implementation period and has the following objectives: To increase the average number of daily referrals to the service , by o establish ing itself as a reliable and trusted countywide service effective in preventing unnecessary hospital admissions ; o develop ing an effective staffing model that will be a ble to safely manage the caseload countywide ; o continuing to communicate and advertise the service through raising awareness to referring groups . To maintai n an average length of stay of maximum three to four days , by continuing to build working relations hips and partnerships with key internal and external stakeholders by ensuring a smooth transfer of care to their services and support for patients on the RRS caseload. To bu ild working relationships with acute c are colleagues to provide urgent assessment support for patients where indicated and aim to keep more referred patients at home. To set up effective lines of communications wi th community complex care teams . Examples of action taken The new countywide service has been operating since 1 November 201 8. A new team has been mobilised and has been developing the model, working alongside existing community nursing and t herapy teams , where needed. Working rela tionships have been built with adult s ocial care (ASC) and Home First teams to enable patients to move onto appropriate services where needed. Also , working with ASC, the Somerset RRS has commissioned a \"test and learn scheme for referring patients onto the Red Cross for further support. Communication with primary c are, South West Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust and frailty units in the acute h ospitals has been ongoing and is encouraging referrals to the RRS. Quality Account 28 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Performance to date From 1 November 2018 to 31 March 3019 the service has managed to keep 242 patients at home. 60 of these patients were transferred onto the Home First pathway and adult social care . The a verage number of referral s per day is currently 2.95 against a target of 4.5. Average length of stay is 2.79 days against a target of three days. Patient satisfaction - Since the start, the service has received feedback 42 Friends and Family feedback forms, 21 from patients and 21 from carers. 95% of Friends and Family feedback responses indicated that they were likely/extremely likely to recommend the service. How this will be measured an d monitored? Admission data is collected via our electronic patient record RIO and is collated and monitored on a monthly basis . This data is reported to the RRS P roject Board, the A&E Delivery Board and Urgent Care Programme Board. Monitoring of the serv ice is continuous. This enable s the continued implementation and development of an effective and efficient model of care delivery for the population of Somerset. This scheme also links into the 'Fit for the Future' commissioning work stream, as a key proje ct for providing care at home. QIP 2019/20 - Priority 6 - Developing co -design and service -user involvement Why is this important? Patients and the public are at the heart of everything we do. The NHS Constitution states that 'You have the right to be i nvolved, directly or through representatives, in the planning of healthcare services commissioned by NHS bodies, the development and consideration of proposals for changes in the way those services are provided, and in decisions to be made affecting the op eration of those services'. We believe that by listening to people who use and care about services we can understand their health needs better and focus on, and respond to, what matters to them. The NHS five year forward view talks about harnessing the 'renewable energy represented by patients and communities' and the need to 'engage with communities and citizens in new ways, involving them directly in decisions about the future of health and care service'. Quality Account 29 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 People are realistic about what the service can and cannot offer if they are engaged in the right way. But, as we lead service changes, engaging with the public can feel difficult, especially when potentially unpopular decisions need to be made. Therefore comprehensive engagement and involvement is cri tical. What do we want to achieve? Our aim is to maintain a constant partnership with patients and the public, in order to improve patient safety, patient experience and health outcomes . This support s people to live healthier lives. As part of the merger we want to achieve meaningful, effective and productive patient and public involvement . Co-design has an influence on and shapes the delivery of care, quality and safety of services and decisions about the inevitable changes to the services delivered as p art of the merger. We use p atient feedback as a valuable source of information , which helps to improve the quality and safety of the care we deliver . By offering every patient, or member of the public affected by the service , the opportunity to share their experience , we are enabling them to motivate and participate in change and improvement. Examples of action taken and performance to -date Musgrove Partners The Musgrove Partners are a group of Patient Voice Volunteers who support engagement and participat ion. They are actively involved in the recruitment of staff, focus groups , reviewing serious incidents , complaints reviews , improvement boards and projects (as noted above) . They also represent the patient and public voice in critical decision making and a re represented in strategic planning. We aim to broaden this group to community teams in Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and plan t o rename the group the Patient V oice Partners. Patient Care Group (PCG - Taunton an d Somerset NHS Foundation Trust ) and the Patient and Public I nvolvement Group (PPIG) - Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust The PCG are appointed by the Council of Governors and is responsible for g aining a greater understanding of patient care issues and developments and take the lead on discussions at the Council of Governors on matters relating to patient care and experience. They are inform ed and up -to-date with developments relating to patient care and experience to enable them to be an effective link with the membership in t heir constituency. Quality Account 30 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 They represent the Trust's members, in order to be satisfied that the Trust's Board, through the non -executive directors, has the right governance and assurance processes in place for matters relating to patient care and experience. The PP IG reviews progress with equality and diversity activity, new and revised Trust policies as well as new and significant risks and safeguarding issues. The meeting is also an opportunity for teams to share successes and challenges through presentations of projects or new initiatives. The meeting is chaired by the lead governor. They provide governance assurance and hold the Trust to account for incidents and themes of complaints and patient advice and liaison activity. This includes Parliamentary and H ealth Service Ombudsman case reviews and patient and public involvement, such as Friends and Family reports and Care Opinion feedback. Our respective Council of Governors have agreed that the aim is for the two groups to be merged in future. Volunteers Volunteers play an important role for people who use our service s, along with their families and carers , by providing support to our healthcare professionals. Volunteers give their time and energy freely to bene fit the quality of our services and contri bute to enhancing service users ' and carers ' experience s. There are many opportunities available , from supporting patient care to signposting visitors or contributing to the running of our services in both Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Some rset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . Service user involvement group ( improvement team) The patient and public involvement teams at Musgrove Park and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust are working with the improvement team on a service -user involv ement project . The aim of this is to improve and enhance the procedures for participating in improvement projects and Trust activity by defining and simplifying the opportunities available along with the recruitment processes required. Focus groups The patient and public involvement team facilitate s and support s focus groups so that services can be delivered in collaboration with experts by experience. These are ad hoc and at the request of the services. Participants are invited to attend a group and share their experiences in order to provide meaningful intelligence from the perspective of a service user or carer. Quality Account 31 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Triangle of care The Triangle of Care (ToC) is a national initiative led by the Carers Trust. The triangle refers to the three way partnershi p between patient, carer and staff , which is different to the 'traditional' two -way relationship between patient and staff. The carer (which might be a husband or wife, child, partner, other family member or a friend) is a crucial partner when we are deliv ering a service to a patient/service user . The ToC improv es health outcomes and the experience of our services. This initiative has already been embedded in mental health, and the aim is to progress this initiative throughout the merged Trust. Stroke Int egration Survey As part of the integration of stroke services, we have recognised the need to seek patient and carer experience along the whole pathway. The patient and public involvement team (PPI) is working closely with clinicians , and ha s developed a questionnaire which will be used with patients and carers at each stage of their journey through the pathway, thus giving real time feedback. This will take the format of semi -structured interviews with experienced members of the PPI team. Patients will be selected on a number of criteria to ensure we have a broad representation of severity of stroke and location within the county. The outcomes will be evaluated , and the themes and issues raised will contribute towards the pathway improvement work currently being undertaken . How will this be measured and monitored? Patient and public involvement team s at Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust work with teams to observe and check the progress and quality of patient and public involvement projects. Support with projects from the improvement team using quality improvement methodology includes: obtaining f eedback from services using patient and public involvement and co-design to develop and influence services . gaining f eedback form patients, service users and participants through regular review meetings (PPI group, Musgrove Partners and Patient Care Group governors) . All projects are overseen and monitored by the Associate Director of Patient - Centered Care and th e patient and public involvement leads. Close monitoring of response rates for the Friends and Family Test, surveys and attendance at focus groups and forums takes place regularly. Quality Account 32 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 NATIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS All data in this section is provided by the Health and Social Care Information Centre and is governed by standard national definitions. Summary Hospital -Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) Related domain: (1) Preventing people from dying prematurely The Summary Hospital -Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI ) is a standardised mortality indicator. It expresses actual deaths compared to an expected value. In this case, 'average' is represented by a value of 1. SHMI has been designed to overcome certain shortcomings inherent in other standardised mortality indi cators such as the HSMR. This includes the influence of coding of palliative care patients. SHMI also includes patients who died within 30 days of discharge whereas HSMR looks only at deaths that occur in hospital. The Trust's overall SHMI over the past th ree years is represented in the table below: Reporting Period Ratio (Banding) England Lowest Trust Highest Trust April 2018 to March 2019 Data due to be published August 2019 January 2018 to December 2018 0.9510 (as expected) 1.0000 0.6993 1.2264 Octobe 0.6917 1.2681 0.6982 1.2572 0.7270 1.2473 0.9344 0.7261 1.2277 1.2123 1.0000 0.6907 1.1894 September 2016 0.9921 (as expected) 1.0000 0.6897 1.1638 July 2015 to June 2016 0.997 (as expected) 1.000 0.694 1.171 Quality Account 33 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 April 2015 to March 2016 1.002 (as expected) 1.000 0.678 1.178 January 2015 to December 2015 1.000 (as expected) 1.000 0.669 1.173 October 2014 to September 2015 0.983 (as expected) 1.000 0.652 1.177 July 2014 to June 2015 0.984 (as expected) 1.000 0.661 1.209 April 2014 to March 2015 0.970 (as expected) 1.000 0.670 1.210 January 2014 to December 2014 0.967 (as expected) 1.000 0.655 1.240 October 2013 to September 2014 0.982 (as expected) 1.000 0.597 1.198 July 2013 to June 2014 0.984 (as expected) 1.000 0.541 1.198 April 2013 0.539 1.197 NB: 1.00 is the SHMI average, values lower than 1.00 indicated better than average. The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: There has been continued focus on initiati ves related to safety that have reduced the number of avoidable deaths in a range of specialties. Routine review of Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED) by speciality, procedure and diagnosis groups has provided early warning of problems in patient care. The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve on this rate, and so the quality of its services: by regularly monitoring outcomes through tools such as Healthcare Evaluation Data. by identifying where outcomes a ppear to be deviating. This allows the Trust to investigate and verify the result and provides an early opportunity to make improvements to patient treatment pathways. Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio (HSMR) and Summary Hospital -level Mortality Indic ator (SHMI) performance are reported each month to the Trust Board, but , due to considerable monthly variation , a rolling three -month figure is reported. Weekday versus weekend non -elective admissions is also reported. Quality Account 34 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Additional scrutiny is undertaken vi a the Trust's monthly mortality surveillance group . Also, the SHMI and HSMR, split by diagnosis group, is kept under close review. This often prompts engagement with the clinical leadership who give consideration to data and clinical quality, as appropriat e.

From November 2016 we have included the palliative care code for admissions where the patient has an assessment completed and is on a pathway . These have been specifically designed by the palliative care team to support clinicians in delivering high quality palliative care. The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve on this rate, and the quality of its services by: monitoring palliative care rates at the mortality surveillance grou p meeting ; auditing palliative care coding to ensure all admissions with assessment completed is coded ; continuously auditing the use of the end of life care pathway for patients who die. PROMS: PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES Related domain (3) Help ing people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury PROMs measure a patient's health status or health -related quality of life from their perspective. Typically, this is based on information gathered from a questionnaire that patients comp lete before and after surgery.

READMISSIONS Patients readmitted to a hospital within 28 days of being discharged Related domain (3) Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury Whilst some emergency readmissions following discharge from hospital are an unavoidable consequence of the original treatment, others could potentially be avoided through ensuring the delivery of optimal treatment according to each patient's needs, carefu l planning and support for self-care. Because of the Quality Account 40 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 complexities in collating data, national and local rates are significantly in arrears. It should also be noted that a readmission is counted for a patient within the 28 day period, even if it is for an e ntirely different problem, for example a discharge following a hip replacement and readmission due to a stroke. This report includes information about children re -admitted to the Trust which show that they are broadly in line with the national average. Our adult readmission results for 2011/12 indicate that we were significantly better than average. Our 30 day standard ised readmission ratio is 99.7 for the period April to December 2018 , with confidence limits well within the expected range . Diagnostic gro ups that are significantly above expected range are reviewed at the data outlier review meeting and investigated with directorates.

The Trust operates an open admission list sys tem - there are approximately 100 children on the open admission list who have a chronic condition, e.g. epilepsy, chronic heart conditions and haematological conditions. These children have had consultant approval to attend the children's unit in accordan ce with condition requirements. Open admission can be an ongoing process throughout the child's life. Children with life limiting conditions, such as oncology related disorders and immune compromising disorders, have repeated admissions due to medical mana gement of their condition. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has taken the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of its services, by: Reducing the number of ward reviews where appropriate. Implementation of the new community mi dwifery -led feeding protocol and assessment to prevent admissions for 'poor feeding' initially reduced inpatient admissions with only two admissions per month for the first six months. Subsequent months have shown a slight rise with on average four a month being managed as inpatient s. It is noted that these admissions are the more complex cases with additional complications in addition to poor feeding. Regular assessment of the reasons for admission to ensure that, within specialties and conditions, there are no trends apparent or evidence of readmissions indicating a problem in clinical treatment or processes. Percentage of patients aged 16 or over readmitted to the Trust within 28 days of being discharged Note: Benchmark data relates to Medium Acute Trus ts Reporting Period Percentage England Lowest Trust Highest Trust April 2011 to March 2012 10.61% 11.26% 0.00% 13.50% April 2010 to Quality Account 42 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 April 2009 to March 2010 9.77% 11.06% 0.00% 13.08% Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: over a period of three years, the Trust has maintained an overall 28 day readmission rate of 0 -2% below the national averag e for equivalent hospitals. this is indicative of good general care and appropriate clinical judgment with regards to patient discharges. this is during a period of the stepwise introduction of enhanced recovery programmes in various specialties, which wou ld indicate that appropriate discharge criteria are being maintained. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to continue to try to improve readmission rates, and so the quality of its services, by: Continuing to monitor readmission rates for var ious procedures and conditions, as this can provide information about clinical teams in greater detail. This would allow improvements to be directed at the areas that most require them. Increased use of ambulatory care and urgent clinics to manage emergenc y care pathways. Working with other health and care providers in Somerset to ensure alternatives to admission are accessed where appropriate. Readmission data has recently been to the data outlier review meeting and we were assured that recent increases in readmission rates are in line with those seen nationally, and that are standardised readmission rates remain within the expected range. We have identified an administration error with patients who have a planned readmission for certain orthopaedic procedu res being wrongly classed as an emergency readmission.

Rate of Clostridium difficile infection Related domains (5) Treat ing and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can cause diarrhoea and sometimes severe inflammation of the bowel. It can occur when the normal bacteria in the gut are disturbe d, usually by taking antibiotics. Although not all cases are pr eventable, the rate of CDI hospital onset cases (those detected four or more days after admission) are an important indicator of improvement in protecting patients from avoidable harm and provi de a useful tool for making comparisons between organisations and tracking improvements over time.

This is the result of sustaining the bundle of improvements implemented in 2011, which includes prompt isolation of patients, high standards of cleaning, reductions in the use of high -risk antibiotics and regular review of patients with C DI by a microbiologist and the infection prevention and control t eam. The CDI rate for 2018/19 is not yet known. However, the number of cases remains similar to last year, and rates are expected to be in line with the national average . Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of its services, by: Continuing to in vestigate all hospital onset cases to identify learning, sharing this learning in the organisation and driving further improvements. Also by investigating community onset cases where the case is detected within two days of admission and where the patient has been an inpatient within the previous four weeks Continuing to reduce the CDI risk associated with antibiotic treatment through robust antibiotic stewardships and further re view of antimicrobial guidance, where appropriate. Prompt isolation of all symptomatic patients as well as previous CDI cases, where there is an increased ris k of reoccurrence . Continuing to give scrupulous attention to hand hygiene, decontamination and c leaning practices. Patient safety incidents reported to the National Reporting and Learning System The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) collects and collates information from the incident databases of health service providers to provide thematic review and share wider learning about patient safety through a system of safety alerts sent to every organisation. The Trust's safeguard incident software has an automatic process for uploading its incidents to the National Learning and Reporting System (NRLS). There is evidence of increasing numbers of reports being uploaded to the NRLS database, as indicated in the table below: Quality Account 46 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Reporting Period Number of Incidents Reported Rate per 1000 Bed Days Taunton and Somerset Median for Acute (Non - Speci alist) Trusts Lowest Trust Highest Trust Apr 2018 - Sep 2018 3,316 43.8 42.4 13.1 107.4 Oct 2017 3,334 44.4 40.1 23.1 69.0 Apr 2016 - Sep 2016 3,251 44.9 40.0 21.2 71.8 Oct 2015 - Mar 2016 3,156 41.7 39.3 14.8 75.9 Apr 2015 - Sep 2015 2,987 40.3 38.3 18.01 74.67 Oct 2014 - Mar 2015 3,171 36.0 35.3 3.6 82.2 Apr 2014 - Sep 2014 3292 38.2 35.1 0.2 74.96 Oct 2013 - Mar 2014 3116 35.9 32.4 5.8 74.9 Apr 2013 - Sep 2013 3004 6.95 7.2 3.5 14.5 The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: We actively encourage reporting of incidents to enable learning to be obtained .

Reporting Period Score Average (Acute Trusts) Lowest Trust Highest Trust ANNUAL REPORT ON ROT A GAPS AND VACANCIES : DOCTORS AND DENTISTS IN TRAI NING This report was presented at Trust Board on 5 February 2019 Executive summary Key points of this report: The level of exception r eporting has proved to be an increasingly useful marker of areas of pressure on staff throughout the Trust. Rota gaps and v acancies appear to be a key factor influencing and driving the level of exception r eporting at an individual ward level. This applies not only to rota g aps and vacancies relating to junior medical staff, but also in those groups of non -medical staff directly supporting their role. Recently, we have seen a significant increase in exception r eport ing across the Trust. This may be related to actions intended to prepa re for w inter pressures. The Board needs to consider how this relates to levels of staffing and their deployment across the Trust, especially in the out of hours period. The Board are as ked to support initiatives to examine safe levels of staffing across the Trust, and to put in place long term plans to ensure adequate numbers of appropriate staff are provided throughout the 24/7 period to protect patient safety and staff wellbeing. Quality Account 52 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Introduction The data presented below is designed to allow the Board to assess the current risks posed by rota gaps and vacancies, especially in the context of numbers of staff available to treat patients in the out of hours period. This is followed by a quali tative summary of issues arising and actions taken to address these. High level data Number of doctors / dentists in training (total): 232 Number of doctors / dentists in training on 2016 TCS (total): 202 Annual vacancy rate among this staff group 2018: 2.41% (2017 94%) Ratios of Junior Doctors to patients in out of hours p eriod (Data provided by Chief Registrar): Medicine including Haematology/Oncology: 2 x covering ward SHOs (+Med +50 in Surgical beds 437 Surgery including (approx. 8 pts): 00:00 (+take +Med SpR) Doctor ratio Core beds 173 1:173 Escalation 183 1:183 -50 if Medical patients in beds 133 1:133 Total Number of Exception R eports to date (Dec 2016 -Jan2019: Data from Allocate Government Office South West (GoSW ) Dashboard ): 814 Exception Reports 2018: (Total 464) Quarter 4 173 Equivalent 2017 (Total 209) Quarter 4 62 Quarter 3 83 Quarter 3 101 Quarter 2 100 Quarter 2 38 Quarter 1 108 Quarter 1 89 Quality Account 53 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Annual data summary relating to rota gaps Specialty Grade Quarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter 3 Quarter 4 Total gaps (average WTE) Anaesthetics CT1/2 1 0 0 0 0.25 Emergency Medicine ST3+ 0 0 1 0 0.25 ST1/2 1 0 0 0 0.25 Max Fax DCT2 0 0 1 0 0.25 Medicine ST3+ 0.2 0.2 0 0 0.05 ST1/2 2 3 0 0 1.25 Obs & Gynae ST3+ 1 1 0 1 0.75 ST1/2 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.6 Ophthalmology ST1/2 1 1 1 1 1 Paediatrics ST4+ 0.6 0 0 0 0.15 ST1-3 1 2 2 2 1.75 Issues arising It is clear that with increasing demand on the resources of the hospital, and the measures taken to try and anticipate such increasing demand (e.g. winter pressure planning), junior medical staff are now expected to provi de significantly wider cover for patients. The implementation of this plan has coincided with a marked increase in levels of exception reporting in the last quarter of 2018. The numbers of patients covered by junior medical staff give concern that it is no w difficult to provide safe and effective care for these patients in the Trust, especially over the out of hours period. Superimposed on this, any level of vacancy therefore bears increased significance and impact. It has been noted during 2018 that there was no Trust -wide data collected on levels of sickness absence for junior medical staff, which is a perceived increased contributor to rota gaps and vacancy. At a ward level, analysis of exception reporting for the most junior grades of doctor (F1/F2) show that rota gaps and vacancy in more senior medical staff grades, and in supportive roles (for example clinical nurse practitioners), increase their level of exception reporting. Quality Account 54 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 We are aware of: Feedback from juniors (both through Immediate Safety Concern (ISC) exception reports, and emails to educational supervisors and rota coordinators) that raise concerns about the increasing intensity of out of hours work and numbers of patients to cover. Clinical incidents that may be related to this intensity and the effect on safe working . Marked increase in the level of exception reporting in 2018 compared to 2017, and especially in Quarter 4 of 2018 ( October - December 2018) . Filling gaps is often challenging, given the geographical position of the Trust in relatio n to the major surrounding teaching centres, the limited control we have over Deanery allocations , and the national lack of suitable doctors to fill vacancies when they arise, often at short notice. However, the Trust has a very good reputation with junior medical staff, reflected in General Medical Council training surveys and feedback from the regional British Medical Association , for the care we extend to doctors in training, and the training/education we deliver. Actions taken to resolve issues The GoSW has identified areas of need, advised and worked with clinical service leads, educational supervisors and junior doctors in areas of pressure to facilitate cover and support, whenever increased levels of exception reporting on the GoSW dashboard has raise d concern over intensity. The GoSW has undertaken a detailed analysis of exception reporting related to seniority, rota and attendant rota gaps. Further specialty, seniority and ward based data will be included in the 2019 GoSW quarterly reports. The Trust has devolved approval for recruitment to fill rota gaps and vacancies to a directorate level, enabling more rapid action to resolve them - this has proved helpful for the medical workforce team, and appears to have delivered a significant improvement in o verall vacancy levels from 7% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2018. The GoSW, via the Junior Doctors Implementation Group, previously asked the Board to support a quality improvement project to look at novel methods of skill mix and staffing to address long term pressu res on safe working in the out of hours period. Given the increasing concerns reflected in several areas of feedback, the medical director has recently reconvened the Hospital at Night group to take this forward. This group met for the first time in Jan uary 2019. The Trust has directed the medical workforce team to centrali se recording of junior medical staff sickness absence. The GoSW will include any Quality Account 55 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 relevant data from this centrali sation in future reports on rota gaps and vacancy. Summary Rota gaps and vacancy have a direct effect on the most junior medical staff at a ward level . Winter planning measures appear to have directly increased the intensity of workload for junior medical staff, reflected in a significant increase in overall exception reporting The Trust is acting to collect collective data on sickness absence, and to examine staffing and skill -mix via the H ospital at Night group . Questions for consideration The Board will need to consider the level of investment required, in both total human re source, and improved skill -mix, to deliver safe working related to patient care, especially for acute admissions, and especially in the out of hours period. The Board will need to consider data on sickness absence when reliably available, and consider the cause and effect related to intensity of workload and staff wellbeing. The Board will need to consider and act upon the findings of the Hospital at Night Group when delivered in 2019. STATEMENTS OF ASSURANCE FROM THE BOARD Review of services During 201 8/19 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust provided, or sub - contracted, 79 relevant health services, including a comprehensive range of medical, surgical and specialist services in the following areas: Acute adult and paediatric care Maternity services Accident and Emergency treatment Diagnostic services Elective and emergency services Cancer care and radiotherapy. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has reviewed all the data available to it on the quality of care in each of these relevant s ervices. Quality Account 56 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 The income generated by the relevant health services represents 100% of the total income generated from the provision of relevant health services by the Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust in 2018/19 . The Tr ust is engaged with NHS England and NHS Improvement regarding the implementation of the priority clinical standards for 7-day hospital services. There is regular performance monitoring against the standards, with a working group led by the Chief Medical Officer , charged with ensuring goo d performance. The Trust has participated fully in the national performance audits, which have shown full compliance with some areas of the priority standards, and highlighted areas where compliance has not yet been achieved. There is an action plan in pla ce to achieve improvements, which includes linking to the T rust's Global Digital Exemplar work. The action plan forms the framework for regular discussions with NHS England and NHS Improvement on these issues. Both organisations are engaged and informed ab out the Trust's progress and of nationally -shared issues for compliance , such as the need for significant investment in c onsultant resource , in order to achieve some of the standards. There is also a good working relationship on 7-day services with NHS Som erset and other local providers, including the sharing of information and good practice. Progress in implementing the priori ty clinical standards for 7 -day hospital services \"There are 10 nation al clinical standards for 7 -day hospital services. Four of the se (Standards 2, 5, 6 and 8) are \"priority\" standards. The T rust is compliant with Standard 5 (access to diagnostics), Standard 6 (access to interventions) and Standard 8 (frequency of Ongoing Consultant Review). However, it is not compliant with Standard 2, which records how quickly patients are seen by a c onsultant after admission, and mandates that 90% of patients have to be seen by a c onsultant within 14 hours. At the l ast audit, in spring 2018, the Trust scored 74%. An improvement plan has been agreed in discussion with NHS Improvement and NHS England, focusing on IT solutions to enable easier tracking of patients and to aid better recording of reviews in patient notes. There has also been a significant investment agreed with NHS Somerset CCG for the recruitment of additional c onsultants to provide a more robust staffing rota across all seven days of the week. In the future, the T rust will provide regular assurance to the Board on progress against all 10 clinical standards, in accordance with the revise d guidance from NHS England.\" Quality Account 57 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 INFORMATION ON PARTI CIPATION IN CLINICAL AUDITS AND NATIONAL CONFIDENTIA L ENQUIRIES National Clinical Audit Participation During 2018/19, 49 national clinical audits and three national confidential enquiries covered relev ant health services that Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust provides.

Amongst these are the following responsive actions, selected as an illustration of the service -specific improvement work initiated via audit during the 2018/19 period.) British Thorac ic Society (BTS) National Adult Bronchiectasis Audit 2017 (published June 2018) Results are in line with current BTS quality standards when compared to the national average and in several key clinical areas, performance is better than the national average. The respiratory team offer a comprehensive bronchiectasis service that compares favourably to the national mean when measured against the BTS quality standards. Notable areas of performance above the national average Quality Account 63 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 include appropriate use of antibiotics and provision of an individualised written management plan. Improvement areas include: investigation for suspected common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and investigation for suspected recurrent pulmo nary aspiration, however, local review has indicated that in the vast majority of cases (91.5%), specific investigations were not clinically indicated in these patients. National Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) audit report 2017 (published Dec 2018) There were 11 key performance indicators (KPI) measured. The local FLS performed better than the national average in 4 KPIs, similar to national average in 5 KPIs, and performed below national average in 2 KPIs. The local FLS initiative for falls assessment has been used as a case study for excellent practice in the national report. The key areas of improvement identified in this report include identification of vertebral fragility fractures (VFF), appropriate bone protection prescriptions, commencing strength a nd balance classes, and 12 & 52 week follow up following fragility fracture. The FLS is involved with local and regional stakeholders to improve the identification of fractures especially VFF, as well as working to develop and implement a falls pathway in the community to help to decrease further falls, and increased engagement in strength and balance classes. The team will be meeting with the NOS (national osteoporosis service) delivery board in February 2019 to gain some advice and support for these impr ovements. MINAP - MYOCARDIAL ISCHAEMIA NATIONAL AUDIT PROJECT 2018 (2016/17 data) The national audit for MINAP (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project) shows that overall cardiac patients at Musgrove Park Hospital receive a good to excellent standard of care. Musgrove Park Hospital was above the national average for arrival to treatment ('Door to Balloon') times under 90 mins. The audit also shows that due to circumstance beyond the control of the hospital, call to treatment times for STEMI p atients has dropped year on year. The primary reason for this is increasing pressure on the ambulance service that transfers patients to Musgrove Park Hospital, increasing numbers of out of hospital arrest cases that are brought in for assessment for PPCI as well as transfers from a neighbouring hospital. Quality Account 64 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 The Trust is below the national average for number of patients (with nSTEMI) who received angiography during admission. The primary reason is that these patients are generally elderly patients with multi ple comorbidities (other conditions) where angiography is considered not to be a benefit. National Diabetes Inpatient Audit 2017 (NADIA) The audit highlighted several aspects of practice for attention and improvement including diabetes medication errors, insulin errors, glucose management and prescription errors. There was a comparatively higher rate of severe hypoglycaemic episodes. Findings were better than average for completion of foot risk assessments, patient meal experience and overall satisfaction with care. Medication errors had increased in this audit year, prior to this they had shown year on year improvement from 2013 -2016 and this will be subject to further examination to fully understand the causes. Whilst there were fewer mild episodes of hy poglycaemia reported , severe cases had increased. The team had already secured funding for Inpatient Diabetes Specialist Nurse (DSN) time to work on improving patient outcomes and reducing length of stay. There is specific focus on improving outcomes for inpatients with diabetes in terms of hypoglycaemia avoidance and medication / insulin error avoidance. The DSN is running this ongoing project with input from the Quality Improvement team. National Cardiac Arrest Audit - 2017/18 report The results show th at the Trust performed better than average in terms of survival to discharge for our cardiac arrest patients with the lowest incidence of ward - based cardiac arrest per 1,000 bed days amongst participating Trusts for this period. Performance will continue t o be monitored via the Trust's Deteriorating Patient Committee. National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) Year 4 report Overall, the audit demonstrate s that the Trust is practising in line with standards , and compares favourably to other local hospitals and national figures in terms of consultant involvement in care, routine HDU care, length of post -operative stay, unplanned HDU/ITU admission, reoperation and mortality. Areas for improvement include: Ensuring every patient has preoperative risk stratific ation and this should then improve admission rates to HDU/ITU post -operatively. Getting our patients to theatre faster. Issues around preoperative involvement of consultant anaesthetist/intensivist are being addressed via the clinical lead. Quality Account 65 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Although the POPS team has made a notable impact, the recent loss of consultant geriatrician time has potential to bring a decline in performance for future rounds. National Hip Fracture Database 2018 report (2017 data) The trauma and orthopaedic team ha s noted good an d improving overall performance within the audit: The report confirmed a significant improvement in performance linked to increased orthogeriatric assessment, now achieved within 72hrs for 97.5% of patients. This is a result of altered work patterns and ne w consultant appointment. As a result of improvements in most domains, time to theatre is now consistently the dominant cause of missing the (Best Practice Tariff) standard, accounting for about half the total. Delays with theatre are also being addressed by a new policy for cancellation of elective surgery at times of peak Trauma demand. Increasingly, minor trauma surgery is being managed via Day Surgery. Mortality is closely monitored by the clinical team. There is now a better correlation of crude and adjusted measures with national data, suggesting more accurate recording of comorbidities - other conditions the patient has - at the time of the fracture. Uplift in Physiotherapy input is being planned to enable hip fracture patients to be reviewed dail y. Additionally, a new hip surgeon appointment during 2019 should improve the timeliness of surgery for fractures. National Ophthalmology Database (NOD) report 2018 Until there is an electronic medical record (EMR) system in place at Musgrove Park Hospita l, for use in cataract surgery, full submission of data to the National Ophthalmology Database will not be possible. There has been a big effort to implement a departmental EPR solution, and the first module to be used will be the cataract module. When thi s goes live, all cataract surgery (over 2 ,000 cases per year) will be linked to audit outcomes , and we will appear as a trust on the NOD report. The results of our most recent local ( departmental ) cataract audit showed a favourable PCR complication rate ( rupture of the posterior lens capsule or vitreous prolapse or both) of 1.08%, compared to the national benchmark of 1.4% published in the 2018 NOD audit report. National oesophago -gastric cancer audit report 2018 All patients diagnosed with oesophago -gastric cancer are recommended to have an initial staging CT scan. The Trust's findings show that 78.9% of patients were recorded as having had a staging CT scan. An audit was conducted following the Quality Account 66 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 publication of the report. Of 89 patients included in the aud it 85 patient s had a staging CT scan (95.5%), which would meet the recommended requirement. National Paediatric Diabetes Audit 2016/17 (Report June 2018) The paediatric diabetes team ha s conducted a full appraisal of the audit findings, and ha s identified improvement actions for all the main topics addre ssed within the recommendations. One area of focus has been completion of health checks, which are recommended annually. Improved annual review processes have been an aim for the team , resulting in year on year improvements. This includes screening for complications and identification of other risk factors e.g. smoking / alcohol. Annual review now includes a type 2 diabetes specific form. The annual screening target is 100% locally and this was achieved in the 2017/18 data. Review of screening for psychological issues is part of current work programme. An area identified from the audit feedback was to investigate improving retinopathy completion. Following review of outstanding patients, all patients will be offered appointments. College of Emergency Medicine (CEM) - Pain in Children 2017 The findings suggested a need for some concerted improvement work. Pain assessment in children is part of the triage process using a child -friendly scoring method, and E mergency Department nurses have specific processes in place for administration of simple analgesia for pain score 4 -6/10. Stronger, fast -acting analgesics are used for pain score 7 or more, and are prescribed by doctors. The audit results are likely to refl ect recognised issues with clear documentation of pain assessment. Review has been via the departmental clinical governance meeting , and the actions will be part of a quality improvement project. Since the audit, a paediatric safety check list has been dev eloped and introduced. This includes a pain score at triage and a reassessment of this score after one hour. Use of the checklist will enhance the ability to audit our progress with all CEM audit standards. In the longer term, the team ha s requested that e -triage is introduced for children as part of the electronic record development and this will include a mandatory pain score. Training provision has also been subject to review, with key staff attending a paediatric pain management day run at the regional centre in Bristol. Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme 2017/18 The Trust compares well to standards and national figures in most key indicators and there has been improvement or sustained audit scores compared to the last annual period. There are howe ver three key aspects where improvement could be made when compared to national figures: Quality Account 67 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The number of patients thromboly sed within one hour of arrival Consul tant review within 24 hours Days seen by speech and language therapists. Modelling is currently underway looking to extend stroke consultants ' hours in keeping with South West Stroke Network requirements. Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) national audit of seven -day acute care diagnostic radiology It is proposed that the NHS moves towards a seve n-day service. Severe shortage of consultant radiologists poses a particular challenge with an 8.5% consultant vacancy rate and only 43% of advertised consultant posts leading to a successful appointment. RCR 2018 publication \"Standards for providing a sev en-day acute care diagnostic radiology service\" highlight the significant management, administrative and IT support that radiologists require to provide such a service. This audit evaluates the extent to which diagnostic and interventional radiology is provided to acute and non -acute care patients seven days a week within the UK , and will inform development of business cases on workforce and service issues. Royal College of Radiologists national audit of radiology involvement in cancer multidisciplinary t eam meetings Radiologists are essential contributors to cancer multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs). They review relevant imaging and provide a specialist opinion to guide cancer diagnosis and treatment. In 2014 RCR published \"Can cer Multidisciplinar y Team M eetings - Standards for Radiologists.\" This audit assesses compliance with these standards . Identifying deficiencies will aid development of solutions to improve the quality and consistency of radiology input towards MDTMs, thereby improving the s tandardisation of cancer treatment in the NHS. Royal College of Radiologists national audit of safety checks for radiology interventions Human error is an inevitable cause of patient harm. Safety checks are a simple method of reducing the risk of harm us ing routine checks to reduce the likelihood of error. A document was published by the RCR in 2013 offering guidance on the implementation of the World Health Organisation surgical safety checklists for radiological procedures. The audit assessed whether ra diology departments had improved implementation and met national standards for safety checklists across the UK. A second objective was to examine difficulties in implementation. Quality Account 68 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Local clinical audit The reports of 68 local clinical audits were reviewed by the provider in 2018/19 and Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve the quality of healthcare provided. The following are examples of projects conducted by clinical teams across the hospital and the c hanges proposed as a result of them: Breast Care Re-excision of margins From national audit, the team noted a higher than average rate of re -excision compared to other centres. Examining this via local audit found that this included a subset of cases whose condition would not be seen using breast imaging. In these cases the re -excision was considered unavoidable. A further sub -group was identified that should have been excluded from the national audit dataset and with these accounted for the findings were i n line national average. Post-operative infection rate Post-operative infection rate was 3.8% (12/316 patients over a six month period) and only a minority required readmission to hospital. However, not all high risk patients received perioperative antibio tics. The audit led to reinforcement of the perioperative breast antibiotic guidelines to drive improvements and ensure reliable antibiotic prescribing. Dermatology Teledermatology The audit examined the teledermatology service provided for inpatients to support on call care of people admitted with skin diseases to Musgrove Park Hospital. Communication was improved as an outcome of the audit, with additional safeguards put in place to ensure that the teledermatology report was directed correctly to ensure timely action by the clinical team. There has also been a drive to improve documentation of care of patients with complex skin diseases needing treatment. Anaesthetics Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in elective orthopaedic patients The available data suggests that AKI rate amongst this large patient group has been halved in the past year due to simple approaches such as early risk scoring, stopping ACE -inhibitors, and early involvement of the High Dependency Unit (HDU) team. Quality Account 69 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Central line checklist completion The audit was undertaken to ensure that central line checklists are completed reliably. The feedback helped to ensure the team followed the standards of aseptic insertion and proper documentation after insertion. Postoperative TTO analgesia prescribing in day surgery patients The audit helped with appropriate selection of the patients in need of analgesia at home and reduced the amount of overprescribed drugs. Management and follow up of hypotension after orthopaedic surgery This audit was part of a project designed to improve decision making, focussing on identifying which patients need to be followed up on the ward or are in need of more specialised care in the High Dependency Unit. Recovery Handover Documentation and Standardi sation As a result of this au dit, the department changed the anaesthetic charts, adding new content to ensure a clearer and safer handover from theatre to recovery area, and to the ward. Re -auditing is planned to assess ongoing success with this change. Ophthalmology Retinal detachmen t / CVI / Glaucoma / Macula hole / Retinopathy of prematurity audits This core set of audits for the department were used to provide assurance that standards are met. Cataract audit This local audit (supporting the National Cataract Audit as above), demonstrated an efficient system, with good success rates for the procedure. Corneal treatment guidance compliance As a result of an audit of corneal procedures, the team identified efficiencies in the process of care, implementing a more standard approa ch to delivery of the care pathway. Retinal and glaucoma virtual clinic audits The audits were undertaken to assess the impact of the virtual clinics and demonstrate their benefit. Quality Account 70 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Orthodontics Child did not attend policy and child safeguarding audit The audit indicated that the orthodontics department was not fully adhering to the Trust protocol for managing children not attending, and clinicians were informed of their obligations with regard to children who are not brought to their clinic appointments. A revised approach has been implemented within the team for children who are not brought to their appointments - either new patient consultations or follow -up appointments. The team plans to re -audit this area, to monitor and ensure improvement. Number of visits and treatment length The team wanted to review the efficiency of treatment provided to patients undergoing upper and lower fixed orthodontic appliance treatment. The average treatment time was found to be 22 months and the average number of visits was 13. This was found to be the same as the results reported in 2013. The findings indicated that when there was a change in operator, treatment length and number of visits increased . Other factors that increased treatment time were missed appointments an d emergency appointments. Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) score (re -audit) This audit is undertaken on an annual basis to quality assure orthodontic treatment. The results showed that the standard of treatment outcome is very high, the team exceeded all of th e standards that were set, with 71% of patients achieving a greatly improved outcome and 28% in the improved category. Quality of X-rays It is a requirement that the team reviews radiographs to check the quality of the radiographs taken . The results showe d that the departments in Yeovil and Taunton are easily achieving the standards required by Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000. Extra training is to be provided for certain X-rays where the standard was lower than other views to try and improve technique in these areas. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Bladder Scanner Audit Overall the audit showed that the introduction of the ultrasound bladder scanner had reduced the need for additional radiation doses and revealed that fewer imaging variance s (deviation from protocol) were being issued . This resulted in more patients being treated in adherence to protocol. The audit also recommended that a more robust protocol for the use of the bladder scanner be created, which staff would be trained to foll ow. This is currently under Quality Account 71 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 development, with plans for staff training to be rolled out, with the intention of re - auditing the use of the bladder scan in the future. Diagnostic imaging Audit of compliance with NICE guidelines (2014) for CT head imaging in traumatic head injury NICE CT head imaging guidance published in 2014 uses clinical features to identify patients r equiring urgent CT head scans within one hour or within eight hours, recommending a provis ional written CT report within one hour. The audit was performed to assess compliance with NICE guidelines and to explore opportunities to improve efficiency/compliance. The majority of scans were requested in accordance with NICE guidance and performed and reported within one hour. However, several areas for development were highlighted, inc luding: improving completion of relevant vital information re NICE criteria on CT head requests education of junior A&E staff minimising delays prior to scan and report. Changes in practice being developed: A&E to c learly triage relevant CT head requests as per NICE guidance (urgent/re quired within one hour vs within eight hours ) plans to increase vetting by CT radiographers plan to re -audit following implementation of changes. Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiog ram (PTC) outcomes (re -audit) This was a re -audit of complications and success of PTC interventions (drainage/stent placement) compared to 2014/2015. PTC intervention is usually a palliative procedure and thus it is essential to minimise associated morbidi ty. Significant improvements were seen in morbidity and mortality 30 days following percutaneous biliary intervention . This was achieved through changes in practice initiated following the previous audit. In particular, positive impacts were seen via impro ved communication with consultant to consultant discussion regarding patient selection . Simple measures were seen to significantly reduce complications - i.e. locking drains; pre and post procedure care on a GI specialist ward and increased anaesthetic sup port. Audit of critical results notification The purpose of this audit was to ensure that all serious unexpected diagnoses are dealt with efficiently and effectively via the alerts system in diagnostic imaging. Quality Account 72 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 This is in line with a new procedure. Overal l, results were very positive, demonstrating that the implemented new system for alerts in communication of critical, urgent and unexpected findings is efficient and effective. Regular yearly re - audits planned. Naso -gastric tube audit The audit assessed c ompliance with National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) 2011 guidance, reviewing chest X-rays for naso -gastric tube position and demonstrating areas for improvement in imaging and reporting . An action plan has been formed and includes : a training presentatio n at r adiographers' meeting s NPSA guideline posters distributed within the department , with a reminder regarding clear communication to clinical team/ward documentation if th e tube is shown to be misplaced - this topic has been highlighted for re -audit. Audit of pathway for arranging MRI following GP -requested Ultrasound The audit was undertaken due to a view that the pathway created for GP -referred patients with soft tissue masses requiring MRI characterisation (and subsequent referral to sarcoma MDT) c ould be improved. Findings demonstrated scope for improving the care pathway, by clarifying the ultrasound scan report and by the subsequent completion of the management/urgency and MRI safety questionnaire. A new pathway was developed with two streams , depending on whether patients are still within the department , allowing immediate completion of the MRI safety questionnaire. As follow -up, radiologists have been trained on the new pathway; posters have been provided within the department ; and GPs notified of the new pathway. A re -audit is planned to assess success. Haematology and oncology Single nurse check audit The single nurse check audit has been completed over two years and this has a lso led to a change in practice. This check has now been rolled out to all band 5 nurses. Re-audit of the documentation following the use of Patient Group Directions to manage hypersensitivity reactions in the Beacon Day Unit Several actions have been taken to respond to the findings, including a focus on documentation pr actice, instructions given to the patient who experienced a hypersensitivity reaction regarding the use of oral antihistamine and discharge advice. There has been enhanced effort to determine the number of patien ts who receive treatment for a h ypersensitiv ity reaction and who are receiving rituximab / Quality Account 73 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 paclitaxel. These patients receive Hydrocortisone and antihistamine intravenously (IV) as part of their pre-treatment to reduce the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Physiotherapy Documentation quality Phys iotherapist records of care are audited to assess eleven national standards. It was found that six out of eleven standards were met with either acceptable level or above required level of compliance. The areas consistently not meeting the standards include the recording of relevant past medical history, including history of falls and goal setting. Feedback has been provided in order to support any training needs, with an aim to improve these results. The therapy team's workload has increased significantly f ollowing the introduction of the 'Home First' pathway discharge system - and the audit will support monitoring of whether additional pressures are impacting record keeping quality. Gynaecology Use of mesh In accordance with NICE guidance, all mesh used in gynaecology should only be offered when clear governance arrangements are in place. The purpose of this audit was to ensure compliance with the national guidance. Prolapse procedure in day surgery The service has moved towards offering some prolapse surg ery that was traditionally offered as inpatient procedures to be performed in day surgery. The purpose of this audit was to measure the outcomes. Management of gynaecological emergency admission to Surgical Admission Unit The admission and management of gy naecological emergencies has always been a matter for concern , as priority is often given to obstetric emergencies. Further to previous auditing, there have been recent appointment s of new consultants with specific time within their job plan in order to pr ioritise gynaecological emergencies. This audit showed a very satisfactory outcome and reduced number of admissions compared to a previous audit three years ago, which highlighted the need for consultant cover. The management of ectopic pregnancy and the u se of Methotrexate Use of Methotrexate in managing ectopic can potentially result in adverse outcomes if misused. This audit was conducted to ensure the team adheres to the guidance and policy. Quality Account 74 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Gynaecological oncology Colposcopy re -audit - conservative m anagement of High -Grade Cervical Intraepithelial neoplasia (HG CIN) The audit has identified a continued need to focus on improving recognition of these patients. It was highlighted that the departmental guideline for this pathway of care is not being reliably followed. In response, all colposcopists were made aware of the findings and new ways of highlighting these p atients were discussed. Ongoing audit s are being planned to monitor improvements. Paediatrics Sepsis in the Paediatric Department This is a monthly audit assessing whether all acute admissions are screened for possible sepsis , and monitoring the time taken to administer intravenous (IV)antibiotics in those patients screened as a possible 'red flag' for sepsis. National guidance from Sepsis Trus t and NICE inform the standards of care assessed. The main overall benefit has been culture change on the unit, whereby sepsis is recognised as important and needs to be identified and treated promptly. The screening audit shows that acute admissions are c onsistently screened. The time to administration of IV antibiotics has fluctuated and remains an area for improvement. Further work needs to try to identify where the delays are happening how these can be reduced. CLINICAL RESEARCH Last year saw signifi cant enactment of the Government's ambitions to embed research in NHS services. T he National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and NHS England are jointly driving system -wide changes to speed up the process of conducting research and disseminating and a dopting the results of research for the benefit to the NHS and its patients, whilst capitalising on fiscal savings to support long -term sustainability . This effort has been further augmented by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) working in partnership with the Health Research Authority (HRA), the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) . The aim is to develop new assessment guidance and indicators as part of the 2018 update of the well-led framework of the CQC's monitoring and inspection programme . This approach demonstrates the belief and growing body of evidence that research - active hospitals have better patient outcomes. There will also now be a question in the CQC annual patient surve y on whether patients have been offered a research opportunity during their time in hospital. Quality Account 75 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Commercial collaborations The Trust's first commercial research collaboration , capturing and processing circulating tumour cells, was led by chief investigator Dr Fred Mayal l, and completed successfully, having proved the concept. The project aim was to test whether circulating tumour cells in patients with cancer of an unknown primary could be captured and analysed to aid diagnosis. A further related project is currently being developed to test whether the same process works for diagnosing lymphoma . The Trust has recently gone live with TrinetX . TrinetX is a commercial data warehouse t hat makes anonymised data available to approved research partners . This enables patients with rarer conditions , who are eligible for trials , to be identified more readily so that researchers can target setups in locations with the relevant patient population. The Trust join ed a prime site collaboration with IQVIA (previously IMS Healt h and Quintiles). This means the Trust will be able to influence commercial trial development at an early stage , to enhance the deliverability of the research within the NHS and to join new trials sooner. The Trust, along with the other trusts across the S outh West Peninsula, has become a partner organisation of Pfzier 's Inspire Programme; a global network of strategic partnerships with research centres (Investigator Networks, Site Partnerships and Infrastructure for Research Excellence). It is thought that the development of this relationship will lead to potential growth opportunit ies in future. Academic grants The Trust has a number of academic, grant supported studies in various stages. Respiratory clinician , Dr Justin Pepperell , will shortly commence r ecruitment to a new study , in collaboration with the University of Oxford, for patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea. Dr Pepperell was awarded a grant of \u00a3317,184 by the NIHR Research for Patient Benefit Programme to set up and run the trial . Mr Nic k Burns -Cox, Consultant Urologist , has successfully led recruitment of 100 patients to a study validating a new blood test for diagnosing prostate cancer in a Trust -sponsored, collaborative study with the world renowned Karolinska Institute in Sweden. This ground -breaking research, if successful, could lead to fewer men having to undergo intrusive biopsies in future. Professor Rob Andrews' trial, EXTOD education, has developed and tested an education programme for enabling patients with type I diabetes to undertake exercise safely. The work will be published towards the end of the year. The Trust has continued to work with its local health community partners in Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to dev elop the Somerset Research Collaborative; several staff Quality Account 76 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 have been seconded to continue to develop this work . The lead research nurse and research manager work on behalf of Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership Foundation Trusts . Charitable sector The research team ha s appointed their first research ambassador, Emeritus Professor Mike Fowler, who is working strategically with the leadership team to scope and investigate further research funding opportunities to help develop loca l chief investigators. Quality improvement The department continues to review whether research delivery provides a good patient experience. This year our focus group was held with cardiology research patients to hear about their experiences. This prompt ed changes in several aspects of how cardiology research is undertaken, such as the environment where research activities take place . Funding and activity In 201 8/19, the Trust was allocated \u00a3994,055 to support research staffing and infrastructure via the NIHR Clinical Research Network: South West Peninsula, with a further \u00a3 29,390 directly from the Department of Health. Revenue from the conduct of research of \u00a3 647,371 has been invoiced for, as at 31 March 2019. The number of patients receiving relevant hea lth services provided or sub - contracted by Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust in 2018/19 that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a research ethics committee was 1,590 (in 110 studies). Trust employees have demon strated the vibrancy and innovative practice of a research active organisation in the last twelve months by producing an extremely high volume of successes, conference abstracts and publications in high quality academic journals. The Emergency Department won South West Research Team of the year, which is testament to the hard work and dedication of the whole department, led by Dr James Gagg. Ninety four articles and abstracts were produced. The topics were wide ranging across specialities and also across the whole range of professions. Analysis of data provided by the Library Service demonstrates that the most prolific specialities for successful publications are bariatric medicine and respiratory medicine.

COMMISSIONING FOR QU ALITY AND INNOVATION FRAME - WORK (CQUIN) Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust's income in 201 8/19 was not conditional on achieving quality improvement and innovation goals through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation framework as the Trust agreed a block contract. However, a number of improvement and innovation goals were agreed between Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group. Key leads were identified for all of the goals and a Quality Account 78 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 monitoring group was established to review progress on a monthly basis. The Trust's overall compliance was monitored by commissioners and discussed in detail at quarterly cross -county, multiagency meetings. 2.5% of income for 2017/18 was also conditional on achieving quality and innovation goals. Further details of the agreed goals for 201 8/19 and for the following 12 month period are available electronically at http://www.musgroveparkhospital.nhs.uk/about -your -hospital/our -quality Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trus t is required to register with the Care Quality Commission and its current registration status is unconditional. The Care Quality Commission did not carry out any inspections at the Trust during 2018/19. The last inspection of the Trust was carried out between the 30 August and 28 September 2017, with unannounced inspections of four core services and a review of the well -led key question at trust -level. The Trust continues to be rated as \"Good\" overall, and \"Excellent\" for the caring domain. Taunton and Som erset NHS Foundation Trust has not participated in any special reviews or investigations by the Care Quality Commission during the reporting period. The Care Quality Commission has not taken enforcement action against Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tr ust during 2018/19. INFORMATION ON THE QUALITY OF DATA Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust submitted records during 2018/19 to the Secondary Uses S ervice (SUS) for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics, which are included in the latest pub lished data. The percentage of records in published data with valid NHS numbers and GP practitioner code were as follows: Indicator Accident and Emergency care Admitted Patient Care Outpatient Care Number of records which included the patient's valid NHS Number % of valid NHS Numbers received from EPR 95.9 99.5 99.6 % of valid NHS Numbers sent to SUS 98.6 99.8 100 Quality Account 79 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Number of records which included the patient's valid General Medical Practice Code % of valid GP Practice Codes received from EPR 99.6 99.9 99.8 % of valid GP Practice Codes sent to SUS 99.8 100 100 There has been an improvement across the board in the completeness of data submitted to SUS with a high correlation in most areas between the data contained within the core Electronic Patient R ecord (EPR). Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust will be taking the following actions to improve data quality: Extending current data quality dashboard reporting on data quality issues ; Monitoring compliance with new data quality policy ; Extending the use of S pine Mini Services through the Trusts Integration engine to improve completeness of data; Investigating Spine Connectivity for Core PAS System . Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust was not subject to the Payment by Results clinical coding audit durin g 2018/19 by the Audit Commission. INFORMATION GOVERNAN CE Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust's Data Security and Protection Toolkit submission for 2018/19 was completed by the end of March 2019 with all mandatory evidence items provided and an assessment status of 'standards exceeded'. CLINICAL CODING ERRO R RATE The Clinical Coding Audit for Data Security and Protection Standard1 Data Quality purposes was performed internally on a sample of 240 records across all specialties. The results for the clinical coding audit showed good overall figures. The diagnoses coding, with both the primary diagnosis (92.89 %) and the secondary diagnosis ( 91.07 %), are exceeding the 90% and 80% respective recommendations given for the Data Security and Protec tion Standard1 Data Quality. The procedure coding also exceeded the recommended target, with the primary procedure correct at 94.89 % and the secondary procedures at 86.57 %.

The number of patients who have died during the reporting period, including a quarterly breakdo wn of the annual figure During April 2018 to March 2019, 1,303 patients at Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust died (including inpatients and patients in the Emergency Quality Account 81 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Department ). This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: Quarter Number of Deaths Quarter 1: April - June 2018 302 Quarter 2: July - September 2018 294 Quarter 3: October - December 2018 323 Quarter 4: January - March 2019 384 Note - These include deaths of patients wh ilst an inpatient or in the Emergency Department only. 2. The number of deaths included in section 1 which the provider has subjected to a case record review or an investigation to determine what problems (if any) there were in the care provided to the patien t, including a quarterly breakdown of the annual figure By 26 February 2019, 492 case record reviews and nine investigations have been carrie d out in relation to 456 of the deaths included above. In five cases a death was subjected to both a case record re view and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record or an investigation was carried out are provided below. Quarter Number of Deaths Quarter 1: April - June 2018 208 Quarter 2: July - September 2018 173 Quarter 3: October - December 2018 145 Quarter 4: January - March 2019 49 A single death may be reviewed by more than one clinical team. There is often a delay between the death occurring, and the case reviewed and reported to the mortality surveillance group (MSG ), hence the total of reviews conducted toward the end of the reporting period will not be the final total. 3. An estimate of the number of deaths during the reporting period included in section 2 for which a case record review or investigation has been carri ed out which the provider judges as a result of the review or investigation were more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient (including a quarterly breakdown), with an explanation of the methods used to assess this Quality Account 82 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Three, representing 0.7 % of the patient deaths during the reporting period , are judged more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to each quarter this consisted of: Quarter Number of Deaths Quarter 1: April - June 2018 2 (0.7%) Quarter 2: July - September 2018 1 (0.3%) Quarter 3: October - December 2018 1 (0.3 %) Quarter 4: January - March 2019 2 (0.5 %) These numbers have been estimated using a locally designed tool to assess quality of care de veloped in line with the principles of Structure Judgement Review Methodology as the method or review advocated nationally. The reviewer records the key aspects of care for which concerns are judged to have occurred and rates the quality of care at Taunto n and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust using the below scale: A. No significant care issues identified and care considered to be excellent despite the outcome B. No significant care issues identified C. Some care issues identified but not related to death D. Care issues identified which may have contributed to death E. Serious issues identified (failure to follow procedures/ unacceptable standards of care) . Deaths with at least one review with a score of D or E are included in the percentage above. 4. A summary of what the pro vider has learnt from case record reviews and investigations conducted in relation to the deaths identified in section 3 The numbers of mortality case note reviews that have demonstrated significant care concerns that may have been related to death have be en low. The mortality surveillance group use this information to track the number of care concerns on a monthly basis. This gives the MSG oversight into significant changes within 'care concerns' throughout the Trust over time. This information can be used to further investigate potential changes related to decline or improvement in care for mortality cases. The run chart (see below) has shown a decrease in number of cases with quality care concern issues and probable avoidability identified since October 2 017. Quality Account 83 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The mortality case review process is also used to identify any potential causes for concern relating to clinical care at any stage in the patient's final admission. This is performed for all mortality cases reviewed regardless of whether there have deemed to be care concerns contributing towards death. A summary of these themes is displayed below . During the 2018/19 period the MSG has sought to understand the issues that contribute to some of these concerns. To do this, a full thematic analysis of the most frequent concern categories identified , using the above methodology , was conducted - acute management and end of life. (Preadmission care was reviewed in the previous period). 5. A description of the actions which the provider has taken in the report ing period, and proposes to take following the reporting period, as a result of what the provider has learnt during the r eporting period (see section 4) The Trust continues to refine the process around learning from cases where there is thought to be a car e concern contributing to death. In cases where there are serious care issues identified (E on care scale - see section 3) the mortality review Quality Account 84 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 case is automatically referred through to the Serious Incident Review Group (SIRG) and, as appropriate, a seriou s incident investigation is undertaken. This involves a full root cause analysis (RCA) into the care issues , and action to address the issues are monitored in a formal action plan. There has been significant work around the identification of sepsis as a consequence of a mortality review which was investigated as a serious incident. Whilst there has been an improvement overall in the organisation's response to sepsis the investigation identified that the organisation requires further education, especially t o empower staff on what to do in terms of specific clinical and non - clinical actions when sepsis is identified. Ward based simulation training is being implemented to support the overarching sepsis improvement work that is currently being undertaken. Since the last reporting period a new Somerset countywide Treatment Escalation Plan and Resuscitation Decision Policy has been written, alongside two new admission documents relating to the Treatment Escalation Plan and Caring with Compassion for the Dying Pe rson. These are in current use within the Trust and have offered guidance on treatment escalation and appropriate palliation respectively. In mortality cases where significant care concerns are identified , but the impact on the contribution to death is n ot known (D/C on care scale) , the cases are referred back to the relevant directorate team to review the learning points , manage any actions , and disseminate appropriately . The Trust continues to work on the governance processes for these cases to ensure p rocess of learning is robust and the outputs are demonstrable. The mortality surveillance group continues to develop the mortality review policy . The Trust actively promotes the use of mortality and morbidity meetings to begin the learning process when dis cussing mortality review cases. These are a combination of single speciality (e .g. respiratory), multidisciplinary (e .g. cardiology) and multi -specialty (e .g. general surgery) meetings , and are part of the consultant core supporting professional activities . They are well attended by the consultant body and the junior medical teams, and cases are discussed with appropriate learning for clinical teams distributed at this time. Most learning and action is taken at specialty level and there is variation in the way this learning and action is recorded. During 2018/19 the Trust has developed a module to its incident management system that will support the facilitation of mortality reviews and help document specific examples of action undertaken. The MSG use the fi ndings of mortality reviews in a number of ways to improve patient care and provide assurance of good practise. As wel l as providing an indication of T rust level trends, mortality review data is regularly cross referenced Quality Account 85 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 with standardised mortality data f or specific diagnosis groups to understand whether there are any clinical concerns for specific cohorts of patients. The findings of the thematic analysis are provided to relevant clinical groups to support the work to improve patient care. For example, o ne of the main findings of the thematic analysis for acute management was issues with the identification of patients with sepsis and the administration of timely treatment. This data has been provided to the clinical leads for the deteriorating patient and sepsis to support their actions to improve process. 6. An assessment of the impact of the actions described in section 5 which were taken by the provi der during the reporting period It is very difficult to assess the impact resulting directly from mortality reviews due to a number of different factors . These include : the process of identifying learning which is still under development a considerable overlap with emerging themes to work alre ady being undertaken within the Trust (eg sepsis, end of life, palli ative care) challenges with co-ordinating local (directorate) governance and learning with Trust -wide processes . The Trust monitor s the quality of the services it provides , and in terms of mortality , the indicators show that the number of cases with sign ificant care concerns has decrease d from October 2018 and that the standardised mortality indicator HSMR has returned to the expected range . SHMI has maintained its position as below the expected range. The Trust has seen a number of other significant impr ovements in work areas that overlap with concerns identified in mortality review such as sepsis and end of life care planning. 7. The number of case record reviews or investigations finished in the reporting period which related to deaths during the previous reporting period but were not included in section 2 in the relevant document for that previous reporting period 341 case record reviews were completed after 1 April 201 8 which related to 330 deaths which took place before the start of the reporting period 8. An estimate of the number of deaths included in section 7 which the provider judges as a result of the review or investigation were more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient, with an explanation of the methods u sed to assess this One case , representing 0.3 % of the patient deaths before the reporting period, is judged to be more likely than not due to problems in care provided to the patient. This number has been derived using the locally designed tool and methodo logy described above. Quality Account 86 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 9. A revised estimate of the number of deaths during the previous reporting period stated in section 3 of the relevant document for that previous reporting period, taking account of the deaths referred to in section 8. Twenty, representi ng 3.4% of the patient deaths during 2017/18 , are judged to be more likely than not due to problems in the care provided to the patient. PART THREE - OTHER INFORMATION Part three of the Quality Account provides an overview of the Trust's achievements and progress within quality indicators that have been selected by the board in consultation with stakeholders, including CQUINs. The data reviewed covers the three dimensions of quality - patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience. This de monstrates that the Trust has provided high quality of care, but with room for further improvement as highlighted below. In addition, part three also includes further information on a number of key work - streams that the Trust is currently focussing on t o improve quality and a review of performance against national targets and regulatory requirements. PATIENT SAFETY Hand washing A key component in the reduction of infection is thorough hand hygiene by all clinical staff. This is an important issue for the Trust and patients. Monthly hand hygiene compliance audits are carried out in all areas. The infection prevention and control team also undertake hand hygiene validation audits to check the reliability of the data collected and identify areas for imp rovement. Results are fed back to directorate managers, senior nurses and the ward sisters and teams. Local Target: 90% compliance Actual 2018/19 - 92% Quality Account 87 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Sustaining reductions in healthcare associated infections Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus is an organism which is resistant to the antibiotics usually used to treat infections caused by the staphylococcus aureus bacterium. Infections caused by the bacterium can r ange from mild to life threatening and can be particularly hard to treat as special antibiotics have to b e used. The Trust's aim for 2018/19 was to have no MRSA Trust -apportioned bloodstream infections (specimen taken on or after the third day of admission in line with the standard national definition), as agreed with the Trust's commissioners. Unfortunately, the Trust had two cases of MRS A bloodstream infections in 2018/19 . Multi -disciplinary reviews were completed to identify the source of the infection and any areas of sub -optimal practice that may have contri buted to the case. Areas identified for improvement included hand hygiene and MRSA screening and actions were put in place and this learning shared a cross the organisation. Clostridium diffici le Infection (CDI) Clostridium difficile is a bacterium that is present in the gut of up to 3% of healthy adults and does not normally cause any harm. CDI can occur when the normal bacteria in the gut are disturbed, usually by taking antibiotics. This allows the bacterium to multiply rapidly in the gut and produce toxins which cause diarrhoea, and in some cases severe inflammation of the bowel. The Trust continues to implement a number of actions to help reduce the risk to patients, which includes: Robust antibiotic stewardship to help reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics Prompt Isolation of patients with diarrhoea and / or a confirmed CDI Isolation of patients with a history CDI, if they are at an increased risk of developing symptoms Scrup ulous hand washing with soap and water following contact with patients with CDI Regular review of patients with CDI by a microbiologist and the Infection; Prevention and control team to support medical management and isolation practice Enhanced cleaning of rooms with hydrogen peroxide based technology to help eradicate CDI spores Enhanced cleaning of equipment with a sporicidal agent Quality Account 88 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Working closely with the Trust's partners in the community to help reduce the risk of CDI in primary care. In 2018/19 , the Trust had a total of 12 hospital onset cases ( those detected four or more days after admission) . This was a reduction from the previous year when there were 18 cases identified. All cases of Trust -apportioned CDI are thoroughly investigated to assess whether there was any lapse in care that may have contributed to the case. These assessments are subsequently peer reviewed and validated with the T rust's commissioners. I n nine of the 12 cases a lapse of care that could have contributed towards th e case was identified, and these included cleaning and hand hygiene practices being below the expected standard, both key infection control practices for CDI. A number of i mprov ement actions have been taken. These include a Trust -wide hand hygiene campaign and the purchasing of two new automated hydrogen peroxide cleaning machines, which compared to manual cleaning are superior for eradicating environmental contamination. To ensure the optimal use of antibiotics, antimicrobial stewardship remains a high priori ty in the Trust. A regular review is undertaken of broad spectrum antimicrobial prescribing on both medical and surgical wards by a consultant microbiologist and antimicrobial pharmacist. The use of high risk broad -spectrum antibiotic prescribing has sig nificantly reduced in favour of lower risk combination therapy with narrow spectrums agents . The Trust remains amongst the lowest users of these agents in the region. Quality Account 89 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Norovirus Norovirus is one of the most common causes of infective gastroenteritis in the UK. It is highly infectious and causes regular outbreaks of diarrhoea in the community and hospitals. Norovirus outbreaks can occur at any time of the year, but are more common in the winter months, with hospital outbreaks often leading to ward closur e and disruption in hospital activity. In 2018/19 there were 16 confirmed norovirus outbreaks in the Trust, resulting in restrictions being put in place on wards. Outbreaks were managed in line with the Trust's 'Management of Norovirus' policy and the Guidelines for the management of norovirus outbreaks in acute and community and social care settings' (DH Norovirus Working Party December 2011). PATIENT EXPERIENCE DIETETICS - ENSURING PATIENTS RE CEIVE ADEQUATE AND NOURISHING FOOD Nourishment is a key el ement in recovery from illness or surgery and maintenance of good health. Food and nutrition is a priority for high quality care and the Trust knows that it needs to maintain the programme for continual improvement of food services, food availability, staf f education and practice. The Trust provides patients with a range of nourishing foods, as needed, and aims to ensure that they are given the assistance as required. Food availability Availability of food, including hot meals and snacks, 24 hours a day en ables patients to have flexible access to nutrition in order to meet their needs. In addition to the wide menu of both hot and cold food served at the usual mealtimes, the Trust has the facilities required to provide hot meals 'out of hours' for patients w ho are unable to eat at the usual mealtimes or would prefer a hot meal at a different time, whether this is day or night. To provide this flexibility, the Trust has microwaves on every ward and freezers which are stocked with balanced nutritious meals. The se meals can cater for a range of diets, including gluten free, vegetarian, modified textures, milk free etc. An iPad system for food ordering is in use. This has a number of benefits, including a safer system for ordering special diets and immediate elec tronic delivery of patient meal choices from wards to the kitchen. The iPad has been Quality Account 90 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 further refined with the addition of nutritional information for each menu item. We understand that many patients prefer time to peruse the menus in order to make their me al choices and viewing an iPad does not suit all. Therefore to support a better patient experience in food choice and ordering, laminated menus which can be kept at the patient's bedside will be introduced by April 2019. Once the patient has made their foo d choices, staff can input this in to the iPad. Staff knowledge Staff education on nutrition and food provision continues to be a priority with the requirement that a minimum of 80% of the ward staff have the knowledge they need about food availability in order that patients receive what they need. A ward food folder, detailing information on food provision and special diets is available on each ward. This is supplemented by menus and special diet information available on the ward iPads and is for use by both staff and patients to ensure that patients are able to receive the food they need and would like. With the change in December 2017 of staff roles and responsibilities for patient food ordering and service, the priority has been to provide food safety awareness and food hygiene training for relevant staff. A continuing programme of course dates is enabling the key staff to receive this important training. Current figures show that in the past year we have doubled the number of clinical staff who have received face to face training on nutrition awareness and food hygiene training. Help with eating The aim for patients receiving sufficient food within or outside mealtimes focused on ensuring those who needed assistance with eating reported that they had been helped. The Trust aims for 95% (good) achievement for this. The target was set in the context of improving assistance to patients, between and at mealtimes, by: ensuring they could reach their food and drinks opening packaging offering finger foods providing prompting, or fully helping them to eat where this was needed. A bespoke survey to gain feedback from patients on their experience with 'Help with Eating' is undertaken throughout the year. In 2018/19 three surveys have taken place. In July 20 18, 100% of patients reported receiving the help they needed. In January 2019, the figure was 89% . However , this improved to 100% in March 2019. The Trust continues to compare well from the 2017 National Inpatient Survey with the question patients are aske d, 'Did you get enough help from staff to eat your meals?' The results when benchmarked show that the Trust is similar compared to other trusts on this question. Quality Account 91 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Improvements achieved in the last year Following the successful trial of the Droplet system, the Trust has now introduced these dementia -friendly mug and plastic tumblers across all the adult hospital wards. With a special base that plays a series of pre -set messages to patients or has a small flashing light on the base , these mugs and tumblers serve as reminder for people to drink and supports adequate hydration. Improved nursing care plans have been introduced for patients at risk of malnutrition. These include more focus on hydration and include the use of the Droplet system. A new, separate, ca re plan has been developed for patients requiring special diets or assistance with eating but who aren't considered at risk of malnutrition. These new and improved care plans were launched as part of Nutrition and Hydration week (see below). New hospital m enus were introduced in August 2018. They include a choice of hot finger foods and special small, but energy dense, meals to support patients on our Care of Older People wards. Also, to provide for those patients for whom healthier (lower fat and sugar) fo od choices are appropriate during their hospital stay, there is now a wider range of meal options available. To support the increasing numbers of children with eating disorders being admitted to our children's unit, special hospital menus have been develo ped. These include carefully selected meals to ensure the children receive good nutrition for their recovery and fit with a specific treatment pathway that has developed in conjunction with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services ( CAMHS ) team in So merset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . The Trust has now introduced menu clerks who help ward teams to collate patient's food choices and input these to the iPads so we can achieve same day food ordering yet meet deadlines for the food delivery and serv ice. Also, any patients who have just been admitted or have moved wards can be supported by the menu clerks to ensure that they get the meal they want, as the ordering deadline is at a time when often nursing teams will be very busy with other duties. We are working towards a consistent approach with all our food providers within the Trust. This includes the private patient ward and the commercial food and drink outlets. We have been successful in aligning to the NHS standards for the percentage of non -sugary drinks on sale on our hospital site. Quality Account 92 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Once again the Trust has actively participated in the international Nutrition and Hydration week, held in March 2019. This year, there were a wide range of activities with a focus for each weekday. This included: o 'Thirsty Thursday' which promoted hydration; and use of the Droplet system o Launch of the new nutrition and hydration care plans o Swallowing Awareness Day, which included information on the new dysphagia descriptors and the opportunity to try new modified t exture meals o The 'Big Tea Party' when cakes are supplied to the wards for a special afternoon tea event and celebration. The Trust continues to have a group of highly committed 'Nutrition Champions'. These are ward staff who work to improve nutrition in t heir ward areas with support from the dietitians and dietetic assistants. Work continues to ensure that the Trust meets the requirements of national patient safety alerts and an international improvement programme for patients requiring tube feeding. Working with our Speech and Language colleagues from Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, modified texture menus and support materials have been revised to meet the requirements for new coding of food and drink for patients with swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). This was implemented in March 2019 with support resources, staff awareness and training including through Nutrition and Hydration week and beyond. Within the new 'Prepare to Care' course, aimed at new health care assistants, there are two ses sions dedicated to nutrition. Within these sessions there is a focus on nutrition awareness, supporting patients with eating and drinking as well as how to identify risk of malnutrition. Further improvement identified Patient surveys will be taking place during 2019 to gain further feedback from our patients on the food we are offering and the meal ordering systems. This feedback will enable us to ensure that future changes are based on what patients are telling us. Further audits will be undertaken to en sure that food availability meets the standards we expect. Working with ward teams we aim to ensure that food services and mealtime systems continue to improve to meet our patients' needs. This will include a programme called 'Mealtimes Matter', which wil l be introduced to ensure Quality Account 93 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 that focus on mealtimes is maintained, particularly ensuring that all patients needing help with eating always receive it. Further auditing of compliance and accuracy of nutritional screening with a plan for regular education and training for ward staff, including an e -learning programme SEEKING AND LEARNING FROM FEEDBACK With an ambition to provide high quality patient and family centred care, it is fundamental in planning and delivering service s to gather people's views and experiences and act upon these to shape and improve the service and culture. As part of this it is vitally important to seek out and actively engage with a diverse group of people who have experience of the services delivered by Taunton and Somerset NHS Found ation Trust. In 2018 the feedback below was gathered - 4.5 Stars NHS.UK user rating Unfortunately my wife and I cannot remember the names of the people involved because we were obviously in a daze and worried. Nevertheless, staff who had admitted me an d were going off shift, came by and enquired how I was doing. Fortunately, all tests came back negative regarding a Heart Attack, with the prognosis that it was an Angina attack. Nevertheless, at all stages, we were told not to feel guilty calling an ambu lance, and that we had certainly undertaken the correct action. My wife and I, although Somerset natives, live in Essex now but remember Musgrove Park from over 50 years ago. What an evolution! You have a wonderful hospital and fantastic staff who deserve every accolade possible. Many, many thanks and best wishes for the future. Visited in December 2018.

Posted on 30 November 2018 I was given an appointment to have a mammogr am and arrived approximately 10mins early. I was told to wait in the designated area and then I would be called through. I sat in the waiting area for over 40 mins and at no point during this time did anyone mention that the Breast Care Centre was running behind schedule. Eventually I gave up waiting and explained to reception that I needed to return to work. At this point she then explained that there was only one room available for scanning therefore they were behind schedule. Why wasn't this mentioned on arrival?

On a good note the staff are all so friendly and very helpful and understanding thank you to all in the department ' Patient -led asses sments of the care environment (PLACE) assessment August 2018 Patient Led Assessments for the Care Environment provide motivation for improvement by providing a clear message, directly from patients, about how the environment or services might be enhanced . The assessments apply to hospitals, hospices and day treatment centres providing NHS funded care. Each year the PLACE assessments give opportunity to invite local people to go into hospitals as part of teams to assess how the environment supports patient 's privacy and dignity, food, cleanliness and general building maintenance. This is a vital part of the assessment; linking our teams with volunteers, governors and patients as well as external verifiers to give a true account of the current position. Quality Account 97 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The assessments take place every year, and results will be reported publicly to help drive improvements in the care environment. The results will show how hospitals are performing nationally and locally. In recent years Musgrove Park Hospital has performed ver y well and the hospital is proud to announce that in this year's assessment scores have reflected very positively; six out of eight areas are above the national average. This is an outstanding achievement showing that all services can impact on the patient experience of care. It is important to note that the scored areas for dementia, disability and privacy and dignity have improved significantly; this gives great encouragement and importance to work that has taken place in the Trust to improve our faciliti es for all patients. Of course, there are areas where we need to continue our improvement - structurally some of our buildings are in a state of repair and our busy public areas require constant dusting/cleaning. Topic Area National Average Musgrove Park Hospital Score Cleanliness 98.50% 97.09% Food (Nutrition and 90.20% 95.74% Organisational Meals) 90.01% 90.50% 96.55% Privacy, Dignity 96.25% Disability 84.20% 92.40% This is our chance to say thank you to those that lead and support the assessments . Our volunteers, governors and patient representatives are instrumental in ensuring that comme nts and qualifications are correct and their skill in recognising our strengths and challenges should be commended . The assessments would not be possible wi thout the necessary engagement. Staffing from a number of areas supported the PLACE process. We app reciate the time, efforts and input into the assessments and hope that all involved will be prepared to give their support in future assessments. Quality Account 98 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Patient Experience Collaboration For the past 12 months we have been testing a method named 'real -time measur ement' to listen to our patient's views and their stories of the care we provide. We have tested this on eight wards in total across Musgrove Park Hospital (MPH) and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (Som par). The feedback tool was developed by No rthumbria HealthCare NHS Foundation Trust, an 'Outstanding Trust ', and has been successful in improving their position of 144th in the national inpatient survey to being consistently in the top ten. They have been the only non -specialist hospital to achiev e this. The process has been tested in different environments at MPH and Sompar, as part of a collaboration of ten hospitals across the UK, led by Northumbria and the Patient Experience Network (PEN), over the last 12 months. The process included a conve rsation between patients and members of staff who are not directly involved in the patient's care, during which 25 standard questions are answered. The questions are grouped into domains covering key aspects of care and a score is given for each domain eac h month. They are taken from the National inpatient survey which was co -designed with patients as the most important aspects of inpatient care. The patients were made aware that their feedback is anonymised and those undertaking the surveys encouraged pati ents to be open and honest with their feedback. The aim was to survey a minimum of 50% of the ward occupancy each month. The scores were inputted , a report run , and a summary poster produced. This is shared with the designated ward colleagues on the same d ay that the required minimum numbers of patients are surveyed. Any named individuals have the comments shared with them directly and any issues raised are taken straight to the ward lead on the day the feedback was received for immediate action. Specialis t services seeking feedback Cancer Services ' patient surveys There is a rolling programme of patient feedback from the cancer services: Paediatric patient experience Prostate cancer Gynaecological Anti-cancer treatment. The surveys are undertaken and rev iewed by the cancer services team based in the Beacon Centre through the patient experience groups led by the patient and staff experience lead , Joanna Wilson . Quality Account 99 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Friends and Family test - Two Minutes of Your Time survey and One Quick Question surveys The Friends and Family Test (FFT) is one of the ways that we listen to our patients. It is a national measure that gives patients an opportunity to provide feedback. The results give wards/departments feedback on their care, but are also reviewed nationally to understand the Trust's performance alongside other trusts. At Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, the FFT question naire is now a part of the two minutes of your time survey for all inpatients , and the one quick question survey for all other areas. This allows the potential for all patients to provide feedback on their experience. The patient and public involvement team ha s been working closely with departments to improve the response rates and plan to target additional support in maternity and the Emergency Department in the coming weeks. A planned change to the Friends and Family Test will enable a relaunch of the process as well as utilisation of Questback to input the data.

PATIENT AND PUBLIC INV OLVEMENT (PPI) Contribution from g overnors, Musgrove Partners and Healthwatch The Trust's governors support the continued patient engagement and feedback agenda, particularly learning from feedback. The governors Patient Care Group regularly reviews feedback from patients/relatives from the local community, which is included in \"The Good to Know\" log report at their meeting. The Trust has established links with Healthwatch , and listens to feedback from this route and engages with Heal thwatch to support engagement activities particularly with the groups that may be seldom heard. The Musgrove Partners are a group of \"patient voice volunteers \" who support engagement and participate in activities from recru itment of staff to focus groups. They review serious incidents and work within improvement boards and projects. The patient experience team also support s observations, shadowing, emotional mapping, focus groups and other engagement events for specific topics. PRIVACY AND DIGNITY We r ecognise that dignity, respect and privacy in care is an important issue for patients who come to us for care and treatment. We are committed to maintaining patient privacy, and treating individuals with dignity and respect. To monitor this Quality Account 107 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 we survey our p atients and set ourselves the target of 90% positive response. The results are reviewed monthly by the directorates and board. LEARNING FROM CONCER NS AND COMPLAINTS Feedback from patients and their families and carers is very important. This helps the Trust to continuously learn and improve what it does. During the year the Trust received 166 formal complaints and 2,102 concerns which were raised through the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). All of these concerns are investigated and feedbac k given to the person who raised the issue. This includes setting out what staff have learnt and any changes made as a result of the questions raised. The Trust aims to avoid cause for Quality Account 108 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 concerns or complaints in the first instance, and when concerns and com plaints are raised , to address them thoroughly and in a timely way. Every complaint is reviewed to identify the issues raised by the complainant. This is to ensure that we can learn and continuously improve. The categorisation of issues identified for al l complaints is recorded and reviewed to allow wider learning and identification of trends. This information is considered alongside other patient information such as incidents and feedback we gain from our monthly patient surveys. In addition to a monthl y integrated performance report, which includes a range of quality indicators, the Trust Board receives a detailed report every quarter throughout the year. This provides the Board with a detailed analysis of issues arising from complaints and concerns and action being taken. During the year, learning from complaints has been shared across the hospital in a number of ways ; including the use of patient stories and hearing directly from our patients and their relatives about their experience. Information fro m complaints and stories from patients enhances staff training and helps to improve our services and care. The public Trust Board meeting begins with a patient story. The following are just a few examples of the learning and improvements we have made over the year: Feedback gained from concerns can highlight the need to introduce or review patient information given. One example relates to the length of time it took for a patient to receive her biopsy results. Investigation revealed that there was a gap betw een a report being written and authorised. As a result , learning was taken forward by the department to prevent this from happening again . A system was implemented which lets all consultants know on a weekly basis of any reports that have not yet been auth orised. One complaint revealed that a patient was not given written information from the orthotics team regarding how to care for and manage his ankle - foot orthosis; nor was he given contact details should problems arise. As a result, going forward, orthot ics clinicians now provide all inpatients with written contact details and product caring and troubleshooting advice about their device. Sometimes a complaint can produce learning for more than one specialty , in this case, gynaecology and admissions. A pat ient complained because her surgery was cancelled at the last minute. The reason was that the patient was undergoing two procedures and the second required a specialist surgeon but the booking clerk was unaware. The learning for the Quality Account 109 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 teams involved was that (a) the admissions team must check if a second procedure is indicated and (b) The procedure requiring a specialist consultant is listed as the primary procedure to avoid cancellation. THE PARLIAMENTARY AN D HEALTH SERVICE OMB UDSMAN (PHSO ) The Parliament ary and Health Service Ombudsman provides an independent complaints handling service for a range of public bodies. Should any of our complainants be dissatisfied with the handling and outcome of their complaint they have the right to request the Ombudsman to undertake an independent review of their complaint. We ensure that every complainant is given information about the role of the Ombudsman. This year the Ombudsman's office contacted the Trust regarding five complaints, requesting information regarding how the Trust had responded to those complainants. As a result of the information we supplied, a record of our investigations and responses (response letter or local resolution meeting), the Ombudsman decided not to carry out official investigations for four of these complaints , indicating that they were satisfied with the Trust's responses. However, they will be taking forward one investigation regarding a daughter who does not agree with the Trust's explanation of the cause of her mother's unexpected death. Although the number of complaints the Trust receives each year from the Ombudsman is low by overall English standards, the Trust regrets that any complaints should have to escalate to such a level. CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS LENGTH OF STAY The Trust st rives to ensure that patients do not stay in hospital for any longer than is clinically necessary. This ensures patients receive the best care in the right setting, whilst also ensuring the Trust uses its resources effectively. Reports on average length of stay are monitored in regular Trust Board reports and at a more detailed level by each directorate in their monthly Performance Assurance Framework (PAF) reviews. The following charts show the average length of stay for elective a nd non -elective patients in 2018/19 and the previous year. The Trust would typically expect average elective length of stay to be below non -elective as elective activity is more Quality Account 110 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 predictable and planned. Non-elective cases (i.e. emergencies and urgent transfers from other trusts) are often more complex and so need longer treatment and recovery periods . Elective average l ength of stay The average length of stay for patients admitted for elective operations during 2018/19 has been above the level reported in the same month in 201 7/18, for most months. This is likely due to an increase in the complexity of operations undertaken due to a 21% increase in referrals to the Trust for patients with a suspected cancer. The conversion rate from referral into a diagnosed cancer has stayed the same, meaning more patients have undergone cancer surgery this year , for which patients would usually stay longer in hospital. Non-elective average l ength of stay The average length of stay in hospital for patients admitted non-elect ively during 2018/19 has been broadly similar to those patients admitted during 2017/18. Quality Account 111 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The Somerset A&E Delivery Board is overseeing a programme of work which commenced in 2018/19, which shoud reduce the number of emergency admissions to the Trust and should also red uce the length of stay in hospital for certain groups of patients . This programme of work includes the following schemes: 7-day working rapid response hubs single point of access arrangements continued work with care homes reduction in patients with a long length of stay full implementation of Home First (discharge to assess) . The impact of these schemes on non -elective length of stay should be seen in full during the latter half of 2019/20. CANCER WAITING TIMES There are eight cancer waiting standards that hospitals need to meet. Four ou t of the eight were met in 2018/ 19. The four standards that were met relate to the 31 day standards, which cover the waiting times between decision to treat and treatment, whether first treatment or subsequent treatment s. The good performance against these standards demonstrates the commitment of the Trust to treat patients promptly once diagnosed and once treatments have been agreed. The Trust did not however meet the standards that relate to the time between referral a nd a patient being 'first seen', which should be no more than two weeks for patients with suspected cancer and for any patients with breast symptoms. This standard was narrowly missed i n 2018/ 19, largely due to capacity constraints for Quality Account 112 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 CTs and endoscopy wh ich are a common first appointment for many cancer types. These capacity -related delays are being addressed and it is anticipated that waiting times will shorten through 2019. Another common delay factor for this standard is that patients will frequently d ecline the first appointments offered them; the Trust is working with primary care to ensure that GPs make patients fully aware that they are being referred to hospital on pathways designed to rule out or diagnose cancer quickly, and asking for their suppo rt in ensuring that patients accept offered appointments within the tight timeframes. The Trust also did not meet either of the two standards that cover the time between referral into the hospital (either by GP or via a screening programme) and treatment, which should be no more than 62 days. The screening standard was narrowly missed (89.0% against the 90% target), whilst 77.5% of patients referred in by their GPs were treated within 62 days (against the 85% target). The reasons for the failure to achieve the standard include the complexity of patients being referred, high levels of referrals, especially for diagnostic tests such as CT, MRI and endoscopy; patients choosing to delay diagnostic tests or treatment, and delays for patients being seen for specia list treatment at other providers. The Trust did however make incremental improvements each quarter against this standard and has plans in place for f urther improvement through 2019/ 20. All standards were m ore challenging to meet in 2018/ 19 because of ma rked increases in referral rates; there were 2,074 more patients referred on su spected cancer pathways in 2018/ 19 than in the previous year, representing a 20.2% increase in referrals. Colorectal, breast, gynaecology and head and neck referrals showed the largest increases, and it is an ongoing challenge for these services to flex capacity in order to meet this demand. Compliance with all cancer targets continues to be closely monitored by the Trust Board and is a key area of focus for improvement. HOSPIT AL STANDARDISED MORT ALITY RATIO (HSMR) The hospital standardised mortality ratio (HSMR) is a method of comparing mortality against the predicted national average but taking into account a range of factors such as the case -mix of patients, palliative care cases and differences in populations. It is calculated on 56 diagnosis groups that account for around 80% of in-hospital deaths. The ratio is of actual deaths to expected deaths, multiplied by 100. If the number of deaths is higher than would be expected, the HSMR will be greater than 100. Mortality rates show considerable variation over the short -term which means that observing them over longer periods of time (12 months) provides a better perspective on genuine trends. Whilst the methodology for Quality Account 113 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 HSMR may take into account factors such as palliative care, there are differences in the way trusts code this data which may make comparisons less reliable. The following graph illustrates the Trust's quarterly overall rolling 12 -month HSMR over the last three ye ars. The HSMR is currently in the 'as expected banding', suggesting the Trust's in -hospital mortality rate is not significantly different than the national average. HSMR is presented alongside the 95% confidence intervals. Where the lower confidence i nterval exceeds 100, the HSMR is said to be significantly higher than expected. Where the confidence interval spans 100, the HSMR is within the expected range. In order to explore the root causes for this position, the Trust reviews individual diagnostic g roups and conducts investigations to identify the causes when these are different from those expected. It should be noted that small variations are not necessarily accurate reflections of changes in the standard of care as these are statistical representat ions with certain inherent errors. It is most valuable in detecting major deviations or trends. During 2018/19 the Trust has conducted a number of reviews into its high standardised mortality ratios within certain diagnostic groups that contribute to the overall high HSMR. These diagnosis groups include pleurisy, pneumothorax and pulmonary collapse. The investigations consist of a review of coding practices, case mix and the structure of our services. It also includes a review of the quality of the care the Trust was delivering. The reviews found no significant causes for concern relating to the quality of care being delivered. During the year, Quality Account 114 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 improvements have continued to be made in co-morbidity and pallia tive care coding. ORGAN DONATION The Trust contin ues to implement national and regional best practice and remains compliant with NICE guidance (CG 135). 2018/19 has been a busy year. A n outstanding referral rate of 22 potential orga n donors has been achieved (100 %); 14 families have been approached to explore organ donation and all of these approaches have been collaborative (100%). This exceeds the national average. The overall consent rate for organ donation within the Trust is 86%; the national average is 67 %. As a result, the Trust continues to per form well in terms of org an donation with a total of 23 transplants enabled over the year. Key work for 2019/20 will be a focus on the NHS Blood and Transplant regional strategy to try and minimise the length of the donation process, in part by expediting the testing of patients with suspected death as diagnosed by neurological criteria. NHS STAFF SURVEY 201 8 / PULSE CHECK Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust continue s to hold at its core the culture and organisation development programme that pers on-centred care can only be delivered through a person -centred culture. The Trust continues to place significant value on the insight provided by the internal engagement measure \"Pulse Check\" and the NHS Annual Staff Survey. 2018 NHS staff survey The 2018 NHS Staff Survey results have been slightly amended this year. The key changes have involved a shift in 2018 from key findings to 10 themes and the scoring move from a 5 point scale to a 10 point scale. Overall, staff engagement for the Trust in 2018 is 7. 2 compared to an overall score in 2017 of 7.3. This is a slight decrease from 2017 and is a slight increase on the acute trust average for 2018, which is 7.0. The staff engagement theme questions which make up the overall engagement score relate to: staff members' perceived ability to contribute to improvements at work Quality Account 115 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 their willingness to recommend the Trust as a place to work or receive treatment the extent to which they feel motivated and engaged with their work. The table below sets out the specific q uestions which make the key findings with the results for 2015 - 2018 . Question 2018 2017 2016 2015 Acute hospitals (2018) Difference against national benchmark +/- I look forward to going to work 61.% 61% 60% 67% 59.3% 76% 78% 74.8% +0.7% 78% 78% 76.8% +1.1% Question 2018 2017 2016 2015 Acute hospitals (2018) Difference against national benchmark +/- There are frequent opportunities f or me to show initiative in my role 72% 75% 75% 78% 73% -1% I am able to make suggestions to improve the work of my team / department 75% 78% 79% 78% 75% - I am able to make improvements happen in my area of work 56% 58% 57% 60% 56% - Care of patients / organisation's top priority 82% 84% 84% 85% 77% +5% I would recommend to work 72% 72% 71% 74% 63% +9% If a friend or relative needed treatment, I would be happy with the standard of care provided by this organisation 84% 84% 84% 82% 71% Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in last 12 months and equal opportunities for career progression One of the themes in the 2018 NHS Staff Survey is safe environment - bullying and harassment. This sets out the score using the new 10 point scale indicating staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from staff and patients/service users over the last 12 months. In 2018 this stands at 8.1 compared to 8.2 in 2017 with the average for acute trusts in 2018 s tanding at 7.9. This theme is made up of the following three questions: Question 2018 2017 2016 2015 Acute Hospitals 2018 Difference against National Benchmark +/- % never experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse at work from managers in the las t 12 months 90% 91% 90% 88% 86% +4% % never experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse at work from other colleagues in the last 12 months 81% 82% 83% 76% 80% +1% % never experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse at work from patients/service users, the ir relatives or other members of the public 72% 73% 70% 71% 72% - In 2019/20 the re will be a focus on the safe environment - bullying and harassment theme in line with the year 2 priorities of the People Strategy. The aim is to reduce this through develo pment of resilience, management development and other programmes of work to support colleagues. We will be working alongside the Freedom to Speak up guardians as well as the people partners to support this. Quality Account 117 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Equality, Diversity and Inclusion In the 2018 NHS Annual Staff Survey, equality, diversity and inclusion was one of the 10 themes and overall the score for 2018 for this theme is 9.2 which is the same as 2017. This theme is made up of the following four questions: Question 2018 2017 2016 2015 Acute Hospitals 2018 Difference against National Benchmark +/- Does your organisation act fairly with regard to career progression /promotion, regardless of ethnic background, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability or age? 85.2% 87.9% 87.9% 93.3% 83.9% +1.3% In the last 12 months have you personally experienced discrimination at work from patients / service users, their relatives or other members of the public? 5.6% 6.3% 6.7% 6.4% 6.1% +0.5% In the last 12 months have you personally experienced discrimination at work from manager / team leader or other colleagues? 6.2% 6.0% 6.5% 6.2% 7.7% +1.5% Has your employer made adequate adjustment(s) to enable you to carry out your work? 76.7% 79.2% 82.4% 72.4% 72% +4.7% Staff conversations / listening to staff The people partner team, alongside the leadership and organisational development team continue to support the directorates and divisions across both Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, with inte rventions to ensure that colleagues across both trusts feel listened to , and have an opportunity to have their voice s heard. The teams have run listening events on the back of Pulse Check results to understand from colleagues what drives the results and wh at changes would help. As well as providing support for colleagues to do this they also provide the challenge about the role colleagues have to play in making changes and what support they may Quality Account 118 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 need to enable this to happen. These types of interventions wit h teams are ongoing . Freedom to Speak Up The role of the Freedom to Speak Up guardian is to provide a service for all colleagues to speak about any concerns regarding patient safety or their experience at work. The guardians are also required to provide r eports to the National Guardian Office and Trust Board. Within the Trust there are two Freedom to Speak Up guardians providing this service and they are supported within the People Services. Alongside this there is support from the Executive Director of People and Organisational Development and a Non -Executive Director for the Trust. The role of the Freedom to Speak Up guardian has been in place since 2017 and in this time the service has dealt with the following number of cases: Figures below are from April 2018 - March 2019 Number of cases raised Number of cases raised anonymously Number of cases with an element of patient safety Number of cases with an element of behaviours including bullying and harassment Number of cases where there was a suffering of detriment 57 1 37 39 3 During 2018 the promotion of the Freedom to Speak Up service was a year one priority arising out of the People Strategy which was approved in April 2018. In order to cr eate awareness across the Trust, work has been undertake n to promote the service, including posters of the process from the Freedom to Speak Up policy. In October 2018 there was a month -long National Freedom to Speak Up campaign, which saw the guardians, alongside executives and non -executive directors, doing walk arounds in all areas of the hospital talking to colleagues about the service. As well as responding to speaking up concerns , the guardians have been proactive in terms of raising awareness of the service through a number of Trust channels, as well as building relationships with the People Partner team wh ich support the guardians once a colleague has spoken up. Quality Account 119 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Plans for the future include extend ing the hours for the Freedom to Speak Up service . This will ensure more availability, which in turn will ena ble the guardians to embed the culture of speaking up across the hospital with a focus on understanding the barriers to speaking up and to support the removal of these by working with the People Services team. Pulse Check Now in its sixth year, Pulse Check continues to be the survey we use to measure leadership and wellbeing across the Trust. There remains a strong focus on leadership and wellbeing from immediate managers. This provides two key focuses from the results of Pulse Check. There have been no cha nges to the way Pulse check runs. T he survey continues to be run twice a year across both Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. This gives the directorates, along with the support of the People Partner tea m, six months between each Pulse Check to make some changes and then see the impact this has had by comparing these results. As part of the people metrics for the Trust, five of the 14 questions are amalgamated into the leadership capability index, which is the key measurement used to identify how well managers are leading their teams in line with the Trust's leadership behaviours. The five questions used to make up this index are: I think that it is safe to speak up and challenge the way things are do ne My immediate manager motivates and inspires me to do a great job My immediate manager recognises and acknowledges when I have done my job well My immediate manager makes time to see me when I need support or direction I receive regular and constructi ve feedback on my performance. The following table shows the percentage of respondents responding positively to the questions during 2018/2019 for the Trust as a whole: Q1 & Q2 April - Sept Q3 & Q4 Sept - March Leadership Capability Index (Amalgamatio n of following five questions) 74.4% 73.6% I think that it is safe to speak up and challenge the way things are done 72.3% 72.4% My immediate manager motivates and inspires me to do a great job 73.5% 72.8% Quality Account 120 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 My immediate manager recognises and acknowledge s when I have done my job well 74.4% 73.5% My immediate manager makes time to see me when I need support or direction 84.2% 82.7% I receive regular and constructive feedback on my performance 67.5% 66.8% The following table below shows the results from 2018/19 for the Wellbeing Index for the Trust as a whole.

New preceptees come into the hospital with fresh eyes, energy and new ideas that encourage staff to think differently and challenge the way they work. The preceptees may not feel that they have the skills to challenge or to suggest new innovations, yet they see problems and want to work on solutions. The preceptees have structured time around quality improvement during their programme which allows the m to develop their ideas in a structured and supported environment. The preceptees present their projects to invited guests from the improvement network, senior nurses, line managers and to those staff helping with th e transition and sustainability of the work. Examples of som e of the Improvement projects that have been presented from the last two courses are: To improve and standardise mouth care in ventilated patients on intensive care Food record chart - can we do better? The use of name boards in the operating department End of life symptom observations Clinical care alert tile - memory management aid. Quality Account 121 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 The Lea dership Talent Programme 2018/19 In September 2018 the Trust introduced a new leadership programme called Compass for Leadership. This programme is designed for all Band 6 and a bove colleagues across both Taunton and Somerset NHS and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. It is an opportunity for all leaders across both trusts to come together to learn and share experiences. The content of the programme is designed around the three values: Listening and leading Working together Outstanding care The format of the programme is four modules which are broken down as follows: Module 1 - Introduction and Change Module 2 - Listening and Leading Module 3 - Working Together Module 4 - Outstanding Care Modules 2 - 4 will look at leadership in terms of each of our values and how we can bring to life the values we have created so they become the way we are and set the culture of the Trust. Module 1 is now complete with nearly 1,100 co lleagues having attended the module. Module 2 started is well under way with modules 3 and 4 planned to be completed prior to December 2019.

Quality Account 125 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 ANNEXES Annex 1: Statements from Stakeholders NHS S omerset Clinical Commissioning Group Report NHS Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group is the lead commissioner of health services from the Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (T&S), we welcome the opportunity to provide this statement and comm ent on the Trusts Quality Account. The Quality Account presents a summary and balanced overview on the progress at of the Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust local and national quality priorities and quality improvement work undertaken within 2018/1 9 as well as reporting on the required content as set out by NHS Improvement's Quality Account reporting requirements. Throughout 2018/19, there have been robust arrangements in place between Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and the CCG to agree, monitor and review the quality of services through the Clinical Quality Review meeting and the Contract Review Group meetings. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has launched numerous quality improvements during the year, these include learning fro m complaints and incidents. It is notable that the Trust has participated in the full range of national and local clinical audits and that this has resulted in actions to improve quality. Our review will detail comments on the three key areas patient exper ience, patient safety and clinical effectiveness. Patient Experience The CCG is pleased to see the focus of the user experience and very positive engagement with individuals and organisations in developing these quality accounts. The Trust has a well -deve loped Musgrove Friends who help ensure the voice of users is integral to future service development. The Trust has begun to work collaboratively with patients and families to co -design and shape the services provided and improve patient outcomes and experi ences. On NHS Choice's the Trust scored 4 stars with comments from a variety of the services, one recent review thanked all the staff saying \"hospital appointments are anxious occasions, but everyone looking after me. All introduced themselves by name and explained clearly what I should do, and what they would do. I was particularly impressed by the HCA, whom I saw at the start and at the end of my two hours in the department. Not only was she great with me, I saw her taking special care over an older pati ent with additional needs, and obviously briefed the next member of staff about that patient.\" Quality Account 126 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 The Trust shares learning from complaints across the hospital through the use of patient stories and feedback from patients and their relatives, enhancing staf f training and improving care and services. The CCG congratulates the Trust on its continued improved performance with Patient Led Assessments on the Care Environment (PLACE). PLACE is a system for assessing the quality of the hospital environment and th e Trust had six out of eight areas scoring above the national average. Best performing areas included Ward Food (Availability), Dementia, Food (Nutrition & Hydration), Privacy, Dignity & Well -being, Organisational Food (Service of Meals) and Disability. The Trust has acknowledged the importance of nourishment in recovery from illness or surgery and to maintain good health and have therefore made food and nutrition a priority area for improvement. Quality Improvement projects include dementia -friendly mugs and plastic tumblers across all the adult hospital wards, care plans for patients at risk of malnutrition, improved food menus plus menu clerks who help collate patient's food choices and support for children with eating disorders. The Trust also particip ated in International Nutrition and Hydration week and has plans for further improvement in 2019/20. A nation campaign, launched by England's chief nursing officer , to end \" pyjama paralysis\" has helped reduce falls and pressure ulcers and cut the length o f time people spent in hospital, The trust has taken part in national campaigns to highlight the benefits of patients getting dressed as soon as possible when they are in hospital. Patient Safety The Trust continues to work closely with the CCG and other stakeholders in Somerset to improve infection prevention and control through shared learning. A key component in the Trust's reduction of infection is thorough good hand hygiene by all clinical staff. For 2018/19 the Trust had an overall compliance of 92 % compared to the Local Target of 90%. The Trust aim was to have no Methicillin -Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA -bacteria) Trust -apportioned bloodstream infections but unfortunately had two cases in 2018/19. Multi -disciplinary reviews identified impro vements in hand hygiene and MRSA screening; actions were put in place and this learning was shared across the organisation . In 2018/19 there were 12 Trust attributed cases of Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) with 9 of the cases suggesting a lapse in c are. The Trust addressed this by implementing a Trust -wide hand hygiene campaign and the purchasing of two new automated hydrogen peroxide cleaning machines. Musgrove Park Hospital continues to drive quality improvements to reduce the number of Clostridi um Quality Account 127 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 difficile cases with projects including antibiotic stewardship, prompt isolation of patients, regular review of patients with CDI by a microbiologist and the Infection Prevention and Control team and through enhanced cleaning of rooms and equipment. Th e Trust continues to work closely with the partners in the community to help reduce the risk of CDI in primary care. The CCG acknowledges that the Trust has begun to investigate community onset cases, where the case is detected within two days of admissio n, and where the patient has been an inpatient within the previous four weeks. This is good practice and is in line with expectations for 2019/20. In 2018/19 there were 16 confirmed Norovirus outbreaks in the Trust resulting in restrictions being put in pl ace on wards and management in line with local and national policy. During 2018/19, the Trust reported 10 Serious Incidents, three of which were Never Events. The three Never Events relate to the Wrong Implant/prosthesis, Wrong Site Surgery and Retained Fo reign Object. Only one of these reports has been completed to date and although there were no adverse consequences to the patient, learning includes embedding the prosthesis verification stage within the whole process. Of the 7 serious incidents, three related to maternity, two were diagnostic issues and two were surgical. Reporting for the 2018/19 financial year was up 4 from the previous year however, Taunton and Somerset are classified as low reporters the regulator and commissioners will be working with the Trust to understand this position better. Clinical Effectiveness: In a bid to improve staff retention, the Trust is undertaking several projects to improve the Health and Wellbeing of staff and having scored 6 out of 10 in this section of the 201 8 Annual Staff Survey, this is compared to the national average of 5.9. Musgrove Park Hospital saw a 1% decrease in performance in the A&E maximum waiting time of four hours from arrival to admission/transfer/discharge (91.8% in 2017/18 compared to 90.8% i n 2018/19); this is also compared to the national standard of 95%. The Trust is to be congratulated on its success in the field of clinical research which has been recognised through numerous publications in academic journals and in receiving the award of South West Research Team of the Year. Quality Account 128 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 The Trust has implemented the second version of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) as a hard copy form. Conversion to an electronic format has been delayed due to technical issues with the trust's system provid er. Sepsis screening compliance has been variable throughout the year. Sepsis screening for children has improved in 2018/19. The trust has developed an electronic App called POPS (V2) (Paediatric Observation Priority Score) which has been commended by ot her services. Nevertheless, the trust is also working with University Hospitals Bristol to trial the Bristol Paediatric Early Warning Score (BPEWS), helping to work towards a new nationally validated tool to replace the current PEWS tool published by NICE. The use of sepsis screening will continue to be monitored in 2019/20 through the quality contract meetings. The CCG notes the improvements around mental health and holistic care and in particular the increase in the number of staff who have received enhan ced training to further understand and support mental health issues. The CCG also notes the improvements in the availability of psychiatric liaison services which is now accessible 24/7. Building on previous work delivered in 2018/19, the Trust has achiev ed an overall reduction in the length of stay, from 3.7 days to 3.5 days, through maintaining sustainable changes to discharge pathways including the implementation of 7 -day services. The CCG notes the continued good performance in reducing delayed transf ers of care through successful collaborative working with partners across the county. The Trust continues to work well with commissioners and other stakeholders in delivering the National Home First discharge project which, in Somerset, is funded through t he Joint Commissioning Board (Somerset Local Authority and the CCG). The project aims to support frail, vulnerable people, post -discharge. This is delivered either at home with assessment and support, with community hospital enablement or care home enabl ement. The Trust has reported that, as of January 2019, 1,999 patients have used the Home First service from its hospital site with 1,181 of these being discharged directly home from hospital. At the time of writing, the final data against the eight cance r standards was not yet available however the Trust anticipates that four out of the eight were met in 2018/2019. The four cancer targets met related to the 31 -day 'decision to treat to receiving treatment' waiting time standards. The Trust did not meet t he standards that relate to the time between referral and a patient being 'first seen', or either of the two standards that cover the time between referral into the hospital (either by GP or via a screening programme) and treatment (no more than 62 days). The Trust has stated that the cancer standards were more challenging to meet in 2018/19 due to increased referral rates, complexity of patients being referred, patients choosing to delay tests or treatment Quality Account 129 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 and the delay in patients receiving specialist tre atment from other providers. There were 2,074 more patients referred on suspected cancer pathways in 2018/19 than in the previous year, representing a 20.2% increase. Colorectal, breast, gynaecology and head and neck referrals showed the largest increases . Compliance with cancer targets will continue to be a key area for improvement. Following national guidance, the Mortality Surveillance Group (MSG) meets monthly to review deaths, establish if avoidable, identify learning, initiate investigation if signi ficant concerns and cascade learning to Trust staff. By February 2019, the MSG reviewed 492 deaths with five subjected to a case record review and investigation. The number of deaths that have demonstrated significant care concerns was low and there has continued to be a steady decrease since October 2017. The Trust will continue to improve the mortality review process in 2019/20. Quality Improvement Priorities for 2019/20 The CCG supports the Quality Improvements identified by the Trust for 2019/20: Delivering parity of esteem between physical and mental health services Learning from incidents, complaints and mortality reviews Improving the quality of discharge summaries Improving sepsis recognition Improving implementation of the Rapid Response Servic e Developing co -design and service -user involvement . It is clear that the Trust has demonstrated numerous areas of effective improvement in patient safety and quality initiatives. The CCG recognises the Trust's continued commitment to working in partnershi p with commissioners, the public and other key stakeholders and we look forward to again working with the Trust in the forthcoming year.

Sandra Corry Direc tor of Quality, Safety and Engagement Quality Account 130 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Healthwatch Somerset's Response to Taunton & Somerset NHS Trust Quality Account 2018/19 Introduction Healthwatch S omerset welcomes the opportunity to comment on the draft Taunton & Somerset Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account for 2018 - 19. Healthwatch Somerset exists to promote the voice of patients and the wider public with respect to health and social care services. Over the past year we have continued to work with Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust to ensure that patients and the wider community are appropriately involved in providing feedback and that this feedback is taken seriously. Healthwatch S omerset welcomed the opportunity to meet with the Trust over the last year and comment on last year's priorities. We have read this document in the knowledge that is has been a difficult document to put together ahead of the merger with Somerset Partnershi p Foundation Trust. Healthwatch Somerset would welcome understanding how this year's priorities have been developed and whether this has been done in collaboration with representatives of the patient voice. We also note that there is minimal comment on how well the Trust has performed against last year's priorities. Priority Areas for 2019 -20 Priority 1 - Delivering parity of esteem between physical and mental health services Healthwatch Somerset has not been supplied narrative to comment on, however, we know that the benefits of integrated care across boundaries (health, social care, employment and housing) are understood although integrated care for people with mental health conditions is often the exception rather than the rule. This can lead to poo r patient experience and reduced quality of care. We would like to see the Trust improve the ability of staff to recognise and respond appropriately, to those patients with mental health needs (children, adults in crisis, and older people). The developin g partnership with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust should mean closer working between physical and mental health care services and a greater opportunity for better mental health training for hospital staff. Quality Account 131 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Priority 2 - Learning from incidents, complaints and mortality reviews We support any action by the Trust to ensure that, when things go wrong, a proper investigation, with full input of the patient/their relatives or carers, takes place. We note that the Serious Incident Review Group will h ave a key role to play in ensuring that learning takes place as a result of its overview responsibility. We would welcome regular conversations with the Trust about how complaints are being used to shape services going forward. Priority 3 - Improving the quality of discharge summaries Healthwatch Somerset has not been supplied narrative to comment on. Healthwatch Somerset is aware that discharge is a continuing area of concern for patients and carers, and has been pleased to be involved in a number of workshops in Somerset to identify areas of concern, and to develop good practice to improve discharge planning. Priority 4 - Improving sepsis recognition We support any action by the Trust to raise awareness of sepsis and to ensure that prompt and appropr iate treatment takes place. We note that inpatient performance results have improved since the Care Quality Commission inspection in December 2018 with over 82% of inpatients screened for sepsis, compared to less than 20% a year before. We applaud the work that the Trust have already undertaken on Sepsis recognition, and would welcome better understanding of the plans to develop this further in the year ahead. Priority 5 - Improving implementation of the Rapid Response Service We note that the new Rapid Response Service has been operational since November 2018, and new relationships built with adult social care and Home First to enable patients to move onto appropriate services where needed. We welcome the collaboration of services to meet patient need. Priority 6 - Developing co -design and service user involvement By listening to people who use and care about health and social care services the Trust can understand their health needs better and focus on, and respond to, what matters to them. Groups such as Musgrove Partners and the Patient Care Group, as well as volunteer groups, are key to enabling a partnership with patients and the public to ensure that patient and public involvement is genuine and meaningful. We would welcome a seat on the Patien t Care Group to ensure we can share patient feedback and understand the actions taken from it. Quality Account 132 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Summary Overall, we feel that this is a balanced report covering both past performance and proposals for future priorities. We look forward to working with t he Trust over the coming year to ensure that the experiences of patients, their families, and carers are heard and taken seriously. Somerset County Council's Report The accounts were a thoroughly robust, interesting and encouraging document. Scrutiny for Adults and Health Committee Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust Governors' Report Musgrove Park Hospital is a very well respected Trust, servicing a population of over 340,000 within Somerset as well as providing specialist and tertiary services for the whole county - amounting to a catchment population of over 544,000. The majority of the Somerset population recognise how lucky they are to have such a caring and efficient hospital within their reach. Over the years, the Musgrove teams have improved overall operational efficiency, quality of health and patient care, whilst at the same time are continually fighting the battle of increasing patient numbers and costs against financial constraints. These pressures, along with the continual need to provid e a safe healthcare service, have led to the Trust continually focussing on the need to learn from, and improve on, its services. This has included projects to improve quality of care, cleanliness and hospital food, lengths of stay, efficiency of the indi vidual's discharge and the implementation of a lot of lateral thinking. Most importantly, the Trust makes a point of learning from its mistakes - incidents, complaints and reviews of performance such as mortality, sepsis, etc. This Quality Account report well illustrates the high level of analysis and reports carried out to support decision making. None of this could have been achieved without the support of the Trust's staff. This has been encouraged by programmes to improve recruitment, working practic es, removing duplication and the introduction of a programme to support the emotional, physical and mental wellbeing of colleagues. This is being measured by the monitoring of activities such as sickness, staff turnover and temporary staffing costs. Over t he years it has become increasingly obvious that closer working between physical and mental health services would improve overall patient care and at the same time help improve physical and financial efficiency. As a consequence, the Quality Account 133 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 Trust is now in the process of merging with the Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (provider of mental and community hospital care). The Trust has continually recognised areas for quality improvement and assurance and, despite outside pressures, has achieved and maint ained targets as required throughout the year - despite work pressures due to increased admission rates. The quality indicators continue to show a consistent improvement and remain within the expected range. The overall patient experience score from the Fr iends and Family questionnaire continues to improve. It is good to note that there is a focus on increasing the response rate and the improvement boards are implementing learning from patient experience in their work. The collaboration between Taunton a nd Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is well evidenced in the report. Despite the challenges presented it appears that new initiatives are actively encouraged, thus recognising the advantages of a closer alliance. The introduction of the liaison psychiatry team in the Emergency Department, together with the activity coordinators based on the care of the elderly wards, has ensured interaction between the physical and mental health needs of the patient, thus improvin g the patient experience within the acute hospital. The increased teaching around end of life care has ensured that the care of patients, their families and those in the caring role , are given the support they need. This allows the experience to be as holi stic and empowering as possible for all involved. Due to the increased collaboration between the community and the hospital, delayed discharges have been drastically reduced, with the Trust consistently over achieving against the national target. This, to gether with other initiatives such as 'Home First', has had an overall effect on recovery and increased independence of patients following discharge. With ever increasing numbers of patients, especially via the Accident and Emergency route, the Trust and i ts employees are under continual strain. The priority in any decision making is - patient first. This is a very good hospital with a loyal staff. Mistakes are made, as with any organisation, but the Trust endeavours to learn from them for the overall be nefit of future patients. The overall picture of this do cument is one of encouragement. A ll areas of the community and acute trust s are working to ensure that the continued delivery of care for all patients throughout Somerset is of the highest standard . Members of the Patient Care Group Quality Account 134 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 Annex 2: Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in respect of the Quality Report The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service Quality Accounts Regulations to prepare Quality Acc ounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual quality reports (which incorporate the above legal requirements), and on the arrangements that NHS foundation trust boards should put in place to support the data quality for the preparation of the quality report. In preparing the Quality Report, directors are required to take steps to satisfy themselves that: The content of the Quality Report meets the requirements set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2018/19 and supporting guidance detailed requirements for quality reports 2018/19. The content of the Quality Report is not inconsistent with i nternal and external sources of information including: - Boar d minutes and papers for the period April 2018 to March 2019 - Papers relating to Quality reported to the Board over the period April 2018 to March 2019 - Feedback from the commissioners dated 10/05/ 2019 - Feedback from governors dated 13/05 /2019 - Feedback fro m Local Healthwatch organisations dated 06/05 /2019 - Feedback from overview and scrutiny committee dated 09/05/ 2019 - The Trust's complaints report published under regulation 18 of the Local Authority Social Services and NHS complaints Regulations 2009, dated 26/04/2019. - The 2018 national patient survey report dated 26/02 /2019 - The 2018 national staff survey report dated 26/02 /2019 - The Head of Internal Audit's annual opinion over the Trust's control environment dated May 2019 - The Care Quality Commission (CQC) report dated 05/12/2017 Quality Account 137 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 We read the other information contained in the Quality Rep ort and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with: Board minutes and papers for the period April 2018 to May 2019; papers relating to quality reported to the board over the period April 2018 to May 2019; feedback from commissioners, dated 02 May 2019; feedback from governors, dated 02 May 2019; feedback from local Healthwatch organisations, dated 06 May 2019; feedback from Overview and Scrutiny Committee, dated 09 May 2019; the latest national patient survey, dated 03 May 2018; the latest national staff survey, dated 28 February 2019; Care Quality Commission Inspection, dated 5 December 2017; the 2018/19 Head of Internal Audit's annual opinion over the trust's control environment, dated 09 May 2019; and any other information included in our review. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with those documents (collectively, the 'documents'). Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. We are in complia nce with the applicable independence and competency requirements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Code of Ethics. Our team comprised assurance practitioners and relevant subject matter experts. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Council of Governors of Taunton & Somerset NHS Foundation Trust as a body, to assist the Council of Governors in reporting the NHS Foundation Trust's quality agenda, performance and activities. We permit th e disclosure of this report within the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2019, to enable the Council of Governors to demonstrate they have discharged their governance responsibilities by commissioning an independent assurance report in connection w ith the indicator. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Council of Governors as a body and Taunton & Somerset NHS Foundation Trust for our work or this report, except where terms are ex pressly agreed and with our prior consent in writing. Assurance work performed Quality Account 138 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Tru st - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 We conducted this limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) - 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information', issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ('ISAE 3000'). Our limited assurance procedures included: evaluating the design and implementation of the key processes and controls for manag ing and reporting the indicator; making enquiries of management; testing key management controls; limited testing, on a selective basis, of the data used to calculate the indicator back to supporting documentation; comparing the content requirements of the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual to the categories reported in the Quality Report; and reading the documents. A limited assurance engagement is smaller in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement. The nature, timing and extent of procedure s for gathering sufficient appropriate evidence are deliberately limited relative to a reasonable assurance engagement. Limitations Non-financial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the characte ristics of the subject matter and the methods used for determining such information. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of different, but acceptable measurement techniques which can result in materially different measurements and can affect comparability. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Furthermore, the nature and methods used to determine such information, as well as the measurement criteria and the precisio n of these criteria, may change over time. It is important to read the quality report in the context of the criteria set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual and supporting guidance. The scope of our assurance work has not included gove rnance over quality or the non-mandated indicator, which was determined locally by Taunton & Somerset NHS Foundation Trust. Conclusion Based on the results of our procedures, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, for the year en ded 31 March 2019: Quality Account 139 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2018/19 the Quality Report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the criteria set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual and supporting guidance; the Quality Report is not consistent in all material respects with the sources specified in the Guidance; and the indicators in the Quality Report subject to limited assurance have not been reasonably stated in all material respects in accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual and the six dimension s of data quality set out in the Guidance.

Additional PDC may also be issued to trusts bythe Department of Health and Social Care. Acharge, reflecting thecost of capital utilised bythe trust, ispayable to the Department of Health and Social Care as the public dividend capital dividend. Revaluation reserve Increases inasset values arising from revaluations arerecognised intherevaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse impairments previously recognised inoperating expenses, inwhich case they arerecognised inoperating Subsequent downward movements inasset valuations arecharged to the revaluation reserve to theextent that aprevious gain was recognised unless thedownward movement represents aclear consumption of economic benefit or a reduction in service potential.

Consequently, thefollowing financial statements have been prepared inaccordance with theGAM 2018/19 issued by theDepartment of Health and Social Care. Theaccounting policies contained intheGAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to the extent that they aremeaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which isadvised by theFinancial Reporting Advisory Board. Where theGAM permits achoice of accounting policy, theaccounting policy that isjudged tobemost appropriate to the particular circumstances oftheTrust for the purpose of giving a true andfairview has been selected. Theparticular policies adopted aredescribed below. These have been applied consistently indealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. Note 1.1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under thehistorical cost convention modified toaccount for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. Note 1.2 Going concern These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. International Accounting Standards (IAS1) require thedirectors toassess, as part of theaccounts tocontinue as agoing concern. Inaccordance with theNHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual paragraph 3.20, theaccounts should be prepared on agoing concern basis unless thedirectors either intend toapply to the Secretary ofState for the dissolution of the Foundation Trust without thetransfer of theservices toanother entity, or have no realistic alternative but todo so. The Trust has developed detailed financial plans for the financial year to the end of March 2020 and these show adeficit position of \u00a36,000,000 on theNHS Improvement control total basis and \u00a35,652,000 after taking account of donated asset related movements. The planned level of deficit willpotentially require theuse of interim revenue support loan facilities from theDepartment of Health and Social Care. The Trust hasutilised interim revenue support loan facilities during both the2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years and expects these available. Forthisreason, theDirectors consider itappropriate tocontinue toadopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. Theaccounts do not include any adjustments that would result iftheFoundation Trust wasunable tocontinue as a going concern. Note 1.3 Interests in other entities Joint ventures Joint ventures arearrangements inwhich theTrust has joint control withone or more other parties, and where ithastherights to the net assets of thearrangement. IFRS 11 specifies that since theTrust does not have subsidiaries that areconsolidated and does not therefore produce consolidated accounts, theTrust 1.4.1 Revenue from contracts with customers Where income isderived from contracts with customers, it isaccounted forunder IFRS 15.TheGAM expands thedefinition of acontract toinclude legislation and regulations which enables an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that isnotclassified asataxbythe Office of National Statistics (ONS). As directed by theGAM, thetransition toIFRS 15in2018/19 has been completed in applying theStandard retrospectively but recognising thecumulative effects atthedate of initial application (1 April 2018). There awas no overall impact on the income and expenditure position of the Trust. Revenue inrespect of goods/services provided isrecognised when (oras) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods/services to the customer and ismeasured at theamount of thetransaction price allocated tothose performance obligations. Attheyear end, theTrust accrues income relating toperformance obligations satisfied inthat year. Where theTrust's entitlement to consideration forthose goods or isunconditional willbe recognised. toconsideration isconditional on afurther factor other than thepassage of time, a contract asset willbe recognised. Where consideration received or receivable relates toaperformance obligation istobesatisfied inafuture period, theincome isdeferred and recognised as acontract liability. Revenue from NHS contracts The main source of income for the Trust iscontracts with commissioners forhealth care services. A performance obligation relating todelivery of aspell of health care isgenerally satisfied over time as healthcare isreceived and consumed simultaneously by thecustomer as theTrust performs insuch acontract isthecommissioner, butthecustomer as services areprovided to their patient. Even where acontract could be broken down into separate performance obligations, healthcare generally aligns with paragraph 22(b) of theStandard entailing adelivery of aseries goods or services that aresubstantially thesame and have asimilar pattern of transfer. Attheyear end, theTrust accrues income relating to activity delivered inthat year, where apatient care spell is incomplete. Revenue isrecognised to the extent that collection of consideration isprobable. Where contract challenges from commissioners areexpected tobe upheld, theTrust reflects this inthetransaction price and derecognises therelevant portion of income. Nosignificant contract challenges have been received this financial year. Where theTrust isaware of apenalty based on contractual performance, theTrust reflects this inthe transaction price for its recognition of revenue. Revenue isreduced by thevalue of thepenalty. No penalties have been incurred in this financial year. NHS injury cost recovery scheme The Trust receives income under theNHS injury cost recovery scheme, designed toreclaim thecost of treating injured individuals towhom personal injury compensation has subsequently been paid, for instance by an insurer. The Trust recognises theincome when itreceives notification from the Department of Work and Pension's Compensation Recovery Unit, has completed theNHS2 form and confirmed there areno discrepancies with thetreatment. Theincome ismeasured at theagreed tariff for the treatments provided to the injured individual, less an allowance forunsuccessful compensation claims and doubtful debts in line with IFRS 9requirements of measuring expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. 15Note 1.4.2 Revenue grants and other contributions to expenditure Government grants aregrants from government bodies other than income from commissioners or trusts for the provision of services. Where agrant isused tofund revenue expenditure it istaken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. The value of thebenefit received when accessing funds from the the Government's apprenticeship service isrecognised as income at thepoint of receipt of thetraining service. Where these funds are paid directly toan accredited training provider, thecorresponding notional expense isalso recognised at the point of recognition for the benefit. Note 1.4.3 Other income Income from thesale of non-current assets isrecognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met, and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. Note 1.5 Expenditure on employee benefits Short-term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment-related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. NHS Pension Scheme Past and present employees arecovered by theprovisions of theNHS Pension Scheme. Thescheme isan unfunded, defined benefit scheme that covers NHS employers, general practices and other bodies, allowed under thedirection of Secretary ofState, inEngland and Wales. The scheme isnot designed inawaythat would enable employers toidentify their share of theunderlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, the scheme is accounted for as though it is a defined contribution scheme. Employer's pension cost contributions arecharged tooperating expenses as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements arenot funded by thescheme except where theretirement isduetoill-health. The fullamount of theliability for the additional costs ischarged to theoperating expenses at the time the trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of themethod of payment. Note 1.6 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services isrecognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and ismeasured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure isrecognised in operating expenses except where itresults inthecreation of anon-current asset such as property, plant and equipment. 167Note 1.7 Property, plant and equipment 7Note 1.7.1 Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust it is expected to be used for more than one financial year the cost of the item can be measured reliably the item has cost of at least \u00a35,000, orcollectively, anumber of items have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have cost ofmore than \u00a3250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated tohave similar disposal dates and are under single managerial control.itforms part of theinitial equiping and setting upcosts ofanew build or refurbishment of award or unit, irrespective of their individual or collective cost.Where alarge asset, forexample abuilding, includes anumber of components with significantly different asset lives, eg, plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful lives. 7Note 1.7.2 Measurement Valuation Allproperty, plant and equipment assets are measured initially atcost, representing thecosts directly attributable to acquiring or constructing theasset and bringing itto the location and condition necessary forittobe capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Allassets are measured subsequently at valuation. Assets which are held fortheir service potential and are inuse(ie operational assets used todeliver either front lineservices or corporate functions) are measured at their current value in existing use. Assets thatwere most recently held fortheir service potential but are surplus withno plan tobring them back intouseare measured at fairvalue where there are no restrictions on sale atthereporting date and where they do not meet the definitions of investment properties or assets held for sale. Property assetsThefairvalue of land and buildings isdetermined by valuations carried out by theTrust's valuer GVA. The valuations are carried out inaccordance with theRoyal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Manual and are carried out primarily onthebasis of Depreciated Replacement Cost (DRC) which ismeasured on aModern Equivalent Asset basis forspecialised operational property. Non-specialised operational property ismeasured on an Existing Use Value. Afullvaluation (excluding assets under construction/work inprogress) was undertaken as at 1April 2016. A subsequent desktop valuation has been carried out for31March 2019. This value, together withindexation applied to buildings in line with the Valuers advice has been included in the closing Statement of Financial Position. The component elements of each property asset are depreciated individually where thevalue of thecomponent parts are judged tobe material inrelation to the overall value of that asset and where theuseful economic lives ofthe components are significantly different from that of theoverall property asset. The component parts that are individually depreciated by the Trust are building structures, engineering elements and external works. The value of land forexisting usepurposes isassessed atexisting usevalue. For non-operational properties including surplus land, thevaluations are carried out at open market value. GVA have supplied amended estimates of the diminution invalue relating tooperational buildings scheduled forimminent closure and subsequent demolition. These buildings have been written down intheaccounts tothese values. Open market values have also been provided for land and residences. Itisimpracticable todisclose theextent of thepossible effects of an assumption or another source of estimation uncertainty at theend of thereporting period. On the basis of existing knowledge, outcomes within thenext financial year that are different from the assumption around thevaluation of our land, property, plant and equipment could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability recorded in note 15 Properties inthecourse of construction forservice or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, where capitalised inaccordance with IAS23, borrowings costs. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when the assets are brought into use. ITequipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings, and plant and machinery that are held foroperational useare valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful lives orlowvalues or both, as this is not considered to be materially different from current value in existing use. 17Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating toanitem of property, plant and equipment isrecognised as an increase inthe carrying amount of theasset when it isprobable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred toreplace acomponent of such item will flow to the enterprise and thecost oftheitem canbe determined reliably. Where iscapitalised amount of thepart replaced isde-recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. 18Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in amanner consistent with theconsumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land isconsidered tohave an infinite life andisnot depreciated. Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as'held forsale' cease tobe depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets inthecourse of construction and residual interests inoff-Statement of Financial Position PFI contract assets are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use or reverts to the trust, respectively. Revaluation gains and losses Revaluation gains are recognised intherevaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised inoperating expenses, inwhich case they are recognised in operating income. Revaluation gains are recognised intherevaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised in operating expenses. Gains and losses recognised intherevaluation reserve are reported intheStatement of Comprehensive Income as an item of operating expenses. ImpairmentsInaccordance with theGAM, impairments that arise from aclear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential intheasset are charged tooperating expenses. Acompensating transfer ismade from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i)theimpairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. Animpairment that arises from aclear consumption of economic benefit or of service potential isreversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave riseto the loss is reversed. Reversals are recognised inoperating expenditure to the extent that theasset isrestored to the carrying amount itwould have had iftheimpairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal isrecognised intherevaluation reserve. Where, at thetime ofthe original impairment, atransfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. 7Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. De-recognition Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as 'held for sale' once all of the following criteria are met: theasset isavailable forimmediate sale in its present condition subject only toterms which are usual and customary for such sales; the sale must be highly probable ie: - management are committed to a plan to sell the asset - an active programme has begun to find a buyer and complete the sale- the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price- the sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the date of classification as 'held for sale' and-theactions needed tocomplete theplan indicate it is unlikely thattheplan willbe abandoned or significant changes made to it. Following reclassification, theassets are measured at thelower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fairvalue less costs tosell'. Depreciation ceases tobe charged. Assets are de-recognised when allmaterial sale contract conditions have been met. Property, plant and equipment which istobe scrapped or demolished does not qualify forrecognition as 'held forsale' and instead isretained as an operational asset andtheasset's useful life is adjusted. The asset isde-recognised when scrapping or demolition occurs. 7Note 1.7.3 Donated and grant funded assets Donated and grant funded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fairvalue on receipt. The donation/grant iscredited toincome at thesame time, unless thedonor has imposed acondition that the future economic benefits embodied inthegrant are tobe consumed inamanner specified by thedonor, inwhich case, the donation/grant isdeferred within liabilities andiscarried forward to future financial years to the extent that thecondition has not yet been met.The donated and grant funded assets are subsequently accounted forinthesame manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. 197Note 1.7.4 Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) transactions 8Note 1.7.5 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment Min life Max life Years Years Land - - Buildings, excluding dwellings 4 61 Dwellings 8 16 Plant & machinery 5 25 Transport equipment 5 10 Information technology 5 8 Furniture & fittings 4 10 8Note 1.8 Intangible assets 8Note 1.8.1 Recognition PFItransactions which meet the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 12 definition of a service concession, as interpreted in HM Treasury's Financial Reporting Manual (FReM) ,are accounted for as 'on- Statement of Financial Position' by the trust. In accordance with IAS 17, the underlying assets are recognised as property, plant and equipment, together with an equivalent finance lease liability. Subsequently, the assets are accounted for as property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets as appropriate. The annual contract payments are apportioned between the repayment of the liability, afinance cost, the charges for services and lifecycle replacement of components of the asset. The service charge isrecognised inoperating expenses and the finance cost ischarged tofinance costs inthe Statement of Comprehensive Income. Lifecycle replacement Components of the asset replaced by the operator during the contract ('lifecycle replacement') are capitalised where they meet the trust's criteria for capital expenditure. They are capitalised at the time they are provided by the operator and are measured initially at their fair value. The element of the annual unitary payment allocated tolifecycle replacement ispre-determined for each year of the contract from the operator's planned programme of lifecycle replacement. Where the lifecycle component isprovided earlier or later than expected, a short-term finance lease liability or prepayment is recognised respectively.Where the fairvalue of the lifecycle component is less than the amount determined inthe contract, the difference is recognised as an expense when the replacement isprovided. Ifthefairvalue isgreater than the amount determined in the contract, the difference istreated as a'free' asset and adeferred income balance isrecognised. The deferred income isreleased tothe operating income over the shorter of the remaining contract period or the useful economic life of the replacement component. Useful lives reflect the total lifeof an asset and not the remaining lifeof an asset. Therange of useful lives are shown in the table below: Finance-leased assets (including land) are depreciated over the shorter of the useful lifeor the lease term, unless the trust expects toacquire the asset at the end of the lease term in which case the assets are depreciated inthe same manner as owned assets above. Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 208Note 1.8.2 Measurement 8Note 1.8.3 Useful economic life of intangible assets Min life Max life Years Years Software licences 8 10 Software Software which is integral tothe operation of hardware, eg an operating system, iscapitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral tothe operation of hardware, eg application software, iscapitalised as an intangible asset.Purchased computer software licences are capitalised as intangible non- current assets where expenditure of at least \u00a35,000 isincurred and these are amortised over the shorter of the term of the licence and their useful lives. Intangible assets are recognised initially atcost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed tocreate, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and the value inuse where the asset isincome generating. Revaluations gains and losses and impairments are treated inthe same manner as for property, plant and equipment. Anintangible asset which is surplus with no plan tobring itback intouseisvalued at fairvalue under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 of IFRS 5.Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or \"fair value less costs to sell\". Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful lives in amanner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Useful lives reflect the total lifeof an asset and not the remaining lifeof an asset. Therange of useful lives are shown in the table below:Internally generated intangible assetsInternally generated goodwill, brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer listsandsimilar items are not capitalised as intangible assets. Expenditure on research is not capitalised.Expenditure on development is capitalised only where all of the following can be demonstrated: the project is technically feasible to the point of completion and will result in an intangible asset for sale or use the trust intends to complete the asset and sell or use it the trust has the ability to sell or use the assethow the intangible asset willgenerate probable future economic or service delivery benefits, eg, the presence of a market for it or its output, or where it is to be used for internal use, the usefulness of the asset;adequate financial, technical and other resources are available tothe trust tocomplete the development and sellor use the asset and the trust can measure reliably the expenses attributable to the asset during development. 219Note 1.9 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Due tothe high turnover of stocks within the Trust, current costs are used as a fair estimate of first in/ first out valuation. #Note 1.10 Cash and cash equivalents Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are investments that mature in 3months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. Inthe Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the Trust's cash management. Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorded at current values. #Note 1.11 Financial assets and financial liabilities #Note 1.11.1 Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities arise where the Trust is party tothe contractual provisions of afinancial instrument, and as aresult has alegal right toreceive or alegal obligation topaycash or another financial instrument. TheGAM expands the definition of acontract toinclude legislation and regulations which give rise toarrangements that in all other respects would be a financial instrument and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by ONS. This includes the purchase or sale of non-financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements and are recognised when, and tothe extent which, performance occurs, ie, when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. #Note 1.11.2 Classification and measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs except where the asset or liability is not measured at fair value through income and expenditure. Fair value is taken as the transaction price, or otherwise determined by reference to quoted market prices or valuation techniques. Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through finance leases are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases described below. Financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost. Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost are those held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and where cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes cash equivalents, contract and other receivables, trade and other payables, rights and obligations under lease arrangements and loans receivable and payable. After initial recognition, these financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment (for financial assets). The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability tothe gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. Interest revenue or expense is calculated by applying the effective interest rate tothe gross carrying amount of afinancial asset or amortised cost ofafinancial liability and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and afinancing income or expense. Inthecase of loans held from the Department of Health and Social Care, the effective interest rate is the nominal rate of interest charged on the loan. Impairment of financial assets For all financial assets measured at amortised cost including lease receivables, contract receivables and contract assets , the Trust recognises an allowance for expected credit losses. The Trust adopts the simplified approach toimpairment for contract and other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, measuring expected losses as at an amount equal tolifetime expected losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowance is initially measured at an amount equal to12-month expected credit losses (stage 1) and subsequently at an amount equal tolifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk assessed for the financial asset significantly increases (stage 2). For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Expected losses are charged tooperating expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduce the net carrying value of the financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position. #Note 1.11.3 Derecognition Financial assets are de-recognised when the contractual rights toreceive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. 22#Note 1.12 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially alltherisks and rewards of ownership are transferred tothe lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. #Note 1.12.1 The trust as lessee Finance leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of aleased asset are borne by the trust, the asset isrecorded as property, plant and equipment and acorresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised isthe lower of the fairvalue of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Theasset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset isaccounted for an item of property plant and equipment. The annual rental charge is split between the repayment of the liability andafinance cost so astoachieve aconstant rate of finance over the lifeof the lease. The annual finance cost ischarged toFinance Costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The lease liability, is de-recognised when the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Operating leases Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on astraight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognised initially asaliability and subsequently as areduction of rentals on astraight-line basis over the lease term. Leases of land and buildings Where alease isfor land and buildings, the land component isseparated from the building component and the classification for each is assessed separately. #Note 1.12.2 The trust as lessor Operating leasesRental income from operating leases isrecognised on astraight-line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred innegotiating and arranging an operating lease are added tothe carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. #Note 1.13 Provisions The Trust recognises aprovision where ithasapresent legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there willbeafuture outflow of cash or other resources; and areliable estimate can be made of the amount. Theamount recognised inthe Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money issignificant, the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using the discount rates published and mandated by HM Treasury. Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolution operates ariskpooling scheme under which the trust pays an annual contribution toNHS Resolution, which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolution isadministratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases, the legal liability remains withtheTrust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the trust is disclosed at note 27.2 but is not recognised in the Trust's accounts. Non Clinical Risk Pooling Thetrust participates inthe Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities toThird Parties Scheme. Both areriskpooling schemes under which the trust pays an annual contribution toNHS Resolution and inreturn receives assistance withthe costs ofclaims arising. Theannual membership contributions, and any \"excesses\" payable inrespect of particular claims are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises. 23#Note 1.14 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is,assets arising from past events whose existence willonly be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within theentity's control) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed innote 26 where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed innote 26, unless the probability of atransfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as:possible obligations arising from past events whose existence willbe confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; orpresent obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that atransfer of economic benefits will arise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. #Note 1.15 Public dividend capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is atype of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. HMTreasury has determined that PDC is notafinancial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. Atanytime, the Secretary of State canissue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the trust. PDC is recorded at the value received.Acharge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the trust, ispayable as public dividend capital dividend. Thecharge is calculated at the rate set by HMTreasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for (i) donated assets (including lottery funded assets), (ii)average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short-term working capital facility, and (iii) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. Inaccordance with the requirements laiddown by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year iscalculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out inthe \"pre-audit\" version of the annual accounts. Thedividend thus calculated isnot revised should any adjustment tonet assets occur as aresult the audit of the annual accounts. #Note 1.16 Value added tax Most of the activities of the trust are outside the scope of VAT and, ingeneral, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases isnot recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT ischarged tothe relevant expenditure category or included inthe capitalised purchase cost offixed assets. Where output tax ischarged or input VAT isrecoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. #Note 1.17 Corporation tax The Trust isaHealth Service Body within the meaning of s986 Corporation Taxes Act2010. Accordingly it isnotliable to corporation tax.The Trust is also exempt from tax on chargeable gains under s271(3) Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. There is,however, apower for HMTreasury tosubmit an order toParliament exemption inrelation toparticular activ ities of an NHS Act 2010). Accor dingly, theTrust ispotentially within the scope of corporation tax inrespect of activities tobe specified inthe order which are not related to, or ancillary to, the provision of healthcare, and where the profits therefrom exceed \u00a350,000 per annum. Until such an order is approved by Parliament, the Trust has no corporation tax liability. 24#Note 1.18 Foreign exchange The functional and presentational currency of the trust is sterling. Atransaction which is denominated inaforeign currency istranslated intothe functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Where the trust has assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at the Statement of Financial Position date: monetary items are translated at the spot exchange rate on 31 March non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction andnon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fairvalue are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined. Exchange gains or losses on monetary items (arising on settlement of the transaction or on re-translation at the Statement of Financial Position date) are recognised in income or expense in the period in which they arise.Exchange gains or losses on non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised inthe same manner as other gains and losses on these items. #Note 1.19 Third party assets Assets belonging tothird parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised inthe accounts since the trust has no beneficial interest inthem. However, they are disclosed inaseparate note tothe accounts inaccordance with the requirements of HM Treasury's FReM . #Note 1.20 Losses and special payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when itagreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. Bytheir nature they are items thatideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided intodifferent categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged tothe relevant functional headings inexpenditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had the trust not been bearing their own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure).However the losses and special payments note iscompiled directly from the losses and compensations register which reports on an accrual basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. #Note 1.21 Gifts Gifts areitems that are voluntarily donated, withno preconditions and without the expectation of any return. Gifts include alltransactions economically equivalent tofree and unremunerated transfers, such as the loan of an asset for its expected useful life, and the sale or lease of assets at below market value. #Note 1.22 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies The following are the judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below) that management has made in the process of applying the trust accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Value of land, buildings and dwellings \u00a3136.7 million (2017-18 \u00a3141.5million): This is the most significant estimate inthe accounts and isbased on the professional judgement of the Trust's independent valuer with extensive knowledge of the physical estate and market factors. Thevalue does not take intoaccount potential future changes inmarket value which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Note 1.7.2 gives details of the valuation methods used inthese accounts. Note 7 and Note 15 give details of Imapirment and Revaluation movements. #Note 1.23 Early adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations No new accounting standards or revisions to existing standards have been early adopted in 2018/19. #Note 1.24 Standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or adopted IFRS 16 came intoforce on the 1January 2019. However as per guidance from HMTreasury, NHS Providers are able to defer the implementation of thisstandard until 1January 2020. Noearly adoption is allowed and the requirements willbe applicable to the public sector for the 2020/21 financial year. 25Note 2 Operating Segments Operating segments arereported inamanner consistent with theinternal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who isresponsible forallocating resources and assessing performance of theoperating segments, has been identified as theboard that makes strategic decisions. TheTaunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust ismanaged by theBoard ofDirectors, which ismade up of both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Board isresponsible forstrategically and operationally leading thework ofthehospital. The Non-Executive Directors bring external expertise to the organisation and provide advice and guidance to the Executive Directors. The Executive Directors take care of the day to day running of the hospital. The Board is therefore considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) of the hospital. Themonthly financial information presented to the Board includes a trust level Statement of Comprehensive Income, a Statement of Financial Position, aStatement of Cash flows and other financial indicators such asthecontinuity of service riskrating. Forthemajority of theyear, thesegmental expenditure data way ofaseparate note which summarises thecontributions of thedirectorates, and separately identifies reserves and central budgets. Thedetail includes current period and year todate data, ineach case comparing actual data toplan. The commentary also includes theDirectorates' contribution totrust wide initiatives, such ascost improvement programmes. Other information reported to the Board is specifically analysed for its purpose, forexample trust pay spend against budget analysed by employee groups and income stream expectations by type (NHS Clinical, nonNHS etc)compared toactual achieved. Information such as delivery of thesavings plan isa trust wide position paper but detailed into the areas tasked with implementing savings. The Trust has used three key factors initsidentification of itsreportable operating segments. Thekeyfactors arethat the reportable operating segment: a) engages in activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses; b) reports financial results which areregularly reviewed by theTrust's board of directors tomake decisions about allocation of resources to the segment and to assess its performance; andc) has discrete financial information. The Trust's reportable segments and services provided are: Acute Medicine The services provided by this operating segment include A&E, Cardiology, Care oftheElderly, Endocrinology, Neurology, Rehabilitation, Respiratory and Stroke. Surgery and Critical Care Theservices provided by thisoperating segment include Gastroenterology, Upper and Lower GISurgery, Nephrology, Services, Pre-op Assessment, Surgical Admissions and Pain Services.

TheTrust's land, buildings and dwellings were revalued by GVA as at 31 March 2019 based on adesktop revue. Afull valuation was undertaken as at 1April 2016. The Trust's specialised buildings and associated land have been valued using the depreciated replacement cost method, based upon provision of amodern equivalent asset (MEA). A fundamental principle ofMEA valuations isthatahypothetical buyer would purchase the least expensive sitethatwould be suitable and appropriate for the existing operations. The valuation of the Trust's specialised land and buildings has therefore been based upon the Trust hypothetically being located on asuitable alternative siteaway from the town centre, where the cost of the land would besignificantly lower, but where the Trust would still be able tore-provide itsservices. Applying these MEA revaluations has resulted inanet overall decrease of \u00a35,391,000 inthe value of the Trust's estate. This decrease invalue of the Trust's estate isrecorded inproperty, plant and equipment. \u00a34,271,000 has been recognised as anet impairment charged tothe Statement of Comprehensive Income and the remaining \u00a31,120,000 has been recognised as an decrease to the revaluation reserve. 32Note 8 Employee benefits 2018/19 2017/18 Total Total \u00a3000 \u00a3000 and wages 156,949 147,461 Social security costs 15,353 13,394 Apprenticeship levy 757 704 Employer's contributions to NHS pensions 19,051 17,768 Pension cost - other - - Other post employment benefits - - Other employment benefits 7 - Termination benefits 23 96 Temporary staff (including agency) 10,538 8,793 Total gross staff costs 202,678 188,216 Recoveries in respect of seconded staff (487) (520) Total staff costs 202,191 187,696 Of which Costs capitalised as part of assets 1,915 1,525 Note 8.1 Retirements due to ill-health Note 8.2 Directors' Remuneration The aggregate amounts payable to directors were: 2018/19 2017/18 Total Total \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Salary 1,232 977 Employer's National Insurance contributions 153 128 Employer's pension contributions 152 127 Total 1,537 1,232 Benefits are accruing under the NHS defined benefit pension scheme to9of the Directors (2017/18: 9). Nobenefits are accruing under any money purchase schemes. There were no other advances or guarantees existing with any of the Directors as at 31 March 2019 (2017/18: Nil). During 2018/19 there were no early retirements from the trust agreed on the grounds of ill-health (1inthe year ended 31 March 2018). The estimated additional pension liabilities of these ill-health retirements is \u00a30k (\u00a340k in 2017/18). The cost of these ill-health retirements will be borne by the NHS Business Services Authority - Pensions Division. Further details of directors' remuneration can be found in the remuneration report. 33Note 9 Pension costs Thelatest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme wascompleted as at 31 March 2016. Theresults ofthisvaluation set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2019. TheDepartment of Health and Social Care have recently laid Scheme Regulations confirming that the employer contribution rate willincrease to20.6% of pensionable pay from this date. b) Full actuarial (funding) valuationPast and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GPpractices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State inEngland and Wales. They are not designed tobe run inaway thatwould enable NHS bodies toidentify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme isaccounted for as if it were adefined contribution scheme: the cost totheNHS body of participating ineach scheme istaken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. Inorder that the defined benefit obligations recognised inthe financial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by aformal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation Avaluation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period inconjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and isaccepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2019, isbased on valuation data as 31 March 2018, updated to31March 2019 with summary global member and accounting data. Inundertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed inIAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. Thelatest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme iscontained inthe report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. Thepurpose of thisvaluation istoassess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and torecommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers.

The Trust's specialised buildings and associated land have been valued using the depreciated replacement cost method, based upon provision ofamodern equivalent asset (MEA). Afundamental principle ofMEA valuations isthatahypothetical buyer would purchase the least expensive sitethatwould be suitable and appropriate fortheexisting operations. Thevaluation of the Trust's specialised land and buildings has therefore been based upon the Trust hypothetically being located on asuitable alternative siteaway from thetown centre, where the cost ofthe land would besignificantly lower, but where the Trust would be able tore-provide itsservices. Thevaluation wascarried outinaccordance withtheterms oftheRoyal Institute of valuation standard and in accordance with the revaluation model set out in IAS 16.

The Trust produces atwelve month rolling cash flow to manage liquidity risk. Where liquidity is identified as a risk theTrust hastheability toapply for distressed loan finance from theDepartment of Health and Social Care. The deficit delivered by theTrust inthe 2018/19 financial year required the drawdown of loans amounting to \u00a38,657,000.The Trust currently finances itscapital expenditure from funds made available from cash surpluses generated by the Trust's activities. The PFIproject relating to the Beacon Centre has created liabilities ontheStatement of Financial Position that theTrust iscommitted tomeeting for the duration of theservice concession. This liability is subject toan annual inflationary uplift. Similarly, theTrust iscommitted to the Energy Project which added aleasing liability to the Trust's SOFP in2011/12 and which increased in2012/13. The Trust iscommitted to the payment of thisleasing obligation for the duration of the12 year lease term. The Trust has also entered intoaradiology managed facility service foraperiod of 10 years and iscommitted tomeeting theliabilities created on thestatement of financial position for the duration of theagreement. Inaddition, theTrust completed thenew surgical ward development (the Jubilee Building) during 2013/14 and supported existing cash reserves tofund thisdevelopment by drawing against a\u00a312million loan facility from theFoundation Trust Financing Facility. Theapproval of major capital projects such astheJubilee Building aresubject tocomprehensive project development processes involving thecreation of separate project boards, continuous scrutiny by theTrust Board and also through theinvolvement of NHS partners including theTrust's principal CCG, NHS Improvement and the Area Team of NHS England. Financial reporting standard IFRS 7, dealing with financial instruments, requires disclosure of therole that financial instruments have had during theperiod increating or changing therisks theTrust faces inundertaking thecontinuing service provider relationship that theTrust haswithlocal Clinical Commissioning Groups and thewaythose Clinical Commissioning Groups arefinanced, theTrust isnot exposed to the degree of financial riskfaced by business entities. Also financial instruments play amuch more limited roleincreating or changing riskthan would be typical of listed companies, to which the financial reporting standard mainly applies. The Trust hastheability toborrow funds and toinvest surplus cash. Therisks resulting from transactions of thisnature aremitigated by theTrust's treasury and investment policies and protocols and by thereporting of performance against financial targets to the Foundation Trust regulator, NHS Improvement. The Trust isprincipally adomestic organisation withthegreat majority of transactions, assets and liabilities being inthe UKand sterling based. The Trust has no overseas operations. The Trust therefore has low exposure tocurrency rate fluctuations. The Trust hasthepower toborrow forcapital expenditure, subject toaffordability as confirmed by NHS Improvement, the independent regulator. Some ofthefinancial instruments have afixed interest ratewhich means theTrust may be exposed tointerest raterisk. If the interest rate moves interest paid could be higher than themarket rates, and/or interest received could be lower than themarket rates. Ofthefinancial assets and liabilities set out innotes 31.2 and 31.3, all aredenominated in sterling. Because themajority of theTrust's revenue comes from contracts with other public sector bodies, theTrust has low exposure tocredit risk. Other credit riskisprovided forbythecontinuous processes of reviewing debt management and ensuring that debts that are unlikely to be collected are appropriately impaired. Thevast majority of theTrust's cash balances areheld on deposit with theGovernment Banking Service, and as such the credit risk on these balances is considered to be negligible. The Trust's operating costs are incurred under contracts with Clinical Commissioning Groups and Specialist Commissioners, which arefinanced from resources voted annually by Parliament .The intr oduction of Payment by Results has created an inherent riskof performing below theplanned activity levels, thereby endangering income. The Trust has mitigated thisriskthrough riskshare arrangements within theSomerset Health Community. This arrangement covers the principal commissioner in respect of the majority of its services. 54Note 31.2 Carrying values of financial assets \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Trade and other receivables excluding non financial assets 14,883 - - 14,883 Cash and cash equivalents at bank and in hand 8,166 - - 8,166 Total at 31 March 2019 23,049 - - 23,049 Loans and receivables \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Trade and other receivables excluding non financial assets 11,476 - - - 11,476 Other investments / financial assets 103 - - - 103 Cash and cash equivalents at bank and in hand 4,905 - - - 4,905 Total at 31 March 2018 16,484 - - - 16,484 Note 31.3 Carrying value of financial liabilities \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Loans from the Department of Health and Social Care 21,891 - 21,891 Obligations under finance leases 3,999 - 3,999 Obligations under PFI, LIFT and other service concession contracts 12,885 - 12,885 Trade and other payables excluding non financial liabilities 34,485 - 34,485 Provisions 74,125 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Loans from the Department of Health and Social Care 13,176 - 13,176 Obligations under finance leases 4,459 - 4,459 Obligations under PFI, LIFT and other service concession contracts 11,201 - 11,201 Trade and other payables excluding non financial liabilities 25,160 - 25,160 Provisions under contract 946 - 946 54,942 - 54,942 Note 31.4 Maturity of financial liabilities restrospectively from 1 April 2018 without restatement of comparatives.

The standard isapplied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to reserves on 1 April 2018. IFRS 9replaces IAS39 and introduces arevised approach toclassification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, a new forward-looking 'expected loss' impairment model and a revised approach to hedge accounting. Under IFRS 9, borrowings from the Department of Health and Social Care, which were previously held at historic cost, are measured on an amortised cost basis. Consequently, on 1April 2018 borrowings increased by \u00a370k, and trade payables correspondingly reduced. Reassessment of allowances for credit losses under the expected loss model resulted ina\u00a30k decrease inthe carrying value of receivables. TheGAM expands the definition of acontract inthe context of financial instruments toinclude legislation and regulations, except where thisgives risetoatax.Implementation of thisadaptation on 1April 2018 has ledtotheclassifiction of receivables relating toInjury Cost Recovery as afinancial asset measured at amortised cost. Thecarrying value of these receivables at 1 April 2018 was \u00a30k. Note 33.2 Initial application of IFRS 15 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts withCustomers as interpreted and adapted by the GAM has been applied by the Trust from 1April 2018. Thestandard isapplied retrospectively withthe cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to the income and expenditure reserve on 1 April 2018. IFRS 15 introduces anew model for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers replacing the previous standards IAS11,IAS18 and related Interpretations. Thecore principle ofIFRS 15isthat an entity recognises revenue when it satisfies performance obligations through the transfer of promised goods or services tocustomers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Asdirected by the GAM, theTrust has applied the practical expedient offered in C7A of the standard removing the need to retrospectively restate any contract modifications that occurred before the date of implementation (1 April 2018). There was no overall impact on Statement of Comprehensive Income or Statement of Financial Position. 57Note 34 148 392 337 446 NHS England 7,667 4,144 0 496 Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust 1,772 467 1,470 485 NHS NEW Devon CCG 0 179 266 15 Charitable Funds 37 140 8 5 Other Related Parties (NHS and Government) 1,696 2,120 8,550 8,038 South West Pathology Services LLP 0 15 0 0 SPS Facilities Limited 15 15 0 0 Intergrated Pathology Partnerships Limited 64 0 0 1,262 NHS England 66,099 0 Charitable Funds 1,629 761 0 0 Other Related Parties (NHS and Government) 27,852 23,340 50,427 47,910 South West Pathology Services LLP 185 6,343 SPS Facilities Limited 185 185 6,303 5,525 Intergrated 316,987 299,492 67,651 65,070 Note 35 Events after the reporting dateTransactions between the Trust and its related parties are reviewed each year and declared below.
