If the Subscriber provides us this documentation in the specified time period and we do not make a determination about eligibility before the termination date, coverage will continue until we make a determinati on. If we determine that the Dependent does not meet the eligibility requirements as a disabled dependent, we will notify the Subscriber that the Dependent is not eligible and let the Subscriber know the membership termination date. If we determine that th e Dependent is eligible as a disabled dependent, there will be no lapse in coverage. Also, starting two years after the date that the Dependent reached the age limit, the Subscriber must provide us documentation of the Dependent's incapacity and dependency annually within 60 days after we request it so that we can determine if the Dependent continues to be eligible as a disabled dependent If the child is not a Member because you are changing coverage, you must give us proof, within 60 days after we request it, of the child's incapacity and dependency as well as proof of the child's coverage under your prior coverage. In the future, you must provide proof of the child's continued incapacity and dependency within 60 days after you receive our request, but not more frequently than annually If the Subscriber is enrolled under a Kaiser Permanente Medicare plan .

When Medicare is primary . Your Group's Premiums may increase if you are (or become) eligible for Medicare Part A or B as primary coverage, and you are not enrolled through your Group in Kaiser Permanente Senior Advan tage for any reason (even if you are not eligible to enroll or the plan is not available to you). When Medicare is secondary . Medicare is the primary coverage except when federal law requires that your Group's health care coverage be primary and Medicare coverage be secondary. Members who have Medicare when Medicare is secondary by law are subject to the same Premiums and receive the same benefits as Members who are under age 65 and do not have Medicare. In addition, any such Member for whom Medicare is se condary by law and who meets the eligibility requirements for the Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage plan applicable when Medicare is secondary may also enroll in that plan if it is available. These Members receive the benefits and coverage described in this EOC and the Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage evidence of coverage applicable when Medicare is secondary.

Prior authorization is a UM process that determines whether the requested services are Medically Necessary before care is provided.

Additional information about prior authorization for durable medical equi pment and ostomy and urological supplies . The prior authorization process for durable medical equipment and ostomy and urological supplies includes the use of formulary guidelines. These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary clinical and operat ional work group with review and input from Plan Physicians and medical professionals with clinical expertise. The formulary guidelines are periodically updated to keep pace with changes in medical technology and clinical practice. If your Plan Physician p rescribes one of these items, he or she will submit a written referral in accord with the UM process described in this \"Medical Group authorization procedure for certain referrals\" section. If the formulary guidelines do not specify that the prescribed ite m is appropriate for your medical condition, the referral will be submitted to the Medical Group's designee Plan Physician, who will make an authorization decision as described under \"Medical Group's decision time frames\" in this \"Medical Group authorizati on procedure for certain referrals\" section.

If the Medical Group needs more time to make the decision because it doesn't have information reasonably necessary to make the decision, or because it has requested consultation by a particular specialist, you and your treating physician will be informed about the additional information, testing, or specialist that is needed, and the date that the Medical Group expects to make a decision. Your treating physician will be informed of the decision within 24 hours after the decision is made. If the Services are authorized, your physician will be informed of the scope of the authorized Services. If the Medical Group does not authorize all of the Services, Health Plan will send you a written decision and explanation within two business days after the decision is made. Any written criteria that the Medical Group uses to make the decision to authorize, modify, delay, or deny the request for authorization will be made available to you upon request.

For example, your Cost Share may be a Copayment or Coinsurance. If your coverage includes a Plan Deductible and yo u receive Services that are subject to the Plan Deductible, your Cost Share for those Services will be Charges until you reach the Plan Deductible. Similarly, if your coverage includes a Drug Deductible, and you receive Services that are subject to the Dru g Deductible, your Cost Share for those Services will be Charges until you reach the Drug Deductible.

During the 31 days of automatic coverage for newborn children described under \"Newborn coverage\" under \"Who Is Eligible\" in the \"Premiums, Eligibility, and Enrollment\" section, the parent or guardian of the newborn must pay the Cost Share indicated in the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC for any Services that the newborn receives, whether or not the newborn is enrolled. When the \"Cost S hare Summary\" indicates the Services are subject to the Plan Deductible, the Cost Share for those Services will be Charges if the newborn has not met the Plan Deductible. Payment toward your Cost Share (and when you may be billed) . In most cases, your pro vider will ask you to make a payment toward your Cost Share at the time you receive Services. If you receive more than one type of Services (such as a routine physical maintenance exam and laboratory tests), you may be required to pay separate Cost Share f or each of those Services. Keep in mind that your payment toward your Cost Share may cover only a portion of your total Cost Share for the Services you receive, and you will be billed for any additional amounts that are due. The following are examples of w hen you may be asked to pay (or you may be billed for) Cost Share amounts in addition to the amount you pay at check -in: You receive non -preventive Services during a preventive visit. For example, you go in for a routine physical maintenance exam, and at c heck -in you pay your Cost Share for the preventive exam (your Cost Share may be \"no charge\"). However, during your preventive exam your provider finds a problem with your health and orders non -preventive Services to diagnose your problem (such as laborator y tests). You may be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for these additional non -preventive diagnostic Services You receive diagnostic Services during a treatment visit. For example, you go in for treatment of an existing health condi tion, and at check -in you pay your Cost Share for a treatment visit. However, during the visit your provider finds a new problem with your health and performs or orders diagnostic Services (such as laboratory tests). You may be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for these additional diagnostic Services You receive treatment Services during a diagnostic visit. For example, you go in for a diagnostic exam, and at check -in you pay your Cost Share for a diagnostic exam. However, during the diagnostic exam your provider confirms a problem with your health and performs treatment Services (such as an outpatient procedure). You may be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for these additional treatment Services You receive Se rvices from a second provider during your visit. For example, you go in for a diagnostic exam, and at check -in you pay your Cost Share for a diagnostic exam. However, during the diagnostic exam your provider requests a consultation with a specialist. You m ay be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for the consultation with the specialist In some cases, your provider will not ask you to make a payment at the time you receive Services, and you will be billed for your Cost Share (for exampl e, some Laboratory Departments are not able to collect Cost Share, or your Plan Provider is not able to collect Cost Share, if any, for Telehealth Visits you receive at home). When we send you a bill, it will list Charges for the Services you received, pay ments and credits applied to your account, and any amounts you still owe. Your current bill may not always reflect your most recent Charges and payments. Any Charges and payments that are not on the current bill will appear on a future bill. Sometimes, you may see a payment but not the related Charges for Services. That could be because your payment was recorded before the Charges for the Services were processed. If so, the Charges will appear on a future bill. Also, you may receive more than one bill for a single outpatient visit or inpatient stay. For example, you may receive a bill for physician services and a separate bill for hospital services. If you don't see all the Charges for Services on one bill, they will appear on a future bill. If we determine that you overpaid and are due a refund, then we will send a refund to you within 4 weeks after we make that determination. If you have questions about a bill, please call the phone number on the bill. In some cases, a Non -Plan Provider may be involved in the provision of covered Services at a Plan Facility or a contracted facility where we have authorized you to receive care. You are not responsible for any amounts beyond your Cost Share for the covered Services you receive at Plan Facilities or at contract ed facilities where we have authorized you to receive care. However, if the provider does not agree to bill us, you may have to pay for the Services and file a claim for reimbursement.

If you receive Services from one of these specialists, the Cost Share for a Physician Specialist Visit will apply to all consultations, evaluations, and treatment provided by the specialist except for routine preventive counseling and exams listed under \"Preventi ve Services\" in this \"Benefits\" section. For example, if your personal Plan Physician is a specialist in internal medicine or obstetrics/gynecology who is not a Primary Care Physician, you will pay the Cost Share for a Physician Specialist Visit for all co nsultations, evaluations, and treatment by the specialist except routine preventive counseling and exams listed under \"Preventive Services\" in this \"Benefits\" section.

We will count all Ser vices you receive during the benefit limit period toward the benefit limit, including Services you received under a prior Health Plan EOC (as long as you have continuous coverage with Health Plan). Note: this rule does not apply when you first enroll in in dividual plan coverage or a new employer group's plan, when you move from group to individual plan coverage (or vice versa), or to Services you received under a Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage evidence of coverage.

The Demand for Arbitration shall include the basis of the claim against the Respondents; the amount of damages the Claimants seek in the arbitration; the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the Claimants and their attorney, if any; and the names of all Respondents.

Legal Department 393 E. Walnut St. Pasadena, CA 91188 Service on that Respondent shall be deemed completed when received. All other Respondents, including individuals, must be served as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure for a civil action. Filing fee The Claimants shall pay a single, nonrefundable filing fee of $150 per arbitration payable to \"Arbitration Account\" regardless of the number of claims asserted in the Demand for Arbitration or the number of Claimants or Respondents named in the Demand for Arbitration. Any Claimant who claims extreme hardship may request that the Office of the Independent Administrator waive the filing fee and the neutral arbitrator's fees and expenses. A Claimant who seeks such waivers shall complete the Fee Waiver Form and submit it to the Office of the Independent Administrator and simultaneously serve it upon the Respondents. The Fee Waiver Form sets forth the criteria for waiving fees and is available by calling our Member Service Contact Center. Number of arbitrators The number of arbitrators may affect the Claimants' responsi bility for paying the neutral arbitrator's fees and expenses (see the Rules of Procedure). If the Demand for Arbitration seeks total damages of $200,000 or less, the dispute shall be heard and determined by one neutral arbitrator, unless the parties otherw ise agree in writing after a dispute has arisen and a request for binding arbitration has been submitted that the arbitration shall be heard by two party arbitrators and one neutral arbitrator. The neutral arbitrator shall not have authority to award monet ary damages that are greater than $200,000. If the Demand for Arbitration seeks total damages of more than $200,000, the dispute shall be heard and determined by one neutral arbitrator and two party arbitrators, one jointly appointed by all Claimants and one jointly appointed by all Respondents. Parties who are entitled to select a party arbitrator may agree to waive this right. If all parties agree, these arbitrations will be heard by a single neutral arbitrator. Payment of arbitrators' fees and expenses Health Plan will pay the fees and expenses of the neutral arbitrator under certain conditions as set forth in the Rules of Procedure. In all other arbitrations, the fees and expenses of the neutral arbitrator shall be paid one -half by the Claimants and one -half by the Respondents.

Costs Except for the aforementioned fees and expenses of the neutral arbitrator, and except as otherwise mandated by laws that apply to arbitrations under this \"Binding Arbitration\" section, each party shall bear the party's own attorneys' fees, witness fees, and other expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending against a claim regardless of the nature of the claim or outcome of the arbitration. General provisions A claim shall be waived and forever barred if (1) on the date the Demand for Arbitration of the claim is served, the claim, if asserted in a civil action, would be barred as to the Respondent served by the applicable statute of limitations, (2) Claimants fail to pursue the arbitration claim in accord with the Rules of Procedure with reasonable dilig ence, or (3) the arbitration hearing is not commenced within five years after the earlier of (a) the date the Demand for Arbitration was served in accord with the procedures prescribed herein, or (b) the date of filing of a civil action based upon the same incident, transaction, or related circumstances involved in the claim. A claim may be dismissed on other grounds by the neutral arbitrator based on a showing of a good cause. If a party fails to attend the arbitration hearing after being given due notice thereof, the neutral arbitrator may proceed to determine the controversy in the party's absence.
