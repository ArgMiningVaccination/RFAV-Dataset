Thanks to the state-of-the-art facilities and excellent talent pool offering affordable world-class medical support to foreign patients. Availability of combo facilities of traditional Ayurvedic therapies and advanced medical treatments has created a special attraction for foreigners, creating a new dimension for Indian medical tourism. The AYUSH ministry endorsing traditional medicine and opening AYUSH wellness centers has further strengthened the base of Ayurvedic medical tourism in the country. Ayurveda - Medicine that heals everything: Ayurveda is composed of two Sanskrit words - Ayu meaning life and Veda meaning knowledge. It is a science that helps you build knowledge of your body and life. It teaches you to have a deep understanding of the harmful and beneficial aspects of a lifestyle, happy and sad conditions of life and causes for ailments. Ayurveda with a holistic approach aims to restore the health and wellness of mind and body, essential to lead a satisfying life. It gives equal importance to prevention and therapy. The global population is plagued with countless mental and physical disorders like stress, anxiety, depression, inflammation, chronic fatigue, sleeplessness, obesity, nervous disorders, ulcers, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular issues. Ayurveda is known to successfully prevent and treat all of these sourcing ingredients from nature and plants. The treatments are non-invasive and non-toxic, free from side-effects. These are also effective in enhancing beauty and slowing down aging. How Ayurveda attracts foreigners? The stress-torn global population is turning to natural ways for disease prevention and healing. This is perhaps the prime reason behind the rise in Ayurvedic medical tourism in India. Apart from following ancient medical texts, Ayurveda has evolved over the years by integrating yoga and other traditional practices. Proven efficacy of the treatments increased its international acceptance, gradually broadening the scope of Ayurvedic medical tourism in this country. The global fad for relaxation therapies and anti-aging treatments has further made Ayurveda more popular to foreign travelers. Cosmetic surgery and western medicine are costlier than natural treatments and the latter assures more safety. So, foreigners found a great way to enjoy a vacation in India along with taking some detoxification and massage therapies to enhance beauty and wellness. Ayurveda offered a different concept of beauty that runs skin deep. It taught that mind should be well-coordinated with the body to bring out the glowing appearance. The reasons behind the growing interest of Ayurveda among foreigners can be summarized as follows: - Taking a holistic approach - Taking care of the individual constituents, that is, the person's nature (Prakruti) in planning the treatment and diet. - Incorporating the importance of harmony in lifestyle with the environment, climate and customs. - Using natural ingredients as medicine since our body is naturally disposed to it. - Inducing deep spiritual thinking, creating a respectful attitude towards surroundings and ecology. Growing demand for Ayurvedic treatment in Indian medical tourism: There has also been a shift towards treatment preferences for medical tourists in India. Previously, when it was purposed solely for medical treatments, a growing number of patients are also looking for combination treatments. Indian medical tourism is taking a different approach given the shifting preferences. Hospitals, instead of resorting just to conventional medical treatments, are keeping Ayurvedic treatment options open as well. They are forming tie-ups with accredited Ayurveda centers and practitioners. Certified medical experts on board are guiding foreigners to the right treatments along with resolving their queries. Today, many foreign patients are well-informed of Ayurvedic practices and their efficacy. Therefore, it may be in a post-surgery recuperation phase these foreign patients are more likely to go for Ayurvedic treatments for overall physical and mental wellbeing. Research in Ayurveda is growing and so is the demand for treatments. Travelers seeking alternative therapies in India have shot up dramatically. A recent data states over 90,000 travelers visited India for wellness and natural treatments. The ground is favorable for Ayurvedic medical and wellness tourism in India. Does a global market exist for Ayurvedic medical tourism? Ayurveda has attracted travelers mainly from developed nations. A large fraction of these travelers come from Germany. Ayurveda is also popular in the UK, France, Italy and Spain. Few countries of the GCC region like Saudi Arabia and UAE are also showing interest in Ayurveda. The demand is there in the CIS countries as well. With strategic marketing, Asia-Pacific, Australia and New Zealand will soon emerge as new markets. The good news is the number of tourists visiting India for Ayurveda is growing by almost 20-25%. A majority of the tourists fall into the 40-60 age group and are highly satisfied with the quality of services offered. Ayurvedic medical tourism destinations in India: Kerala takes the lead It is Ayurveda that has made Kerala the key global medical tourism destination. Truly, this South Indian state is famed as the God's own country, where spiritual touch matters in Ayurvedic healing.

Other celebrity visitors also spoke highly of Kerala's ayurvedic resorts, expressing deep satisfaction and gratitude for the services.
