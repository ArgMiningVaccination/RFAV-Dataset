These aren't always easy to find, so I've rounded up some links to commercially available antiseptic mouth rinses and nasal sprays PLUS instructions for how to dilute widely available 10% providone iodine to make a DIY Nasal Spray or Antiseptic Mouth Rinse. These treatments aren't without side effects; so, I cover those as well as alternative choices. Commercially Available Antiseptic Mouth Rinses Mouth rinses with cetylpiridinum chloride Cetylpiridinum chloride side effects: these mouth rinses often have a high percentage of alcohol that can lead to dry mucous membranes in the mouth. Brands include: Crest Pro-Health, Scope, Cepacol, Colgate Plax, Act Advanced Care, Balance, Breath Rx, Perio-Aid, Halita. Mouth rinses with chlorhexidine These are usually only available with a prescription. Chlorhexidine side effects: staining of teeth and tongue, altered sense of taste, and increased tartar formation. These mouth rinses often have a high percentage of alcohol which can lead to dry mucous membranes in 1% Iodine solution To a 1% iodine solution from the widely available 10% iodine solution, you simply dilute it by a factor of 10. That means, if you are putting your mouth rinse in a 250 mL bottle, you add 25 mL of 10% iodine and then fill it the rest of the way with sterile water (you can purchase sterile water from the drugstore or boil/cool tap water). See section below for side effects. Listerine with essential oils Side effects: These mouth rinses often have a high percentage of alcohol which can lead to dry mucous membranes in the mouth. Commercially Available Antiseptic Nasal Sprays 1% Iodine nasal spray To make a 1% iodine solution from the widely available 10% iodine solution, you simply dilute it by a factor of 10. That means, if you are putting your nasal spray in a 30 mL bottle, you add 3 mL of 10% iodine and then fill it the rest of the way with sterile water (you can purchase sterile water from the drugstore or boil/cool tap water). Brand: [Viraldine](https://viraldine.com/) Xylitol nasal moisturizing. Xylitol nasal sprays haven't been evaluated as COVID-19 treatments, but preliminary evidence shows that xylitol may be effective against the virus. Brand: [Xlear](https://xlear.com/) Saline Nasal Rinse Saline nasal rinses are a mainstay of naturopathic prevention and treatment for upper respiratory infections. Because of its efficacy with other upper respiratory tract infections, researchers have theorized that this could be an effective tool to add to your [treatment or prevention regime](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32395245/) and a small study using [saline nasal rinse for COVID-19](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00228-021-03102-3) showed promising results. To create a DIY saline solution, add \u00bd tsp salt and \u00bd tsp of baking soda to 1 cup of warm sterile water. Brand: Neti Pot, Hydrasense, NeilMed Safety Considerations For Iodine Solutions Iodine isn't advised for anyone with an iodine allergy or those undergoing radioiodine treatment. Iodine is often a part of an integrative thyroid treatment plan and has the potential to be very healing. In some people, however, iodine can disrupt thyroid function. Your doctor can help you decide if iodine is a good choice for you. Concentrations of 5% and 10% iodine solution should not be used and have been found to be harmful. Frontline Doctors recommend using iodine treatments for 5 days maximum if pregnant. Safety Considerations For Children It's my opinion that iodine solutions should be avoided in children unless advised by your doctor. Using a xylitol nasal spray or saline nasal rinse instead will help with congestion and discomfort and may help fight the virus as well. It's important that children who may potentially swallow mouth rinses not be given mouth rinses. Conclusions Antiseptic mouth rinses and nasal sprays are in most cases a safe addition to prevention and treatment plans for upper respiratory tract infections, however there are some side effects to be aware of. Harsher treatments aren't always better, and even something as simple as a saline nasal spray can be beneficial in treating and the risk of nosocomial and community transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic?
