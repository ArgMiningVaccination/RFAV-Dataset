As a young adult, Linda was attracted to the study of Rudolph Steiner's Anthroposophy (wisdom of man) and eventually became a teacher of Eurythmy, a healing movement art, in which she could further explore her lifelong love of color and sound. A gifted textile artist, Linda has spent a major portion of her life on this spiritual path of Anthroposophy, art, and love of nature. Experiencing a health crisis about a decade ago, Linda started working with alternative therapies, and through her attunement with her inner being's guidance, received vivid pictures as to the causal forces underlying her imbalances. These intuitive insights led to a profound healing on the level of body, mind, and soul, which has continued to the present day. Her adoption of Ayurveda as a way of life was a natural outcome of her life experiences, discovering that Ayurveda, Anthroposophy, Eurythmy and art are all doorways leading to the healing forces of nature that lie deep within us, connecting us to the dynamic interplay of the elements. The chemicals and preservatives used in most skin care products today are perceived by the body as unnatural, a toxin to be eliminated. We benefit most from natural, high-quality substances which deeply nourish the body with their powerful life force. Linda guarantees to her clients that only these natural substances will be applied and that the body's integrity and intelligence will be honored in a loving and caring manner in the spirit of true service. Only those products deemed most appropriate to the individual client's needs shall be used, in a relaxing, mentally and physically rejuvenating experience. Linda received her training in Himalayan Abhyanga, Ayurvedic Face Rejuvenation and Shirodhara with Diamond Way Ayurveda in San Luis Obispo and her massage certification at the Healing Arts Institute of Citrus Heights.
