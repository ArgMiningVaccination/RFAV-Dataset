ShK-186,a selective inhibitor of Kv1.3 channels, amelioratesautoimmune diseases in rodent models, and humanphase 1 trials of this agent in healthy volunteers havebeen completed. In this study, we identied and char-acterized a large family of Stichodactyla helianthus toxin (ShK)-related peptides in parasitic worms. Based onphylogenetic worm peptides were AcK1, a from the larialworm Brugia malayi. These peptides in solution adopt helical structures closely resembling that of ShK. Atdoses in the nanomolar-micromolar range, they blocknative Kv1.3 in human T cells and cloned Kv1.3 stably expressed in L929 mouse broblasts. They preferen-tially suppress the proliferation of rat CCR7 /H11546effector memory T cells without affecting naive and centralmemory subsets and inhibit the delayed-type hypersen-sitivity (DTH) response caused by skin-homing effectormemory T cells in rats. Further, they suppress IFN /H9253 production by human T lymphocytes. ShK-related pep-tides in parasitic worms may contribute to the potentialbenecial effects of probiotic parasitic worm therapy inhuman autoimmune diseases.\u2014Chhabra, S., Chang,S. C., Nguyen, H.

E-mail: gchandy@uci.edu; R.S.N., Medicinal Chemistry, E-mail: -gated potassium (Kv) 1.3 channel reg- ulates the membrane potential of T cells and provides the counterbalancing K/H11001efflux that promotes and sustains Ca2/H11001signaling during the activation response (1). Its important role in effector memory T (TEM) cells (CD4/H11001or CD8/H11001T cells that are CCR7/H11002CD45RA/H11002) has made Kv1.3 an attractive therapeutic target for immu-nomodulation (1-6). In multiple sclerosis(MS), T EMcells, and selective Kv1.3 inhibitors suppress the proliferation and cytokine pro-duction of these cells; other T-cell subsets are notaffected because they use the calcium-activated channelKCa3.1 to regulate membrane potential and calciumsignaling (1, 3, 4, 6, 7). Kv1.3 blockers are effective models diet-induced obesity, asthma, inflammatorybone resorption in experimental periodontal disease(1-3, 8-15). Several Kv1.3 inhibitors are under development as therapeutics. The most advanced is ShK-186, a syntheticanalogue pore-vestibule region ofKv1.3 (1, 4, 16-19). ShK-186 is the subject of an openInvestigational New Drug (IND) application in theUnited States and human phase 1A and 1B trials of thisagent were recently completed in healthy volunteers. The Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) (available at http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) predicts the existence of a large superfamily of 668proteins that contain 1315 domains resembling ShK(referred to as ShKT domains and peptides). ShKTsexist in both the plant and animal kingdoms, suggest-ing an ancient origin (20). The structures of 6 ShKTshave been determined, all of which have been reportedto modulate ion channels (see the SMART database).The largest family of ShKTs is found in worms, with 276 of 668 proteins in the SMART database coming fromworms 200,000-year history, humans have carried parasitic worms in their bodies, some harmlessand others causing disease (21, 22). Indeed, worminfections are among the most common afflictions ofpeople living in poverty in the developing world, where they contribute to the healthcare burden of malnutrition,anemia, allergies, seizures, colitis, and growth retardation.Currently, approximately 876 million children annuallyrequire regular deworming to protect them from thesedebilitating diseases (23). In the developed world, worminfestations have greatly decreased, and it has been sug- gested that this reduction has contributed to the in- creased incidence of autoimmune diseases (21, 24, 25).In 2005, probiotic therapy with the nematode Trichuris suis was reported to have improved symptoms in pa- tients with inflammatory bowel disease (24, 25). Subse-quent studies conrmed the benecial effects of probi-otic worm therapy in humans and animal models ofinflammatory bowel disease and MS, and human trialswith probiotic worm therapy are now under way (21-52). The worm-dependent protective effect in autoim-mune diseases is associated with increases in regulatoryT cells, direct suppression of proinflammatory cyto-kines, and the induction of T H2-type immune re - sponses that indirectly counteract proinflammatory re-sponses (27, 28, 36, 37, 39, 41, 48). It has also beensuggested that worm infections alter the host micro-biome (53, 54). Since Kv1.3 blockers have immunomodulatory ef- fects similar to those ascribed to worm infections (1),we investigated whether worm ShKTs share structuralsimilarity to ShK, block Kv1.3, and exhibit immuno-modulatory activity. In this report, we describe a largefamily of parasitic worm ShKTs. We determined thestructure of 2 of these ShKTs and demonstrated thatthey block Kv1.3 channels, selectively suppress thefunction of T EMcells in vitro, and inhibit DTH. It is therefore plausible that ShK-like worm peptides areamong the active agents that contribute to the protec-tive effect of parasitic worms in autoimmune diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Identication of ShK-like worm sequences and phylogenetic analysis To identify secreted hookworm proteins that might be in- jected into the host and mediate host-parasite interactions,we dissected the anterior secretory glands of the parasitichookworm Ancylostoma caninum and created a full-length SMART cDNA library. Two thousand clones chosen randomlywere sequenced by using Sanger-based cycle sequencing, anda customized bioinformatic was used to clean, clus-ter, and annotate the sequences. The most abundant tran-script encoding a secreted with at least 1 ShK-likedomain, Ancylostoma caninum K1 (AcK1), was used to search in databases, which resulted in our identifying 53related protein sequences from diverse parasitic worms thatinfect humans, cattle, dogs, goats, sheep, and rodents. Sup-plemental Fig. S1 shows a manually produced alignment ofthese protein sequences. Most are secreted peptides, whereasothers (indicated by asterisks) represent domains withinlarger worm proteins. We subjected this alignment to parsi-mony analysis with the Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony(PAUP*) 4.0b101 program (55). One thousand replicates ofheuristic searches with random sequence addition yielded afamily of the shortest trees of 386 sequences in length, andthe tree shown in Fig. 1A is the majority-rule consensus tree of this group. 2 Vol. 28 September 2014 CHHABRA ET AL.

A) Phylogenetic tree of peptides and protein domains from nematodes, trematodes, and cestodes and their relationship to sea anemone toxins. This is a majority-rule consensus tree from the family of shortest trees found by extensive parsimony searching using the computer program PAUP*, v4.0b10 (55). Sequences thatrepresent domains within larger proteins are asterisks. Aligned sequences of peptide sequence of AcK1 from dog-infecting A. caninum is identical with that of from A. BmK2 and AcK1t are analogues BmK1 and AcK1, which we designed and synthesized. BMK2 was generated based on the structures of AcK1 and BmK1, and our knowledge of the ShKchannel interaction surface; it differs from BmK1 at just 5 residues and is C-terminally amidated. AcK1t is a truncated versionof AcK1 that lacks the rst 9 residues. The alignments were produced manually and cover only the region spanning the 6cysteines contained within this domain. The conserved cysteines are highlighted in gray, the critical pore-protruding K/Rresidue is highlighted in magenta and the neighboring aromatic residue present in many Kv channel-blocking peptides ishighlighted in green. Other conserved residues are highlighted in yellow. 3 IMMUNOMODULATORY PEPTIDES FROM PARASITIC WORMSPeptide synthesis, folding, and purication Peptides were synthesized on a Prelude synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ, USA). Each peptide was assem-bled on Rink-mBHA resin (Peptides International, Louisville,KY, USA), by using Fmoc-tBu chemistry with 6-Cl-HOBTdiisopropyl carbodiimide activation of each amino acid deriv-ative. Following removal of the nal Fmoc protecting group,the peptides were cleaved and simultaneously deprotectedwith reagent K for 2 h. The peptide was isolated from thespent resin by ltration over a Buchner funnel. The crudeproduct was precipitated in ice-cold diethyl ether, dissolved in50% acetic acid (AcOH) in H 2O, and diluted in water containing 5% methyl alcohol and 1 mM glutathione (amixture of reduced and oxidized). In the case of AcK1,solubilization required neat trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to fullydissolve the product. Solubilization in 50% AcOH resulted ina viscous hydrogel. The pH was adjusted to 8.0 with NH 4OH, and the peptides were allowed to fold oxidatively for 48 h.Each product was subsequently puried by preparative RP-HPLC S2), and and lyophilized. Peptide identity was conrmed by ESI-MS and was consistent with theory forformation of 3 disulde bonds for each peptide. Expression and purication of AcK1 The synthesized oligonucleotide sequence of mature AcK1 was purchased from GeneArt (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,CA, USA) and subsequently cloned into pET-32a plasmid(EMD4Biosciences-Novagen, Billerica, MA, USA). The trans-formed BL21 (DE3) cells were grown at 37\u00b0C until the OD 600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl /H9252-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a nal optimized concentration of 1 mM, andexpression was carried out at 28\u00b0C for 6 h. For isotopiclabeling, the cells were grown in minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and13C-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Labs, Andover, MA, USA) and expressed at 20\u00b0C for 12 h. The cultures werecentrifuged at 5000 gat 4\u00b0C for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellets were stored at /H1100280\u00b0C until purication. F o ra1Lculture, a cell in BugBuster (EMD4Biosciences-Novagen) (5 ml/g of cell pel-let) at room temperature for 1 h, with the addition ofEDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics,Indianapolis, IN, USA). The lysate centrifuged at 20,000gfor 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel Sepharose column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh,PA, USA) and washed with buffer [20 mM Na 2HPO4(pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole] for removal of anynonspecic binding. The fusion protein was then eluted withelution buffer [20 mM Na 2HPO4(pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole]. The fraction containing fusion proteinwas dialyzed extensively in dialysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH8.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA] over 24 h. Final yields offusion protein from 1 L varied from 60 to 80 mg. Tobaccoetch virus (150 /H9262g TEV) protease was added to cleave the fusion protein at room temperature for 20 h. The cleavedprotein was then loaded onto 10 Eluted fractions containing AcK1 were lyophi-lized for Peptide determinedusing the assay (Pierce, Rockford,IL, USA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The BCAassay was calibrated against peptide content by amino acid analysis (The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and MentalHealth, Parkville, VIC, Australia). Peptide and masswere determined by and LC-MS, respec-tively. Nuclear magnetic (NMR) spectroscopy AcK1 Samples of 1 mM 15N,13C-labeled AcK1 were in 10 mM Na2HPO4in either 100%2H2O or 90%/10% H2O/2H2O at pH 5.4. Experiments were performed at 25\u00b0C on Avance 500, 600, and 800 spectrometers (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA,USA), each equipped with a cryoprobe and z-axis gradient. AcK1 gave good-quality spectra 1H and 2-dimensional (2D)1H-15N HSQC spectra in Supplemental Fig. S3 A,B,E. Backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained with the HNCO, HNCA, and recorded at 800 MHz, with a mixing time of 150 ms. A2D-NOESY spectrum was also recorded at 600 MHz, with amixing time of 150 ms and used in addition to the 3D NOESYexperiments for nal structure calculations. NMR spectrawere processed using 3.2; 2H2O or 90%/10% H2O/2H2O buffered with 10 mM Na2HPO4(pH 4.8), to a nal concentration of /H110110.8 mM. Similar to AcK1, good-quality spectra were obtained forBmK1; 1D and 1H-15N HSQC spectra are shown in Supple - mental Fig. S3C, D,F. Chemical shift assignments for back- bone and side-chain proton resonances were made by con-ventional analysis ofthe 2D [ 1H-1H]-total-correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY; spin lock time, 30 and 70 ms) and [1H-1H]-NOESY spectra (mix - ing time, 200 ms) acquired at 20\u00b0C.15N chemical shifts were obtained from a1H-15N-HSQC spectrum, and13C chemical shifts were obtained from a combination of13C-H2BC and 13C-HSQC spectra acquired in 100%2H2O (pH 4.8). A 2D-NOESY spectrum was also recorded at 800 MHz with amixing time of 200 ms at pH 5.8 and was subsequently usedfor nal structure calculations. For determination of theamide resonance temperature coefcients, a series of 1D 1H spectra and 2D homonuclear TOCSY spectra (spin lock time,70 ms) was acquired at 15, 20, 25, and 30\u00b0C on an Avance 600MHz instrument (Bruker). Amide exchange material in 2H2Oa tp H4 . 8 and then recording a series of 1D spectra, followed by a 70 msTOCSY spectrum at 20\u00b0C. All spectra were processed inTOPSPIN (version 3.2) and were analyzed by CcpNmr-Anal-ysis (version 2.1.5; available at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/soft-ware/analysis/). The NMR chemical shift data reported inthis article have been deposited in the BioMagResBank DataBank (56) with accession numbers 19460 and 19450 for AcK1and BmK1, respectively. 4 Vol. 28 September 2014 CHHABRA ET AL. The FASEB Journal /H18528www.fasebj.orgStructure calculations Structures were initially calculated by using the noeassign macro within the program CYANA 3.0 (57). Disulde bondconstraints were added according to the connectivity patternsobserved from the structures calculated in the absence ofdisulde constraints; NOEs were also observed directly be-tween 3 disulde bonds in AcK1and for both AcK1 and BmK1, the pattern of disuldeconnectivity was 1-6/2-4/3-5, as observed for ShK (58).Torsion angle constraints (/H9272 and/H9272) were generated from an analysis of chemical shifts by using Talos /H11001/TALOS-N (59). Structures were then calculated with Xplor-NIH 2.33 (60),using a simulated annealing protocol in torsion angle dynam-ics (TAD). A radius of gyration term to represent weakpacking potential was included, as were database potentials ofmean force to rene against multidimensional torsion angles(61), C/H9251 and C/H9252 chemical shifts, and backbone hydrogen- bonding. One hundred trial structures were calculated ini-tially from a minimized extended structure, with randominitial velocities and a starting temperature of 50,000 K. Afurther 100 rened structures were subsequently calculated,starting from the lowest energy folded structure of theprevious calculation and rened using TAD, starting from aninitial temperature of 3000 K. Additional backbone distanceconstraints were explicitly included for BmK1 if a hydrogenbond to the same acceptor was observed in more than 50% ofthe structures calculated with the inclusion of the hydrogenbond database potential in automatic detection mode and ifthe amide displayed slow solvent exchange or a low temper-ature coefcient. Structures were selected on the basis oflowest NOE and dihedral angle violations and ranked accord-ing to total energy. The accepted structures had no NOEviolations /H110220.15 \u00c5 (AcK1) (BmK1) or /H110223\u00b0 (AcK1). Thirty structures were selected based on the total lowest energy and assessed usingMOLMOL (version 2K.1) (62) and ProcheckNMR (63).Structural statistics are summarized in Supplemental TableS1. Molecular representations were prepared using eitherChimera (64) or PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular GraphicsSystem, Version 1.5.0.4 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, Portland, OR,USA; available at http://www.pymol.org). Coordinates for the nal sets of 30 structures for AcK1 and BmK1, as well as the NMR restraints from which the structureswere calculated, have been deposited in the Protein DataBank (65) with the ID codes 2MD0 and 2MCR, respectively(http://www.rcsb.org/). Analysis of the pharmacological block of Kvs by parasitic worm peptides Pharmacological performed for Kv1.1, -1.2, -1.3, -1.6, and -3.2, expressed patch-clamp recordings (EPC-9; HEKA Elektronik, Lam-brecht, Germany). Each of the channel clones and cell linesused for these studies has been characterized and describedpreviously (2, 17). Kv1.3 currents were recorded from bothhuman T cells and from L929 broblast cells stably expressingcloned mouse Kv1.3 channels. Mouse Kv1.1 channels werestably expressed in L929 and rat Kv1.2 channels in B82broblasts cells. Human Kv1.6 and rat Kv3.2 L929 WI, USA), whereas (a gift from Dr. Diana Bautista, University ofCalifornia, CA, USA), Nav1.5, and KCa3.1 channelswere into cells. All recordedusing the whole-cell recording conguration in normal mam-malian Ringer solution containing 140 mM Na /H11001. For all Kvchannel recordings, the pipette solution contained (in KF, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, and 2 MgCl 2(pH 7.2) in 300 mOsM and currents were elicited by 200 ms depolarizingpulses from a holding potential of /H1100280 to /H1100140 mV, as described previously (2). The Nav1.5 and K2P3.1 channelswere recorded with CsF and KCl internal solutions, respec-tively, and the KCa3.1 channels were recorded with K-aspar-tate internal solution with 1 /H9262M free Ca 2/H11001. Nav1.5 currents were elicited by a test pulse to 0 mV from a /H1100280 mV holding potential every 1 s. K2P3.1 and KCa3.1 currents were elicitedby a 200 ms voltage ramp from /H11002120 to /H1100180 mV every 10 s. Each channel blocker was tested at multiple concentrationsprepared in serial dilutions from peptide stocks dissolved and (pH 6.0)] (19). The measured reduction in peakcurrent at 40 mV for each concentration was normalized tothat of the control normal mammalian Ringer solution andused to generate a dose-response curve. The IC 50values were determined with SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago,IL, USA) by tting the the f/H11005[1/H11001(x/IC fis the frac - tional current at of peptides, and nis the Hill coefcient. Pipette resistances averaged 2 M /H9024, and series resistance compensation of 80% was used at all current levels.Acquisition and analysis were performed with IGOR Pro(WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA) and Excel (Microsoft,Redmond, WA, USA). Data are presented as means /H11006se. Cells The Lewis rat ovalbumin-specic T EMlymphocyte cell line transduced with GFP (66) was a gift from Dr. Alexander Fl\u00fcgel (Georg-August University, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). Thiscell line DTH vivo, and ShK-186 suppresses its proliferation and in vivo activation and migration during a DTH response (12). Histopaque-1077 gradients (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,MO, USA) were used to isolate splenocytes from 5- to 7-wk-oldfemale Lewis rats. These predominantly CCR7 /H11001T cells are resistant to ShK-186 because they up-regulate the KCa3.1channel on activation. All experiments involving rats wereapproved by the institutional animal care and use committeeat Baylor College of Medicine. [ 3H] thymidine incorporation assays T-lymphocyte proliferation was measured by incorporation of [3H] thymidine in the DNA of dividing cells (2). The Lewis rat ovalbumin-specic TEMlymphocyte cell line transduced with GFP (12, 67) was maintained in culture by alternatingcycles of antigen-induced stimulation and cytokine-depen-dent expansion. The T EMcells were used after4do f cytokine-dependent expansion. Splenic T cells were usedimmediately after collection. The cells were seeded in flat-bottomed, 96-well plates in 200 /H9262l of culture medium 1% homologous rat serum. ShK or BmK2 wasadded to the cells 30 min before the antigen or mitogen. TheT EMcells were stimulated with 10 /H9262g/ml ovalbumin presence of irradiated thymocytes as antigen-presenting cells,and splenocytes were stimulated with 1 /H9262g/ml concanavalin A. The cells were cultured for 3 d and were pulsed with [ 3H] thymidine (1 /H9262Ci/well) 16-18 h before harvest on glass ber lters. The proliferative response of T cells was assessed in a/H9252-scintillation counter. DTH Female Lewis rats were purchased from Charles River Labo- ratories (Wilmington, MA, USA) and housed under clean 5 IMMUNOMODULATORY PEPTIDES FROM PARASITIC WORMSconditions in autoclaved setups with food and water ad libitum. Active DTH was induced in 8- to 9-wk-old Lewis rats by immunization in the flank with an emulsion of ovalbuminwith complete Freund's adjuvant (2, 3, 17, 19). Seven dayslater, while under isoflurane anesthesia, the animals werechallenged with ovalbumin dissolved in saline in one ear andsaline in the other. The rats received a single dose of vehicleor BmK2 (0.5 mg/kg dissolved in vehicle) in the scruff of theneck at the time of the challenge. Ear thickness was deter-mined 24 h later with a spring-loaded micrometer as ameasure of inflammation. Cytokine production by human T cells We compared the effects of the worm peptides with ShK-186 in an assay used previously to assess the effect of ShK-186 onhuman T cells (19). When human T cells are activated, theCCR7 /H11001T cells in the pool up-regulate KCa3.1 channels during activation and escape inhibition by Kv1.3 blockers(1-4, 19). Protein kinase C forKCa3.1 up-regulation (68). Thapsigargin, a SERCA pumpinhibitor, triggers calcium signaling and increases cytokine production without activating the protein kinase C pathwaynecessary for KCa3.1 up-regulation (4, 19). We had shown thatShK-186 is very effective in suppressing cytokine production(IL2/H11005IFN-/H9253/H11022IL17/H11022 IL4) in this assay (4, 19). We therefore stimulated human T cells with thapsigargin to assess the effect ofthe worm peptides on the production of a representative cyto-kine (IFN-/H9253 ) in unseparated human T cells truncated AcK1 (AcK1t) (25 mM HEPES, 2 mM l-glutamine, 55 /H9262M/H9252-mercap- toethanol, and 100 IU penicillin and streptomycin) at 4 timesthe desired nal concentration. Fifty microliters of eachdilution was added to 4 replicate wells of a 96-well tissueculture plate, and 50 /H9262l of medium was added to replicate negative and positive control wells. To initiate the experi-ment, we added 100 /H9262l of whole blood to each. The samples were incubated overnight with the drug at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2, after which the cells were stimulated. We added 50 /H9262lo ft h e /H110034 thapsigargin stimulus (40 /H9262M) to all wells, except to the negative control wells, to which 50 /H9262l of 0.4% DMSO was added (19). The plate was incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5%CO 2and spun down for 5 min at 1500 rpm, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 96-well plate. ELISAwas used to measure cytokine concentrations with the CA,USA): anti-human IFN-/H9253 and NS.B3 for and detection. RESULTS Screening cDNA libraries and genome databases We screened a cDNA library of anterior secretory glands of the parasitic hookworm A. caninum, a close relative of the human A. duodenale, A. ceylanicum, and Necator americanus. We sequenced more than 2000 randomly selected clones, which were clus-tered into 159 unique transcripts. Nine transcriptsencoded secreted proteins with a single ShK/ Bunodo- soma (BgK)-like domain and predicted masses of 6.9-8.3 kDa. Of these, AcK1 (Fig. 1 B) was the most abundant transcript, with 27 ESTs, ranking 13thamong the transcripts coding for putative secretedproteins in the library. We used AcK1 to search within genome databases and discovered several related se-quences in many parasitic worms that infect humansand other mammals. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows analignment of 53 ShK-like worm sequences, and 8 knownchannel-blocking, ShK-related peptides from sea anem-ones. Most of these are independent peptides, whereasothers represent domains within larger proteins (indi-cated by asterisks). The alignment (Supplemental Fig.1) shows strong conservation of an Asp (Asp5 in ShK)in the majority of the worm peptides and sea anemo-nes. In ShK, the carboxylate of this Asp is close to the-ammonium group of Lys30, and this interaction facil-itates proper folding of the peptide (58, 69). A posi-tively charged residue and an adjacent aromatic/hydro-phobic residue [Lys22/Tyr23 in ShK and Arg/Leuin toxin domain of matrix metalloprotease 23(MMP23 TxD)] are necessary for potent Kv1.3 channel blockade (16, 18, 20). Of the 53 worm sequences, only17 have this dyad; AcK1 contains Lys/Leu at the equivalent positions (Supple-mental Fig. S1). Peptides lacking these critical residuesmay block other ion channels in preference to Kv1.3,although peptides lacking the dyad have been reportedto block K /H11001channels (70). AcK1 from dog-infecting human- infecting ceylanicum Fig. S1) have identical protein sequences (96% DNA se-quence identity), and this common sequence willhenceforth be referred to as AcK1. The parsimony-based phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1 A shows the inferred evolutionary relatedness of these 60sequences. The anemone sequences form 2 separatebranches (shown in black) that join the tree at a pointclose to its center, and the various worm species form 3separate branches, distinguished in red, green, andblue, which emanate near this point. No systematicdifferences were found in the distribution on this treeof peptides vs.domains. The trematode and cestode sequences are on a single branch (green), whereasnematode sequences are represented on all 3 branches(Fig. 1A). Note that different peptides from a singlespecies of worm may be distributed on very distantbranches of this tree, notably those from Onchocerca volvulus, and suggests that the oldest geneduplications that have diversied this family of peptidespredate the divergence of the worm species. Synthesis of AcK1, BmK1, and analogues We selected 2 worm peptides for further study from 2 branches of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1 andSupplemental Fig. S1). AcK1 was selected because itis a peptide (like ShK), rather than a domain in alarger protein, and is expressed in the anteriorsecretory glands of both the dog- and human-infect-ing hookworms A. caninum and A. ceylanicum, respec- tively, suggesting that it is injected into the host 6 Vol. 28 September 2014 CHHABRA ET AL. The FASEB Journal /H18528www.fasebj.orgduring infection by the worm; also, A. caninum ameliorates disease in a mouse model of colitis (34). BmK1, from a larial worm, was selected because itrepresents an ShKT domain in a zinc metalloprotease likeMMP23 (MMP23 TxD) (20), and larial worms are re - ported to modulate the human immune response ininfected patients (71). AcK1 and BmK1 were synthesizedby labeling for NMR stud- ies (Figs. S2A). Neither synthetic nor recombinant AcK1 folded smoothly; the crude product requiredmore stringent conditions to solubilize, and the foldingprole was much more complex than that of ShK orBmK1. A truncated AcK1 analogue lacking the rst 9N-terminal residues (AcK1t; Supplemental Fig. S2 B) was easier to fold and yielded a well-resolved, hydro-philic-eluting product. BmK1 folded much like ShK-related peptides, into a more hydrophilic productwith misfolded species eluting at later times (Supple- mental Fig. S2 C). BmK2, an analogue of BmK1 that we designed based on sequence alignment and ourknowledge of the ShK-channel interaction surface (4,16-18, 58), differs from BmK1 by 5 residues (Fig. 1 B) and is folded, with a major peak eluting in the middleof the folding prole (22 min; Supplemental structures of AcK1 and BmK1 Supplemental Table S1 summarizes the experimental constraints and structural statistics for AcK1 and BmK1. Both structures are well dened and are of goodquality, as judged by low deviations from idealizedgeometry and Lennard-Jones potentials, indicating thatthe structures have favorable nonbonded contacts. Fur-thermore, 92 and 89%, respectively, of the residues inAcK1 and BmK1 lie in the most favored regions of theRamachandran plots. The rst 10 residues of AcK1 aredened by 114 NOE constraints and form an extendedstructure (RMS over the backbone heavy atoms N, C /H9251, and C=, /H110111.2 \u00c5). However, the absence of and the paucity of medium-range ones (only 7observed), combined with strong sequential H /H9251-HNand HN-HNNOEs, indicate that this region undergoes conformational exchange and is not well dened rela-tive to the structured core of the molecule. Based onchemical shifts, Talos-N predicts that residues 2-7 aredynamic, and this was further conrmed by the back-bone 15N[1H] NOE data (Supplemental Fig. S3 G). Figure 2A shows the families of structures for AcK1 and BmK1, and Fig. 2B highlights the locations of charged side chains on their respective molecular sur-faces.

These peptides have low sequence similarity (/H1101119%) but share the samedisulde framework and critical pore-blocking, posi-tively charged Lys/Arg residue. Furthermore, all struc-tures are predominantly helical, although the lengthsand exact positions of the helical elements differslightly among the 5 structures. The structures arecompared in more detail in Fig. 3 Band the differences are quantied in Supplemental Table S2. Some differ-ences in secondary structure between the worm pep-tides and ShK are apparent (Fig. 3 B); in particular, a four-residue insert in both of the worm peptides (aswell as BgK and MMP23 TxD) is absent in ShK, which produces a shorter interhelical loop 2 in this peptide.The close structural similarity of BmK1 and MMP23 TxD may reflect the fact that both are extracellular domainsof metalloproteases (20). The critical lysine and otherkey residues in ShK that are essential for K /H11001channel blockade (4, 17, 18) are located on a short helical region, but the side chains of residues in the Lys22/Tyr23 dyad(73), which is important for Kv1 blockade in ShK, havedifferent relative orientations in the TxDcompared with BgK and ShK (Fig. 3C). These differences may contribute to the lower po- tency of the worm peptides (Fig. 4A ,B) and MMP23TxD, compared with that of ShK, BgK, and their analogues. As noted above, Asp5 is almost completely conserved in the sequences shown in Supplemental Fig. S1, al-though in a few sequences it is conservatively replacedwith Asn, Glu, or Ser. The residue equivalent to Lys30in ShK is largely conserved among the sequences(Supplemental Fig. S1), although Val occupies thisposition in AcK1, which may contribute to the lessefcient oxidative folding of this peptide in vitro com- pared with ShK and BmK1 (which contains Lys at thisposition). The pKa of Asp5 in ShK-[K30A] is approxi-mately half a unit higher than in native ShK (69),supporting an Asp5-Lys30 electrostatic interaction inShK; this may exist in BmK1 but cannot be present inAcK1. Replacement of Val34 with Lys in AcK1 pro-moted the formation of an Asp-Lys interaction, leading Figure 3. Worm peptides share structural similarity with sea anemone peptides.

The FASEB Journal /H18528www.fasebj.orgto a/H1102210-fold improvement in the yield of the desired folded peptide (data not shown). The N-terminal ex- tension in AcK1 is less ordered than the disulde-bridged core and is poorly dened relative to the corestructure, at least in solution. It also appears to beunnecessary for K /H11001-channel blocking activity, because its elimination in AcK1t does not affect Kv1.3 blocking-potency (Table 1). blocked cloned Kv1.3 channels expressed heterolo-gously in mammalian cells and also native Kv1.3 chan-nels in human T cells, in a dose-dependent mannerwith a Hill coefcient of 1 (Fig. AcK1t,and BmK2 blocked Kv1.3 with IC 50values in low- to midnanomolar range, while BmK1 blocked the channelat low micromolar concentrations (Fig. 4 B). The block was partially reversible. Compared to BgK, the wormpeptides exhibited equal (BmK2) to 1000-fold (BmK1)lower potency against Kv1.3 20- (BmK2) to80,000-fold lower potency against Kv1.3 (Table blocker among thesepeptides, exhibited /H110224000-fold selectivity for Kv1.3 closely related Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6 channels, aswell as and (KCNK3, TASK1) channels Na V1.5 (Table 1). This selectivity prole was similar to ShK-186 (Table 1). Immunomodulatory activity of parasitic worm peptides Kv1.3 blockers suppress the proliferation of Kv1.3- expressing CCR7/H11002TEMcells without affecting CCR7/H11001 naive and central memory T cells, because these lattercells up-regulate the KCa3.1 channel during activation(1, 3, AcK1t and BmK2 block Kv1.3 andnot KCa3.1 (Fig. 4), these 2 peptides should havesimilar effects. We assessed the immunomodulatoryeffect of AcK1t and BmK2 with the same assays thatwere used to evaluate ShK-186 12, 19). AcK1t,BmK2, ShK-186 suppressed ovalbumin-stimulated[ 3H] rat CCR7/H11002TEMcell line that up-regulates Kv1.3 on activation (12). Suppression was achieved at concentra-tions of ShK-186 (10 nM), AcK1t (1 /H9262M) that blocked Kv1.3 (Figs. 4 B and 5A). AcK1t, in CCR7/H11001T cells that up-regulate KCa3.1 channels on activation (Fig. 5B) (2, 6, 68). ShK-186 exhibits in vivo immunomodulatory activity in numerous rodent models (1-3, 8-15) includingDTH. We selected DTH as the assay to assess theimmunomodulatory activity of worm ShKTs. We previ-ously used live 2-photon imaging to demonstrate that Figure 4. Kv1.3 potassium channel inhibition. A) AcK1 blocks Kv1.3 channels in human T cells.

BmK2 is phylogeneti - cally related to ShK-186, has a structure remarkably similar to that of ShK, is the most potent worm ShKTblocker of Kv1.3, and preferentially suppresses T EM cells, and we therefore assessed its ability to inhibitDTH (12). Administration of BmK2 at the time ofantigen challenge suppressed active DTH in rats, asshown in Fig. 5B. We also evaluated the effect of the worm peptides on human T cells using assays identical to those used to evaluate ShK-186 (4, 19). When entire human T cellsare used (i.e., without separation into CCR7 /H11002and CCR7/H11001T cells), the CCR7/H11001T cells in the pool up- regulate KCa3.1 channels during activation and escapeinhibition by Kv1.3 blockers (1, 3, 4, 19). However, ifthapsigargin, a SERCA pump inhibitor is used to stim-ulate human T cells, calcium signaling is triggered andcytokine production augmented without up-regulating the KCa3.1 channel (4, 19). We previously used thisassay to screen the effect of ShK-186 on human T cellsand therefore used it to assess the worm ShKTs (4, 19).AcK1t, BmK2, and ShK-186 suppressed thapsigargin-stimulated IFN-/H9253 production by human T cells from 3 healthy donors in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 C). In summary, worm peptides preferentially suppressT EMcell responses both in vitro and in vivo in rats and humans.DISCUSSION ShK, a peptide from the sea anemone S. Kv1.3 K/H11001channels in T cells and preferentially suppresses the function of TEMcells, both in vitro and in vivo. ShK-186, a synthetic analogue of ShK, is effective in multiple rodent models of autoimmune diseases andhas been successfully tested in human phase 1 trials inhealthy volunteers (1-4, 6, 8-15). In this report, wedescribe an extensive family of ShKTs (ShK-relatedpeptides and domains) in all 3 groups of worms thatinfect humans: nematodes, trematodes, and cestodes.We provide the rst rep-resentatives of this family: a secreted peptide closest struc-tural similarity to MMP23 the ShKT Kv1.3 theypreferentially inhibit the proliferation of T EMcells, suppress cytokine production, and inhibit DTH. A signicant concern with worm therapy is that any benecial effects have to be balanced against the po-tentially harmful changes that result from worm infec- Figure 5.

The FASEB Journal /H18528www.fasebj.orgtions (21, 22, 32, 52). For example, probiotic worm therapy with the hookworm N. americanus causes diar- rhea, vomiting, and intestinal pain when more than 50larvae are administered (44). This problem of admin-istering pathogenic parasitic worms could be circum-vented by the identication and characterization ofimmunomodulatory worm molecules and by the devel-opment of these or related molecules as therapeuticsfor autoimmune diseases. Although several worm ex-tracts are active in rodent models of autoimmunediseases (26, 31, 34, 38, 40, 43, 45, 46, 48, 51), only 4worm-derived immunomodulatory molecules havebeen characterized. Of these, macrophage inhibitory factor worsens autoimmune diseases, cytostatins sup-press T H2 responses and would presumably not be effective in most autoimmune diseases (31, 43), neutro- phil inhibitory factor (26, 45, 46) has not been evaluatedin autoimmune disease models, and ES-62 is the onlyworm molecule to date that has been shown to beeffective in animal models of autoimmune diseases (38). Four lines of evidence suggest that Kv1.3-blocking worm ShKTs also contribute to the benecial effects ofprobiotic worm therapy. First, disease-associated T cellsin patients with MS, type-1 diabetes, RA, psoriasis, andchronic asthma are activated T EMcells with an elevated number of functional Kv1.3 channels (1, 3, 6) and canbe modulated by Kv1.3-blocking worm ShKTs. Second,Kv1.3 channels play role in regulating prolif-eration, proinflammatory cytokine production, cyto-toxic function, both CD4 /H11001and CD8/H11001TEMcells (1-4, 6, 8, 12, 17, 19). Worm ShKTs such as ShK-186 suppress proliferation of TEMcells without CCR7/H11001T cell subsets and decrease proinflammatory TH1 cytokines (2, 4, 6, 12, 17, 19, 68). Third, worm ShKTs such asShK-186 suppress DTH, mostly likely viatheir prefer- ential suppressive action on T EMcells (1, 3, 12). These effects are unlikely to be due to effects on macrophagesor B cells, as macrophages express a Kv1.3/Kv1.5heteromultimer (74) that is likely to be signicantly lesssensitive to Kv1.3-selective blockers, and naive and earlymemory insensitive to Kv1.3 blockers be-cause they KCa3.1 Kv1.3-selective blockers also amelio-rate disease in rodent models of RA, type-1diabetes mellitus, contact dermatitis, autoimmune glo-merulonephritis, psoriasis, chronic asthma, bone resorption due to periodontitis (2, 3, 9,11, 12, 17, 19). In addition, Kv1.3 knockout mice areresistant to the development of MS-like disease. Finally,genetic deletion or dominant-negative suppression ofKv1.3 results in differentiation into IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells viaup-regulation of SMAD3 phos- phorylation (10). This effect is similar to the induc-tion of regulatory T cells during probiotic wormtherapy (35, 48). In summary, we have characterized a novel class of immunomodulators present in all 3 groups of parasiticworms that infect humans. We have dened theirevolutionary relationships, determined structures ofrepresentative peptides, dened their molecular target (Kv1.3), and demonstrated their selective suppressivefunction on T EMcells that are implicated in autoim - mune diseases. These worm peptides or related pep-tides, such as ShK-186 (4, 17), could supersede probi-otic worm-based therapies by retaining the benecialeffects and eliminating the harmful effects associatedwith parasitic infections.
