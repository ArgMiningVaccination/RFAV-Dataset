Administer the Jansse n COVID -19 Vaccine intramuscularly. CONTRAINDICATION Do not administer the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine (see Full EUA Prescri bing Information) . WARNINGS Management of Acute Allergic Reactions Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine. Monitor Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/clinical thrombocytopenia Reports of adverse events following use of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine under emergency use authorization suggest an increased risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses and other sites (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the lower extremities) combined with thrombocytopenia and with onset of symptoms approximately one to two weeks after vaccination . The reporting rate of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine has been highest in females ages 18 through 49 years ; some cases have been fatal. The clinical course of these events shares features with autoimmune heparin- induced thrombocytopenia. In individuals with suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine, the use of heparin may be harmful and alternative treatments may be needed. Consultation with hematology specialists is strongly recommended. The American Society of Hematology has published considerations relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of the Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Reports of adverse events following use of the Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine under emergency use authorization suggest an increased risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination. Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. Syncope Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. Limitations of Vacc ine Effectiveness The Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccinated individuals. ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Adverse reactions reported in a clinical trial following administration of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine i nclude injection site pain, headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, fever, injection site erythema and injection site swelling . In clinical studies, severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Janssen CO VID-19 Vaccine (see Full EUA Prescribing Information) . Adverse Reactions Identified during Post Authorization Use Anaphylaxis and other s evere allergic reactions, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and capillary leak syndrome have been reported following Revised: Oct /20/2021 5 administration of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become apparent with more widespread use of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine .

AUTHORITY FOR ISSUANCE OF THE EUA The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) de clared a public health emergency that justifies the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID -19 Revised: Oct /20/2021 8 pandemic. In response, FDA has issued an EUA for the unapproved product, Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine, for active immunization to prevent COV ID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. FDA issued this EUA, based on Janssen Biotech, Inc.'s request and submitted data. Although limited scientific information is available, based on the totality of the scientific evidence available to date, it is reasonable to believe that the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine may be effective for the prevention of COVID -19 in individuals as specified in the Full EUA Prescribing Information. This EUA for the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine will end when the Secretary of HHS determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.

Administer the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine intramuscularly . Revised: Oct /20/2021 11 2.3 Dosing and Schedule Primary Vaccination The primary vaccination regimen for the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine is a single -dose (0.5 mL) administered to individuals 18 years of age and older. Booster Dose A single Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine boost er dose (0.5 mL) may be administered at least 2 months after primary vaccination with the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine, to individuals 18 years of age and older . A single booster dose of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine (0.5 mL) may be administered as a heterologous booster dose following completion of primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID -19 vaccine. The eligible population(s) and dosing interval for the heterologous booster dose are the same as those authorized for a booster dose of the vaccine used for primary vaccination. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine is a suspension for intramuscular injection. A single -dose is 0.5 mL . 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine to individuals with a known history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine [see Description (13)] . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Management of Acute Allergic Reactions Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine. Monitor Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/clinical -considerations/managing- anaphylaxis.html ). 5.2 Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia Reports of adverse events following use of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine under emergency use authorization suggest an increased risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses and other sites (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the lower extremities) combined with thrombocytopenia and with onset of symptoms approximately one to two weeks after vaccination [see Overall Safety Summ ary (6.2)] . The reporting rate of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine has been highest in females ages 18 through 49 years ; some cases have been fatal. The clinical course of these events shares features with autoimmune heparin- induced thrombocytopenia. Revised: Oct /20/2021 12 Specific risk factors for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of the Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine and the level of potential excess risk due to vaccination are under investigation. Based on currently available evidence, a causal relationship between thrombosis with thrombocytopenia and the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine is plausible. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia in indivi duals who receive the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. In individuals with suspected thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine, the use of heparin may be harmful and alternative treatments may be needed. Consultatio n with hematology specialists is strongly recommended. The American Society of Hematology has published considerations relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of the (https://www.hematology.org/covid- -induced -immune -thrombotic -thrombocytopenia). Recipients of Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, neurological symptoms (including severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision), or petechiae beyond the s ite of vaccination. 5.3 Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Reports of adverse events following use of the Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine under emergency use authorization suggest an increased risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination. 5.4 Syncope Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. 5.5 Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant thera py, may have a diminished immune response to the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. 5.6 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness The Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccinated individuals. 6 OVERALL SAFETY SUMMARY It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to rep ort to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID- 19 following vaccination with the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. To the extent feasible, provide a copy of the VAERS form to Janssen Biotech, Inc. Please see the REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS section for details on reporting to VAERS or Janssen Biotech, Inc. Revised: Oct /20/2021 13 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials In study COV3001, the most common local solicited adverse reaction (10%) reported was injection site pain (48.6%) . The most common systemic adverse reactions (see Tables 1 to 4) . Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Janssen COVID -19 vaccine. Adverse Reactions Identified during Post Authorization Use Anaphylaxis and other severe allergic reactions, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and capillary leak syndrome have been reported following administration of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety P rimary vaccination The safety of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine has been assessed in an ongoing Phase 3 Study, COV3001 (NCT04505722) (Study 1). A total of 43,783 individuals were enrolled in this study, of whom 21,895 adult s aged 18 years and older received the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine [Full Analysis Set (FAS)] . This study is being conducted in the United States (n=19,302) , Brazil (n=7,278), South Africa study, were female, 54.9% were male, 58.7% were White, 19.4% were Black or African American, 45.3% were Hispanic or Latino, 3.3% were Asian, 9.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native and 0.2% were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander , 5.6% were from multiple racial groups and 1.4% were unknown races (see Table 5) . The median age of individuals was 52.0 years (range: 18 -100). There were 4,217 (9.6%) individuals who were SARS -CoV -2 seropositive at baseline and who were included in the study. In the U nited States, 838 of 19,302 (4.3% ) individuals were SARS -CoV -2 seropositive . Demographic characteristics were similar among individuals who received the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine and those who received saline placebo. The safety subset includes 6,736 individual s (3,356 from the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine group, 3,380 from the placebo group) . The demographic profile in the safety subset was similar in terms of age and gender compared to the FAS . A larger percentage of individuals in the safety subset were White (83.4%) compared to the FAS (58.7%). Geographically, the safety subset was limited to individuals from the U nited States (51.4%), Brazil (38.5%) and South Africa (10.2 %). Fewer individuals in the safety subset compared to t he FAS were SARS -CoV -2 seropositive at baseline, 4.5% vs . 9.6%, and a t least one comorbidity 34.1% vs 40.8% . Safety monitoring in the clinical study consisted of monitoring for: (1) solicited local and systemic reactions occurring in the 7 days followi ng vaccination in a subset of individuals (safety subset), Revised: Oct /20/2021 14 (2) unsolicited adverse events (AEs) occurring in the 28 days following vaccination in the safety subset, (3) medically- attended AEs (MAAEs) occurring in the 6 months following vaccination in the entire study population ( FAS) , (4) serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs leading to study discontinuation for the duration of the study in the entire study population. Solicited adverse reactions Shown below are the frequencies of s olicited local adverse reactions (Tables 1 and 2) and systemic adverse reactions (Tables 3 and 4) reported in adults by age group in the 7 days following vaccination in Study 1.

Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported following administration of the Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine had a median duration of 1 to 2 days. Revised: Oct /20/2021 16 Unsolicited adverse events Individuals within the safety subset in S tudy 1 (N=6 ,736) were monitored for unsolicited adverse events (AEs) for 28 days following vaccination with 99.9% (N= 6,730) of individuals completing the full 28 days of follow -up. The proportion of individuals who reported one or more unsolicited AEs was similar among those in the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine group ( 13.1%) and those in the placebo group (12.0%). Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and other events of interest In Study 1, up to a cut -off date of January 22, 2021, 54.6% of individuals had follow -up duration of 8 weeks . The median follow -up duration for all individuals was 58 days. SAEs , excluding those related to confirmed COVID -19, were reported by 0.4% (n= 83) of individuals who received the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine (N= 21,895) and 0.4 % (n= 96) of individuals who received placebo (N= 21,888) . Additional adverse events of interest, including but not limited to allergic, neurologic, inflammatory, vascular, and autoimmune disorder s, were analyzed among all ad verse events collected through protocol -specified safety mon itoring procedures as well as unsol icited reporting. Urticaria (all non -serious) was reported in five vaccin ated individuals and 1 individual who received placebo in the 7 days following vaccination. In addition, an SAE of hypersensitivity, not classified as anaphylaxis, was reported in 1 vaccin ated individual with urticaria beginning two days following vaccination and angioedema of the lips with no respiratory distress begi nning four days following vaccination. The event was likely related to the vaccine. An SAE of severe pain in the injected arm , not responsive to analgesics, with immediate onset at time of vaccination, and that was ongoing 74 days following vaccination was reported in an individual who received the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. An SAE of severe generalized weakness, fever, and headache, with onset on the day following vaccination and resolution three days following vaccination was reported in an individual who received the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. Both SAE s are likely related to the vaccine. Numerical imbalances, with more events in vaccine than placebo recipients , were observed for the following serious and other adverse events of interest in individuals receiving the vaccine or placebo, respectively: Thromboembolic events: Deep vein thrombosis: 6 events (2 serious; 5 within 28 days of vaccination) vs. 2 events (1 serious; 2 within 28 days of vaccination) . Pulmonary embolism: 4 events (3 seriou s; 2 within 28 days of vaccination) vs. 1 event (serious and within 28 days of vaccination) . Transverse sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia : 1 event (serious , with onset of symptoms 8 days post - vaccination) vs. 0. Revised: Oct /20/2021 17 Seizures: 4 events (1 serious; 4 within 28 days of vaccination) vs. 1 event (0 serious and 0 within 28 days following vaccination) . Tinnitus: 6 events (0 serious; 6 within 28 days of vaccination, including 3 within 2 days of vaccination ) vs. 0. For these events, a causal relationship with the Janssen COVID -19 vaccine could not be determined based on S tudy 1. The assessment of causality was confounded by the presence of underlying medical conditions that may have predisposed individuals to these e vents. However, taking into consideration post -authorization experience, a causal relationship with Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine is plausible for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Overall Safety Summary (6.2) ]. There were no additional notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro- inflammatory, and cardiovascular events) that would suggest a causal relationship to the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. Booster Dose Following Primary Vaccination with Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine Overall, in 5 clinical studies conducted in Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Philippines, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom and United States, a pproximately 9,000 participants have received 2 doses of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine, administered at least 2 months apart and approximately 2,700 participants had at least 2 months of safety follow -up after the booster dose. A randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled Phase 2 study, COV2001 ( NCT04535453) (Study 2), evaluated the frequency and severity of loca l and systemic adverse reactions within 7 days of administration of a booster dose of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine administered approximately 2 months after the primary vaccination in healthy adults 18 through 55 years of age and adults 65 years and older in good or stable health. A total of 141 individuals received at least one dose of the vaccine and 137 received both the primary vaccination and the booster dose at an interval of 2 months. The median age of individuals was 48 years, and 48 individuals (34%) were 65 years of age and older. Data on solicited adverse reactions after the primary vaccination and after a booster dose are shown in Tables 5-8.

Grade 3 fever: Revised: Oct 20 Unsolicited adverse events An overall assessment of Janssen's safety analyses from studies evaluating 2 doses of Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine did not reveal new safety concerns following a booste r dose, as compared with adverse reactions reported following the single -dose primary vaccination. Booster Dose Following Primary Vaccination with Another Authorized or Approved COVID - 19 Vaccine The safety of a Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine booster dose in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID -19 Vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from the safety of a Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine booster dose administered following completion of Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine primary vaccination (homologous booster dose) and from data from an independent Phase 1/2 open -label clinical trial ( NCT04889209) conducted in the United States that evaluated a heterologous booster dose of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. In this study, a dults who had completed primary vaccination with a Moderna COVID- 19 Vaccine 2-dose series (N=151) , a Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine single dose (N=156) , or a Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine 2 -dose series (N=151) at least 12 weeks prior to enrol lment and who reported no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a booster dose of one of three vaccines : Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine , Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine, or Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine . Adverse events were assessed through 28 days after the booster dose. An overall review of adverse reactions reported following the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine heterologous booster dose did not identify any new safety concerns, as compared with adverse reactions reported following a Janssen COVID -19 Vac cine primary vaccination or homologous booster dose. 6.2 Post Authorization Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post -authorization use of the Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System labyrinth disorders : Tinnitus. Gastrointestinal disorders : Diarrhea, Vomiting. Immune System Disorders: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis .

Revised: Oct /20/2021 23 11 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 11.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine during pregnancy. Women who are vaccinated with Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine during pregnancy are encouraged to enroll in the registry by visit ing https://c -viper.pregistry.com . Risk Summary All Pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine- associated risks in pregnancy. In a reproductive developmental toxicity study female rabbits were administered 1 mL of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine (a single human dose is 0.5 mL) by intramuscular injection 7 days prior to mating and on Gestation Days 6 and 20 (i.e. , one vaccination during early and late gestation, respectively ). No vaccine related adverse effects on female fertility, embryo -fetal or postnatal development up to Postnatal Day 28 were observed. 11.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data are not available to assess the effects of Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. 11.3 Pediatric Use Emergency Use Authorization of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine does not include use in individuals younger than 18 years of age. 11.4 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine included individuals 65 years of age and older and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see Overall Safety Summary (6.1) and Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18)] . Of the 21,895 individuals who received a single -dose of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine in COV3001 , 19.5% (n=4 ,259) were 65 years of age and older and 3.7% (n=809) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between individuals 65 years of age and older and younger individuals . Revised: Oct /20/2021 24 13 DESCRIPTION The Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine is a colorless to slightly yellow , clear to very opalescent sterile suspension for intramuscular injection. It contains no visible particulates. The vaccine consists of a replication -incompetent recombinant adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2 (SARS -CoV -2) spike (S ) protein in a stabilized conformation. The Ad26 vector expressing the SARS -CoV -2 S protein is grown in PER.C6 TetR cells, in media containing amino acids and no animal -derived proteins. After propagation, the vaccine is processed through several purificat ion steps, formulated with inactive ingredients and filled into vials. Each 0.5 mL dose of Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine is formulated to contain 5\u00d71010 virus particles (VP) and the following inactive ingredients: citric acid monohydrate (0.14 mg), trisodium chloride (2.19 mg) . Each dose may also contain residual amounts of host cell proteins (0.15 mcg) and/or host cell DNA (3 ng). Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine does not contain a preservative . The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. 14 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 14.1 Mechanism of Action The Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine is composed of a recombinant, replication- incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that , after enter ing human cells, expresses the SARS -CoV -2 spike (S) antigen without virus propagation. An immune response elicited to the S antigen protects against COVI D-19. 18 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR EUA 18.1 Efficacy of Primary Vaccination A primary analysis ( cut-off date January 22, 2021) of a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 Study ( Study 1) was conducted in the United States, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Mexico to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single -dose of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID - 19 in adults aged 18 years an d older. Randomization was stratified by age (18- 59 years, 60 years and older) and presence or absence of comorbidities associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID -19. The study allowed for the inclusion of individuals with stable pre-existing medical conditions, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy during the 3 months preceding vaccination, as well as individuals with stable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A total of 44,325 individuals were randomized equally to receive Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine or saline placebo. Individuals are planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. Revised: Oct /20/2021 25 The primary efficacy analysis population of 39,321 individuals (19,630 in the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine group and 19,691 in the placebo group) included 38,059 SARS -CoV -2 seronegative individuals at baseline and 1,262 individuals with an unknown serostatus. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among individuals who received the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine and those who received placebo (see Table 9).

Revised: Oct /20/2021 26 Efficacy Against COVID -19 The co -primary endpoints evaluated the first occurrence of moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 with onset of symptoms at least 14 days and at least 28 days after vaccination . Moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 was molecularly confirmed by a central laboratory based on a positive SARS -CoV -2 viral RNA result using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based test. Moderate COVID -19 was defined based on the following criteria: t he individual must have experienced any one of the following new or worsening signs or symptoms: respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute, abnormal saturation of oxygen (SpO2) but still >93% on room air at sea level, clinical or radiologic evidence of pneumonia, radiologic evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), shortness of br eath or difficulty breathing OR any two of the following new or worsening signs or symptoms: fever (38.0\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F), heart rate 90 beats/minute, shaking chills or rigors, sore throat, cough, malaise, headache, muscle pain (myalgia), gastrointestinal symptoms, new or changing olfactory or taste disorders, red or bruised appearing feet or toes. Severe/critical COVID -19 was defined based on the following criteria: t he individual must have experienced any one of the following at any time during the course of observation: clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute, heart rate 125 beats/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 93% on room air at sea level, or partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg), respiratory failure (defined as needing high- flow oxygen, non- invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), evidence of shock (defined as systolic pressure <90 mmHg, diastoli c blood pressure <60 or requiring vasopressors), significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death. Final determination of severe/critical COVID -19 cases were made by an independent adjudication committee. Primary analysis The median length of follow up for efficacy for individuals in the study was 8 weeks post-vaccination. Vaccine Efficacy (VE) for the co -primary endpoints against moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 in individuals who were seronegative or who had an unknown serostatus at baseline was 66.9% (95% CI: 59.0; 73.4) 66.1% (95% CI: 55.0; 74.8) at least 28 days after vaccination (see Table 10) .

Among all COVID -19 cases with onset at least 14 days post vaccination, including cases diagnosed by a positive PCR from a local laboratory and still awaiting confirmation at the central laboratory (as of January 22, 2021) , there were 2 COVID -19 related hospitalizations in the vaccine group (with none after 28 days) and 29 in the placebo group (with 16 after 28 days). Revised: Oct /20/2021 28 As of t he primary analysis cut -off date of January 22, 2021, t here were no COVID -19-related deaths reported in Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine recipients compared to 5 COVID -19-related deaths reported in placebo recipients , who were SARS -CoV -2 PCR negative at baseline . Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine Efficacy in Countries With Different Circulating SARS -CoV -2 Variants . Exploratory subgroup analys es of vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe/critical COVID -19 and severe/critical COVID -19 for Brazil, South Africa, and the United States were conducted (see Table 12). For the subgroup analys es, all COVID -19 cases accrued up to the primary efficacy analysis data cut -off date, including cases confirmed by the centr al laboratory and cases with documented positive SARS -CoV -2 PCR from a local laboratory which are still awaiting confirmation by the central laboratory, were included. The concordance rate observed up to the data cut -off date between the PCR results from t he local laboratory and the central laboratory was 90.3%.

As of February 12, 2021, samples from 71.7% of central laboratory confirmed primary analysis cases had been sequenced [United States (73.5%), South Africa (66.9%) and Brazil (69.3%)] . In the U nited States, 96.4% of strains were identified as the Wuhan -H1 variant D614G; in South Africa, 94.5% of strains were identified as the 20H/501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351 lineage); in Brazil, 69.4% of str ains were identified to be a variant of the P.2 lineage and 30.6% of strains were identified as the Wuhan- H1 variant D614G. As of February 12, 2021, SARS -CoV-2 variants from the B1.1.7 or P.1 lineages were not found in any of the sequenced samples. 18.2 Immunog enicity of a Booster Dose following Primary Vaccination with Janssen COVID- 19 Vaccine In Study 2, individuals 18 through 55 years of age and 65 years and older received a booster dose of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine approximately 2 months after the primary vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring neutralizing antibodies to SARS -CoV -2 Victoria/1/2020 strain using a qualified wild -type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). Immunogenicity data are available from 39 individuals , of whom 15 wer e 65 years of age and older, and are summarized in Table 13. Based on a limited number of individuals from this study, a similar fold -rise in neutralizing antibody titers from pre -booster to 14 and 28 days post -booster Revised: Oct /20/2021 29 was observed between individuals 18 through 55 years of age and individuals 65 years of age and older.

In this study, adults who had completed primary vaccination with a Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine 2 -dose series (N=151), a Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine single dose (N=156), or a Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine 2 -dose series (N=151) at least 12 weeks prior to enrol lment and who reported no history of SARS -CoV -2 infection were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a booster dose of one of three vaccines: Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine, Janssen COVID - 19 Vaccine, Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vac cine. Neutralizing antibody titers, a neutralization assay using a lentivirus expressing the SARS -CoV -2 Spike protein with D614G mutation, were assessed on Day 1 prior to administration of the booster dose and on Day 15 after the booster dose. A booster response to the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine was demonstrated regardless of primary vaccination. 19 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine is supplied in a carton of 10 multi- dose vials (NDC 59676- 580-15). A maximum of 5 doses can be withdrawn from the multi -dose vial. Revised: Oct /20/2021 30 The storage and handling information in this F act Sheet supersedes the storage and handling information on the carton and vial labels.
