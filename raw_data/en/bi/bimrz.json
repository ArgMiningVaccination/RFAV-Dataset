You can also find more detailed information on the website of the [Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/English/Paginas/inicio.aspx). Vaccines Currently, no vaccines are required to gain entry to Colombia. However, if you wish to visit tourist sites such as the [Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Park](https://colombia.travel/en/santa-marta/sierra-nevada), the Tayrona National Park or the different Amazon reserves, the Colombia authorities will require that you are properly vaccinated against yellow fever. Remember that this vaccine must be administered at least 10 days prior to traveling to these destinations. Check the [list of all the areas in which yellow fever vaccination is mandatory](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/English/Paginas/List-of-municipalities-recommended-for-vaccination-against-yellow-fever.aspx). Please bear in mind that you must be vaccinated at least ten days prior to traveling to the aforementioned areas. Remember, you can also get the vaccine in any of Colombia's major cities. Other recommended vaccines, but not mandatory, include immunization against Hepatitis A and Typhoid fever. The same applies to Malaria pills, which are advisable if visiting the rainforest regions, where we would also recommend the use of insect repellent and mosquito nets. Medication and healthcare services If you take medication, it is essential that you bring your prescription with you so that you can purchase them at a pharmacy or drugstore, if needed. Remember to always keep handy any related documentation regarding any special health condition you may have that would need to be considered in the event of an emergency. We would also highly recommend that, before traveling, you take out international medical insurance to ensure full cover should you need medical attention. Another key tip for you to follow in any part of the country, no matter what the climate, is to use sunscreen and stay well hydrated at all times. Keep in mind that in certain regions it is recommendable that you only consume bottled mineral water. You'll have no problem finding bottled water at any local store. Lastly, if you have any food allergy, make sure you always ask about the ingredients used in the meals you order. For more useful information, check these "}
