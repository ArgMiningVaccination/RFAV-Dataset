TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE An ancient form of medicine combining acupuncture & Chinese herbs, used to achieve optimal health and wellness. With treatments rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Rocky Coast uses both acupuncture and herbs to treat and repair a variety of underlying imbalances that lead to symptoms such as pain, digestive upset, insomnia, migraines, infertility, and much more. How Acupuncture Works Acupuncture is a component of TCM, a form of medicine that has evolved over 2500 years. Acupuncture works by getting to the root of your symptoms. The practice involves the insertion of thin, solid needles into the skin at specific points on the body. There are more than 2000 points on the body that can be accessed, each with a unique function. The individual points are like little gates that sends energetic information deep into your body to promote healing. Acupuncture helps the body restore homeostasis, improves circulation, decreases pain by interrupting pain signaling, balances the body's chemistry, and reduces inflammation. After a detailed health history intake, your provider will create a customized plan for your care. Our providers our state-of-the-art facility in Portland, Maine are highly trained and take into consideration when western medicine could also be useful. Acupuncture is often used alone and can also be combined with Chinese herbal medicine when determined by your provider as a necessary element in your treatment plan. More About Chinese Herbs Chinese herbal medicine has been around for thousands of years and is a powerful healing system that uses combinations of herbs, or herbal formulas. These formulas balance the body and bring about greater health and vitality. Hundreds of dierent substances and thousands of dierent formulas address everything you might bring to your health care provider: skin conditions, headaches, chronic pain, menstrual irregularities, digestive distress, stress and anxiety, colds and flus, and much more.

SPECIALTY AREAS | [Adjunctive Therapies](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicines/#adjunctive-therapies) Central to our practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the idea that each person is unique. We don't treat a set of problems, we treat you. That means spending time, listening deeply and addressing the workings of your mind, body, and spirit in the present moment. What People Are Saying \"I was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer and started going to Rocky Coast to help with the side effects of chemotherapy. Jason Stein met with me on my first consultation and I immediately felt a connection with him, as if I had known him forever.\" \"This was my first treatment from Sarah, and my first impression was exactly what I'd hoped\u2014Sarah was well-informed about my condition\u2014Rocky Coast really communicates and works as a team, making for a very easy clients experience.

I am very grateful to have found Rocky Coast\u2014Sarah has helped me tremendously.\" WHAT IS THE SCIENCE BEHIND ACUPUNCTURE? Connective tissue winds around the needles, increasing electrical conductivity. Doppler ultrasound shows that acupuncture increases blood flow and circulation. MRI readings demonstrate that acupuncture prompts observable changes in the brain. Thermal imaging reveals that acupuncture reduces inflammation. Do acupuncture needles hurt? The hair-fine needles are placed shallowly and in such a gentle, intentional way unique to acupuncture, Many people do not feel them at all. Others say that while they can feel them, they do not elicit that feeling of \"ouch\" associated with needles. In fact most clients report a general sense of relaxation and calm during and after their treatment. What is Qi? Qi (pronounced \"chee\") is life force energy that flows along specific pathways called meridians or channels. These meridians are each associated with a different organ system or physiological system in the body. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, smooth flow and circulation of Qi is crucial for maintaining the health and wellbeing of the body and in treating disease. Should I try acupuncture? Acupuncture treats a variety of conditions, however a lot of people believe that they should only seek treatment if they have a specific issue to address. Acupuncture is also beneficial to promote optimal health, prevent future disease, and for relaxation and stress relief. Many people come in with specific main complaints, but a lot of people also come in regularly to maintain health, feel more grounded and calm, and to address whatever comes up on a weekly basis. It's like maintenance for the whole person. What are Chinese Herbs used for? Chinese herbs are an important component of Traditional Chinese Medicine that can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatments to improve a vast number of symptoms or maintain overall health and wellness. Your Rocky Coast acupuncturist can guide you during your appointment to decide which herbs are right for you, or you can [schedule an herbal consult](/book-an-appointment) to explore these offerings more specifically. Acupuncture is often used alone and is only combined with Chinese herbal medicine when it has been discussed with your provider and has been determined to be a necessary element in your treatment plan. What CAN I expect at my appointment? Your first Rocky Coast appointment will be longer, allowing for your acupuncturist to complete a comprehensive review of your health history, discuss specific health concerns and/or symptoms and answer any questions you may have. For follow-up appointments, there will be an abbreviated check-in to cover any changes or updates since your last appointment. Following the check-in conversation, you will lie down on the table to begin your treatment. You may be asked to uncover certain points on your body, in which case appropriate cover will be provided as needed. Once needles are placed on the body, you will be left to rest for a period of time during which you may find yourself in a state of relaxation, possibly focused on the breath, the sensations in your body or you may even fall asleep! Specialty Areas Infertility Rocky Coast has been the premiere holistic fertility clinic of Maine and has been specializing in fertility treatment since our inception almost 20 years ago. We have been working in partnership with Reproductive Endocrinologists and OB/GYNs in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts to provide acupuncture and fertility support to thousands of women and men. Our approach to boosting fertility looks at every unique individual \u2014 including the conditions that could be leading to fertility challenges. Acupuncture and Chinese medicine can support your body as you try to conceive naturally, or in conjunction with Assisted Reproductive Technology. Acupuncture works by stimulating certain points that increase thickness of the uterine lining, improve blood flow to the ovaries and balance hormones related to the menstrual cycle which can lead to higher quality eggs. Additionally, we use acupuncture to relieve stress, anxiety or depression while you're trying to conceive and individualized treatment to prevent miscarriage after conception. Digestive Disorders Common bloating, abdomen discomfort, and irregular bowel movements are all signs of digestive problems. Anything can cause a dysfunctional gut \u2014 your body may process food poorly because of stress or emotions, maybe you have an allergy or intolerance. It could even be related to trauma, a virus, or your menstrual cycle. Traditional Chinese Medicine looks at the digestive system going beyond your mouth, intestines, and stomach. The issues of the gut can be traced to anywhere and it's our role to find where. We use acupuncture to stimulate organs to react more appropriately to food or activity in conjunction with [Chinese herbal medicine](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#chinese-herbal-medicine) and [nutrition counseling](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#nutritional-counseling) achieve a more balanced digestive system. CHRONIC PAIN That sore back or knee you've been dealing with for years? It simply won't get better by doing nothing. Maybe you work at a physically taxing job, have a nagging old injury, or want to avoid or reduce the use of pharmaceuticals. Whatever the case, acupuncture is clinically proven to relieve pain. When we insert needles into certain points the body releases endorphins, a natural pain-killing chemical that activates your body's healing. We work to minimize your pain and prevent the injury from becoming more severe with time, in addition to looking at possible root causes of any inflammation. When it comes to chronic pain, we may use a variety of techniques in addition to traditional acupuncture like [Chinese herbal medicine,](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#chinese-herbal-medicine) [electro-acupuncture](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#electro-acupuncture) and [dry needling.](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#dryneedling) MENTAL HEALTH The stigma around caring for your mental health is fading, yet millions of Americans struggle to balance their mental and emotional needs. Our team provides mental health support by listening, searching for root causes, and curating treatments to help you manage stress and mental health. While we can't always eliminate the stressors in our lives, we can adapt how our bodies respond. ANXIETY Agitated? Stiff neck? Difficulty concentrating? Anxiety can manifest in ways beyond excessive worrying or restlessness. Studies show that acupuncture is an effective treatment for anxiety, with fewer side effects than medications. Acupuncture works by calming the nervous system and stimulating the body's natural feel-good hormones to reduce stress and invite peace of mind. DEPRESSION Depression is one of the most common mental health issues we face today, affecting one in five people. Whether you want to avoid medication or use it in conjunction with other therapies, [acupuncture is an effective treatment](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-acupuncture-depression/acupuncture-as-good-as-counseling-for-depression-study-idUSBRE98N17420130924). In Traditional Chinese medicine, we look at depression as being stagnant Qi. Something in the body is stuck and we stimulate certain acupuncture points to remove blockages and restore balance to the organs, mind and body. This can help ease depression symptoms, as well as treat the underlying cause. PTSD Whether your traumatic experience happened recently or long ago, you deserve to feel safe and grounded. We use acupuncture to address the mental and physical effects of trauma to help people suffering from PTSD experience more joy and fulfillment in their lives. Our acupuncturists are trained to listen and treat you as an individual by restoring balance to your nervous system and release emotional pain that is being held in the body. Acupuncture can be used in conjunction with other therapies to help you return to an appropriate relationship with your body. Migraines 12% of the population suffer from regular migraines - disproportionately affecting American women at 18%, compared to 6% of men (Migraine Research Institute). Traditional Chinese Medicine offers a non-pharmacological treatment option to prevent migraines. When acupuncture needles are placed in certain locations along the body, it activates pathways in the brain that are responsible for turning off pain. We also look at treating any physical or emotional stress that may be amplifying the pain. While in some cases we can't stop someone's migraines altogether, we can work to ease the severity, duration and frequency of them. Insomnia Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In Traditional Chinese Medicine, when there is an imbalance in the adrenal system (spleen, heart, kidneys), it can lead to sleep disruptions. We address the roots that cause this disharmony of internal organs \u2014 chronic pain, stress, depression, anxiety, medication, hormones \u2014 to promote better sleep, in addition to treating the symptoms themselves. For insomnia, we often make [Chinese herbal medicine](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#chinese-herbal-medicine) suggestions to maximize treatment. SPORTS/ORTHOPEDIC No matter what level of athlete you are, acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can help by providing maintenance or addressing the source of pain or a recurring injury. This leads to drug-free long-term care. We use a whole-body approach to improve athletic performance and reduce pain. Acupuncture and TCM are beneficial for healing and preventing injuries, managing inflammation and soreness, improving sleep and menstrual cycles, and managing physical and emotional stress that comes with training. In addition to traditional acupuncture, we may use techniques like [electro-acupuncture](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#electro-acupuncture) and [dry needling.](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicines/#dryneedling) Reproductive Health Experiencing menopause or irregular menstruation? Want to lay the foundation for improved fertility and healthier pregnancy in the future? We use acupuncture and [Chinese herbal medicine](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#chinese-herbal-medicine) to balance hormones and treat conditions such as Endometriosis, PCOS, menopause, and PMS symptoms including migraines, weight gain, abdominal pain, digestive disruptions, anxiety and change in libido. PREGNANCY + POSTPARTUM SUPPORT Acupuncture is completely safe at all stages of a pregnancy. In the first trimester, it's extremely beneficial for nourishing the body to maintain the pregnancy and alleviating early symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and heartburn. The aches, sore muscles, inflammation, and digestive problems that come later can also be treated with acupuncture. In the final months of pregnancy, acupuncture helps to prepare the body for the onset of labor. The points used for pre-birth acupuncture help to relax and prepare the cervix and uterine muscles, while encouraging the baby to descend in the proper position. This can reduce the chances of induction or medical intervention, and produce faster, easier births. Additionally, acupuncture and [moxibustion](/family-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/#moxibustion) are very effective (69-85%) in flipping a breech baby before the 37th week by creating more space in the uterus. After childbirth, mothers can use acupuncture to bring equilibrium back to their minds and bodies. CANCER SUPPORT Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine can provide a number of benefits for clients undergoing cancer treatment that extend beyond strengthening immune function to stimulate the body healing itself. Acupuncture can boost energy to help combat post-chemo fatigue, relieve nausea and vomiting, reduce anxiety and depression, improve sleep, control pain and medication side-effects and promote a positive outlook. Traditional Chinese Medicine Techniques MOXIBUSTION The burning of moxa (ground mugwort) over the body's meridians or acupuncture points. The heat helps to stimulate points and the flow of Qi, which strengthens the blood. When things in the body are stagnant or stuck, we like to use this heat to get things moving. It's painless, but the recipient does feel a pleasant warming sensation. DRY NEEDLING Rather than placing a needle at an acupuncture point, dry needling involves placing needling on a \"trigger point\" in a knotted or hard muscle to release the tension. Clients may feel an immediate relief of pain or spasms, improving flexibility and range of motion. Chinese Herbal Medicine Chinese herbs are an important component of Traditional Chinese Medicine that can be used alone or in conjunction with acupuncture treatments to improve a vast number of symptoms or maintain overall health and wellness.

ELECTRO-ACUPUNCTURE Like traditional acupuncture, we insert needles on certain points along the body and then attach them to a device that generates continuous electric pulses. It produces a gentle tingling sensation. Your practitioner may choose to integrate this into your treatment to give an extra boost to the treatment. INFRARED Therapy A TDP heat lamp is a specific electromagnetic lamp that produces infrared emissions. It helps to increase circulation, loosen muscles, and to accelerate the body's natural healing processes. The Celluma light uses LED therapy to improve cellular health, which relieves pain, reduces signs of aging, and eliminates acne. Nutritional Counseling Food or diet recommendations based on Traditional Chinese Medicine that aim to achieve balance within the body. Adjunctive Therapies Non-invasive techniques designed to optimize wellness at home. Ear Seeds are tiny balls that we place on certain points on the ear that can be stimulated at home to relieve symptoms. Press tacks are stainless steel needles attached to waterproof and breathable tape. Although the needles do not puncture the skin as a traditional acupuncture needle would, they do provide continuous stimulation at important points when applied. "}
