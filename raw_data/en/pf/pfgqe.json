A: It can be used in a similar way, to help with minor pain or keep fever balanced (it won't get rid of the fever, but may help the body from driving it too high). But it does not work in the same way, by blocking pain. Instead, it works with your body to help you get better. Q: How often can I use this? A: As needed. Take one dose, and if there is no change in 15 - 20 minutes, take another. Continue use every 3 - 4 hours until you are well again!

Infants, children, and adults \u2014 including pregnant and nursing women \u2014 can all use this. Q: What if my child takes too much? Is it dangerous? A: Unlike OTC remedies, the herbs in this formula are not dangerous, even at high doses. Your child could drink the bottle and there is no concern about toxicity! Q: Can I use it alongside Tylenol or another conventional remedy? A: With any OTC, yes. We cannot advise on prescription drug interactions; please consult a doctor.

Q: Plants don't seem 'strong enough' to replace the remedies I'm used to. Does this really work? A: Yes! Plants are a lot more powerful than you may know. There are lots of studies about what they can do in our bodies. Give this a try and see for yourself how well it works! (And don't forget to "}
