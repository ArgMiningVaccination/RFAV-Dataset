Yesterday, the Center For Disease Control made an historic announcement you need to know about. They actually admitted that the flu vaccine has not been working. And it hasn't been working for years. A vaccine is effective if it prevents 90% of the people who receive the shot from getting the disease. Last year the flu shot protected only 42%. And the CDC has gone so far as to admit that for four out of the past seven years, the flu shot has been ineffective. This is especially true for seniors, arguably the people who need it the most. So why isn't the flu shot working? As with many of the concepts I teach you, there are many issues at play here. But let me simplify it for you. 1. Vaccines only activate one immune system You have two types of immune responses: innate and adapted. Vaccines - including the flu shot - only activate one of your immune responses. This is why you need boosters. This is also why we are getting outbreaks like mumps and measles even in vaccinated people. Bottom line: vaccines, especially the flu shot, are not as effective as you have been told. 2. Too many toxins Your flu shot comes with a high dose of mercury. In fact, the flu shot has the highest mercury level of all vaccines. The type of mercury in a vaccine is called thimerosal. According to the World Health Organization, exposure to mercury - even small amounts - may cause serious health problems, and is a threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life. It also has toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, as well as on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. And yes, it's in your flu shot. Lots of it. What else is in your flu shot? - Formaldehyde - Aluminum - Chicken egg proteins - Antibiotics Watch this enlightening [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/maryn_mckenna_what_do_we_do_when_antibiotics_don_t_work_any_more) given by Maryn McKenna on how the overuse of antibiotics is weakening our immune systems. The flu shot has antibiotics in it. The CDC has stopped making antibiotics because they are considered to be no longer effective, which makes you wonder if they will be forced to do the same with the vaccines. 3. Gut damage The toxins you have been exposed to in your foods, vaccines, water, and air are destroying your gut. And 80% of your immune system is in your gut. Vaccines are going to become more and more ineffective if we don't solve this gut issue. This is why you will see me talking about the gut so much. It's key to your immune system, your mental health, weight loss, and energy. In order to be healthy, you need a happy gut. Flu shots damage the gut even more, as the Ted Talk above details. People are being frightened into getting the flu shot without being told the downside. And now the flu shot is not working. I hope I opened your eyes a bit. I know it's hard when your medical doctor encourages vaccines, but you must become your own advocate. You need to look closer at the current research. Big pharma wants to scare you and keep you medicated. Don't ever forget you were born in a body that is ridiculously powerful. Treat it well and your health will grow beyond your wildest dreams.
