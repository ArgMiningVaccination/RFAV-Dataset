Traditional medicine primarily focuses on just one area to control the symptoms; despite the reality that the human body is designed with multiple systems working together. For example, if you have digestive issues, your gut is not the only part that is affected \u2014 your whole body is affected. Utilizing Integrative Medicine, our team focuses on looking at each patient as a whole, to establish all of the contributing factors to his or her health. Doing this gives a complete picture of the patient's health, enabling our team to get to the root cause of the disease and establish a customized treatment plan. Our team of Naturopathic Medicine doctors is focused on giving patients a more personalized experience by establishing a partnership with patients that encourages them to take an active role in their health. We use a variety of tools to help restore health, beginning with a focus on the diet and lifestyle of the patient. From there, we follow a \"least force intervention\" approach, such as acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic, and/or supplements, as the patient's condition and responses dictate. The human body has an amazing ability to heal itself, and it's our job to support that process. Learn more about our integrative medicine practices below or [contact us here ](/contact)for more information. FAMILY PRACTICE CARE From infants to seniors, family practice care integrates a broad-spectrum approach to primary care with the consideration of health-impacting social determinants and community factors, while also serving as an advocate for the patient in an increasingly complex healthcare system. Unlike other narrowly focused specialties, family medicine includes the biological, clinical, and behavioral sciences, encompassing all ages, sexes, organ systems and disease entities. Our practitioners serve as your first point of entry for health care services and are ready to provide you with greater access to care. NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE/NATURAL MEDICINE Our team of Naturopathic Medicine doctors is focused on giving patients a more personalized experience by establishing a partnership with patients that encourages them to take an active role in their health. We use a variety of tools to help restore health, beginning with a focus on the diet and lifestyle of the patient. From there, we follow a \"least force intervention\" approach, such as acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic, and/or supplements, as the patient's condition and responses dictate. The human body has an amazing ability to heal itself, and it's our job to support that process. CHIROPRACTIC Our doctors of chiropractic practice a drug-free, hands-on approach to health care, starting with patient examination, diagnosis and treatment. Our team focuses on the disorders of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, the effects of these disorders on general health, and how we can treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, including, but not limited to, back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. ACUPUNCTURE At Ideal Health & Wellness, we believe the energy that flows through the body is essential for health. Utilizing acupuncture, we are able to correct energy flow imbalances at identifiable points close to the skin and utilize this practice to treat identifiable pathophysiological conditions. IV NUTRITIONAL THERAPY We proudly offer a variety of IV Nutritional Therapy options that we will customize to meet your needs. It is important to stay proactive and keep your body healthy. FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE We utilize Functional Medicine to focus on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease. Each symptom or differential diagnosis may be one of many contributing to an individual's illness and we're here to help you establish lasting benefits beyond symptom suppression.
