Although vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed and approved under emergency use authorization, various adverse events have also been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. This review was undertaken to help clinicians recognize the possible manifestations and systemic pathogenesis, especially those related to the eye, after receiving COVID-19 vaccination. A systemic search was performed on 22 August 2021 through Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library for publications on ocular manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination. Two case-control studies/retrospective cohort studies, one cross-sectional study, three case series, sixteen case reports, two images, and seven letters were included. Ocular manifestations after receiving COVID-19 vaccines may appear on the eyelid, cornea and ocular surface, retina, uvea, nerve, and vessel. The ocular manifestations occurred up to forty-two days after vaccination, and vaccine-induced immunologic responses may be responsible. Although the incidence rate of ocular symptoms is considerably lower in the vaccinated subjects than in COVID-19 patients, physicians should be aware of the possible associations between COVID-19 vaccines and ocular symptoms for the early diagnosis and treatment of vision problems or life-threatening complications.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-11-27", "cleaned_text": "A Systematic Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9121404](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9121404) [Safety Concerns, Sources of Liability, Compensation Strategies and the Right to Be Informed: Ethical and Legal Issues of COVID-19 and mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-01404)] belong to the category of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, while ChAdO\u00d71 (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Oxford, UK) [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-01404)] and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-01404)] belong to the category of adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines. Several adverse events, including ocular manifestations, have been reported after vaccination. In this study, we aimed to review all reported ocular side effects of the available COVID-19 vaccines. 2. Materials and Methods [7](#B7-vaccines-09-01404)]. 2.1. Search Strategy 2.2. Study Selection [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-01404-f001). A total of 341 studies were initially found after searching the databases according to the search strategy. The Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library searches yielded 256, 71 and 14 results respectively, of which 36 studies were excluded because of duplicate articles. We screened a total of 305 titles and abstracts for eligibility. Among these, 252 studies were excluded due to irrelevance and 53 studies were selected for full-text evaluation. We excluded 5 of these studies due to reports not being retrieved, leaving 48 articles suitable for inclusion. After full-text evaluation, 18 studies were excluded due to no relevant and 1 study was excluded due to unknown vaccine. On the other hand, 1 study was identified from websites, while another article was identified through a citation search. Finally, 31 reports matched the inclusion criteria of our study. 2.3. Data Extraction and Analysis [8](#B8-vaccines-09-01404)] and Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine for ratings of individual studies [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-01404)]. Characteristics of ocular manifestations after receiving COVID-19 vaccine and their related reports are presented in [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01404-t001). 3. Results 3.1. Eyelid - Cornea and graft rejection after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) [13](#B13-vaccines-09-01404)]. Wasser et al. reported two cases of corneal graft rejection after the first dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01404)]. A 73-year-old male with a history of PKP in the left eye due to keratoconus and underwent regrafting due to late endothelial failure two years prior. He experienced left eye discomfort 13 days after vaccination. Left eye ciliary injection, corneal edema, Descemet folds, and keratic precipitates (KP) were noted, and corneal graft rejection was diagnosed. The other patient was a 56-year-old male with a history of bilateral keratoconus who underwent PKP 25 and seven years ago in the right and left eyes, respectively. Right eye regraft was performed due to late endothelial failure 10 months previously. He developed blurred vision in the right eye 14 days after vaccination. Right eye corneal edema, KPs, and AC cells were noted, and corneal graft rejection was diagnosed [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01404)]. - Corneal graft rejection after Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) [15](#B15-vaccines-09-01404)]. He developed a decrease in vision seven days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. A right eye conjunctival injection and corneal edema were noted. The central corneal thickness was 714 m, and corneal endothelial graft rejection was diagnosed. Phylactou et al. reported two cases with a history of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy who underwent DMEK with acute corneal endothelial graft rejection after administration of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01404)]. A 66-year-old female who underwent DMEK of the right eye 21 days prior developed blurred vision seven days after the first dose of the vaccine. Right eye conjunctival injection, diffuse corneal edema, and fine KPs were noted, and corneal endothelial graft rejection of the right eye was diagnosed. Another 83-year-old female underwent DMEK six and three years prior in the right and left eyes, respectively. She had bilateral blurring of vision, pain, photophobia, and redness three weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. Bilateral circumcorneal injections, KPs, and AC inflammation were also noted. The central corneal thickness was 660 \u00b5m and 622 \u00b5m in the right and left eyes, respectively. A diagnosis of bilateral simultaneous acute endothelial graft rejection was made. 3.3. Retina - Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN) [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01404)]. Fundoscopy of the eye revealed a delicate teardrop-shaped macular lesion located nasally with respect to the fovea. Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated slight hyperreflectivity of the outer nuclear and plexiform layers and disruption of the ellipsoid zone. Thus, AMN of the left eye was diagnosed. Gabkak et al. reported a 20-year-old female with a history of oral contraceptives and with bilateral flickering scotoma after administration of the ChAdO\u00d71 COVID-19 vaccine [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01404)]. Fundoscopy revealed subtle brightening around the fovea. OCT showed hyperreflective plaques and disruption of the ellipsoid junction. Therefore, bilateral AMN was diagnosed. Book et al. reported a previously healthy 21-year-old female with bilateral paracentral scotomas three days after receiving the first ChAdO\u00d71 COVID-19 vaccine [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-01404)]. Infrared reflectance imaging showed bilateral circumscribed paracentral dark lesions that matched outer plexiform layer thickening and discontinuity of the ellipsoid band on OCT. A diagnosis of bilateral AMN was made. Mambretti et al. reported a 22-year-old female and a 28-year-old female who were on long-term oral contraceptives they developed acute onset of paracentral scotoma two days after receiving the ChAdO\u00d71 COVID-19 vaccine. Multimodal retinal imaging was consistent with AMN in both cases [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-01404)]. - Central serous retinopathy [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01404)]. - Retinal detachment Superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) thrombosis [31](#B31-vaccines-09-01404)]. On the other hand, Bayas et al. reported a 55-year-old previously healthy female who developed conjunctival congestion, retro-orbital pain, and diplopia 10 days after receiving the first dose of ChAdO\u00d71 COVID-19 vaccine. Laboratory investigations revealed thrombocytopenia. IgG-ELISA for PF4-heparin complex antibodies was negative. MRI showed SOV thrombosis with no contrast filling [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01404)]. - Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [33](#B33-vaccines-09-01404)]. Wolf et al. reported a 46-year-old previously healthy female who developed headache, hemianopia to the right, and aphasia 13 days after receiving the ChAdO\u00d71 COVID-19 vaccine. Laboratory examination revealed thrombocytopenia. IgG-ELISA for the PF4-heparin complex antibody was positive. MRI showed thrombotic occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus and the sinus and sigmoid sinus. occipital intracerebral hemorrhage was also noted [ [34](#B34-vaccines-09-01404)]. Suresh et al. reported a 27-year-old male who developed headache associated with eye floaters and vomiting 48 h after receiving the first dose of the ChADO\u00d71 COVID-19 vaccine. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated D-dimer levels, low platelet counts, and fibrinogen levels. IgG-ELISA for the PF4-heparin complex antibody was positive, while CT venogram showed CVST. However, the headache worsened, and new homonymous hemianopia occurred the following day. Repeat CT showed right parietal lobe hemorrhage [ [35](#B35-vaccines-09-01404)]. Dias et al. reported a 47-year-old female with a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to adenomyosis and oral contraceptives. She developed persistent headache, nausea, and photophobia six days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Three days after the consult, she experienced sudden left hemiparesis. Papilledema, left visual extinction, and right gaze deviation were noted. Laboratory investigations revealed a normal platelet count. Brain MRI with venography revealed CVST with venous infarct. IgG-ELISA for PF4-heparin complex antibodies, measured two months after the event, were negative [ [36](#B36-vaccines-09-01404)]. See et al. conducted a case series of six patients with CVST with thrombocytopenia after receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. A female patient experienced headache and visual changes six days after vaccination. After 10 days, she developed ecchymoses, periorbital and lower extremity petechiae, and intermittent shortness of breath. Seventeen days after vaccination, she suddenly lost consciousness, and thrombocytopenia was noted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed CVST and right internal jugular vein thrombosis [ [37](#B37-vaccines-09-01404)]. - Thrombocytopenia with acute ischemic stroke and bleeding [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01404)]. 3.7. Other Reports with Only Ocular Symptoms Mentioned [40](#B40-vaccines-09-01404)]. Santovito et al. reported that a middle-aged, previously healthy male developed a sudden onset of darkening of the visual field three days after receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. He also developed light confusion, asthenia, and profound nausea [ [39](#B39-vaccines-09-01404)]. 4. Discussion [41](#B41-vaccines-09-01404)]. 4.1. mRNA Vaccines [41](#B41-vaccines-09-01404)]. The mRNA is delivered in lipid nanoparticles and induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon gamma (IFN), antigen-specific CD4+ cell responses, IFN-producing CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) and virus antigen-specific T cells may induce corneal allograft rejection [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01404), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-01404), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01404)]. mRNA vaccines can also stimulate innate immunity through toll-like receptors, which are related to reactivation and maintenance of herpesviruses in the host [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-01404)]. The mRNA vaccine can increase free extracellular mRNA, which may increase the permeability of endothelial cells and cause choriocapillaris leakage. Moreover, mRNA vaccines may trigger endogenous glucocorticoid release to increase serum cortisol levels. Lipid nanoparticles consisting of polyethylene glycol, which may induce activation of the complement pathway, could lead to choroidal vessel thickening and neovascularization. All these factors may contribute to CSCR [ [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01404)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-09-01404), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-01404)]. These immune reactions play an important role in the formation of uveitis. Similarly, antibodies against spike proteins and activated Th1 cells can cross-react with proteins and antigens in the outer retinal layers, retinal pigment epithelial cells, and large arteries, which may induce AZOOR and AAION [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01404)]. Other possible effects induced by mRNA vaccines include microangiopathy, localized vasculitis, and demyelination, which cause the presence of eyelid purpuric and ecchymotic lesions and abducens nerve [30](#B30-vaccines-09-01404)]. 4.2. Adenoviral Vector Vaccines [43](#B43-vaccines-09-01404), [44](#B44-vaccines-09-01404)]. However, evidence has shown that during transcription, alternative splice events might cause the formation of C-terminally truncated, which may lead to formation of soluble spike protein. These soluble spike variants may induce thrombotic events via an antibody-mediated mechanism when binding to ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in blood vessels [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-01404), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-01404)]. Other possible causes of thrombosis include spike protein interactions with different C-type lectin receptors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and the CD147 receptor. Lastly, adenovirus vectors may interact with the CD46 receptor or platelet factor 4 antibodies to cause thrombosis [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01404)]. [46](#B46-vaccines-09-01404)]. Moreover, 15 cases of TTS were reported in the United States after administration of 7.98 million doses of Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccination during 2 March-21 April 2021 [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-01404)]. Although the mechanism of TTS is not clear, the clinical course and laboratory test results of TTS are similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia which is triggered by the formation of PF4 antibodies [ [37](#B37-vaccines-09-01404), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-01404)]. The TTS occurred mostly in middle aged women 5-24 days after vaccination. The platelet count ranged from 7000 to 113,000 platelets per cubic millimeter, and most cases were positive for PF4-heparin antibodies [ [48](#B48-vaccines-09-01404)]. The TTS can cause thrombus formation in arteries or veins, which might lead to CVST and SOV thrombosis. By 4 April 2021, 169 cases of CVST were reported among 34 million people vaccinated in the European Economic Area and United Kingdom with the ChAdO\u00d71 COVID-19 vaccine [ [48](#B48-vaccines-09-01404)]. According to our reviewed cases, the disease can present as headache with blurred vision, limited ocular be triggered by the adenoviral vector-targeted B cell immune response. The immune reaction can induce the reactivation of optic neuritis with longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis in longstanding stable MS [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01404)]. The relationship between adenoviral vector vaccines and all of the ocular symptoms mentioned should be further investigated. We agreed with Ng et al. that the pathogenesis of the ocular symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination may be the immune response toward the vaccine [ [50](#B50-vaccines-09-01404)]. Thus, other studies are needed to prove a causal link between the observed event and the vaccine, which may contribute to future vaccine development. 5. Conclusions [51](#B51-vaccines-09-01404)]. In conclusion, although ocular manifestations may develop after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, people are still encouraged to get vaccinated since the benefits outweigh the risks.
