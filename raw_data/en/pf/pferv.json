{"title": "Dietary Factors", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2015-11-06", "cleaned_text": "Some of the listed dietary factors (i.e., L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and lipoic acid) can be synthesized by the body. Contents L-Carnitine (-hydroxy--N-trimethylaminobutyric acid) is a derivative of the [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid), lysine (Figure 1). It was first isolated from meat (carnus in Latin) in 1905. Only the L- [isomer](../glossary#isomer) of carnitine is biologically active [(1)](#references). L-Carnitine appeared as a [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) in the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) and was therefore termed vitamin BT [(2)](#reference2). Vitamin BT, however, is a misnomer because humans and other higher organisms can synthesize L-carnitine (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Under certain conditions, the demand for L-carnitine may exceed an individual's capacity to synthesize it, making it a [conditionally essential nutrient](../glossary#conditionally-essential-nutrient) [(3, 4)](#reference3). In healthy [endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) of L-carnitine, absorption of carnitine from dietary sources, and reabsorption of carnitine by the kidneys [(5)](#reference5). Humans [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) lysine and [methionine](../glossary#methionine) in process several cell compartments ( [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol), [lysosomes](../glossary#lysosome), and [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria)) (reviewed in [6](#reference6)). [protein](../glossary#protein)-bound lysine is [methylated](../glossary#methylation) to form -N-trimethyllysine in a reaction [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by specific lysine methyltransferases that use S-adenosyl-methionine (derived from methionine) as a methyl donor. -N-Trimethyllysine is released for carnitine synthesis by protein [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis). Four [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) are involved in endogenous L-carnitine biosynthesis (Figure 2). They are all ubiquitous except -butyrobetaine hydroxylase is absent from cardiac and skeletal muscle. This enzyme is, however, highly expressed in human liver, testes, and kidney [(7)](#reference7). L-carnitine is primarily synthesized in the liver and transported via the bloodstream to cardiac and skeletal muscle, which rely on L-carnitine for [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) yet cannot synthesize it [(8)](#reference8). The rate of L-carnitine biosynthesis in humans was studied in strict vegetarians (i.e., in people who consume very little dietary carnitine) and estimated to be 1.2 \u00b5mol/kg of body weight/day [(9)](#reference9). The rate of L-carnitine synthesis depends on the extent to which peptide-linked lysines are methylated and the rate of protein turnover. There is some indirect evidence to suggest that excess lysine in the diet may increase endogenous L-carnitine synthesis; however, changes in dietary carnitine intake level or in renal reabsorption do not appear to affect the rate of endogenous L-carnitine synthesis [(6)](#reference6). The [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of L-carnitine from food can vary depending on dietary composition. For instance, one study reported that bioavailability of L-carnitine in individuals adapted to low-carnitine diets (i.e., vegetarians) was higher (66%-86%) than in those adapted to high-carnitine diets (i.e., regular red meat eaters; 54%-72%) [(10)](#reference10). The is degraded by [colonic](../glossary#colon) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria). While [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of L-carnitine from the diet is quite high (see [Dietary L-carnitine](#absorption)), absorption from oral L-carnitine [supplements](../glossary#supplement) is considerably lower. The bioavailability of L-carnitine from oral supplements (doses, 0.6 to 7 g) ranges between 5% and 25% of the total dose [(5)](#reference5). Less is known regarding the metabolism of the [acetylated](../glossary#acetylation) form of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR); however, the bioavailability of ALCAR is thought to be higher than that of L-carnitine. The results of [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) experiments suggested that ALCAR might be partially [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) upon intestinal absorption [(11)](#reference11). In humans, administration of 2 g/day of ALCAR for 50 days increased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) ALCAR concentrations by 43%, suggesting that either ALCAR was absorbed without prior [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis) or that L-carnitine [Renal](../glossary#renal) reabsorption of free L-carnitine is normally very efficient; in fact, an estimated 95% is thought to be reabsorbed by the kidneys [(1)](#references). Therefore, carnitine excretion by the kidney is usually very low. However, several conditions can decrease the efficiency of carnitine reabsorption and, correspondingly, increase carnitine deficiency](#primary-deficiency)) [(12)](#reference12). In addition, when circulating L-carnitine concentration increases, as in the case of oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement), renal reabsorption of L-carnitine may become saturated, resulting in increased urinary excretion of L-carnitine [(5)](#reference5). Dietary or supplemental L-carnitine that is not absorbed by [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte) is degraded by [colonic](../glossary#colon) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) to form two principal products, trimethylamine and -butyrobetaine. -Butyrobetaine is eliminated in the feces; trimethylamine is efficiently absorbed and [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) to trimethylamine-N-oxide, which is excreted in the urine [(13)](#reference13). L-Carnitine is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) primarily in the liver but also in the kidneys and then transported to other tissues. It is most concentrated in tissues that use [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) as their primary fuel, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle. In this regard, L-carnitine plays an important role in energy production by [conjugating](../glossary#conjugation) to fatty acids for transport from the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol) into the [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) L-Carnitine is required for energy acids must be esterified to L-carnitine (acylcarnitine) in order to enter the mitochondrial matrix where -oxidation occurs (Figure 3). On the outer mitochondrial membrane, CPTI (carnitine-palmitoyl transferase I) esterified to coenzyme A (CoA) to L-carnitine. This reaction is a rate-controlling step for the -oxidation of fatty acid [(13)](#reference13). A transport protein called CACT (carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase) facilitates the transport of acylcarnitine across the inner mitochondrial membrane. On the inner mitochondrial membrane, CPTII (carnitine-palmitoyl transferase II) catalyzes the transfer acids from L-carnitine to free CoA. Fatty acyl-CoA is then metabolized through -oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix, ultimately yielding propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA [(6)](#reference6). Carnitine is eventually recycled back to the cytosol (Figure 3). Free (nonesterified) CoA is required as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for numerous cellular reactions. The flux through pathways that require nonesterified CoA, such as the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of [glucose](../glossary#glucose), may be reduced if all the CoA available in a given cell compartment is esterified. Carnitine can increase the availability of nonesterified CoA for these other metabolic pathways CoA to carnitine (Figure 3). The resulting acylcarnitine [esters](../glossary#ester) (e.g., acetylcarnitine) can remain in the mitochondrial matrix or be exported back into the cytosol via CACT. Free (nonesterified) CoA can then participate in other reactions, such as the generation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate in a reaction catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase [(14)](#reference14). Acetyl-CoA can then be oxidized produce energy ( [ATP](../glossary#ATP)) in the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle). In addition to its importance for energy production, L-carnitine was shown to display direct [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) properties [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [(15)](#reference15). Age-related declines in [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) function and increases in mitochondrial [oxidant](../glossary#oxidation) production are thought to be important contributors to the adverse effects of aging. Tissue L-carnitine concentrations have been found to decline with age in humans and animals [(16)](#reference16). The expression of most [proteins](../glossary#protein) involved in the transport of carnitine (OCTN2) and the acylcarnitine shuttling system across the mitochondrial membrane (CPTIa, CPTII, and CAT; Figure 3) was also found to be much lower in the white blood cells of healthy older adults than of younger adults [(17)](#reference17). Preclinical studies in rodents showed that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with high doses of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR; Figure 1) reversed a number of age-related changes in liver mitochondrial function yet increased liver mitochondrial oxidant production [(18)](#reference18). ALCAR supplementation in rats has also been found to improve or reverse age-related mitochondrial declines in skeletal and cardiac muscular function [(19, 20)](#reference19). Co-supplementation of aged rats with L-carnitine and [DNA](../glossary#DNA) strand breaks in a variety of tissues (heart, skeletal muscle, and brain) [(21-30)](#reference21). Co-supplementation for three months improved both the number of total and intact mitochondria and mitochondrial ALCAR exerts antioxidant activities in rodents, it is not known whether taking high doses of ALCAR will have similar effects in humans. Nutritional carnitine deficiencies have not been identified in healthy people without metabolic disorders, suggesting that most people can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) enough L-carnitine [(1)](#references). Even strict vegetarians (vegans) show no signs of carnitine deficiency, despite the fact that most dietary carnitine is derived from animal sources [(9)](#reference9). Infants, particularly premature infants, are born with low stores of L-carnitine, which could put them at [risk](../glossary#risk) of deficiency given their rapid rate of growth. One study reported that infants fed carnitine-free, soy-based formulas grew normally and showed no signs of a clinically relevant carnitine deficiency; however, some biochemical measures related to [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) differed significantly from infants fed the same formula [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with L-carnitine [(31)](#reference31). Soy-based infant formulas are now [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with the amount of L-carnitine normally found in human milk [(32)](#reference32). [Renal](../glossary#renal) filtration maintains [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of free carnitine around 40 to 50 micromoles (\u00b5mol)/L, while plasma concentrations of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR; the most abundant carnitine ester) are around 3 to 6 \u00b5mol/L [(8)](#reference8). Regardless of the [etiology](../glossary#etiology), plasma concentrations of free carnitine 20 \u00b5mol/L and increased acylcarnitine/free carnitine ratios (0.4) are considered abnormal [(6)](#reference6). Low carnitine [status](../glossary#status) is generally due to impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism or to carnitine not being efficiently reabsorbed by the kidneys. The rate of carnitine [excretion](../glossary#excretion) is not a useful indicator of carnitine status because it can vary with dietary carnitine intake and other physiologic parameters. At present, there is no test that assesses functional carnitine deficiency in humans [(6)](#reference6). Primary systemic carnitine deficiency is a rare, [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) disorder caused by [mutations](../glossary#mutation) (including deletions) in the SLC22A5 [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for carnitine transporter protein OCTN2 (organic cation transporter novel 2) [(33)](#reference33). Individuals with defective carnitine transport have poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, impaired L-carnitine reabsorption by the kidneys (i.e., increased urinary loss of L-carnitine), and defective L-carnitine uptake by muscles [(4)](#reference4). The clinical presentation can vary widely depending on the type of mutation affecting SLC22A5 and the phenotypic manifestation of the mutation, i.e., age of onset, organ involvement, and severity of symptoms at the time of diagnosis [(34)](#reference34). The disorder usually presents in early childhood and is characterized by episodes of hypoketotic [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia) (that can cause [encephalopathy](../glossary#encephalopathy)), [hepatomegaly](../glossary#hepatomegaly), [(34, 35)](#reference34). The metabolic and myopathic symptoms in infants and children can be fatal such that treatment should start promptly to prevent irreversible organ damage [(34)](#reference34). The diagnosis is established by demonstrating abnormally low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) free carnitine concentrations, reduced carnitine transport of [fibroblasts](../glossary#fibroblast) from skin biopsy, and molecular analysis of the gene coding for OCTN2 [(33, 34)](#reference33). Treatment consists of [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of L-carnitine that are meant to maintain a normal blood carnitine concentration, thereby preventing the risk of hypoglycemia and correcting metabolic and myopathic manifestations [(34)](#reference34). Secondary carnitine deficiency or depletion may result from either genetic or acquired conditions. Hereditary causes include genetic defects in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid), [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency [(36)](#reference36). Such inherited disorders lead to a buildup of organic acids, which are subsequently removed from the body via urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of acylcarnitine [esters](../glossary#ester). Increased urinary losses of carnitine can lead to the systemic depletion of carnitine [(6)](#reference6). Systemic carnitine depletion can also occur in disorders of impaired [renal](../glossary#renal) reabsorption. For instance, Fanconi's syndrome is a hereditary or acquired condition in which the proximal tubular reabsorption function of the kidneys is impaired [(37)](#reference37). This malfunction consequently results in increased urinary losses of carnitine. Patients with renal disease who undergo [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) are at [risk](../glossary#risk) for secondary carnitine deficiency because hemodialysis removes carnitine from the blood (see [End-stage renal disease](#end-stage-renal-disease-treatment)) [(38)](#reference38). One example of an exclusively acquired carnitine deficiency involves chronic use of pivalate-conjugated antibiotics. Pivalate is a branched-chain fatty acid anion that is metabolized to form an acyl-CoA ester, which is transesterified to carnitine and subsequently excreted the urine as pivaloyl carnitine. Urinary losses of carnitine via this route can be 10-fold greater than the sum of daily carnitine intake and [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) and lead to systemic carnitine depletion (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)) [(39)](#reference39). Finally, a number of [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in carnitine shuttling and fatty acid [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) pathways do not systematically result in carnitine depletion (such that carnitine supplementation may not help mitigate the symptoms) but lead to abnormal profiles of acylcarnitine esters in blood [(35](#reference35), [40)](#reference40). [Endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) of L-carnitine [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by the action of four different [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) (Figure 2). This process and the form of nicotinamide may also require [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) (ascorbate) [(4)](#reference4). One of the earliest symptoms of vitamin C deficiency is fatigue, thought to be related to decreased synthesis of L-carnitine [(41)](#reference41). In most studies discussed below, it is important to note that treatment with L-carnitine or acyl-L-carnitine esters (i.e., acetyl-L-carnitine [ALCAR], propionyl-L-carnitine; Figure 1) was generally used as an [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to standard medical therapy, not in place of it. It is also important to consider the fact that the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of L-carnitine and acylcarnitine derivatives administered orally is low (~10-20%) (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration is more likely to increase [plasma](../glossary#plasma) carnitine concentration, yet [homeostatic](../glossary#homeostasis) mechanisms tightly control blood concentration through [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and [renal](../glossary#renal) [excretion](../glossary#excretion): Up to 90% of 2 g of L-carnitine administered intravenously is excreted into the urine within 12 to 24 hours. Only a fraction of the dose is thought to enter the endogenous carnitine pool \u2014 largely found in skeletal muscle (reviewed in [8](#reference8)). Several small [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have explored whether [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) L-carnitine could improve [glucose tolerance](../glossary#glucose-tolerance) in people with impaired glucose [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). A potential benefit of L-carnitine in these patients is based on the fact that it can (i) increase the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of long-chain [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) which accumulation may contribute to [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) in skeletal muscle, and (ii) enhance [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization by reducing acyl-CoA concentration within the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) matrix (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)) [(42)](#reference42). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of five trials in participants with either impaired fasting glucose, type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis found evidence of an improvement in insulin resistance with supplemental L-carnitine compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(43)](#reference43). Another meta-analysis of four [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trials found evidence of a reduction in fasting plasma glucose concentration and no improvement of [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) concentration in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus supplemented with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) [(44)](#reference44). A third meta-analysis of 16 trials suggested that supplementation with (acyl)-L-carnitine may reduce fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin concentrations, but not resistance to [insulin](../glossary#insulin) [(45)](#reference45). In a recent [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the effect of ALCAR was examined in 229 participants treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), and [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia) [(46)](#reference46). ALCAR supplementation (1 g/day had no effect on [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) or [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure), markers of kidney function (i.e., glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria), markers of glucose [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) (i.e., glucose disposal rate, glycated hemoglobin concentration, and a measure of insulin resistance), and blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile (i.e., concentrations of [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides), [lipoprotein (a)](../glossary#lipoprotein-a), [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), [HDL](../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol, and total cholesterol) [(46)](#reference46). In the studies discussed below it is important to note that treatment with L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine was used as an [ adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) (in addition) to appropriate medical therapy, not in place of it. [Myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (MI) occurs when an [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaque in a [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) ruptures and obstructs the blood supply to the heart muscle, causing injury or damage to the heart (see the page on [Heart Attack](../health-disease/heart-attack)). Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have explored whether L-carnitine administration immediately after MI diagnosis could reduce injury to heart muscle resulting from [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) and improve clinical outcomes. An early trial in 160 men and women diagnosed with a recent MI showed that oral L-carnitine (4 g/day) in addition to standard pharmacological treatment for one year significantly reduced mortality and the occurrence of [angina](../health-disease/angina-pectoris) attacks compared to the control [(47)](#reference47). In another controlled trial in 96 patients, treatment with [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) L-carnitine (5 g bolus followed by 10 g/day for three days) following a MI resulted in lower concentrations of creatine kinase-MB and troponin-I, two markers of cardiac injury [(48)](#reference48). However, not all clinical trials have found L-carnitine supplementation to be beneficial after MI. For example, in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 60 participants diagnosed with an acute MI, neither mortality nor [echocardiographic](../glossary#echocardiography) measures of cardiac function differed between patients treated with intravenous L-carnitine (6 g/day) for seven days followed by oral L-carnitine (3 g/day) for three months and those given a placebo [(49)](#reference49). Another randomized placebo-controlled trial in 2,330 patients with acute MI, L-carnitine therapy (9 g/day intravenously for five days, then 4 g/day orally for six months) did not affect the risk of [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) and death six months after MI [(50)](#reference50). A 2013 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that L-carnitine therapy in patients who experienced an MI reduced the risks of all-cause mortality (-27%; 11 trials; 3,579 angina attacks (-40%; 2 trials; 261 participants), but had no effect on the risks of having a subsequent myocardial infarction or developing heart failure [(51)](#reference51). Because about 90% of oral L-carnitine supplements is unlikely to be absorbed, one could ask whether the efficacy is equivalent between protocols using both intravenous and oral administration and those using oral administration only [(8)](#reference8). This has not been examined in subgroup analyses. Heart failure is described as the heart's inability to pump enough blood for all of the body's needs (see the page on [Heart Failure](../health-disease/heart-failure)). In [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), accumulation of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaque in the [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-artery) may prevent heart regions from getting adequate circulation, ultimately resulting in cardiac damage and impaired pumping ability. [Myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) may also damage the heart muscle, which could potentially lead to heart failure. Further, the diminished heart's capacity to pump blood in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy may lead to heart failure. Because physical exercise increases the demand on the weakened heart, measures of exercise tolerance are frequently used to monitor the severity of heart failure. [Echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography) is also used to determine the left [ventricular](../glossary#ventricles) ejection fraction (LVEF), an objective measure of the heart's pumping ability. An LVEF of less than 40% is indicative of systolic heart failure [(52)](#reference52). An abnormal acylcarnitine profile and a high acylcarnitine to free carnitine ratio in the blood of patients with heart failure have been linked to disease severity and poor prognosis [(53-55)](#reference53). Addition of L-carnitine to standard medical therapy for heart failure has been evaluated in several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies in a total of 1,625 participants with heart failure found that oral L-carnitine (1.5-6 g/day for seven days to three years) significantly improved several measures of cardiac functional capacity (including exercise tolerance and markers of the left ventricle function), yet had no impact on all-cause mortality [(56)](#reference56). Angina pectoris is chest pain that occurs when the coronary blood supply is insufficient to meet the metabolic needs of the heart muscle (as with [ischemic](../glossary#ischemia) heart disease; see the page on [Angina Pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris)) [(57)](#reference57). In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in over 4,000 participants with suspected angina pectoris, elevated concentrations of certain acylcarnitine intermediates in blood were associated with fatal and non-fatal acute myocardial infarction [(58)](#reference58). In early studies, the addition of oral L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine to pharmacologic therapy for chronic stable angina modestly improved exercise tolerance and decreased [electrocardiographic](../glossary#electrocardiogram) signs of ischemia during exercise testing in some angina patients [(59-61)](#reference59). Another early study examined hemodynamic and [angiographic](../glossary#angiography) variables before, during, and after administering [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) propionyl-L-carnitine (15 mg/kg body weight) in men with myocardial dysfunction and angina pectoris [(62)](#reference62). In this study, propionyl-L-carnitine decreased myocardial ischemia, evidenced by significant reductions in ST-segment depression and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure [(62)](#reference62). No recent and/or large-scale studies have been conducted to further examine the potential benefit of L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine in the management of angina pectoris. In [peripheral arterial disease](../glossary#peripheral-arterial-disease), [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) of the arteries that supply the lower extremities may diminish blood flow to the point that the metabolic needs of exercising muscles are not sufficiently met, thereby leading to [ischemic](../glossary#ischemia) leg or hip pain known as claudication (see the page on [Intermittent Claudication in Peripheral Arterial Disease](../health-disease/intermittent-claudication)) [(63)](#reference63). Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have found that treatment with propionyl-L-carnitine improves exercise tolerance in some patients with intermittent claudication. In a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, dose-titration study, 1 to 3 g/day of oral propionyl-L-carnitine for 24 weeks was well tolerated and improved maximal walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication [(64)](#reference64). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled study of 495 patients with intermittent claudication, 2 g/day of propionyl-L-carnitine for 12 months significantly increased maximal walking distance and the distance walked prior to the onset of claudication in patients whose initial maximal walking distance was less than 250 meters (m), but no effect was seen in patients who had an initial maximal walking distance greater than 250 m [(65)](#reference65). More recent trials have associated oral propionyl-L-carnitine supplementation (2 g/day for several months) with improved walking distance and claudication onset time [(66, 67)](#reference66), as well as with higher pain-free walking distance and higher ankle-brachial index (a diagnostic measure of peripheral arterial disease) [(68)](#reference68). Two 2013 [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) of interventions concluded that the modest benefit of propionyl-L-carnitine on walking performance was equivalent or superior to that obtained with drugs approved for claudication in the US (e.g., pentoxyphylline, cilostazol) yet inferior to improvements seen with supervised exercise interventions [(69, 70)](#reference69). L-Carnitine and short/medium-chain acylcarnitine molecules are removed from the circulation during [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis). Both L-carnitine loss into the dialysate and impaired synthesis by the kidneys contribute to a progressive carnitine deficiency in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) [(71)](#reference71). The low clearance of long-chain acylcarnitine molecules leads to a high acylcarnitine-to-L-carnitine ratio that has been associated with a higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) mortality [(72)](#reference72). Carnitine depletion in patients undergoing hemodialysis may lead to various conditions, such as muscle weakness and fatigue, [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [lipid](../glossary#lipid) abnormalities, and refractory [anemia](../glossary#anemia). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 31 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in a total of 1,734 patients with ESRD found that L-carnitine treatment \u2014 administered either orally or [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) \u2014 resulted in reductions of [serum](../glossary#serum) [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (a marker of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and predictor of mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis) and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), although the latter was not deemed to be clinically relevant [(73)](#reference73). There was no effect of L-carnitine on other serum [lipids](../glossary#lipid) (i.e., total and anemia-related indicators (i.e., [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) concentration, [hematocrit](../glossary#hematocrit), albumin, and required dose of recombinant [erythropoietin](../glossary#erythropoietin)) [(73)](#reference73). The US National Kidney Foundation did not recommend routine administration of L-carnitine to subjects undergoing dialysis yet encouraged the development of trials in patients with select symptoms that do not respond to standard therapy, i.e., persistent muscle cramps or hypotension during dialysis, severe fatigue, skeletal muscle weakness or [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy), [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy), and anemia requiring large doses of erythropoietin [(74, 75)](#reference74). Finally, the use of L-carnitine (10-20 mg/kg body weight given as a slow bolus injection) is approved by the US FDA to treat L-carnitine deficiency in subjects with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis [(76)](#reference76). The use of certain antiretroviral agents ( [nucleoside](../glossary#nucleoside) [analogs](../glossary#analog)) has been associated with an increased developing [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy) in [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-positive individuals [(77, 78)](#reference77). Small, uncontrolled, [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial) intervention studies have suggested a beneficial effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) in patients with painful neuropathies. An early uncontrolled study found that 10 out of 16 HIV-positive subjects with painful neuropathy reported improvement after three weeks of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) or intramuscular ALCAR treatment [(79)](#reference79). Results from another uncontrolled intervention in 21 HIV-positive patients suggested that long-term (two to four years) oral ALCAR supplementation (1.5 g/day) may be a beneficial [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to antiretroviral therapy to improve neuropathic symptoms in some HIV-infected individuals [(80, 81)](#reference80). Additionally, two small studies in participants presenting with antiretroviral-induced neuropathy found significant reduction in subjects' mean pain intensity with oral ALCAR (1-3 g/day) for 4 to 24 weeks, but no effect on objective neurophysiological parameters was found [(82, 83)](#reference82). A [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 90 HIV-positive patients with symptomatic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy found no benefit of intramuscular injection with 1 g/day of ALCAR for two weeks in the intention-to-treat analysis, but there was some pain relief in the group of 66 patients who completed the trial [(84)](#reference84). Large-scale, controlled studies are needed before any conclusions can be drawn. Peripheral nerve dysfunction occurs in about 50% of people with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and chronic neuropathic pain is present in about one-third of people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy [(85)](#reference85). Advanced stages of diabetic peripheral neuropathy can lead to recurrent foot ulcers and infections, and eventually amputations [(86)](#reference86). A 2019 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) [(87)](#reference87) identified three [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled interventions that examined of oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR; 1.5-3.0 g/day for one with diabetic peripheral neuropathy [(3](#reference3), [88)](#reference88). Low-quality evidence suggested a lower level of pain with ALCAR, as measured with a visual scale analog. Low-quality evidence from another trial that compared the effect of ALCAR (1.5 g/day) with that of [methylcobalamin](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) (1.5 mg/day) for 24 weeks suggested no difference between treatments regarding the extent of functional disability (using the Neuropathy Disability Scale) or measures of symptom quality and severity (using the Neuropathy Symptom Scale) [(89)](#reference89). A few [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have examined whether ALCAR might help prevent or treat [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy)-induced peripheral neuropathy. A trial in 150 participants with either ovarian [cancer](../glossary#cancer) or castration-resistant [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer found no evidence that ALCAR (1g every 3 days) given with the anticancer drug sagopilone (for up to six cycles of treatment) reduced the overall risk of peripheral neuropathy compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(90)](#reference90). However, ALCAR reduced the risk of high-grade sagopilone-induced neuropathy [(90)](#reference90). In contrast, another trial in 409 women with breast cancer found that ALCAR (3 g/day for 24 weeks) increased anticancer drug (taxanes)-induced peripheral neuropathy and decreased measures of functional status compared to placebo [(91)](#reference91). A follow-up study reported that the negative impact of 24-week treatment with ALCAR was still observed at week 52; however, no differences between ALCAR and placebo were apparent at week 104 [(92)](#reference92). Finally, one trial in 239 participants already suffering from chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy reported a reduction in the severity of neuropathic symptoms with ALCAR (3 g/day for eight weeks) compared to placebo [(93)](#reference93). Improvements in electrophysiological parameters were also observed with ALCAR treatment [(93)](#reference93). The results from these trials are conflicting and thus difficult to interpret. The efficacy of ALCAR in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy remains to be established [(94)](#reference94). A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) identified 12 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including 791 participants, that examined the effect of ALCAR on symptoms of depression [(95)](#reference95). Evidence from nine trials suggested a reduction in depressive symptoms with ALCAR (3 g/day for a median 8 weeks) compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo). Three trials that compared ALCAR treatment (1-3 g/day for 7-12 weeks) and antidepressant medications found ALCAR was as effective as antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms [(95)](#reference95). Another meta-analysis of trials that compared the safety profile of antidepressants found evidence of fewer adverse effects, and consequently, better adherence to treatment with ALCAR compared to placebo and in contrast to classical pharmaceutical agents [(96)](#reference96). The metabolomic profiling of acylcarnitine molecules showed variations in serum concentrations of subjects along the continuum from [cognitively](../glossary#cognitive) healthy to affected by [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) [(97)](#reference97). Changes in the blood concentrations of specific acylcarnitines in subjects with either subjective memory complaints, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease, compared to cognitively healthy peers may reflect changes in the transport of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) into the [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) and/or impairments in energy production. Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) conducted in the 1990s examined the effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) treatment on the cognitive performance of patients clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Early, small trials suggested a beneficial effect of ALCAR with respect to cognitive decline [(98-100)](#reference98), whereas later, larger trials found little-to-no effect compared to placebo [(101-103)](#reference101). However, a 2003 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) highlighted differences in methodologies between early and later studies that make it difficult to compare results [(104)](#reference104). Nevertheless, the pooled analysis of 16 trials suggested improvements in the summary measure of patients' global functioning (assessed with the Clinical Global Impressions [CGI-I] scale) after 12 and 24 weeks of (but not after 52 weeks) of ALCAR treatment (1-3 g/day) and in cognitive performance (assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] scale) after 24 weeks (but not at 12 or 52 weeks) [(104)](#reference104). A 2003 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 21 trials found that ALCAR was superior to placebo in several psychometric tests assessing global patient functioning, attention, memory, and some intellectual functions [(105)](#reference105). [Hepatic encephalopathy](../glossary#hepatic-encephalopathy) refers to the occurrence of a spectrum of neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms in individuals with acute or chronic liver disease [(106)](#reference106). [Subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) hepatic encephalopathy may not feature any symptoms beyond abnormal behavior on psychometric tests or symptoms that are nonspecific in nature. In contract, overt hepatic encephalopathy can present with disorientation, obvious personality change, inappropriate behavior, somnolence, stupor, confusion, and coma [(106)](#reference106). Changes in mental status are thought to be caused by the liver failing to detoxify neurotoxic compounds like ammonia. A 2019 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of five [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials conducted by one group of investigators examined the effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) in 398 participants with [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) and portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the portal vein) and presenting with either subclinical or overt hepatic encephalopathy. ALCAR was either administered orally (4 g/day for 90 days) in four trials or [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) (4 g/day for three days) in one trial. ALCAR was found to significantly reduce blood ammonium concentration compared to placebo. However, none of the trials reported on serious adverse outcomes, including mortality. Additionally, the evidence was too limited to assess the impact on quality of life or mental and physical fatigue. Fatigue is not uncommon in people who have undergone [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) and survived [cancer](../glossary#cancer), with fatigue symptoms depending on the specific type of cancer and treatment. Cancer-related fatigue can persist well beyond the end of chemotherapy and be associated with [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) and functional decline, insomnia, depression, and a reduction in the quality of life [(107)](#reference107). A 2017 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) identified 12 the effect of L-carnitine or ALCAR on cancer-related fatigue (reported as a primary or secondary outcome) in cancer survivors [(108)](#reference108). Three studies had no control arm, eight studies were [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), and eight studies included fewer than 100 participants. Overall, only three studies were deemed of good quality. The meta-analysis of these three [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials found no effect of L-carnitine (0.25-4 g/day for 1 week to 3 months) or ALCAR (3 g/day for 6 months) on the level of cancer-related fatigue [(108)](#reference108). L-Carnitine is concentrated in the [epididymis](../glossary#epididymis), where sperm mature and acquire their motility [(109)](#reference109). An early [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 101 fertile and infertile men found that L-carnitine concentrations in semen were positively correlated with the number of sperm, the percentage of motile sperm, and the percentage of normal appearing sperm in the sample [(110)](#reference110), suggesting that L-carnitine may play an important role in male fertility. One [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in 86 subjects with fertility issues found that supplementation with L-carnitine (2 g/day) for two months improved sperm quality, as evidenced by increases in sperm concentration and motility [(111)](#reference111). In another placebo-controlled trial conducted by the same group, similar improvements in sperm motility were observed in participants supplemented with 2g/day of L-carnitine and 1 g/day of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) for six months [(112)](#reference112). In both trials, the effect of carnitine was greater in the most severe cases of asthenozoospermia (reduced sperm motility) at baseline [(111, 112)](#reference111). Another [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) study in 44 men with [idiopathic](../glossary#idiopathic) asthenozoospermia found an increase in sperm motility in those given ALCAR alone (3 g/day) or ALCAR (1 g/day) plus L-carnitine (2 g/day) compared to those given L-carnitine alone (2 g/day) or a placebo [(113)](#reference113). However, a pooled analysis of the two trials that employed ALCAR found no significant effect of ALCAR and L-carnitine on sperm concentration, motility, and morphology [(114)](#reference114). Evidence from larger scale [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) is still needed to determine whether L-carnitine and ALCAR could play a role in the treatment of male infertility. Frailty is a syndrome [prevalent](../glossary#prevalent) among geriatric populations and characterized by a functional decline and a loss of independence to perform the activities of daily living. Frailty in individuals may include at least three of the following symptoms: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion (poor endurance), weakness (low grip strength), slowness, and physical inactivity [(115)](#reference115). It is believed that early stages of frailty are amenable to interventions that could avert adverse outcomes, including the increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hospitalization and premature death [(116)](#reference116). The suggestion that carnitine deficiency may lead to frailty through [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction [(117)](#reference117) has been examined in one trial. This [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 58 older adults identified as \"pre-frail\" found an decrease in a Frailty Index score and an improvement in the hand grip test in individuals supplemented with L-carnitine (1.5 g/day) over 10 weeks but not in those given a placebo [(118)](#reference118). However, there was no difference in Frailty Index and hand grip test scores between supplemental L-carnitine and placebo groups. Loss of skeletal muscle mass is associated with a decrease in muscle strength and occurs with aging [(119)](#reference119), as well as in several [pathological](../glossary#pathology) conditions [(120-122)](#reference120). Based on preclinical studies, it has been suggested that L-carnitine supplementation could limit the imbalance between protein anabolism (synthesis) and [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) (degradation) that leads to skeletal muscle wasting [(42)](#reference42). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 28 older women (ages, 65-70 years) found no effect of L-carnitine supplementation (1.5 g/day for 24 weeks) on [serum](../glossary#serum) pro-inflammatory [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine) concentrations, body mass and composition (lean [fat-free] mass and skeletal muscle mass), or measures of skeletal muscle strength [(123)](#reference123). In contrast, a [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) cohort study in patients with [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) found a reduced rate of skeletal muscle loss over at least six months in those who were administered L-carnitine (N=35; mean dose, 1.02 g/day) compared to those who were not [(124)](#reference124). Of note, supplementation with L-carnitine was given in patients with cirrhosis to control hyperammonemia (N=27), to reduce muscle cramps (N=6), or to prevent carnitine deficiency (N=2). One major limitation of this study beyond its retrospective design is that patients who received L-carnitine had a significantly different clinical presentation; in particular, liver dysfunction was significantly more severe in these patients than in those who were not supplemented [(124)](#reference124). Muscle cramps are involuntary and painful contractions of skeletal muscles. Two uncontrolled studies conducted in participants with [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) found that L-carnitine [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) was safe to use at doses of 0.9 to 1.2 g/day for eight weeks [(125)](#reference125) and 1 g/day for 24 weeks [(126)](#reference126) and might be considered to control the frequency of cramps. However, whether supplemental L-carnitine can be efficacious to limit the incidence of muscle cramps in patients with cirrhosis remains unknown. An [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), non-randomized trial in 69 patients with either type 1 or type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found a reduction in the incidence of muscle cramps and an improvement in the quality of life of those prescribed 0.6 g/day of L-carnitine for four months compared to controls [(127)](#reference127). In contrast, there is little evidence to date to suggest that supplemental L-carnitine could reduce muscle cramps in patients undergoing [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) [(128)](#reference128). Well-designed trials are necessary to examine whether L-carnitine could be helpful in the management of cramps. Interest in the potential of L-carnitine supplementation to improve athletic performance is related to its important roles in energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). A number of small, poorly controlled studies have reported that either acute (dose given one hour before exercise bout) or short-term (two to three weeks) supplementation with L-carnitine (2 to 4 g/day) supported energy production, cardiorespiratory fitness, and endurance capacity during physical exercise (reviewed in [129](#reference129)). However, in a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 32 healthy adults, propionyl-L-carnitine (1 g/day or 3 g/day) for eight weeks did not improve aerobic or anaerobic exercise performance [(130)](#reference130). An intervention study compared the effect of L-carnitine supplementation (2 g/day for 12 weeks) on [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and skeletal muscle carnitine concentrations and physical performance between 16 vegetarian and 8 omnivorous male participants [(131)](#reference131). At baseline, plasma carnitine concentration was about 10% lower in vegetarian compared to omnivorous participants. However, the content carnitine in skeletal muscle, phosphocreatine, [ATP](../glossary#ATP), [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen), and lactate, as well as measures of physical performance during exercise were equivalent between vegetarians and omnivores. While L-carnitine supplementation normalized plasma carnitine concentration in vegetarians to that observed in omnivores, there was no effect on energy metabolism and physical performance compared to no supplementation and between vegetarians and omnivores [(131)](#reference131). The normal rate of L-carnitine [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) in humans ranges from 0.16 to 0.48 mg/kg of body weight/day [(4)](#reference4). Thus, a 70 kg (154 1b) person would synthesize between 11 and 34 mg of carnitine per day. This rate of synthesis, combined with efficient (95%) L-carnitine reabsorption by the kidneys, is sufficient to prevent deficiency in generally healthy people, including strict vegetarians [(132)](#reference132). Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products are the richest sources of L-carnitine, while fruit, vegetables, and grains contain relatively little L-carnitine. Omnivorous diets have been found to provide 23 to 135 mg/day of L-carnitine for an average 70 kg person, while strict vegetarian diets may provide as little as 1 mg/day for a 70 kg person [(8)](#reference8). Between 54% and 86% of L-carnitine from food is absorbed, compared to 5%-25% from oral supplements (0.6-7 g/day) [(13)](#reference13). Non-milk-based infant formulas (e.g., soy formulas) should be [fortified](../glossary#fortification) so that they contain 11 mg/L of L-carnitine. Some carnitine-rich foods and their carnitine content in milligrams (mg) are of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.| Intravenous L-carnitine is available by prescription only for the treatment of primary and secondary L-carnitine deficiencies [(76)](#reference76). Oral L-carnitine is available by prescription for the treatment of primary and secondary L-carnitine deficiencies [(76)](#reference76). It is also available without a prescription as a nutritional [supplement](../glossary#supplement); supplemental doses usually range from 0.5 to 2 g/day. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is available without a prescription as a nutritional [supplement](../glossary#supplement). In addition to providing L-carnitine, it provides [acetyl](../glossary#acetylation) groups that may be used in the formation of the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter), acetylcholine. Supplemental doses usually range from 0.5 to 2 g/day [(133)](#reference133). Propionyl-L-carnitine is not approved by the US FDA for use as a drug to prevent or treat any condition. It is, however, available without prescription as a nutritional [supplement](../glossary#supplement). See [Figure 1](#figure-1) for the chemical structures of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine. In general, L-carnitine appears to be well tolerated; no toxic effects have been reported in relation to intakes of high doses of L-carnitine. L-Carnitine [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may cause mild [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Supplements providing more than 3 g/day may cause a \"fishy\" body odor. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) has been reported to increase agitation in some [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) patients [(133)](#reference133). Despite claims that L-carnitine or ALCAR might increase [seizures](../glossary#seizure) in some individuals with seizure disorders [(133)](#reference133), these are not supported by any scientific evidence [(134)](#reference134). Only the L- [isomer](../glossary#isomer) of carnitine is biologically active; the D-isomer may actually compete with L-carnitine for absorption and transport, thereby increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of L-carnitine deficiency [(4)](#reference4). Supplements containing a mixture of the D- and L-isomers (D,L-carnitine) have been associated with muscle weakness in patients with kidney disease. Long-term studies examining the safety of ALCAR supplementation in pregnant and breast-feeding women are lacking [(133)](#reference133). Pivalic acid combines with L-carnitine and is [excreted](../glossary#excretion) in the urine as pivaloylcarnitine, thereby increasing L-carnitine losses (see also [Secondary carnitine deficiency](#secondary-deficiency)). valproic acid (Depakene) interferes with L-carnitine [biosynthesis](../glossary#biosynthesis) the liver and forms with L-carnitine a valproylcarnitine [ester](../glossary#ester) that is excreted in the urine. However, L-carnitine supplements are necessary only in a subset of patients taking valproic acid. Risk factors for L-carnitine deficiency with valproic acid include young age (<2 years), severe [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) problems, use of multiple antiepileptic drugs, poor nutrition, and consumption of a ketogenic diet [(135)](#reference135). There is insufficient evidence to suggest that [nucleoside](../glossary#nucleoside) analogs used in the treatment (i.e., ifosfamide, cisplatin) increase the risk of secondary L-carnitine deficiency [(135)](#reference135).

Carnitine: Accessed 7/1/19.] Contents Coenzyme Q10 is a member of the ubiquinone family of compounds. All animals, including humans, can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) ubiquinones, hence, coenzyme Q10 is not considered a [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [(1)](#references). The name ubiquinone refers to the ubiquitous presence of these compounds in living organisms and their chemical structure, which contains a functional group known as a benzoquinone. Ubiquinones are fat-soluble molecules with anywhere from 1 to 12 isoprene (5-carbon) units. The ubiquinone found in humans, ubidecaquinone or coenzyme Q10, has a \"tail\" of 10 isoprene units (a total of 50 carbon atoms) attached to its benzoquinone \"head\" (Figure 1) [(1).](#references) Coenzyme Q10 is [soluble](../glossary#soluble) in (fats) and in virtually all [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), including [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) membranes. The ability of the benzoquinone head group of coenzyme Q10 to accept and donate [electrons](../glossary#electron) is a critical feature to its function. Coenzyme Q10 can exist in three [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) states (Figure 1): (i) the fully [reduced](../glossary#reduction) ubiquinol form, CoQ10H2; (ii) the radical semiquinone intermediate, CoQ10H\u00b7; and (iii) the fully oxidized ubiquinone form, CoQ10. The conversion of energy from [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and fats to [ATP](../glossary#ATP), the form of energy used by cells, requires the presence of coenzyme Q10 in the inner [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) membrane. As part mitochondrial [electron transport chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain), coenzyme Q10 accepts during [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) and [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and then transfers them to electron acceptors. At the same time, coenzyme Q10 contributes to transfer [protons](../glossary#proton) (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy released when the protons flow back into the mitochondrial interior is used to form ATP (Figure 2) [(1)](#references). In addition to its role in ATP synthesis, mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 mediates the oxidation of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. [Lysosomes](../glossary#lysosome) are [organelles](../glossary#organelle) within cells that are specialized for the digestion of cellular debris. The digestive [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) within lysosomes function optimally at an [acidic](../glossary#acidic) [pH](../glossary#pH), meaning they require a permanent supply of [protons](../glossary#proton). The lysosomal membranes that separate those digestive enzymes from the rest of the cell contain relatively high concentrations of coenzyme Q10. Research suggests that coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in the transport of protons across lysosomal membranes to maintain the membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) and [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) from [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation). The presence of a significant amount of CoQ10H2 in cell membranes, along with [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) capable of reducing oxidized CoQ10 back to CoQ10H2 (i.e., NAD(P)H oxidoreductases), supports the idea that CoQ10H2 is an important cellular antioxidant [(4)](#reference4). CoQ10H2 has been found to inhibit [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) when cell membranes and [low-density lipoproteins](../glossary#LDL) (LDL) are exposed to oxidizing conditions. When LDL is oxidized, CoQ10H2 is the first antioxidant consumed. In isolated [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria), coenzyme Q10 can protect membrane [proteins](../glossary#protein) and mitochondrial the oxidative damage that accompanies lipid peroxidation [(5)](#reference5). Moreover, when present, CoQ10H2 was found to limit the formation of oxidized [lipids](../glossary#lipid) and the consumption of -tocopherol (a form of [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) with antioxidant properties) in addition coenzyme Q10 as an antioxidant is also exemplified by recent evidence showing that mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 deficiency causes an increased production of mitochondrial superoxide radical anion (O2-) which might be driving insulin adipose tissues [(7)](#reference7). -Tocopherol -tocopherol radical](../glossary#free-radical), as a lipid peroxyl radical (LOO\u00b7), it becomes [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) itself, forming -TO\u00b7, which can in turn promote the oxidation of lipoproteins under certain conditions in the test tube, thus propagating a chain reaction. However, when the [reduced](../glossary#reduction) form Q10 radical (CoQ10H\u00b7) is formed. It is possible for CoQ10H\u00b7 to react with oxygen (O2) to produce superoxide anion radical (O2\u00b7-), which is a less reactive [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant) than LOO\u00b7. However, CoQ10H\u00b7 can also reduce -TO\u00b7 back to -TOH, resulting in the formation of fully oxidized coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which does not react with O2\u00b7- (Figure 3) [(6, 8)](#reference6). Coenzyme Q10 deficiency has not been described in the general population, so it is generally assumed that normal [biosynthesis](../glossary#synthesis), with or without a varied diet, provides sufficient coenzyme Q10 to sustain energy production in healthy individuals [(9)](#reference9). Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway. To date, mutations in at least nine of these genes have been identified [(1)](#references). As a result, primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a clinically [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) disorder that includes five major phenotypes: (i) severe infantile multi-systemic disease, (ii) encephalomyopathy, (iii) cerebellar [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), (iv) isolated (v) nephrotic syndrome. Whereas most [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) disorders are hardly amenable to treatments, oral coenzyme Q10 supplementation has been shown to improve muscular symptoms in some (yet not all) patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency [(10)](#reference10). [Neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in patients with [(10)](#reference10). Secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency results from mutations or deletions in genes that are not directly related to coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway. Evidence of secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency has been reported in several mitochondrial disorders, such as mitochondrial [DNA](../glossary#DNA) depletion syndrome, Kearns-Sayre (MADD) [(10)](#reference10). Secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency has also been identified in non-mitochondrial disorders, such as cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Niemann-Pick-type C disease [(11)](#reference11). Because the therapeutic potential of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 is limited to its capacity to restore [electron](../glossary#electron) transfer in a defective mitochondrial respiratory chain and/or to increase [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) defense, patients with secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency may fail to respond to supplementation (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). Coenzyme Q10 concentrations have been found to decline gradually with age in a number of different tissues [(5](#reference5), [12)](#reference12), but it is unclear whether this age-associated decline constitutes a deficiency (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(13)](#reference13). Decreased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of coenzyme individuals [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) (see activity 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase (statins), inhibitors [statins]](#statins)), although it remains unproven that this has any clinical implications. According to the [free radical](../glossary#free-radical) and [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) theories of aging, [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) of cell structures by [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) plays an important role in the functional declines that accompany aging [(14)](#reference14). ROS are generated by mitochondria as a byproduct of [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production. If not neutralized by [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), ROS may damage mitochondria over time, causing them to function less efficiently and to generate more damaging ROS in a self-perpetuating cycle. Coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in mitochondrial ATP synthesis and functions as an antioxidant in mitochondrial membranes (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). One of the hallmarks of aging is a decline in energy metabolism in many tissues, especially liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Tissue concentrations of coenzyme Q10 have been found to decline with age, thereby accompanying age-related declines in energy metabolism [(12)](#reference12). Early animal studies have not been able to demonstrate an effect of lifelong dietary [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 on the lifespan of rats or mice [(15-17)](#reference15). Nonetheless, more recent studies have suggested that supplemental coenzyme Q10 could promote mitochondrial biogenesis and delay senescence in transgenic mice [(19)](#reference19). Presently, there is limited scientific evidence to suggest that coenzyme Q10 supplementation prolongs life or prevents age-related functional declines in humans. In a small [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), elderly individuals (>70 years) who received a combination of selenium (100 \u00b5g/day) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) for four years reported an improvement in vitality, physical performance, and quality of life [(20)](#reference20). Further, a 12-year follow-up of these participants showed a reduction in [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) mortality with supplemental selenium and coenzyme [low-density lipoproteins](../glossary#LDL) (LDL) in arterial walls is thought to represent an early event leading to the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis). Reduced coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10H2) inhibits the oxidation of LDL in the test tube ( [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro)) and works together with -tocopherol (-TOH) LDL oxidation by regenerating -TO\u00b7 back to -TOH. In the absence of a co- [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant), such as CoQ10H2 or vitamin C, -TO\u00b7 can, under certain conditions, promote the oxidation of LDL in vitro [(6)](#reference6). [Supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 increases the concentration of CoQ10H2 in human LDL [(22)](#reference22). Studies in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, an animal model found lipoprotein oxidation in the blood vessel wall and the formation of atherosclerotic lesions [(23)](#reference23). Interestingly, co-supplementation of these mice with -TOH and coenzyme Q10 was more effective in inhibiting atherosclerosis supplementation with either -TOH or coenzyme Q10 alone [(24)](#reference24). Another important step in the development of atherosclerosis is the recruitment of immune cells known as [monocytes](../glossary#monocyte) into the blood vessel walls. This recruitment is dependent in part on monocyte expression of cell adhesion molecules (integrins). Supplementation of 10 healthy men and women with 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for 10 weeks resulted in significant decreases in monocyte expression of integrins, suggesting another potential mechanism for the coenzyme Q10 inhibitor of LDL oxidation and atherosclerosis, more research is needed to determine whether coenzyme Q10 supplementation can inhibit the development or progression of atherosclerosis in humans. Inherited coenzyme Q10 deficiencies are rare diseases that are clinically and genetically [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). In individuals with primary coenzyme in adults) may improve the [pathological](../glossary#pathology) phenotype, yet the effectiveness depends on the type of [mutations](../glossary#mutation) affecting the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic coenzyme Q10 essential to limit irreversible organ damage in coenzyme Q10-responsive deficiencies [(1)](#references). It is not clear to what extent coenzyme Q10 supplementation might have therapeutic benefit in patients with inherited secondary Q10 deficiencies. For example, multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), caused by mutations in [genes](../glossary#gene) that impair the activity of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron) from acyl-CoA to coenzyme Q10, is usually responsive to [riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin) [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) yet patients with low coenzyme Q10 concentrations might benefit from co-supplementation with coenzyme Q10 and riboflavin [(27)](#reference27). Another study suggested clinical improvements in secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency with supplemental coenzyme Q10 in patients presenting with [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia) [(28)](#reference28). Because the cause of secondary coenzyme Q10 in inherited conditions is generally unknown, it is difficult to predict whether improving coenzyme Q10 status with supplemental coenzyme Q10 would lead to clinical benefits for the patients. Finally, coenzyme Q10 deficiency can be secondary to the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statin drugs (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six small, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no reduction in statin-induced muscle pain with 100 to 400 mg/day of supplemental coenzyme Q10 for one to three months [(29)](#reference29). The trials failed to establish a diagnosis of relative coenzyme Q10 deficiency before the [intervention](../glossary#intervention-trial) started, hence limiting the conclusion of the meta-analysis. While statin therapy may not necessary lead to a reduction in circulating coenzyme Q10 concentrations, further research needs to examine whether secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency might be predisposing patients to statin-induced [myalgia](../glossary#myalgia) [(30)](#reference30). Impairment of the heart's ability to pump enough blood for all of the body's needs is known as [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure). In [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD), accumulation of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaque in the [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-arteries) may prevent parts of the cardiac muscle from getting adequate blood supply, ultimately resulting in heart damage and impaired pumping ability. Heart failure can also be caused by [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), diseases of the heart valves, [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy), and [congenital](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) heart diseases. Because physical exercise increases the demand on the weakened heart, measures of exercise tolerance are frequently used to monitor the severity of heart failure. [Echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography) is also used to determine the left [ventricular](../glossary#ventricles) ejection fraction, an objective measure of the heart's pumping ability [(31)](#reference31). A study of 1,191 heart failure patients found that low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration was a good [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of advanced heart disease [(32)](#reference32). A number of small [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) that administered [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 to congestive heart failure patients have been conducted. A 2014 literature review identified seven small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examining the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation (60-200 mg/day for 3 months in most trials) in heart failure patients [(33)](#reference33). Pooling data from some of the trials showed an increase in [serum](../glossary#serum) coenzyme Q10 concentrations (three studies) but no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (two studies) or exercise capacity (two studies) [(33)](#reference33). However, a recent meta-analysis of 14 randomized, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in 2,149 participants with heart failure found that supplemental coenzyme Q10 (30-300 mg/day) resulted in a 39% reduction in mortality (seven studies), improved exercise capacity (four studies), but had no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (nine studies) compared to placebo [(34)](#reference34). A trial is presently being conducted to assess the value of supplemental coenzyme Q10 and/or D-ribose in the treatment of congestive heart failure in patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction [(35)](#reference35). The heart muscle may become oxygen-deprived ( [ischemic](../glossary#ischemia)) as the result of [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or during cardiac surgery. Increased generation of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) when the heart muscle's oxygen supply is restored (reperfusion) might be an important contributor to myocardial damage occurring during ischemia-reperfusion [(36)](#reference36). Pretreatment of animals with coenzyme Q10 has been found to preserve myocardial function following ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing [ATP](../glossary#ATP) concentration, enhancing [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage), regulating [autophagy](../glossary#autophagy), and reducing cardiomyocyte [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) [(37)](#reference37). Another potential source of ischemia-reperfusion injury is aortic clamping during some types of cardiac surgery, such as [coronary artery bypass graft](../glossary#coronary-artery-bypass-graft) (CABG) surgery. (60-300 mg/day for 7-14 days prior to surgery) provided some benefit in short-term outcome measures after CABG surgery [(38, 39)](#reference38). In a small [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 30 patients, oral administration of coenzyme Q10 for 7 to 10 days before CABG surgery reduced the need for mediastinal drainage, [platelet](../glossary#platelet) transfusion, and positive inotropic drugs (e.g. dopamine) and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [arrhythmia](../health-disease/arrhythmia) within 24 hours post-surgery [(40)](#reference40). In one trial that did not find preoperative coenzyme Q10 supplementation to be of benefit, patients were treated with 600 mg of coenzyme Q10 12 hours prior to surgery [(41)](#reference41), suggesting that preoperative coenzyme Q10 treatment may need to commence at least one week prior to CABG surgery to improve surgical outcomes. The combined two weeks before CABG surgery and four weeks after was examined in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trial in 117 patients with heart failure [(42)](#reference42). The treatment resulted in lower concentration of troponin-I (a marker of cardiac injury), shorter length of hospital stay, and reduced risk of postoperative transient cardiac dysfunction compared to placebo [(42)](#reference42). Although trials have included relatively few people and examined mostly short-term, post-surgical outcomes, the results are promising [(43)](#reference43). [Coronary angioplasty](../glossary#angiography) (also called percutaneous coronary intervention) is a nonsurgical procedure for treating obstructive [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), including unstable [angina pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris), acute [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), and multivessel coronary heart disease. Angioplasty involves temporarily inserting and inflating a tiny balloon into the clogged artery to help restore the blood flow to the heart. Periprocedural myocardial injury that occurs in up to one-third of patients undergoing otherwise uncomplicated angioplasty increases the risk of morbidity and mortality at follow-up. A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) followed 55 patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (a type of heart attack characterized by the death of some myocardial tissue) who underwent angioplasty [(44)](#reference44). [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration month correlated with less [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and predicted favorable left ventricular end-systolic volume remodeling at six months [(44)](#reference44). One [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) has examined the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on periprocedural myocardial injury in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty [(45)](#reference45). The administration of 300 mg of coenzyme Q10 12 hours before the angioplasty to 50 patients reduced the concentration of [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) ([CRP]; a marker of inflammation) within 24 hours following the procedure compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo). However, there was no difference in concentrations of two markers of myocardial injury (creatine kinase and troponin-I) or in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events one month after angioplasty between active treatment and placebo [(45)](#reference45). Additional trials are needed to examine whether coenzyme Q10 therapy can improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Myocardial [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) may also lead to chest pain known as [angina pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris). People with angina pectoris often experience symptoms when the demand for oxygen exceeds the capacity of the coronary circulation to deliver it to the heart muscle, e.g., during exercise. Five small [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies have examined the effects of oral coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (60-600 mg/day) in addition to conventional medical therapy in patients with chronic stable angina [(46)](#reference46). In most of the studies, coenzyme Q10 supplementation improved exercise tolerance and reduced or delayed [electrocardiographic](../glossary#electrocardiogram) changes associated with myocardial ischemia compared to placebo. However, only two of the studies found significant decreases in symptom frequency and use of nitroglycerin with coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Presently, there is only limited evidence suggesting that coenzyme Q10 supplementation would be a useful [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to conventional angina therapy. Very few high-quality trials have examined the potential therapeutic benefit of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in the treatment of primary review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified two small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials that found little evidence of a reduction in [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) or [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) following the administration of coenzyme Q10 (100-200 mg/day) for three months [(47)](#reference47). In contrast, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that used less stringent selection criteria included 17 small trials and found evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of coenzyme Q10 in patients with [cardiovascular metabolic disorders [(48)](#reference48). The effect of coenzyme Q10 on blood pressure needs to be examined in large, well-designed [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). [Endothelial dysfunction: Normally blood vessel relaxation ( [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation)) when needed (for example, during exercise) and inhibits the formation of blood clots. [Atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) is associated with impairment of vascular endothelial function, thereby compromising vasodilation and normal blood flow. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired in individuals with elevated serum [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, as well as in patients with [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). A 2012 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) examining the results of five small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 194 subjects in total found that supplemental coenzyme Q10 (150-300 mg/day for 4 to 12 weeks) resulted in a clinically significant, 1.7% increase in flow-dependent endothelial-mediated dilation [(49)](#reference49). Evidence from larger studies is needed to further establish the effect of coenzyme Q10 on endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Inflammation: Several in patients at increased [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) risk or with established cardiovascular disease have examined the effect of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 for 3 months on circulating [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) markers i.e., [CRP](../glossary#c-reactive-protein), interleukin-6, and/or tumor necrosis factor-. Recently published pooled analyses of these trials have given mixed results [(50-52)](#reference50). Larger studies are needed to examine the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on low-grade inflammation. Blood lipids: Elevated an independent [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six controlled trials (of which five were randomized) in 409 participants found a reduction in plasma lipoprotein(a) concentration with coenzyme Q10 supplementation Q10 on blood lipids have not been reported [(51, 53, 54)](#reference51). A therapeutic approach combining coenzyme Q10 with other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) might prove to be more effective to target co-existing metabolic disorders in individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease [(55)](#reference55). [Diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) is a condition of increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of reduced coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10H2) have been found to be lower in diabetic patients than healthy controls after normalization to plasma [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations [(56, 57)](#reference56). [Randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the effect of coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) found little evidence of benefits on glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six trials in participants with type 2 diabetes and one trial in participants with type 1 diabetes found that 100 to 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for three to six months lowered neither fasting plasma [glucose](../glossary#glucose) nor levels of [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) ([HbA1c]; a measure of glycemic control). Maternally inherited diabetes mellitus-deafness syndrome (MIDD) is caused by a [mutation](../glossary#mutation) in [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [DNA](../glossary#DNA), which is inherited exclusively from one's mother. MIDD accounts for less than 1% of all cases of diabetes. Some early evidence suggested that long-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation (150 mg/day) may improve [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion and prevent progressive hearing loss in these patients [(58, 59)](#reference58). Of note, the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus involves the early onset of [glucose intolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) and hyperinsulinemia associated with the progressive loss of tissue responsiveness to insulin. Recent experimental studies tied [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) to a decrease in coenzyme Q10 expression and supplementation might thus be a more useful tool for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes rather than for its management. [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) is a degenerative [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) disorder characterized by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slow movements. It is estimated to affect approximately 1% of Americans over the age of 65. [Mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra may play a role in the development of the disease [(60)](#reference60). Decreased ratios of [reduced](../glossary#reduction)-to- [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) coenzyme Q10 have been in [platelets](../glossary#platelet) of individuals with Parkinson's disease [(61, 62)](#reference61). One study also found higher concentrations of oxidized coenzyme Q10 in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of patients with untreated Parkinson's disease compared to healthy controls [(63)](#reference63). Additionally, a study in postmortem Parkinson's disease patients found lower concentrations of total coenzyme Q10 in the cortex region of the brain compared to age-matched controls, but no differences were seen in other brain areas, including the striatum, clinical trial](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) evaluated the safety and efficacy of 300, 600, or 1,200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 in 80 people with early Parkinson's disease [(65)](#reference65). Coenzyme Q10 supplementation was well tolerated at all doses and resulted in a slower deterioration of function in Parkinson's disease patients in the group taking 1,200 mg/day. A [phase III clinical trial](../glossary#phase-III-clinical-trial) was then designed to further examine the effect of motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. This trial was prematurely terminated because it was unlikely that such a treatment was effective in treating Parkinson's disease [(66)](#reference66). A smaller placebo-controlled trial showed that oral administration of 300 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for 48 to 96 months moderately improved motor symptoms in treated patients (with Levodopa) with re-emerging symptoms but not in patients at an early stage of the disease [(67)](#reference67). Two recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of randomized, placebo-controlled trials found no evidence that coenzyme Q10 improved motor-related symptoms or delayed the progression of the disease when compared to placebo [(68, 69)](#reference68). [Huntington's disease](../glossary#huntington-disease) is an inherited [neurodegenerative disorder](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by selective degeneration of nerve cells known as striatal spiny neurons. Symptoms, such as movement disorders and impaired [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function, typically develop in the fourth decade of life and progressively deteriorate over time. Animal models indicate that impaired [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) function and [glutamate](../glossary#glutamate)-mediated neurotoxicity may be involved in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of Huntington's disease. Some, but not all, studies in mouse models of Huntington's disease have suggested that coenzyme Q10 supplementation could improve motor performance, overall survival, and various hallmarks of Huntington's disease, antagonist), the antibiotic minocycline, or creatine led to greater improvements in most biochemical and behavioral parameters [(70-72)](#reference70). To date, only two [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined whether coenzyme Q10 might be efficacious in human patients with Huntington's disease. A 30-month, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial of coenzyme Q10 (600 mg/day), remacemide, or both in 347 patients with early Huntington's disease found that neither coenzyme Q10 nor remacemide significantly altered the decline in total functional capacity, although coenzyme Q10 supplementation (with or without remacemide) resulted in a nonsignificant trend toward a slower decline [(73)](#reference73). A 20-week [pilot trial](../glossary#pilot-study) examined the safety and tolerability increasing dosages of coenzyme Q10 (1,200 mg/day, 2,400 mg/day, and 3,600 mg/day) in eight healthy subjects and in 20 patients with Huntington's disease; 22 of the subjects completed the study [(74)](#reference74). All dosages were generally well tolerated, with [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms being the most frequently reported adverse effect. Blood concentrations of coenzyme Q10 at the end of the study were maximized with the daily dose of 2,400 mg [(74)](#reference74). This dose was tested in a multicenter [phase III clinical trial](../glossary#phase-III-clinical-trial) in 609 participants with early-stage Huntington's disease. Participants were randomized to receive either 2,400 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 or placebo for five years [(75)](#reference75). The trial was prematurely halted because it appeared unlikely to demonstrate any health benefit in supplemented patients \u2014 about one-third of participants completed the trial at the time of study termination [(75)](#reference75). Although coenzyme Q10 is generally well tolerated, there is no evidence that supplementation can improve functional and cognitive symptoms in Huntington's disease the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) frataxin. Frataxin for the making of [iron](../minerals/iron)-sulfur clusters (ISC). ISC-containing subunits are especially important for the mitochondrial [respiratory for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [heme](../glossary#heme)-containing proteins [(76)](#reference76). Frataxin deficiency is associated with imbalances in iron-sulfur containing proteins, mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction and lower [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production, and accumulation of iron in the mitochondria, which increases [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to macromolecules of the respiratory chain [(77)](#reference77). Clinically, FRDA is a progressive disease characterized by [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), [areflexia](../glossary#areflexia), speech disturbance (dysarthria), sensory loss, to 10 FDRA patients found that energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of cardiac and skeletal muscle was improved after only three months of therapy [(78)](#reference78). Follow-up assessments at 47 months indicated that cardiac and skeletal muscle improvements were maintained and that FRDA patients showed significant increases in fractional shortening, a measure of cardiac function. Moreover, the therapy was effective at preventing the progressive decline of [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) function [(79)](#reference79). Another study reported both coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E deficiencies among FRDA patients and suggested that co-supplementation with both compounds, at doses as low as 30 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 and 4 IU/day of vitamin E, might improve disease symptoms [(80)](#reference80). Large-scale, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are necessary to determine whether coenzyme Q10, in conjunction with vitamin E, has therapeutic benefit in FRDA. At present, about one-half of patients use coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E [supplements](../glossary#supplement) despite the lack of proven therapeutic benefit [(77)](#reference77). Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs): SCAs are a group of rare [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) dominant [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by gait difficulty, loss of hand dexterity, dysarthria, and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline. SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 most common SCAs [(81)](#reference81). [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) coenzyme Q10 treatment of forearm skin [fibroblasts](../glossary#fibroblast) isolated from patients with SCA2 was found to reduce [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and normalize complex I and II-III [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) [(82)](#reference82). A cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 319 patients with SCAs (15 years) found no difference in the rate of disease progression over two years between those taking [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 (median dose, 600 mg/day) and nonusers [(81)](#reference81). interest in coenzyme Q10 as a potential therapeutic agent in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) was stimulated by an [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) that found that individuals with lung, [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), and especially breast cancer were more likely to have low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentrations than healthy controls [(83)](#reference83). Two [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have explored the effect of coenzyme Q10 as an [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to conventional therapy for breast cancer. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 failed to improve measures of fatigue and quality of life in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer [(84)](#reference84) and in patients receiving [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) [(85)](#reference85). There is little evidence that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 improves athletic performance in healthy individuals. A few [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have examined the effects of 100 to 150 mg/day of supplemental coenzyme Q10 for three to eight weeks on physical performance in trained and untrained men. Most did not find significant differences between the group taking coenzyme Q10 and the group taking placebo with respect to measures of aerobic exercise performance, such as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and exercise time to exhaustion [(86-90)](#reference86). One study found the maximal cycling workload to be slightly (4%) increased after eight weeks of coenzyme Q10 supplementation compared to placebo, although measures of aerobic power were not increased [(91)](#reference91). Two studies actually found significantly greater improvement in measures of anaerobic [(87)](#reference87) and aerobic [(86)](#reference86) exercise performance with a placebo than with supplemental coenzyme Q10. More recent studies have suggested that coenzyme Q10 could help reduce both muscle damage-associated [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and low-grade [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) induced by strenuous exercise [(92-95)](#reference92). Studies on the effect of supplementation on physical performance in women are lacking, but there is little reason to suspect a gender difference in the response to coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Coenzyme Q10 is biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 involves three major steps: (1) synthesis of the benzoquinone structure from 4-hydroxybenzoate derived from either tyrosine or phenylalanine, two amino acids; (2) synthesis of the polyisoprenoid side chain from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) via the mevalonate pathway; and (3) the joining (condensation) of these two structures to form coenzyme Q10. In the mevalonate pathway, biosynthetic pathways of both coenzyme and pyridoxine ( [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6)), in the form of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, is required for the conversion of tyrosine to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid that constitutes the first step in the biosynthesis of the benzoquinone structure of coenzyme Q10. It is not known to what extent the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway may be affected by inadequate pantothenic acid and/or vitamin B6 nutritional [status](../glossary#status). It has been estimated that dietary consumption contributes to about 25% of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10, but there are currently no specific dietary intake recommendations for coenzyme Q10 from the US National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) or other agencies [(96)](#reference96). The extent to which dietary consumption contributes to tissue coenzyme Q10 concentrations is not clear. Based on studies employing [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire), the average dietary intake of coenzyme Q10 is about 3 to 6 mg/day [(97)](#reference97). Rich sources of dietary coenzyme Q10 include mainly meat, poultry, and fish. Other good sources include soybean, corn, olive, and canola oils; nuts; and seeds. Fruit, vegetables, eggs, and dairy products are moderate sources of coenzyme Q10 [(97)](#reference97). Some dietary sources are meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| Coenzyme Q10 is available without a prescription as a dietary [supplement](../glossary#supplement) in the US. Doses in supplements for adults range from 30 to 100 mg/day, which are considerably higher than typically estimated dietary coenzyme Q10 intakes. Coenzyme Q10 is fat-soluble and is best absorbed with fat in a meal. Doses higher than 100 mg/day are generally divided into two or three doses throughout the day [(101)](#reference101). Less than 5% of orally administered coenzyme Q10 is thought to reach the circulation [(102)](#reference102). Therefore, [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of coenzyme Q10 as high as 1,200 to 3,000 mg/day for adults and 30 mg/kg/day for children are usually needed to relieve symptoms in patients with coenzyme Q10 deficiency [(26)](#reference26). Oral supplementation with coenzyme Q10 is to increase blood and to reach a supplementation with a dose of 2,400 mg/day [(103, 104)](#reference103). Yet, under normal circumstances, uptake of supplemental coenzyme Q10 from peripheral tissues/organs is likely limited because is ubiquitously [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) [(105)](#reference105). Nonetheless, under aging) or in [pathologies](../glossary#pathology), coenzyme Q10 [status](../glossary#status) might be compromised and it is then presumed that supplementation might increase coenzyme Q10 concentrations in tissues that are deficient [(106)](#reference106). For example, a study in 24 older adults supplemented with 300 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for at least seven days prior to cardiac surgery found that the coenzyme Q10 content of atrial tissue was significantly increased in those taking coenzyme Q10, especially in patients greater than 70 years of age [(38)](#reference38). In another study of patients with left ventricular dysfunction, supplementation with 150 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for four weeks before cardiac surgery increased coenzyme Q10 concentrations in the heart but not in skeletal muscle [(107)](#reference107). Finally, a 2007 review of the literature highlighted that plasma coenzyme Q10 concentrations higher than 'normal' were likely needed to promote coenzyme Q10 uptake by peripheral tissues and different tissues may indeed require different plasma thresholds for the uptake of coenzyme Q10 [(102)](#reference102). There have been no reports of significant adverse side effects of oral coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) at doses as high as 3,000 mg/day for up to eight months [(103)](#reference103), 1,200 mg/day for up to 16 months [(65)](#reference65), and 600 mg/day for up to 30 months [(73)](#reference73). According to the observed safe level (OSL) risk assessment method, evidence of safety is strong with doses up to 1,200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 [(108)](#reference108). Some people have experienced [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, appetite suppression, heartburn, and abdominal discomfort, especially with daily doses 200 mg [(109)](#reference109). These adverse effects may be minimized if daily doses >100 mg are divided into two or three daily doses [(101)](#reference101). During pregnancy, the use of coenzyme Q10 supplements (100 mg twice daily) from 20 weeks' [gestation](../glossary#gestation) was found to be safe [(110)](#reference110). Because reliable data in lactating women are not available, supplementation should be avoided during breast-feeding [(110)](#reference110). Concomitant use of warfarin (Coumadin) and coenzyme Q10 [supplements](../glossary#supplement) has been reported to decrease the [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) effect of warfarin in a few cases [(111)](#reference111). An individual on warfarin should not begin taking coenzyme Q10 supplements without consulting the health care provider who is managing his or her anticoagulant therapy. If warfarin and coenzyme Q10 are to be used concomitantly, blood tests to assess clotting time (prothrombin time; PT/INR) should be monitored frequently, especially in the first two weeks. HMG-CoA reductase is an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) a biochemical reaction common are widely used as cholesterol-lowering medications. Statins can thus also reduce the [endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) coenzyme Q10 [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration by the concentration of circulating lipids [(122, 123)](#reference122). It is likely that circulating coenzyme Q10 concentrations are decreased because statins reduce circulating lipids rather than because they inhibit coenzyme Q10 synthesis [(124)](#reference124). In addition, very few studies have examined coenzyme Q10 concentrations in tissues other than blood such that the extent to which statin therapy affects coenzyme Q10 concentrations in the body's tissues is unknown [(118](#reference118), [120](#reference120), [125)](#reference125). Finally, there is currently little evidence to suggest that secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is responsible for statin-associated muscle symptoms in treated patients.

Lipoic acid is [covalently](../glossary#covalent-bond) bound to certain [proteins](../glossary#protein), which function as part of essential [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) multi [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) complexes involved in energy and [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). In addition to the physiological functions of protein-bound lipoic acid, there is increasing scientific and medical interest in potential therapeutic uses of [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of free (unbound) lipoic acid [(3)](#reference3). Lipoic acid contains two thiol (sulfur) groups, which may be [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) or [reduced](../glossary#reduction); dihydrolipoic acid is the reduced form of lipoic acid (Figure 1) [(4)](#reference4). Lipoic acid also contains an asymmetric carbon, which means that lipoic acid can exist as one of two possible optical [isomers](../glossary#isomer), also called [enantiomers](../glossary#enantiomer). These enantiomers are mirror images of each other: R-lipoic acid and S-lipoic acid (Figure 1). Only the R-enantiomer is [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) synthesized and covalently bound to protein. R-lipoic acid occurs naturally in food (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Free (unbound) lipoic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) or 50:50 ( [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture)) mixture of R-lipoic and S-lipoic acid (see [Supplements](#supplements)). The [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of lipoic acid has been characterized in detail in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not all genes involved in the process have been identified in humans [(5)](#reference5). Lipoic acid is synthesized [de protein (ACP; article on [Pantothenic Acid](../vitamins/pantothenic-acid#function)) during the process of fatty acid synthesis (Figure 2). An enzyme called lipoyl (octanoyl) transferase 2 [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the from octanoyl-ACP to a conserved lysine of the H protein of the glycine cleavage system (see also [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). The next reaction is the insertion of two sulfur atoms at positions 6 and 8 of the protein H-bound octanoyl moiety, thereby producing a dihydrolipoyl moiety. This step by the lipoic (also called lipoyl synthase), an enzyme containing iron-sulfur clusters that act as sulfur donors in the reaction [(5)](#reference5). Finally, the enzyme lipoyl transferase 1 catalyzes the transfer of the dihydrolipoyl moiety from the H protein of the glycine cleavage system to conserved lysine residues of the by a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Figure 2). Consumption of lipoic acid from food has not yet been found to result in detectable increases of free lipoic acid in human [plasma](../glossary#plasma) or cells [(3](#reference3), [6)](#reference6). In contrast, high oral doses of free lipoic acid (50 mg) significantly, yet transiently, increase the concentration of free lipoic acid in plasma and cells. [Pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies in humans have found that about 30%-40% of an oral dose of a [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) mixture of R-lipoic acid and S-lipoic acid is absorbed [(6, 7)](#reference6). Oral lipoic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are better absorbed on an empty stomach than with food: taking lipoic acid with food (versus without food) decreased peak plasma lipoic acid concentrations by about 30% and total plasma lipoic acid concentrations by about 20% [(8)](#reference8). A liquid formulation of R-lipoic acid was found to be better absorbed and more stable in the plasma, suggesting that it might be more efficacious than the solid form in the management of a condition like diabetic neuropathy [(9, 10)](#reference9). There may also be differences in [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the two [isomers](../glossary#isomer) of lipoic acid. Following single oral doses R,S-lipoic acid (racemic mixture), peak plasma concentrations of R-lipoic acid were found to be 40%-50% higher than S-lipoic acid, suggesting a differential absorption in favor of the R-enantiomer [(6](#reference6), [8](#reference8), [11)](#reference11). Yet, following oral ingestion, both enantiomers are rapidly [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) and [excreted](../glossary#excretion). Plasma lipoic acid concentrations generally peak within one hour or less and decline rapidly [(6, 7](#reference6), [11, 12)](#reference11). In cells, lipoic dihydrolipoic acid, and [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) studies indicate that dihydrolipoic acid is then rapidly exported from cells [(3)](#reference3). Moreover, a [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) in 19 healthy adults suggested that the bioavailability of R,S-lipoic acid and R-lipoic acid may vary with age and gender [(13)](#reference13). Finally, there is no evidence in humans that exogenous lipoic acid can be 'activated' with [ATP](../glossary#ATP) or by a lipoyl a loss of lipoic acid-dependent enzymatic activity caused by defects in endogenous lipoic acid synthesis (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)) cannot be rescued by the provision of exogenous lipoic acid [(5)](#reference5). R-lipoic acid is an essential [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for several [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) multi [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) complexes that [catalyze](../glossary#catalyze) critical reactions related to the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) (breakdown) of [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) and the production of energy [(15)](#reference15). R-lipoic acid is [covalently](../glossary#covalent-bond) bound to a specific lysine [residue](../glossary#residue) in at least one of the [proteins](../glossary#protein) in each multienzyme complex. Such a non- [protein](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#protein) cofactor is known as a \"prosthetic group.\" R-lipoic acid functions as a prosthetic group for the biological activity of the following multienzyme complexes: (i) the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), an important [substrate](../glossary#substrate) for energy production via the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle); (ii) the -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex that catalyzes the conversion of -ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA, another important intermediate of the citric acid cycle; (iii) the branched-chain -ketoacid dehydrogenase complex that is involved in the decarboxylation of ketoacids in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids, namely leucine, isoleucine, and valine; (iv) decarboxylation the hydroxylysine, tryptophan. All four as group essential for E2 transacetylase activity, dehydrogenase R-lipoic acid is also found in the E3-binding protein (protein X component) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [(5)](#reference5). When considering the biological activities of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) (unbound) lipoic acid, it is important to keep in mind the limited and transient nature of the increases in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and tissue lipoic acid (see [Metabolism and [reactive nitrogen species](../glossary#reactive-nitrogen-species) (RNS) are highly reactive compounds with the potential to damage [DNA](../glossary#DNA), [proteins](../glossary#protein), and [lipids](../glossary#lipid) in [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Both dihydrolipoic acid can directly [scavenge](../glossary#scavenge) (neutralize) physiologically relevant ROS and RNS in the test tube (reviewed in [3](#reference3)). However, whether direct quenching reactions occur [in vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) is unknown. The highest tissue concentrations of free lipoic acid likely to be achieved through oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) are at least 10 times lower than those of other intracellular [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), such as [vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) and [glutathione](../glossary#gluathione). Moreover, free lipoic acid is rapidly eliminated from cells, so any increases in direct radical scavenging activity are unlikely to be sustained. Regeneration of other antioxidants: When an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) [scavenges](../glossary#scavenge) a [free radical](../glossary#free-radical), it becomes [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) itself and is not able to scavenge additional [ROS](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) or [RNS](../glossary#reactive-nitrogen-species) until it has been [reduced](../glossary#reduction). In the test tube, dihydrolipoic acid is a potent reducing agent with the capacity to reduce the oxidized forms of several important antioxidants, including [coenzyme 17)](#reference16). reduce the oxidized form of -tocopherol ( [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E)) directly or indirectly through regenerating oxidized vitamin C (see the article on [Vitamin E](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-E#function)) [(18)](#reference18) or oxidized coenzyme effectively unclear Metal metal [ions](../glossary#ion), as [copper](../minerals/copper), can induce [oxidative [(20)](#reference20). Compounds that [chelate](../glossary#chelate) free metal ions in a way that prevents them from generating free radicals offer promise in the treatment of [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) and other [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) in which metal-induced may play a [pathogenic](../glossary#pathogen) role [(21)](#reference21). Both lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid have been found to inhibit copper- and iron-mediated oxidative damage in the test tube [(22, 23)](#reference22) and to inhibit excess iron and copper accumulation in animal models [(24, 25)](#reference24). Lipoic acid may also be helpful as an adjunct treatment against heavy metal toxicity. No clinical trial has examined the use of lipoic acid as a chelating agent in mercury toxicity, yet it has proven to be effective in several mammalian species [(26, 27)](#reference26). Activation of antioxidant signaling pathways: [Glutathione](../glossary#gluathione) is an important intracellular [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) that also plays a role in the detoxification and elimination of potential [carcinogens](../glossary#carcinogen) and toxins. Reductions in glutathione [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and tissue glutathione concentrations in aged animals (compared to younger ones) are suggestive of a potentially lower ability to respond to [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) or toxin exposure [(28)](#reference28). Lipoic acid has been found to increase glutathione concentrations in cultured cells and in the tissues of aged animals fed lipoic acid [(29, 30)](#reference29). Lipoic acid might be able to increase glutathione synthesis in aged rats by up-regulating the increasing cellular uptake of cysteine, an [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) required for glutathione synthesis [(32)](#reference32). Lipoic acid was found to upregulate the expression of -GCL and other antioxidant enzymes via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway [(31](#reference31), [33)](#reference33). Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol). Keap1 responds to oxidative stress signals by freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) where it can bind to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) region of [genes](../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant enzymes and scavengers. Lipoic acid \u2014 but not dihydrolipoic acid \u2014 can react with specific sulfhydryl residues of Keap1, causing the release of Nrf2 [(34)](#reference34). Nrf2/ARE target genes code for several upregulation of the Nrf2 pathway by lipoic acid in cultured hepatocytes and in the liver of obese or diabetic rats prevented [lipid](../glossary#lipid) overload-induced [steatosis](../glossary#steatosis) [(35)](#reference35) and cell death [(36)](#reference36). Lipoic acid protected liver from oxidative stress-induced liver injury in methotrexate-treated rats through the activation of Nrf-2 pathway and other anti-inflammatory pathways [(37)](#reference37). Pre-treatment and and reversed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced enzymatic complex that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the production of superoxide from oxygen and NADPH and has been involved in innate immune defense against microbes [(39)](#reference39). Lipoic acid prevented NOX-induced superoxide production in a rat model of [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) and limited infarct volume limited NOX-generated [ROS](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) production and reduced cancer cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) induced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection [(41)](#reference41). The binding of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) the insulin [receptor](../glossary#receptor) stimulates a cascade of [protein](../glossary#protein) [phosphorylations](../glossary#phosphorylation) leading to of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) transporters (GLUT4) to the [cell membrane](../glossary#cell-membrane) and an increased cellular uptake of glucose [(3](#reference3), [42)](#reference42). Lipoic acid has been found to activate the insulin signaling cascade in cultured cells [(3](#reference3), [42, 43)](#reference42), increase GLUT4 translocation to cell membranes, and increase glucose uptake in cultured [adipose](../glossary#adipose) and muscle cells [(44, 45)](#reference44). A computer modeling study suggested that lipoic acid might bind to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor and stabilize the active form of the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) [(43)](#reference43). In addition to Nrf2 and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) signaling pathways, lipoic acid was found to target other [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) molecules thereby affecting a variety of cellular processes, including [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), stress responses, [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), and survival. For example, in cultured [endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells, lipoic acid was found to inhibit IKK-, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that promotes the translocation the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) [(46)](#reference46). Lipoic acid also been shown to improve [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO)-dependent [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation) in aged rats by NO synthase (eNOS) and triggering [AMP](../glossary#AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-induced transcription factor PGC-1 activation in skeletal muscle of aged mice [(48)](#reference48). Several reviews of the literature have described pathways that are potential targets of lipoic acid in various models and under different experimental conditions [(49-52)](#reference49). Lipoic acid deficiency has been described in rare cases of inherited [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the lipoic acid biosynthetic pathway. Mutations identified in patients with defective lipoic acid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) affect [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of iron-sulfur clusters genes for is the hallmark of [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). Type 1 diabetes is caused by the [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) destruction of the [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-producing -cells of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), leading to an insufficient production of insulin. Exogenous insulin is required to maintain a normal blood glucose concentration (i.e., fasting blood glucose <100 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]). In contrast, impaired tissue glucose uptake in response to insulin (a phenomenon called [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance)) plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes [(55)](#reference55). Although patients with type 2 diabetes may eventually require insulin, interventions that enhance [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) may be used to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations. The term 'prediabetes' is sometimes used to describe early metabolic abnormalities that place individuals at high [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes. Of note, these patients are also at high risk for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). According to the American Diabetes Association, prediabetes can be defined by a condition of impaired fasting glucose, characterized by a fasting blood glucose concentration between 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL and/or a condition of impaired glucose tolerance, characterized by a 2-hour blood glucose concentration 140 mg/dL following an oral glucose tolerance test [(56)](#reference56). The effect of high-dose lipoic acid on [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization has been primarily examined in individuals with type 2 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). An early [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) in 13 patients with type 2 diabetes found that a single [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) infusion of 1,000 mg of lipoic acid improved [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-stimulated glucose disposal (i.e., [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive)) by 50% compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) infusion [(57)](#reference57). A placebo-controlled study of 72 patients with type 2 diabetes found that oral administration of lipoic acid at doses of 600 mg/day, 1,200 mg/day or 1,800 mg/day improved insulin sensitivity by 25% after four weeks of treatment [(58)](#reference58). There were no significant differences among the three doses of lipoic acid, suggesting that 600 mg/day may be the maximum effective dose [(55)](#reference55). However, in a more recent randomized, placebo-controlled study in 102 subjects, daily supplementation with 600 mg of lipoic acid (+/- 800 mg of vitamin E [-tocopherol]) for 16 weeks had no effect on fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, or a measure of insulin resistance called the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index [(59)](#reference59). A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis identified 20 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (published between 2007 and 2017) that examined the effect of supplemental lipoic acid on markers of glucose utilization in 1,245 subjects with metabolic disorders (not limited to type 2 diabetes) [(60)](#reference60). Administration of lipoic acid (200 to 1,800 mg/day for 2 weeks to 1 year), alone or together with other nutrients, was found to lower fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin resistance, and blood HbA1c concentration \u2014 a marker of glycemic control over the past few months [(60)](#reference60). The inner lining of blood vessels, known as the [vascular endothelium](../glossary#vascular-endothelium), plays an important role in the maintenance of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) health. In particular, [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) regulates vascular tone and blood flow by promoting the relaxation of all types of blood vessels, including arteries \u2014 a phenomenon called [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation). Alterations in NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation results in widespread [vasoconstriction](../glossary#vasoconstriction) and [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) abnormalities and is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis). The presence of chronic [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia), [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and pro-inflammatory [(61)](#reference61). The measurement of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is often used as a surrogate marker of endothelial function. Two techniques are being used to measure endothelium-dependent vasodilation. One technique measures the forearm blood flow by venous occlusion plethysmography during infusion of acetylcholine. Using this invasive technique, intra-arterial infusion of lipoic acid was found to improve [endothelium-dependent vasodilation](../glossary#endothelium-dependent-vasodilation) in 39 subjects with type 2 diabetes but not in 11 healthy controls [(62)](#reference62). A more recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 30 patients with type 2 diabetes found that [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) infusion of 600 mg of lipoic acid improved the response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator measure flow-mediated vasodilation was used in two additional studies conducted by Xiang et al. [(64, 65)](#reference64). The results of these randomized, placebo-controlled studies showed that intravenous lipoic acid could improve endothelial function in patients with impaired fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [(64)](#reference64) or impaired glucose tolerance [(65)](#reference65). One randomized placebo-controlled trial that assessed the effect of oral lipoic acid supplementation in 58 patients diagnosed with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome), a condition characterized by abnormal glucose and [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), showed that flow-mediated vasodilation improved by 44% with 300 mg/day of lipoic acid for four weeks [(66)](#reference66). Peripheral neuropathy: Up to 50% of diabetic patients develop [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy), a type of nerve damage that may result in pain, loss of sensation, and weakness, particularly in the lower extremities [(67)](#reference67). Peripheral neuropathy is also a leading cause of lower limb amputation in diabetic patients [(68)](#reference68). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain chronic [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia)-induced nerve damage, such as intracellular accumulation of sorbitol, glycation reactions, and [oxidative](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and nitrosative stress (reviewed in [69](#reference69)). The results of several large [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) indicated that maintaining blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) at near normal concentrations was the most important step in limiting the [risk](../glossary#risk) of diabetic neuropathy and lower extremity amputation [(70-72)](#reference70). However, evidence of the efficacy of enhanced control of glycemia in preventing neuropathy is stronger in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 diabetes [(73)](#reference73). Moreover, this glucose control intervention increased the risk of hypoglycemic episodes [(73)](#reference73). The efficacy of lipoic acid, administered either [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) or orally, in the management of neuropathic symptoms has been examined in patients with diabetes. [Meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of randomized controlled trials suggest that infusion of 300 to 600 mg/day of lipoic acid for two to four weeks significantly reduced the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy to a clinically meaningful degree [(55](#reference55), [74)](#reference74). Regarding the efficacy of oral lipoic acid supplementation, an initial short-term study in 24 patients with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found that the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy improved in those who took 600 mg of lipoic acid three times a day for three weeks compared to those who took a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(75)](#reference75). A larger [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) randomly assigned more than 500 patients with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic peripheral neuropathy to one of the following treatments: (i) 600 mg/day of intravenous lipoic acid for three weeks followed by 1,800 mg/day of oral lipoic acid for six months, (ii) 600 mg/day of intravenous lipoic acid for three weeks followed by oral placebo for six months, or (iii) intravenous placebo for three weeks followed by oral placebo for six months [(76)](#reference76). Evidence of improvements in sensory and motor deficits \u2014 assessed by physicians \u2014 could be observed after three weeks of intravenous lipoic acid therapy, yet not at the end of six months of oral lipoic acid therapy. However, another [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial in 181 patients with diabetic neuropathy found that oral supplementation with either 600 mg/day, 1,200 mg/day, or 1,800 mg/day of lipoic acid for five weeks significantly improved neuropathic symptoms [(77)](#reference77). In this study, the 600 mg/day dose was as effective as the higher doses. Finally, a four-year, multicenter, clinical trial in 421 diabetic patients with distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy found no difference between oral administration of 600 mg/day of lipoic and placebo on the primary endpoint, a composite score that assessed neuropathic impairment of the lower limbs and nerve conduction [(78)](#reference78). Yet, measures of specific neuropathic impairments (secondary outcomes) improved with lipoic acid supplementation [(78)](#reference78). A post-hoc analysis suggested that oral lipoic acid supplementation may reduce neuropathic symptoms particularly in subjects with a high burden of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), diabetes, and neuropathy yet with normal and [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) is cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), which occurs in as many as 25% of diabetic patients [(55)](#reference55). CAN is characterized by damage to the nerve fibers that innervate the heart and blood vessels, leading to reduced heart rate variability (variability in the time interval between heartbeats) and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality [(80)](#reference80). In a [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of 72 patients with type 2 diabetes and reduced heart rate variability, oral supplementation with 800 mg/day of lipoic acid for four months resulted in significant improvement in two out of four measures of heart rate variability compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(81)](#reference81). Summary: Overall, the available research suggests that treatment with [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) or oral lipoic acid may help reduce symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The use of lipoic acid is currently approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy in Germany [(4)](#reference4). It is important to note that many of the studies that examined the efficacy of lipoic acid in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy have been primarily conducted by one German research group and funded by the manufacturer of lipoic acid in Germany [(82)](#reference82). Chronic [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) can damage blood vessels in the [retina](../glossary#retina) and cause a potentially sight-threatening condition called diabetic retinopathy [(83)](#reference83). One placebo-controlled study examined the effect of lipoic acid on the visual capability of 80 participants of whom 12 had type 1 diabetes, 48 had type 2 diabetes, and 20 were diabetes-free. The result showed that daily oral administration of 300 mg of lipoic acid for three months prevented the deterioration of contrast sensitivity in patients with diabetes and improved it in healthy patients compared to placebo [(84)](#reference84). [Multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) is an [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) disease of unknown [etiology](../glossary#etiology) that is characterized by the progressive destruction of [myelin](../glossary#myelin) and nerve fibers in the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), causing [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in affected individuals [(85)](#reference85). There are four main types of multiple sclerosis defined according to the disease course: (i) clinically isolated syndrome, (ii) relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, (iii) secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and (iv) primary progressive multiple sclerosis (for more information, visit the [National Multiple Sclerosis Society website](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/)) [(86)](#reference86). Lipoic acid was found to effectively slow disease progression when administered either orally [(87)](#reference87), [intraperitoneally](../glossary#intraperitoneal-injection) [(88)](#reference88), or [subcutaneously](../glossary#subcutaneous) [(89)](#reference89) to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) and animal studies have found that lipoic acid exhibits immunomodulatory properties through mechanisms that stimulate the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) [(90, 91)](#reference90) \u2014 a central regulator of [innate immune](../health-disease/immunity#innate-immunity) functions \u2014 and inhibits the migration of immune cells into the brain and spinal cord [(92)](#reference92), possibly by decreasing endothelial expression of cell adhesion molecules, inhibiting expression of enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and/or reducing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier [(87, 89](#reference87), [93, 94)](#reference93). Only a few studies have examined lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in humans. A small [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) designed to evaluate the safety of lipoic acid in 30 people with relapsing or progressive multiple sclerosis found that treatment with 1,200 to 2,400 mg/day of oral lipoic acid for two weeks was generally well tolerated (see [Safety](#safety)) [(95)](#reference95). In this study, higher [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of lipoic acid were associated with the lowest serum concentrations of MMP-9 \u2014 a marker of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) [(95)](#reference95). Another study suggested that an oral dose of 1,200 mg of lipoic acid in subjects with multiple sclerosis could help achieve serum lipoic acid concentrations similar to those found to be therapeutic in mice [(96)](#reference96). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 52 subjects (mean age, 30 years) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis found an increase in total [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity in blood with lipoic acid supplementation (1,200 mg/day for 12 weeks) yet not in the activity of specific antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) [(97)](#reference97). Supplemental serum concentrations of some (IFN-, ICAM-1, TGF-, IL-4), but not markers (TNF-, and other inflammation [(98)](#reference98). In addition, lipoic acid supplementation did not reduce the severity of multiple sclerosis symptoms, as assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scoring system [(98, 99)](#reference98). A two-year [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) designed to assess the effect of lipoic acid (1,200 mg/day) on loss of mobility and changes in brain volume in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis is ongoing [(85)](#reference85). Studies in animal models of aging and [neurodegenerative disease](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) have indicated that lipoic acid administration might improve measures of spatial memory, learning capacity, and/or motor function (reviewed in [100](#reference100)). It is not known whether oral lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) can slow [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline related to aging or [pathological](../glossary#pathology) conditions in humans. An uncontrolled, [open-label trial](../glossary#open-label-trial) in nine patients with probable [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/Alzheimer-disease) and related [dementias](../glossary#dementia), who were also taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, reported that oral supplementation with 600 mg/day of lipoic acid appeared to stabilize cognitive function over a one-year period [(101)](#reference101). A subsequent study that followed 43 patients for up to four years found those with mild dementia or moderate-early dementia who took lipoic acid (600 mg/day), in addition to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, experienced slower cognitive decline compared to the typical cognitive decline of Alzheimer's patients as reported in the literature [(102)](#reference102). However, the significance of these findings is difficult to assess without a control group for comparison. A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that oral supplementation with 1,200 mg/day of lipoic acid for 10 weeks was of no benefit in treating [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-associated cognitive impairment [(103)](#reference103). The results of another randomized trial in 39 patients with Alzheimer's disease suggested that supplementation with fish oil concentrate (high in [omega-3 fatty acids](../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids)) with or without lipoic acid (600 mg/day) for one year could delay the progression in cognitive and functional impairments assessed by the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scoring system compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(104)](#reference104). Interestingly, patients who took fish oil concentrate together with lipoic acid showed no worsening of global cognitive function (as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score system) over 12 months as opposed to those who took either the fish oil concentrate alone or a placebo [(104)](#reference104). Larger trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings and further evaluate the usefulness of supplemental lipoic acid in the prevention and/or management of neurodegenerative diseases. A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials found that lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in those with high [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI) resulted in significant, yet modest, reductions in weight (9 studies) and BMI (11 studies) in the absence of caloric restriction (except in one study) [(105)](#reference105). Subgroup analyses revealed that weight loss was greater in overweight versus obese participants, in unhealthy versus healthy participants, with daily doses 600 mg, and for intervention period shorter than 10 weeks. There was no reduction in waist circumference with supplemental lipoic acid (5 studies) [(105)](#reference105). Substantial weight and BMI reductions with lipoic acid supplementation in overweight or obese subjects were also reported in a prior meta-analysis [(106)](#reference106). R-lipoic acid is synthesized [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) by humans (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). R-lipoic acid occurs naturally in food in [proteins](../glossary#protein) (lipoyllysine; see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). Although lipoic acid is found in a wide variety of foods from plant and animal sources, quantitative information on the lipoic acid or lipoyllysine content of food is limited; published databases are lacking. Animal tissues with high lipoyllysine content (~1-3 g/g dry wt) include kidney, heart, and liver, while lipoyllysine-rich vegetables include spinach and broccoli [(107)](#reference107). Somewhat lower amounts of lipoyllysine (~0.5 g/g dry wt) have been measured in tomatoes, peas, and Brussels sprouts. Unlike lipoic acid in foods, lipoic acid in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) is not bound to [protein](../glossary#protein). Moreover, the amounts of lipoic acid available in dietary supplements (50-600 mg) are likely as much as 1,000 times greater than the amounts that could be obtained from the diet. In Germany, lipoic acid is approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathies and is available by prescription [(108)](#reference108). Lipoic acid is available as a dietary supplement without a prescription in the US. Most lipoic acid supplements contain a [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) mixture of R-lipoic acid and S-lipoic acid (sometimes noted d,l-lipoic acid). Supplements that claim to contain only R-lipoic acid are usually more expensive, and information regarding their purity is not publicly available [(109)](#reference109). Since taking lipoic acid with a meal decreases its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability), it is generally recommended that lipoic acid be taken 30 min prior to a meal (see also [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) [(8)](#reference8). R-lipoic acid is the [isomer](../glossary#isomer) that is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by plants and animals and functions as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) in its [protein](../glossary#protein)-bound form (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Direct comparisons of the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the oral [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) mixture and R-lipoic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) have not been published. Following the ingestion of R,S-lipoic acid, peak [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of R-lipoic acid were found to be 40%-50% higher than S-lipoic acid, suggesting better absorption of R-lipoic acid. Both isomers were nonetheless rapidly [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) and eliminated [(6](#reference6), [8](#reference8), [11)](#reference11). In rats, R-lipoic acid was more effective than S-lipoic acid in enhancing [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-stimulated [glucose](../glossary#glucose) transport and metabolism in skeletal muscle [(110)](#reference110), and R-lipoic acid was more effective than R,S-lipoic acid and S-lipoic acid in preventing [cataracts](../glossary#cataract) [(111)](#reference111). However, all of the published human studies have used R,S-lipoic acid (racemic mixture). It has been suggested that the presence of S-lipoic acid in the racemic mixture may limit the polymerization of R-lipoic acid and enhance its bioavailability [(52)](#reference52). At present, it remains unclear which supplemental form is best to use in [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). In general, high-dose lipoic acid administration has been found to have few serious side effects. [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of lipoic acid at doses of 600 mg/day for three weeks [(112)](#reference112) and oral lipoic acid at doses as high as 1,800 mg/day for six months [(113)](#reference113) and 1,200 mg/day for two years [(76)](#reference76) did not result in serious adverse effects when used to treat [diabetic](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events in patients with diabetic neuropathy who took 600 mg/day of lipoic acid for four years compared to those in the [placebo](../glossary#placebo) group [(78)](#reference78). Oral intake of 2,400 mg/day for two weeks was also found to be safe in a [pilot study](../glossary#placebo) that included participants with [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) [(95)](#reference95). Two mild [anaphylactoid](../glossary#anaphylaxis) reactions and one severe [anaphylactic](../glossary#anaphylaxis) reaction, including laryngospasm, were reported after intravenous lipoic acid administration [(55)](#reference55). The most frequently reported side effects of oral lipoic acid supplementation are allergic reactions affecting the skin, including rashes, hives, and itching. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and vertigo have also been reported, and one trial found that the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and vertigo was dose-dependent [(77)](#reference77). Further, malodorous urine has been noted by people taking 1,200 mg/day of lipoic acid orally [(95)](#reference95). A [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) reported that daily oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 600 mg of lipoic acid ( [racemic](../glossary#racemic-mixture) mixture) during pregnancy and without interruption from a period spanning between week 10 and week 30 of gestation and until the end of week 37 was not associated with any adverse effect in mothers and their newborns [(114)](#reference114). In absence of further evidence, lipoic acid supplementation during pregnancy should only be considered under strict medical supervision. The safety of lipoic acid supplements in lactating women has not been established and should thus be discouraged [(115)](#reference115). A case of intoxication was reported in a 20-month old child (10.5 kg bw) after the accidental ingestion of four 600-mg tablets of lipoic acid [(116)](#reference116). The child was admitted to hospital with [seizure](../glossary#seizure), acidosis, and unconsciousness. Symptomatic management and rapid elimination of lipoic acid led to a full recovery without sequelae within five days. The non-accidental ingestion of a very high dose of lipoic acid led to multi-organ failure and subsequent death of an adolescent girl [(117)](#reference117). In theory, because lipoic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may improve [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-mediated [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization (see [Diabetes mellitus](#diabetes-treatment)), there is a potential [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia) in diabetic patients using insulin or oral anti-diabetic agents [(118)](#reference118). Consequently, blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely when lipoic acid supplementation is added to diabetes treatment regimens. Yet, one study in 24 healthy volunteers reported no significant drug interactions with the co-administration of a single oral dose of lipoic acid (600 mg) and the oral anti-diabetic agents, glyburide (also called glybenclamide) or acarbose (Precose/Prandase/Glucobay) [(119)](#reference119). The chemical structure of [biotin](../vitamins/biotin) is similar to that of lipoic acid, and there is some evidence that high concentrations of lipoic acid can compete with biotin for transport across [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) [(120, 121)](#reference120). The administration of high doses of lipoic acid by injection to rats decreased the activity of two biotin-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) by about 30%-35% [(122)](#reference122), but it is not known whether oral or [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) lipoic acid supplementation substantially increases the requirement for biotin in humans [(123)](#reference123).

However, the term is generally used to describe chemicals from plants that may affect health, but are not essential nutrients. While there is ample evidence to support the health benefits of diets rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts, evidence that these effects are due to specific nutrients or phytochemicals is limited. Because plant-based foods are complex mixtures of bioactive compounds, information on the potential health effects of individual phytochemicals is linked to information on the health effects of foods that contain those phytochemicals. Select a phytochemical from the list for more information. The information on dietary phytochemicals from the Linus Pauling Institute's Micronutrient Information Center is now available in a book titled, An Evidence-based Approach to Phytochemicals and Other Dietary Factors. The book can be purchased from the [Linus Pauling Institute](/books) or [Thieme Medical Publishers](http://www.thieme.com/books-main/complementary-medicine/product/1635-an-evidence-based-approach-to-phytochemicals-and-other-dietary-factors). Contents Carotenoids are a class of more than 750 naturally occurring pigments [synthesized](../../glossary#synthesis) by plants, algae, and photosynthetic [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) [(1)](#references). These richly colored molecules are the sources of the yellow, orange, and red colors of many plants. [Fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) provide most of the 40 to 50 carotenoids found in the human diet. -Carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein, -carotene and -cryptoxanthin are provitamin A carotenoids, meaning they can be converted by the body to retinol (Figure 1). Lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene are nonprovitamin A carotenoids because they cannot be converted to retinol (Figure 2). For dietary carotenoids to be absorbed intestinally, they must be released from the food matrix and incorporated into mixed [micelles](../../glossary#micelle) (mixtures of [bile salts](../../glossary#bile-acids) and several types of [lipids](../../glossary#lipid)). Food processing and cooking help release carotenoids embedded in their food matrix and increase intestinal absorption [(1)](#references). Moreover, carotenoid absorption requires the presence of fat in a meal. As little as 3 to 5 g of fat in a meal appears sufficient to ensure carotenoid absorption [(2, 3)](#reference2), although the minimum amount of dietary fat required may be different for each carotenoid. The type of fat (e.g., medium-chain vs. long-chain [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglycerides)), the presence of [soluble](../../glossary#soluble) [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber), and the type and amount of carotenoids (e.g., [esterified](../../glossary#ester) vs. non-esterified) in the food also appear to influence the rate and extent of carotenoid absorption (reviewed in [4](#reference4)). Because they do not need to be released from the plant matrix, carotenoid [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) (in oil) are more efficiently absorbed than carotenoids in food [(3)](#reference3). Although carotenoids were initially thought to be absorbed within the cells that line the intestine ( [enterocytes](../../glossary#enterocyte)) only by passive diffusion, recent investigations identified the apical membrane transporters, Scavenger Receptor-class B type I (SR-BI) and Cluster Determinant 36 (CD36), suggesting active uptake of carotenoids as well [(5)](#reference5). Within the enterocytes, provitamin A be the cleavage provitamin A carotenoids into retinal, which is further [reduced](../../glossary#reduction) to retinol (vitamin A) or [oxidized](../../glossary#oxidation) to retinoic acid (the biologically active form of vitamin A). -Apocarotenal derived from the cleavage of -carotene by BCO2 can be cleaved further by BCO1 to produce retinal. Although provitamin A carotenoids can be converted into apocarotenals by BCO2, the activity of this [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) is higher toward nonprovitamin A carotenoids. Conversely, BCO1 shows limited affinity [lipoproteins](../../glossary#lipoprotein) called [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicron), secreted into lymphatic vessels, and then released in the bloodstream [(1)](#references). Triglycerides are depleted from circulating chylomicrons through the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, resulting in the formation of chylomicron remnants. Chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver, where carotenoids can be cleaved by BCO1/BCO2 or incorporated into lipoproteins and secreted back into the circulation for delivery to extrahepatic tissues. Of note, more [hydrophilic](../../glossary#hydrophilic) molecules in the enterocytes like retinoic acid and apocarotenals can be transported directly to the liver through the portal blood system. The conversion of provitamin A carotenoids to retinol is influenced by the vitamin A [status](../../glossary#status) of the individual [(6)](#reference6). The regulatory mechanism involving the intestine-specific homeobox (ISX) [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) can block carotenoid uptake and vitamin A production by inhibiting the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of SR-BI and BCO1. ISX is under the control of retinoid acid and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-dependent mechanisms such that, when vitamin A stores are high, ISX is activated and both provitamin A carotenoid absorption and conversion to retinol are inhibited. Conversely, during vitamin A insufficiency, the expression of both SR-BI and BCO1 is no longer repressed by ISX, allowing for provitamin A carotenoid absorption and conversion to retinol [(1)](#references). Interindividual variations in blood and tissue concentrations of carotenoids have been attributed to genetic differences among individuals. Specifically, a number of single [nucleotide](../../glossary#nucleotide) [polymorphisms](../../glossary#polymorphism) (SNPs) \u2014 corresponding to changes of one nucleotide in the sequence of [genes](../../glossary#gene) \u2014 have been identified in genes coding for [proteins](../../glossary#protein) involved in intestinal uptake, transport, and [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of carotenoids [(7)](#reference7). Specifically, SNPs within genes coding for SR-BI, CD36, and BCO1 are suspected to affect the expression and/or activity of these proteins and, in turn, individual carotenoid status [(7)](#reference7) Vitamin A is essential for normal growth and development, immune system function, and vision (see the article on [Vitamin A](../../vitamins/vitamin-A#function)). Currently, the only essential function of carotenoids recognized in humans is that of the provitamin A carotenoids, -carotene, -carotene, and -cryptoxanthin, to serve as a source of vitamin A [(8)](#reference8). Provitamin A carotenoids are less easily absorbed than preformed vitamin A and must be converted to retinol and other retinoids by the body (Figure 3). The efficiency of conversion of provitamin A carotenoids into retinol is highly variable, depending on factors like food matrix, food preparation, and one's digestive and absorptive capacities [(9)](#reference9). The most recent international standard of measure for vitamin A is retinol activity equivalent (RAE), which represents vitamin A activity as retinol. It has been determined that 2 micrograms (\u00b5g) of -carotene in oil provided as a [supplement](../../glossary#supplement) could be converted by the body to 1 \u00b5g of retinol, giving it an RAE ratio of 2:1. However, 12 \u00b5g of -carotene from food are required to provide the body with 1 \u00b5g of retinol, giving dietary -carotene an RAE ratio of 12:1. Other provitamin A carotenoids in food are less easily absorbed than -carotene, resulting in RAE ratios of 24:1. RAE ratios are shown in Table 1. |Quantity Consumed||Quantity Bioconverted to Retinol||RAE the function of quenching (deactivating) singlet oxygen, an [oxidant](../../glossary#oxidation) formed during photosynthesis [(10)](#reference10). Test tube studies indicated that lycopene is one of the most effective quenchers of singlet oxygen among carotenoids [(11)](#reference11). They also suggested that carotenoids could inhibit the oxidation of fats (i.e., [lipid peroxidation](../../glossary#lipid-peroxidation)) under certain conditions, but their actions in humans appear to be more complex [(12)](#reference12). Although important for plants, the relevance of singlet oxygen quenching to human health is less clear [(1)](#references). Some evidence suggests that carotenoids and/or their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) may upregulate the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) and detoxifying [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the Kelch-like ECH-associated (Keap1) in the stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoter](../../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes and scavengers. Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code for numerous mediators [(14)](#reference14). A recent study showed an increase in the level of the major antioxidant [glutathione](../../glossary#gluatathione) and a protection against TNF-induced oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) following lycopene-mediated Nrf2 activation and GCL induction [(15)](#reference15). shown Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway in various cell types [(16-18)](#reference16). At present, evidence from animal and human studies is very limited [(13)](#reference13). The long system of alternating double and single bonds common to all carotenoids allows them to absorb light in the visible range of the spectrum [(10)](#reference10). This feature has particular relevance to the eye, where lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin (derived from lutein) efficiently absorb blue light. Depending on the carotenoid pigment density at the center of the eye's [retina](../../glossary#retina) ( [macula](../../glossary#macula)), up to 90% of blue light can be absorbed by these pigments. Reducing the amount of short-wavelength light that reaches the critical visual structures of the eye may protect them from light-induced [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) [(19)](#reference19). Because the only source of these plant pigments in the eye is diet, a number of [observational](../../glossary#observational-study) and [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined the potential of dietary and [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) lutein and zeaxanthin to protect against age-related [Age-related macular degeneration](#age-related-macular-degeneration-prevention) and [Cataracts](#cataracts-prevention)). Supplemental lutein, alone or with zeaxanthin, was found to improve contrast sensitivity and protect against visual fatigue in young and/or healthy individuals [(20-23)](#reference20). Lutein has also been suggested to improve visual function through stimulating [neuronal](../../glossary#neuron) signaling efficiency in the eye [(24)](#reference24). Carotenoids can facilitate communication between neighboring cells grown in culture by stimulating the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) of connexin [proteins](../../glossary#protein) [(25)](#reference25). Connexins form pores (gap junctions) in [cell membranes](../../glossary#cell-membrane), allowing cells to communicate through the exchange of small molecules. This type of intercellular communication is important for maintaining cells in a [differentiated](../../glossary#differentiation) state and is often lost in [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells. Carotenoids facilitate intercellular communication by increasing the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of the [gene](../../glossary#gene) encoding a connexin protein, an effect that appears unrelated to the vitamin A or antioxidant activities of various carotenoids [(26)](#reference26) and involving a retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-independent mechanism [(27)](#reference27). Because vitamin A is essential for normal immune system function, it is difficult to determine whether the effects of provitamin A carotenoids are related to their vitamin A activity or other activities of carotenoids. Although some [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have found that -carotene supplementation improves several [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) immune function [(28-30)](#reference28), increasing intakes of lycopene and lutein \u2014 carotenoids without vitamin A activity \u2014 have not resulted in similar improvements in biomarkers of immune function [(31-33)](#reference31). Although consumption of provitamin A carotenoids (-carotene, -carotene, and -cryptoxanthin) can prevent vitamin A deficiency (see the article on [Vitamin A](../../vitamins/vitamin-A#deficiency)), no overt deficiency symptoms have been identified in people consuming low-carotenoid diets if they consume adequate vitamin A [(8)](#reference8). After reviewing the published scientific research in 2000, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine concluded that the existing evidence was insufficient to establish a recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../../glossary#RDA)) or adequate intake ( [AI](../../glossary#AI)) for carotenoids. The Board has set an RDA for vitamin A (see the article on [Vitamin A](../../vitamins/vitamin-A#RDA)). Recommendations by the National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and American Heart Association to consume a variety of [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) daily are aimed, in part, at increasing intakes of carotenoids. Dietary carotenoids: Several large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), have examined potential associations between carotenoid intake and/or blood concentrations and lung [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(36)](#reference36). In a [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight prospective cohort studies, including NHS and HPFS, the highest versus lowest quantile of total carotenoid intake was significantly associated with a 21% reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of lung cancer. For the individual carotenoids, the risk of lung cancer was estimated to be 20% and 14% lower with the highest versus lowest intakes of -cryptoxanthin and lycopene, respectively. In contrast, dietary intakes of -carotene, -carotene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were not found to be significantly linked to a reduced risk of developing lung cancer [(36)](#reference36). In addition, an analysis of the pooled results of 11 [nested case-control](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) and four prospective cohort studies found no association between [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentrations of total carotenoids, -carotene, -lycopene, -cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin and lung cancer. Only high versus low serum lycopene concentrations could be linked to a 29% lower risk of lung cancer [(36)](#reference36). Any protective effect of dietary carotenoids against the development of lung cancer is likely small and not statistically significant [(36)](#reference36). [Supplemental -carotene: The effect of -carotene ] [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) on the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing lung cancer has been examined in three large [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials. In Finland, the -Tocopherol eta-Carotene (ATBC) cancer prevention trial evaluated the effects of 20 mg/day of -carotene and/or 50 mg/day of -tocopherol on more than 29,000 male smokers [(37)](#reference37), and in the United States, the -Carotene And Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) evaluated the effects of a combination of 30 mg/day of -carotene and 25,000 IU/day of retinol (preformed vitamin A) in 18,314 men and women who were smokers, former smokers, or had a history of occupational asbestos exposure [(38)](#reference38). Unexpectedly, the risk of lung cancer in the groups taking -carotene supplements was increased by 16% after six years in the ATBC participants and by 28% after four years in the CARET participants. In contrast, the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) examined the effect of -carotene supplementation (50 mg every other day) on cancer risk in 22,071 male physicians in the United States, of whom only 11% were current smokers [(39)](#reference39). In that lower risk population, -carotene supplementation for more than 12 years was not associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. In addition, in the Linxian General Population trial conducted in about 29,000 Chinese participants, randomization to 15 mg/day of -carotene, 30 mg/day of -tocopherol, and 15 \u00b5g/day of selenium, was not found to be associated with lung cancer mortality 10 years after the intervention ended [(40)](#reference40). Although the reasons for the increase in lung cancer risk are not yet clear and several mechanisms have been proposed [(41)](#reference41). The US Preventive Services Task Force estimated that the risks of high-dose -carotene supplementation outweigh any potential benefits for cancer prevention and recommended against supplementation, especially in smokers or other high-risk populations [(42)](#reference42). [Prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) is the most common cancer affecting US men, more [prevalent](../../glossary#prevalence) than lung and colorectal cancers [(34)](#reference34). Dietary lycopene: Several early [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have suggested that lycopene-rich diets were associated with significant reductions in the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), particularly more aggressive forms [(43)](#reference43). However, pooled data analyses of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) that examined potential links between dietary intakes and/or circulating concentrations of lycopene and risk of prostate cancer have given mixed results. An early [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) that combined the results of 10 case-control and four prospective studies found that men with the highest intakes of raw tomatoes, cooked tomatoes, or dietary lycopene had a 11 to 19% lower risk of prostate cancer [(44)](#reference44). In addition, pooled data from two [case-control](../../glossary#case-control-study) and five [nested case-control studies](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) showed a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer in participants with the highest [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentrations of lycopene [(44)](#reference44). Most recently, a meta-analysis of observational studies found no association of prostate cancer risk with dietary lycopene intakes (10 case-cohort and two prospective cohort studies) but an [inverse association](../../glossary#inverse-association) with blood lycopene concentrations (two case-control, nine nested case-control, and one cohort studies) [(45, 46)](#reference45). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 15 nested case-control studies conducted by the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers, and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group showed an inverse association between circulating lycopene concentrations and risk of advanced stage and/or aggressive prostate cancer, while no association was found with risk of non-aggressive or localized disease [(47)](#reference47). While there is considerable scientific interest in the potential for lycopene to help prevent prostate cancer, it is not yet clear whether the prostate cancer risk reduction observed in some observational studies is related to lycopene itself, other compounds in tomatoes, or other factors associated with lycopene-rich diets [(48)](#reference48). Of note, the 2014 World Cancer Research Fund International report on Diet, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Prostate Cancer suggested the need for better designed studies to establish whether consumption of lycopene-containing foods could be linked to a lower risk of prostate cancer [(49)](#reference49). Supplemental lycopene: To date, a few short-term, dietary [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) using lycopene in patients prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia; HGPIN) or [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) have been completed. Specifically, two small [randomized controlled studies](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have recently examined the effect of lycopene supplementation for up to six months in men with HGPIN [(50, 51)](#reference50). The consumption of 30 to 35 mg/day of supplemental lycopene in the form of tomato extract [(50)](#reference50), or together with selenium (55 mg/day) and green tea catechins (600 mg/day) [(51)](#reference51), showed no benefit on the rate of progression to prostate cancer at six-month [(50, 51)](#reference50) and 37-month follow-ups [(51)](#reference51). Earlier small trials in men with HGPIN led to similar conclusions (reviewed in [52](#reference52)). Additionally, a randomized controlled trial in men with localized prostate cancer found that supplementation with 15, 30, or 45 mg of lycopene (until prostatectomy) did not significantly increase [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) lycopene concentration, modify the ratio of [steroid](../../glossary#steroid) [hormones](../../glossary#hormone) in blood, or reduce the concentration of markers of [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) (i.e., prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and Ki-67) compared to [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(53)](#reference53). In another trial, 54 patients with [metastatic](../../glossary#metastasize) prostate cancer were randomized to orchidectomy alone or orchidectomy plus 4 mg/day of lycopene [(54)](#reference54). The proportion of complete clinical response to treatment \u2014 assessed by serum PSA and/or bone scan returning to normal \u2014 and patient survival rate were found to be significantly higher in patients supplemented with lycopene [(54)](#reference54). Large-scale, controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to further examine the safety and efficacy of long-term use of lycopene supplements for prostate cancer prevention or treatment. In a [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), no association was found between total and individual carotenoid intake and [risk](../../glossary#risk) of breast cancer, except with -carotene for which a 5% reduction in breast cancer risk was estimated for every 5 mg/day increment in consumption [(55)](#reference55). In a pooled analysis of 14 [nested case-control studies](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) and one follow-up study of a [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial), reductions in breast cancer risk were found to be associated with blood concentrations of total carotenoids (-26%), -carotene (-20%), and lutein (-30%) [(55)](#reference55). Another study that recalibrated data for consistency across eight large prospective cohorts before pooled analysis found reduced breast cancer risk to be associated with the highest versus lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of blood concentrations of total carotenoids (-21%), -carotene association](../../glossary#inverse-association) between the blood concentrations of -carotene and -carotene and risk of estrogen receptor-negative (ER-), but not estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), breast tumors [(56)](#reference56). A similar result was recently reported in a case-control study nested within the multicenter, large, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study [(57)](#reference57). Another case-control study nested within the EPIC study found a 31% lower risk of [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) with the highest versus lowest [quartile](../../glossary#quartile) of -carotene intake, while no associations were shown with blood concentrations of other carotenoids or total carotenoids [(58)](#reference58). The nested case-control study was included in a recent meta-analysis of 22 [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) that failed to find associations between carotenoid intakes and colorectal cancer [(59)](#reference59). Pooled data from mostly [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) also suggested that higher intakes of individual carotenoids, especially -cryptoxanthin and lycopene, might be associated with a reduced risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and [larynx](../../glossary#larynx) [(60)](#reference60). However, the results of case-control studies are more likely to be distorted by bias than results of prospective studies. Examining blood concentrations of each carotenoid in relation to cancer subsites may help overcome limitations associated with dietary data and differences in carotenoid absorption. In Western countries, degeneration of the [macula](../../glossary#macula), the center of the eye's [retina](../../glossary#retina), is a leading cause of blindness in older adults. Long-term blue light exposure and [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) in the outer segments of photoreceptors may lead to drusen and/or pigment abnormalities in the macula, increasing the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and central blindness. Dietary lutein and zeaxanthin: The carotenoids found in the [retina](../../glossary#retina) are lutein and zeaxanthin, which are both of dietary origin, and meso-zeaxanthin, which is derived from lutein. These three carotenoids are present in high concentrations in the macula (known as macular pigment), where they are efficient absorbers of blue light. They may prevent a substantial amount of the blue light entering the eye from reaching the underlying structures involved in vision and protect against light-induced [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage), which is thought to play a role in the [pathology](../../glossary#pathology) of age-related macular degeneration (reviewed in [19](#reference19)). It is also possible, though not proven, that lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin, act directly to neutralize [oxidants](../../glossary#oxidation) formed in the retina. Increasing dietary consumption of lutein and zeaxanthin was shown to raise their [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentration and macular pigment density [(61, 62)](#reference61). Some, but not all, [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have provided evidence that higher intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin are associated with lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of age-related degeneration (AMD) [(63)](#reference63). While [cross-sectional](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and retrospective [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) found that higher levels of lutein and zeaxanthin diet [(64-66)](#reference64), blood [(67, 68)](#reference67), and retina [(69, 70)](#reference69) were associated with a lower incidence of AMD, several prospective cohort studies found no relationship between baseline dietary intakes or serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and the risk of developing AMD over time [(71-74)](#reference71). A recent report examined the association between the incidence of AMD and calculated dietary intakes and predicted [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin in older adults (50 years) from two large prospective cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 63,443 women) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; 38,603 men), followed for 26 years and 24 years, respectively [(75)](#reference75). The highest versus lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of predicted plasma lutein and zeaxanthin scores was associated with a 41% lower risk of advanced AMD, yet no association was found with intermediate AMD. The evidence also suggested that the consumption of about 6 mg/day of lutein and zeaxanthin from [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) (compared with less than 2 mg/day) may decrease the risk of advanced AMD [(75)](#reference75). Supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin: The first [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in patients with [atrophic](../../glossary#atrophy) AMD found that supplementation with 10 mg/day of lutein slightly improved visual acuity after one year compared to a placebo [(76)](#reference76). The effects of long-term lutein supplementation on atrophic AMD were further investigated in combination with [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [vitamins](../../glossary#vitamin) and [minerals](../../glossary#mineral) in the Age-Related mg/day), vitamin C (500 mg/day), vitamin E (400 IU/day), zinc (80 mg/day as zinc oxide), and copper (2 mg/day as cupric oxide) for five years was shown to reduce the risk of developing advanced AMD by 25% [(77)](#reference77). In the AREDS2 study conducted in 4,203 participants at risk for developing late AMD, supplemental lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day), in combination with -carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and copper (the 'AREDS' formulation), did not slow the progression to advanced AMD, although subgroup analyses revealed a benefit in those with the lowest dietary intakes of lutein + zeaxanthin [(77)](#reference77). A total of 3,036 subjects were further randomized to various combinations of carotenoids; supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin significantly reduced the risk of progression to late AMD and to neovascular AMD compared to supplementation with -carotene [(78)](#reference78). Several smaller (n=30-433) randomized controlled trials also suggested that supplementation with xanthophyll carotenoids would be beneficial in the management of AMD (reviewed in [79](#reference79)). A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight trials that examined the effect of supplemental lutein (6 to 20 mg/day) or/and zeaxanthin (0 to 10 mg/day) in 1,176 AMD subjects for up to 36 months found improvements in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity with increased levels of xanthophyll carotenoids [(80)](#reference80). Finally, a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial found daily consumption of a buttermilk drink with egg yolks enriched with lutein (1.4 mg), zeaxanthin (0.2 mg), and an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (DHA; 160 mg) for one year improved visual acuity and macular pigment optical density in subjects with drusen and/or retinal pigment abnormalities (about half of them being classified as having early AMD) [(81)](#reference81). Supplemental -carotene: The first [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) designed to examine the effect of a carotenoid [supplement](../../glossary#supplement) on AMD used -carotene in combination with vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc because lutein and zeaxanthin were not commercially available as supplements at the time the trial began [(82)](#reference82). Although the combination of [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant) and zinc lowered the risk of developing advanced macular degeneration in individuals with signs of moderate-to-severe macular degeneration in at least one eye, it is unlikely that the benefit was related to -carotene since it is not present in the [retina](../../glossary#retina). Supplementation of male smokers in Finland with 20 mg/day of -carotene for six years did not decrease the risk of AMD compared to [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(83)](#reference83). A placebo-controlled trial in a cohort of 22,071 healthy US men found that -carotene supplementation (50 mg every other day) had no effect on the incidence of age-related maculopathy \u2014 an early stage of AMD [(84)](#reference84). Recent [systematic reviews](../../glossary#systematic-review) of randomized controlled trials have concluded that there is no evidence that -carotene supplementation prevents or delays the onset of AMD [(85, 86)](#reference85). Retinopathy of prematurity Preterm infants have an immature retinal vascular system that places them at [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Basically, preterm birth halts the normal development of [retinal](../../glossary#retina) vascular system, which results in a retina that is poorly vascularized and highly susceptible to hyperoxia. In order to meet metabolic demand, the hypoxic retina induces the production of proangiogenic factors like VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). These factors stimulate the development of new blood vessels ( [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis)), causing aberrant vessels sprouting from the retina into the vitreous. It is thought that an imbalance between the production of [reactive oxygen species](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) and the reduced levels of [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant) in preterm infants contributes to ROP pathogenesis and causes additional damage to the retina (reviewed in [87](#reference87)). Supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin: A [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 62 preterm infants (32 weeks of [gestational](../../glossary#gestation) age) failed to observe any benefits regarding ROP incidence and severity with lutein (0.5 mg/kg/day) and zeaxanthin (0.02 mg/kg/day) supplemented from the seventh day post birth until about 10 weeks of age [(88)](#reference88). In two other multicenter, [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in a total of 343 preterm infants, a daily oral dose of 0.14 mg of lutein and 0.006 mg of zeaxanthin administered from the first week after birth did not significantly reduce ROP incidence or the rate of progression from early to more advanced stages of ROP occurrence [(89, 90)](#reference89). A fourth multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 203 preterm infants found that administration of a formula containing carotenoids (lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, and -carotene) had no effect on ROP incidence but limited the progression to severe ROP stages in infants with mild ROP compared to a carotenoid-free formula [(91)](#reference91). Compared with the control formula, preterm infants free of ROP fed the carotenoid-containing formula had significantly increased [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) carotenoid concentrations, which were correlated with greater rod photoreceptor sensitivity [(91)](#reference91). More research is needed to examine whether carotenoid supplementation might promote normal photoreceptor development and prevent ROP in preterm infants. Diabetic retinopathy Supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin has been shown to help preserve [retina](../../glossary#retina) integrity in [diabetic](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) rodents by reducing [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) (-carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin) was associated with a reduced risk of diabetic retinopathy in a [cross-sectional analysis](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 111 individuals with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(92)](#reference92). Recent data from 1,430 individuals participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study found no association between lutein intake and diabetic retinopathy after adjustment for [confounding](../../glossary#confounder) variables [(93)](#reference93). To date, the role of carotenoids in the prevention of diabetic retinopathy has not been examined in [clinical studies](../../glossary#clinical-trial). The primary function of the eye's [lens](../../glossary#lens) is to collect and focus light on the [retina](../../glossary#retina). Ultraviolet light and [oxidants](../../glossary#oxidation) can damage [proteins](../../glossary#protein) in the lens, causing structural changes that result in the formation of opacities known as [cataracts](../../glossary#cataract). As people age, cumulative damage to lens proteins often results in cataracts that are large enough to interfere with vision [(10)](#reference10). Risk factors other than aging and sunlight exposure include smoking, [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), higher [body mass index](../../glossary#body-mass-index), and use of [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) replacement therapy. An estimated 50 million US adults are projected to be affected by age-related cataracts by 2050 [(94)](#reference94). Dietary lutein and zeaxanthin: The observation that lutein and zeaxanthin are the only carotenoids in the human [lens](../../glossary#lens) has stimulated interest in the potential for increased intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin to prevent or slow the progression of cataracts (reviewed in [79](#reference79)). Large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have found that men and women with the highest intakes of foods rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, particularly spinach, kale, and broccoli, were 18%-50% less likely to require cataract extraction [(95, 96)](#reference95) or develop cataracts [(97-99)](#reference97). Moreover, [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin have been found to be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) to the progression of nuclear cataract. Additional research is required to determine whether these findings are related specifically to lutein and zeaxanthin intake or to other factors associated with diets high in carotenoid-rich foods [(63)](#reference63). Supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin: The Age-related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) failed to show an effect of supplemental lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day; supplementation for a median of 4.7 years) on the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing [cataract](../../glossary#cataract), on the progression to severe cataract or to cataract surgery, and on visual acuity [(100)](#reference100). However, the results might have been [confounded](../../glossary#confounder) by the fact that most participants were better nourished than the general population and/or used multivitamins that have been found to decrease the risk of developing cataract [(101)](#reference101). Additional limitations to consider in interpreting the results have been reviewed elsewhere [(100)](#reference100). Additional [interventions](../../glossary#intervention-trial) are required to study whether supplemental lutein and zeaxanthin might be helpful in the prevention of cataract. Supplemental -carotene: Evidence from [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) that [cataracts](../../glossary#cataract) were less [prevalent](../../glossary#prevalence) in people with high dietary intakes and blood concentrations of carotenoids led to the inclusion of -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in several large [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant). The results of those trials have been somewhat conflicting. -Carotene supplementation (20 mg/day) for more than six years did not affect the prevalence of cataracts or the frequency of cataract surgery in male smokers living in Finland [(83)](#reference83). In contrast, a 12-year study of male physicians in the US found that -carotene supplementation (50 mg every other day) decreased the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of cataracts in smokers but not in nonsmokers [(102)](#reference102). Note that use of -carotene supplements have been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers (see [Supplemental -carotene in lung cancer](#supplemenal-beta-carotene-lung-cancer)). Three randomized controlled trials examined the effect of an antioxidant combination that included -carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E on the progression of cataracts. Two trials found no benefit after supplementation for five years [(103)](#reference103) or more than six years [(104)](#reference104), but one trial found a small decrease in the progression of cataracts after three years of supplementation [(105)](#reference105). Overall, the results of randomized controlled trials suggest that the benefit of -carotene supplementation in slowing the progression of age-related cataracts does not outweigh the potential risks. Dietary carotenoids: Because carotenoids are very [soluble](../../glossary#soluble) in fat and very insoluble in water, they circulate in [lipoproteins](../../glossary#lipoprotein), along with [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) and other fats. Evidence that low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)) [oxidation](../../glossary#oxidation) plays a role in the development of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) led scientists to investigate the role of [antioxidant ](../../glossary#antioxidant)compounds like carotenoids in the prevention of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(106)](#reference106). The thickness of the inner layers of the [carotid arteries](../../glossary#carotid-arteries) can be measured noninvasively using [ultrasound](../../glossary#ultrasonography) technology. This measurement of carotid intima-media thickness is considered a reliable marker of atherosclerosis [(107)](#reference107). A number of [case-control](../../glossary#case-control-study) and [cross-sectional studies](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have found higher blood concentrations of carotenoids to be associated with significantly lower measures of carotid artery intima-media thickness [(108-113)](#reference108). Additionally, higher [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) carotenoids at baseline have been associated with significant reductions in [risk](../../glossary#risk) of cardiovascular disease in some [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [(114-118)](#reference114) but not in others [(119-122)](#reference119). More recently, an analysis of data from the 2003-2006 US National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in a sample of 2,856 adults found that [serum](../../glossary#serum) total carotenoid concentration was [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) to blood concentrations of two cardiovascular risk factors, [C-reactive protein](../../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) and total [homocysteine](../../glossary#homocysteine) [(123)](#reference123). [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol concentration was to be positively associated with -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations, but only the latter was inversely associated with LDL-cholesterol [(123)](#reference123). Finally, a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) of [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (-12%) and [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) (-18%) in individuals in the highest versus lowest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of blood lutein concentration [(124)](#reference124). While the results of several prospective studies indicate that people with higher intakes of carotenoid-rich [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) are at lower risk of cardiovascular disease [(122](#reference122), [125-127)](#reference125), it is not yet clear whether this effect is a result of carotenoids or other factors associated with diets high in carotenoid-rich fruit and vegetables. Supplemental -carotene: In contrast to the results of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) suggesting that high dietary intakes trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no evidence that -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in doses ranging from 20 to 50 mg/day were effective in preventing cardiovascular disease [(39](#reference39), [128-130)](#reference128). Based on the results of these randomized controlled trials, the US Preventive Health Services Task Force found good evidence to suggest that -carotene supplements provided no benefit in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in healthy adults [(42)](#reference42). Thus, although diets rich in -carotene have generally been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk in observational studies, there is no evidence that -carotene supplementation reduces cardiovascular disease risk [(131)](#reference131). A recent experimental study found that the administration of -cryptoxanthin to ovariectomized mice limited bone [resorption](../../glossary#resorption) by inhibiting [osteoclast](../../glossary#osteoclast) [differentiation](../../glossary#differentiation) but had no effect on [osteoblast](../../glossary#osteoblast)-driven bone formation [(132)](#reference132). Yet, evidence of a protective role of -cryptoxanthin \u2014 and other individual carotenoids \u2014 against bone loss in humans is scarce. In the [prospective](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) Framingham Osteoporosis Study, data analysis of 603 participants found no association between -cryptoxanthin intake and changes in [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) over a four-year period [(133)](#reference133). total and individual carotenoids (-carotene, and lutein/zeaxanthin) were positively associated with proximal BMD in men over a four-year period, while lycopene intake was positively linked to lumbar spine BMD in women [(133)](#reference133). The 17-year follow-up of participants in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study (946 participants) showed those in the highest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of total carotenoid intake (median intake: 23.7 mg/day) had a 51% lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../../glossary#fracture) compared to those in the lowest tertile (median intake: 7.3 mg/day) [(134)](#reference134). In a much larger prospective study \u2014 the Singapore Chinese Health Study \u2014 in 63,257 men and women followed for 10 years, the highest versus lowest [quartile](../../glossary#quartile) of total carotenoid intake was associated with a 37% lower risk of hip fracture in men but not in women [(135)](#reference135). Dietary intakes of - and -carotene \u2014 but not of -cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin \u2014 were [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with hip fracture risk in men [(135)](#reference135). Nevertheless, in a small, four-year, Japanese prospective cohort study in 457 adults, the risk of [osteoporosis](../../glossary#osteoporosis) was 93% lower in postmenopausal women in the highest versus lowest tertile of [serum](../../glossary#serum) -cryptoxanthin concentration [(136)](#reference136). No such association was reported with serum concentrations of other individual carotenoids. Whether carotenoid supplementation may help prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of osteoporosis in older individuals is currently unknown. [Observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have suggested that dietary lutein may be of benefit in maintaining [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) health [(137, 138)](#reference137). As stated above, among the carotenoids, lutein and its [isomer](../../glossary#isomer) zeaxanthin are the only two that cross the blood- [retina](../../glossary#retina) barrier to form macular pigment in the eye. Lutein also preferentially accumulates in the brain [(139, 140)](#reference139). Recent studies suggested that lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations in the [macula](../../glossary#macula) were correlated with brain lutein and zeaxanthin status and might be used as a [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) to assess cognitive health [(140-142)](#reference140). Additionally, in the Georgia Centenarian Study, the analysis of [cross-sectional](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) data from 47 centenarian decedents showed a positive association between post-mortem measures of brain lutein concentrations and pre-mortem measures of cognitive function [(139)](#reference139). Brain lutein concentrations were found to be significantly lower in individuals with mild cognitive impairment compared to those with normal cognitive function [(139)](#reference139). In a small, four-month, [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in older women (ages, 60 to 80 years) without cognitive impairment, supplementation with lutein (12 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (~0.5 mg/day) significantly improved cognitive test performance [(143)](#reference143). Nevertheless, the Age-related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) failed to show an effect of supplemental lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day; supplementation for a median of 4.7 years) on the cognitive test scores of 3,741 participants (mean age, 72.7 years) [(144)](#reference144). The most prevalent carotenoids in the and zeaxanthin the all-trans form (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) and [Figure 2](#figure-2) above), although cooking may result in the formation of other [isomers](../../glossary#isomer). The relatively low [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of carotenoids from most foods compared to [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) is partly due to the fact that they are associated with [proteins](../../glossary#protein) in the plant matrix [(145)](#reference145). Chopping, homogenizing, and cooking disrupt the plant matrix, increasing the bioavailability of carotenoids [(3)](#reference3). For example, the bioavailability of lycopene from tomatoes is substantially improved by heating tomatoes in oil [(146, 147)](#reference146). -Carotene and -carotene are provitamin A carotenoids, meaning they can be converted in the body to vitamin A. The vitamin A activity of -carotene in food is 112 that of retinol (preformed vitamin A). Thus, it would take 12 \u00b5g of -carotene from food to provide the equivalent of 1 \u00b5g (0.001 mg) of retinol. The vitamin A activity of -carotene from foods is 124 that of retinol, so it would take 24 \u00b5g of -carotene from food to provide the equivalent of 1 \u00b5g of retinol. Orange and yellow vegetables like carrots and winter squash are rich sources of - and -carotene. Spinach is also a rich source of -carotene, although the chlorophyll in spinach leaves hides the yellow-orange pigment. Some foods that are good sources of -carotene and -carotene are listed in Table 2 provitamin A carotenoid. The vitamin A activity of -cryptoxanthin from food was estimated to be 124 that of retinol, so it would take 24 \u00b5g of -cryptoxanthin from food to provide the equivalent of 1 \u00b5g of retinol. Orange and red fruit and vegetables like sweet red peppers and oranges are particularly rich sources of -cryptoxanthin. Some foods that are good sources of -cryptoxanthin are listed in raw||1 wedge (116 of a melon that is 15 inches long x 7.5 inches grapefruit, watermelon, and guava their red color. It has been estimated that 80% of the lycopene in the US diet comes from tomatoes and tomato products like tomato sauce, tomato paste, and ketchup (catsup) [(149)](#reference149). Lycopene is not a provitamin A carotenoid because it cannot be converted to retinol. Some foods that are good sources of lycopene are listed in Table raw||1 wedge (116 of a melon that is 15 inches long x 7.5 inches in and zeaxanthin are different compounds, they are both classified as xanthophylls and nonprovitamin A carotenoids (see [Figure 2](#figure-2) above). Some methods used to quantify lutein and zeaxanthin in food do not separate the two compounds, so they are typically reported as lutein and zeaxanthin or lutein + zeaxanthin. Both pigments are present in a variety of [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables). Dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale are particularly rich sources of lutein but poor sources of zeaxanthin [(150)](#reference150). Although relatively low in lutein, egg yolks and avocados are highly [bioavailable](../../glossary#bioavailability) sources of lutein. Good sources of dietary zeaxanthin include yellow corn, orange pepper, orange juice, honeydew (melon), and mango [(150)](#reference150). Some foods containing lutein and zeaxanthin are content of certain foods, search [USDA's FoodData Central database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). Dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) providing purified carotenoids and combinations of carotenoids are commercially available in the US without a prescription. Carotenoids are best absorbed when taken with a meal containing fat. [Supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing a mixture of carotenoids may include -carotene. As a provitamin A carotenoid, supplemental -carotene can contribute to fulfill vitamin A requirements. It is not known whether the relative [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of supplemental -carotene is greater than that of dietary -carotene. [Supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing a mixture of carotenoids may include -cryptoxanthin. As a provitamin A carotenoid, supplemental -cryptoxanthin can contribute to fulfill vitamin A requirements. It is not known whether the relative bioavailability of supplemental -cryptoxanthin is greater than that of dietary -cryptoxanthin. -Carotene is sold as individual [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) and also found in supplements marketed to promote visual health [(151)](#reference151). Commercially available -carotene supplements usually contain between 1.5 mg and 15 mg of either synthetic -carotene or natural -carotene (mainly from the algae Dunaliella salina) per softgel capsule [(150)](#reference150). As a provitamin A carotenoid, -carotene may be used to provide all or part of the vitamin A in [multivitamin supplements](../../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements). The provitamin A activity of -carotene from supplements is much higher than that of -carotene from food: it takes only 2 micrograms [\u00b5g] (0.002 mg) of -carotene from supplements to provide 1 \u00b5g of retinol (preformed vitamin A) compared to 12 \u00b5g of dietary -carotene. Of note, the -carotene content of supplements is often listed in international units (IU) rather than \u00b5g: 3,000 \u00b5g (3 mg) of supplemental -carotene provides 5,000 IU of vitamin A. Lycopene has no provitamin A activity. Synthetic lycopene and lycopene from natural sources, mainly tomatoes, are available as nutritional [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing up to 15 mg of lycopene per softgel capsule [(150)](#reference150). Lutein as [esters](../../glossary#ester) (esterified to [fatty acids](../../glossary#fatty-acid)). Both forms appear to have comparable [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) [(152)](#reference152). Many commercially available lutein and zeaxanthin supplements have much higher amounts of lutein than zeaxanthin [(150)](#reference150). Supplements containing only lutein or zeaxanthin are also available. Although -carotene can be converted to vitamin A, the conversion of -carotene to vitamin A decreases when body stores of vitamin A are high (see [Absorption, Metabolism, and Bioavailability](#absorption-metabolism-bioavailability)). This may explain why high doses of -carotene have never been found to cause vitamin A toxicity. High doses of -carotene (up to 180 mg/day) have been used to treat erythropoietic protoporphyria, a photosensitivity disorder, without toxic side effects [(8)](#reference8). No toxicities have been reported [(153)](#reference153). Increased lung cancer risk: Two [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in smokers and former asbestos workers found that [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) with 20 to 30 mg/day of -carotene for 4 to 6 years was associated with significant 16%-28% increases in the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of lung [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) compared to [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) (see [Supplemental -carotene in lung cancer)](#supplemenal-beta-carotene-lung-cancer). Although the reasons for these findings are not yet clear, the potential risk of lung cancer in smokers and other high-risk groups supplemented with high-dose -carotene outweigh any possible benefits for [chronic disease](../../glossary#chronic-disease) prevention [(42)](#reference42). It should be noted that there is no evidence that -carotene supplementation may harm nonsmokers. Carotenodermia: High doses of -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) (30 mg/day) and the consumption of large amounts of carotene-rich food have resulted in a yellow discoloration of the skin (xanthoderma) known as carotenodermia. Carotenodermia is not associated with any underlying health problems and resolves when supplementation with -carotene is discontinued or dietary carotene intake is reduced. Lycopenodermia: High intakes of lycopene-rich food or [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) may result in a deep orange discoloration of the skin known as lycopenodermia. Because lycopene is more intensely colored than the carotenes, lycopenodermia may occur at lower doses than carotenodermia [(8)](#reference8). Lutein and zeaxanthin Adverse effects of lutein and zeaxanthin have not been reported [(150)](#reference150). Unlike vitamin A, high doses of -carotene taken by pregnant women have not been associated with increased risk of birth defects [(8)](#reference8). However, the safety of high-dose -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in pregnancy and lactation has not been well studied. Although there is no reason to limit dietary -carotene intake, pregnant and breast-feeding women should avoid consuming more than 3 mg/day (1,500 \u00b5g RAE/day; 5,000 IU/day) of -carotene from supplements unless they prescribed under medical supervision. The safety of carotenoid [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) other than -carotene in pregnancy and lactation has not been established, so pregnant and breast-feeding women should obtain carotenoids from food rather than supplements. There is no reason to limit the consumption of carotenoid-rich [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) during fat- and carotenoids, as can mineral oil and Orlistat (Xenical), a drug used to treat obesity [(150)](#reference150). Colchicine, a drug used to treat [gout](../../glossary#gout), can cause intestinal [malabsorption](../../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome). However, long-term use of 1 to 2 mg/day of colchicine did not affect [serum](../../glossary#serum) -carotene concentrations in one study [(154)](#reference154). Increasing gastric [pH](../../glossary#pH) through the use of proton-pump inhibitors (Omeprazole, Lansoprazole) may decrease the absorption of a single dose of a -carotene supplement, but the effect is unlikely to be clinically significant [(155)](#reference155). A three-year [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 patients with documented [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) and low [serum](../../glossary#serum) high density lipoprotein ( [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)) concentrations found that a combination of simvastatin (Zocor) and [niacin](../../vitamins/niacin) increased HDL2 levels, inhibited the progression of [coronary artery](../../glossary#coronary-arteries) [stenosis](../../glossary#stenosis), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) events, [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) and [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) [(156)](#reference156). Surprisingly, when an [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) combination of 1,000 mg of vitamin C, 536 mg of RRR--tocopherol (vitamin E), 100 \u00b5g of selenium, and 25 mg of -carotene daily was taken with the simvastatin-niacin combination, the protective effects were diminished. Since the antioxidants were taken together in this trial, the individual contribution of -carotene cannot be determined. In contrast, a much larger randomized controlled trial of simvastatin and an antioxidant combination of 297 mg of RRR--tocopherol, 250 mg of vitamin C, and 20 mg of -carotene daily in more than 20,000 men and women with CHD or [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found that the antioxidant combination did not diminish the cardioprotective effects of simvastatin therapy over a five-year period [(157)](#reference157). These contradictory findings indicate that further research is needed on potential interactions between antioxidant supplements and cholesterol-lowering agents, such as niacin and statins. In a controlled feeding study, consumption of 18 g/day of the fat substitute Olestra (sucrose polyester; Olean) resulted in a 27% decrease in [serum](../../glossary#serum) carotenoid concentrations after three weeks [(158)](#reference158). Studies in people before and after the introduction of Olestra-containing snacks to the marketplace found that total serum carotenoid concentrations decreased by 15% in those who reported consuming at least 2 g/day of Olestra [(159)](#reference159). One study in adults found that those who consumed more than 4.4 g of Olestra weekly experienced a 9.7% decline in total serum carotenoids compared to those not consuming Olestra [(160)](#reference160). Some studies found that the regular use of plant sterol-containing spreads resulted in modest, 10%-20% decreases in the [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of some carotenoids, particularly -carotene, -carotene, and lycopene (see the article on [Phytosterols](phytosterols)) [(161, 162)](#reference161). However, advising people who use plant sterol- or stanol-containing margarines to consume an extra serving of carotenoid-rich [fruit or vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) daily prevented decreases in plasma carotenoid concentrations [(163, 164)](#reference163). The relationships between alcohol consumption and carotenoid [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) are not well understood. There is some evidence that regular alcohol consumption inhibits the conversion of -carotene to retinol [(165)](#reference165). Increases in lung supplementation in two [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) were enhanced in those with higher alcohol intakes [(38](#reference38), [166)](#reference166). The results of metabolic studies suggested that high doses of -carotene competed with lutein and lycopene for absorption when consumed at the same time [(167-169)](#reference167). However, the consumption of high-dose -carotene [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) did not adversely affect serum carotenoid concentrations in long-term clinical trials [(170-173)](#reference170).

Plants use chlorophyll to trap light needed for photosynthesis [(1)](#references). The basic structure of chlorophyll is a porphyrin ring similar to that of [heme](../../glossary#heme) in [hemoglobin](../../glossary#hemoglobin), although the central atom in chlorophyll is [magnesium](../../minerals/magnesium) instead of [iron](../../minerals/iron). The long hydrocarbon (phytol) tail attached to the porphyrin ring makes chlorophyll fat-soluble and insoluble in water. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b represent about 99% of the chlorophyll species found in edible plants (Figure 1; [2](#reference2)), while some algae and microalgae contain minor quantities chlorophyll c pigments (e.g., Laminaria ochroleuca, Undaria pinnatifida) [(3)](#reference3). Chlorophyll a and b only have a small difference in one of the side chains but an intact phytol tail, while the common characteristic of chlorophyll c isoforms is the absence of a phytol tail. These structural differences cause each type of chlorophyll to absorb light at slightly different wavelengths. Metallo-chlorophyll derivatives, including chlorophyllins, can be chemically synthesized or produced in industrial food processing; these compounds contain [zinc](../../minerals/zinc), iron, or [copper](../../minerals/copper) in place of the central magnesium atom [(2)](#reference2). The most studied chlorophyllin, sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), is a semi-synthetic mixture of sodium copper salts derived from chlorophyll [(4, 5)](#reference4). SCC is often simply called 'chlorophyllin' in the older scientific literature, with newer publications specifying whether iron, zinc, copper, or magnesium chlorophyllin were studied. During its synthesis, the magnesium atom at the center of the ring is replaced with copper (or other metals), and the phytol tail is lost. Unlike natural chlorophyll, chlorophyllins (regardless of the metal used) are water-soluble. Although the content of different SCC mixtures may vary, two compounds commonly found in commercial SCC are trisodium copper chlorin e6 and disodium copper chlorin e4 (Figure 2). Little is known about the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of chlorophyll in humans, although it is known that chlorophyll undergoes extensive metabolism once consumed. Animal model studies show only about 1%-3% of chlorophyll is absorbed, while the rest is [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) in the feces, primarily as pheopytin and pyropheophytin metabolites, indicating that significant transformation and microbial metabolism occur in the gastrointestinal tract (reviewed in [2](#reference2)). A recent study in eight healthy adults found pheophytin and pheophorbide derivatives in the blood of most subjects following consumption of 1.2 kg boiled spinach, a concentrated source of chlorophyll [(6)](#reference6). Sodium copper chlorophyllin was originally thought to be poorly absorbed because of its lack of apparent toxicity. However, a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found that significant amounts of copper chlorin e4 in the [serum](../../glossary#serum) of people taking chlorophyllin tablets (300 mg/day) [(7)](#reference7), indicating that it is indeed absorbed. [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies have found chlorin e4 to have a higher stability than chlorin e6 [(2)](#reference2). More research, however, is needed to understand the bioavailability and metabolism of natural chlorophylls and chlorin compounds in synthetic chlorophyllin. Chlorophyll and sodium copper chlorophyllin are able to form tight molecular complexes with certain chemicals known or suspected to cause [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), including polyaromatic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke [(8)](#reference8), some amines found in cooked meat [(9)](#reference9), and aflatoxin-B1 [(10)](#reference10). The binding of chlorophyll or SCC to these potential [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) may interfere with [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption of potential carcinogens, reducing the amount that reaches susceptible tissues [(11)](#reference11). This has been demonstrated in humans: a [cross-over study](../../glossary#cross-over-trial) in three volunteers that used accelerator mass spectrometry to study the [pharmacokinetics](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) of an ultra-low dose of aflatoxin-B1 found a 150-mg dose of either SCC or chlorophyll could decrease absorption of aflatoxin-B1 [(12)](#reference12). SCC can neutralize several physically relevant [oxidants](../../glossary#oxidant) [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(13-16)](#reference13), and limited data from animal studies suggest that SCC [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) may decrease [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) induced by chemical [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) and radiation [(17, 18)](#reference17). While chlorophyll and its derivatives have demonstrated [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity in in vitro assays [(15](#reference15), [19)](#reference19), the relevance of these findings to humans is not clear. To initiate the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), some chemicals ( [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen)) must first be metabolized to active [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) that are capable of damaging [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) or other critical molecules in susceptible tissues. Since [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) in the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) family are required for the activation of some procarcinogens, inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes may decrease the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of some types of chemically induced cancers. [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies indicate that SCC may decrease the activity cytochrome P450 enzymes [(8](#reference8), [20, 21)](#reference20). Phase II biotransformation enzymes promote the elimination of potentially harmful toxins and carcinogens from the body. Limited data from animal studies indicate that SCC may increase the activity of the phase II enzyme quinone reductase [(22)](#reference22). One [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) study showed that human [colon](../../glossary#colon) cancer cells undergo cell cycle arrest after treatment with SCC [(23)](#reference23). The mechanism involved inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity. Ribonucleotide reductase plays a pivotal role in [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) synthesis and repair and is a target of currently used cancer therapeutic agents, such as hydroxyurea [(23)](#reference23). While this may provide a potential avenue for SCC in the clinical setting, sensitizing cancer cells to DNA damaging agents, [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) studies are needed. The porphyrin structure of chlorophyll is analogous to the [heme](../../glossary#heme) structure found in blood and muscle tissue. Because heme-bound iron has higher [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) than nonheme iron (the most common form of iron in plant-based sources, e.g., [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), spinach), iron uptake from iron chlorophyll is of interest. Toxicity studies in rats suggest iron chlorophyllin is generally safe for mammalian consumption [(24)](#reference24). [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies demonstrate that iron chlorophyllin is as good as heme in delivering iron to intestinal cells, and significantly better than the most common supplemental form of iron (i.e., ferrous sulfate) when incorporated into most food matrices [(25)](#reference25). However, work in this area is nascent and has not yet been validated in humans. It is also not known if metallo-chlorophyll derivatives of copper or zinc increase absorption of these essential divalent metals. Aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1), a liver [carcinogen](../../glossary#carcinogen) produced by certain species of fungus, is found in moldy grains and [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), including corn, peanuts, and soybeans [(4](#reference4), [11)](#reference11). In hot, humid regions of Africa and Asia with improper grain storage facilities, high levels of dietary AFB1 are associated with increased [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [hepatocellular carcinoma](../../glossary#hepatocellular-carcinoma). Moreover, the combination of [hepatitis](../../glossary#hepatitis) B infection and high dietary AFB1 exposure increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma still further. In the liver, AFB1 is metabolized to a carcinogen capable of binding [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) and causing [mutations](../../glossary#mutation). In animal models of AFB1-induced liver [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), administration of SCC at the same time as dietary AFB1 exposure significantly reduces AFB1-induced DNA damage in the livers of rainbow trout and rats [(26-28)](#reference26) and dose-dependently inhibits the development of liver cancer in trout [(29)](#reference29). Likewise, natural chlorophyll has also been found to inhibit AFB1-induced liver cancer in the rat [(28)](#reference28). Collectively, this evidence supports a role for SCC and/or chlorophyll itself in limiting cancer initiation. In contrast, data suggest a limited role for SCC in influencing cancer progression. For example, one rat study found that SCC did not protect against aflatoxin-induced liver damage when given after tumor initiation [(30)](#reference30). Because of the long time period between AFB1 exposure and the development of cancer in humans, an [intervention trial](../../glossary#intervention-trial) might require as long as 20 years to determine whether SCC [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) can reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people exposed to high levels of dietary AFB1. However, a [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) of AFB1-induced DNA damage (AFB1-N7-guanine) can be measured in the urine, and high urinary levels of AFB1-N7-guanine have been associated with significantly increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma [(31)](#reference31). In order to determine whether chlorophyllin could decrease AFB1-induced DNA damage in humans, a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled intervention trial was conducted in 180 adults residing in a region in China where the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is very high due to unavoidable, dietary AFB1 exposure and a high [prevalence](../../glossary#prevalence) of chronic hepatitis B infection [(32)](#reference32). Participants took either 100 mg of SCC or a placebo before meals three times daily. After 16 weeks of treatment, urinary levels of AFB1-N7-guanine were 55% lower in those taking SCC than in those taking the placebo, suggesting that SCC supplementation before meals can substantially decrease AFB1-induced DNA damage. Although a reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma has not yet been demonstrated in humans taking SCC, scientists are hopeful that supplementation will provide some protection to high-risk populations with unavoidable, dietary AFB1 exposure [(11)](#reference11). It is not known whether SCC will be useful in the prevention of cancers in people who are not exposed to significant levels of dietary AFB1, as is the case for most people living in the US. Many questions remain to be answered regarding the exact mechanisms of cancer prevention by SCC, the implications for the prevention of other types of cancer, and the potential for natural chlorophylls in the diet to provide cancer protection. Observations in the 1940s and 1950s that [topical](../../glossary#topical) SCC had deodorizing effects on foul-smelling wounds led clinicians to administer SCC orally to patients with [colostomies](../../glossary#colostomy) and [ileostomies](../../glossary#ileostomy) in order to control fecal odor [(33)](#reference33). While early [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) indicated that SCC doses of 100 to 200 mg/day were effective in reducing fecal odor in ostomy patients [(34, 35)](#reference34), a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial found that 75 mg of oral SCC three times daily was no more effective than placebo in decreasing fecal odor assessed by colostomy patients 36. Several case reports have been published indicating that oral SCC (100-300 mg/day) decreased subjective assessments of urinary and fecal odor in incontinent patients [(33](#reference33), [37)](#reference37). [Trimethylaminuria](../../glossary#trimethylaminuria) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of trimethylamine, a compound with a \"fishy\" or foul odor. One study in a small number of Japanese patients with trimethylaminuria found that oral SCC (60 mg three times daily) for three weeks significantly decreased urinary trimethylamine concentrations [(38)](#reference38). Research in the 1940s indicated that chlorophyllin slowed the growth of certain [anaerobic](../../glossary#anaerobic) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) in the test tube and accelerated the healing of experimental wounds in animals. These findings led to the use of [topical](../../glossary#topical) SCC solutions and ointments in the treatment of persistent open wounds in humans [(39)](#reference39). During the late 1940s and 1950s, a series of largely uncontrolled studies in patients with slow-healing wounds, such as vascular ulcers and pressure (decubitus) ulcers, reported that the application of topical SCC promoted healing more effectively than other commonly used treatments [(40, 41)](#reference40). In the late 1950s, SCC was added to papain and urea-containing ointments used for the chemical debridement of wounds in order to reduce local [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), promote healing, and control odor [(33)](#reference33). SCC-containing papain/urea ointments are still available in the US by prescription [(42)](#reference42). Several studies have reported that such ointments are effective in wound healing [(43)](#reference43). A spray formulation of the papain/urea/SCC therapy is also available [(44)](#reference44). A few small studies have investigated SCC as a topical treatment for various skin conditions. In a [pilot study](../../glossary#pilot-study) of 10 adults (ages 18-30 years) who had mild-to-moderate [acne vulgaris](../../glossary#acne-vulgaris) and enlarged facial pores, twice daily application of a 0.1% liposomal SCC gel for three weeks improved a number of clinical parameters of the Global Acne Assessment Scale (i.e., facial oiliness, facial blotchiness, presence and size of facial pores, and number of acne lesions) compared to baseline [(45)](#reference45). Additionally, a pilot study in 10 women (ages 40 years or older) with noticeable photodamage and solar lentigines found that twice daily topical application of a gel containing 0.66% SCC complex salts for eight weeks improved various clinical measures, including tactile and visual roughness of facial skin, skin radiance, fine lines, pore size, and overall photodamage [(46)](#reference46). A few [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) have also observed some improvement in facial redness and rosacea with application of topical SCC [(47)](#reference47). While the reports from these studies are interesting, [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine whether SCC may have utility in treating various skin conditions. Chlorophylls are the most abundant pigments in plants, with chlorophyll a being two to four times as prevalent as chlorophyll b [(6](#reference6), [48)](#reference48). Dark-green leafy vegetables like spinach are rich sources of natural chlorophylls. The chlorophyll content of selected vegetables are presented in are often marketed as [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) sources of chlorophyll. Because natural chlorophyll is not as stable as SCC and is much more expensive, most over-the-counter chlorophyll supplements actually contain sodium copper chlorophyllin. Oral preparations of sodium copper chlorophyllin (also called chlorophyllin copper complex) are available as a dietary [supplement](../../glossary#supplement) and as an over-the-counter drug (Derifil) used to reduce odor from [colostomies](../../glossary#colostomy) and [ileostomies](../../glossary#ileostomy), or to reduce fecal odor due to incontinence [(50)](#reference50). Oral doses of 100 to 300 mg/day in three divided doses have been used to control fecal and urinary odor (see [Therapeutic Uses of Chlorophyllin](#therapeutic-uses)). In the US, SCC is found in minor quantities in some types of green table olives [(51)](#reference51). It is also used as a green color additive in foods like chewing gum [(52)](#reference52), as well as in drugs and cosmetics [(53)](#reference53). In US supermarkets, canned green beans thermally processed in a zinc chloride solution to produce zinc chlorophyll derivatives within the green beans themselves are sold under the trademarked name \"veri-green\" [(54)](#reference54). Because zinc chlorophyll derivatives are more robust to heat and acid treatment, they better retain a bright green color as compared to native magnesium-bound chlorophyll [(48)](#reference48). Natural chlorophylls are not known to be toxic, and no toxic effects have been attributed to chlorophyllin despite more than 50 years of clinical use in humans [(11](#reference11), [33](#reference33), [39)](#reference39). When taken orally, [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) chlorophyll or sodium copper chlorophyllin may cause green discoloration of urine or feces, or yellow or black discoloration of the tongue [(55)](#reference55). There have also been occasional reports of diarrhea related to oral SCC use. When applied [topically](../../glossary#topical) to wounds, SCC has been reported to cause mild burning or itching in some cases [(56)](#reference56). Oral chlorophyllin may result in false positive results on guaiac card tests for occult blood [(57)](#reference57). Since the safety of chlorophyll or chlorophyllin supplements has not been tested in pregnant or lactating women, they should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation.

Rhizomes are horizontal underground stems that send out shoots, as well as roots. The bright yellow-orange color of turmeric comes mainly from fat-soluble, polyphenolic pigments as curcuminoids. Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid found in turmeric, is generally considered its most active constituent [(1)](#references). Other curcuminoids found in turmeric include demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin (Figure 1). In addition to its use as a spice and pigment, turmeric has been used in India for medicinal purposes for centuries [(2)](#reference2). More recently, evidence that curcumin may have anti- [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) and anticancer activities has renewed scientific interest in its potential to prevent and treat disease. [Clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) in humans indicate that the systemic [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of orally administered curcumin is relatively low [(3-5)](#reference3) and that mostly [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) of curcumin, instead of curcumin itself, are detected in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) or [serum](../../glossary#serum) following oral consumption [(6, 7)](#reference6). In the intestine and liver, curcumin is readily [conjugated](../../glossary#conjugate) to form curcumin glucuronide and curcumin sulfate or, alternately, reduced to tetrahydrocurcumin, hexahydrocurcumin, and octahydrocurcumin (Figure 2) [(4)](#reference4). An early clinical trial conducted in Taiwan indicated that serum curcumin concentrations peaked at 0.41 to 1.75 micromoles/liter (M) one hour after oral doses of 4 to 8 g of curcumin [(8)](#reference8). Another clinical trial conducted in the UK found that plasma concentrations of curcumin, curcumin sulfate, and curcumin glucuronide were in the range of 0.01 M one hour after a 3.6 g oral dose of curcumin [(9)](#reference9). Curcumin and its metabolites could not be detected in plasma at doses lower than 3.6 g/day. There is some evidence that orally administered curcumin accumulates in [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) tissues. For instance, when [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) patients took 3.6 g/day of curcumin orally for seven days prior to surgery, curcumin was detected in both [malignant](../../glossary#malignant) and normal colorectal tissue [(10)](#reference10). In contrast, curcumin was not detected in the liver tissue of patients with liver [metastases](../../glossary#metastasize) of colorectal cancer after the same oral dose of curcumin [(11)](#reference11), suggesting that oral curcumin administration may not effectively deliver curcumin to tissues outside the gastrointestinal tract. The safety and efficacy of several curcumin formulations are currently being explored in (pre)clinical settings with the aim of increasing the absorption, bioavailability, and tissue-targeted delivery of curcumin [(12-16)](#reference12). Examples of approaches include conjugation to [peptide](../../glossary#peptide) carriers to polylactic-co-glycolic acid effective of [reactive oxygen species](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) and [reactive nitrogen species](../../glossary#reactive-nitrogen-species) in the test tube [(18, 19)](#reference18). However, it is not clear whether curcumin acts as a direct [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo). Due to its limited oral [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) in humans (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)), [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) and tissue curcumin concentrations are likely to be much lower than those of other fat-soluble antioxidants like -tocopherol ( [vitamin E](../../vitamins/vitamin-E)). Yet, curcumin taken orally may reach sufficient concentrations in the [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) tract and protect the intestinal mucosa against [oxidative](../../glossary#oxidation) [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage [(11)](#reference11). In addition to a potentially direct antioxidant activity, curcumin can induce the [expression](../../glossary#gene-expression) of important intracellular antioxidant that plays a critical role in cellular adaptation to stress [(20)](#reference20). Curcumin was found to upregulate the expression of GCL through the activation of different [signaling pathways](../../glossary#cell-signaling) [(21)](#reference21). In particular, curcumin increases the expression of GCL and other detoxifying enzymes via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway. Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../../glossary#cytosol). Keap1 responds stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoter](../../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) and [scavengers](../../glossary#scavenge). Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code tubular epithelial cells challenged with high [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) concentrations was shown to prevent phenotype changes resembling fibrosis and known to occur at an early stage of [diabetic](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) renal injury [(23)](#reference23). Curcumin also inhibited the progression of fibrosis in liver and lung in animal models of chronic [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) diseases [(24, 25)](#reference24). Curcumin mitigated the effect of chronic ethanol intake on mouse liver, partly by upregulating Nrf2 target genes by downstream genes for GCL, HO-1, NQO-1, and SOD in the brain of rats [(27)](#reference27). Additional studies have demonstrated the ability of curcumin to reduce oxidative stress in different experimental settings via the induction of Nrf2/ARE pathway (reviewed in [22](#reference22)). Curcumin has been shown to inhibit mediators of the [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) response, including [cytokines](../../glossary#cytokine), chemokines, adhesion factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) induces the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of the COX-2 [gene](../../glossary#gene), other pro-inflammatory genes, and genes involved in cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), adhesion, survival, and [differentiation](../../glossary#differentiation). The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin result from its ability to inhibit the NF-B pathway, as well as other pro-inflammatory pathways like dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis by curcumin in mice has been associated with a downregulation of the expression of p38-MAPK and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- and a reduction of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of [neutrophil](../../glossary#neutrophil) infiltration in intestinal mucosa [(29)](#reference29). Curcumin has also been shown to improve colitis by preventing STAT3 activation and STAT3-dependent induction of cell proliferation in mouse [colon](../../glossary#colon) [(30)](#reference30). Moreover, curcumin was shown to attenuate the immune response triggered by [collagen](../../glossary#collagen) injections in a mouse model of [rheumatoid arthritis](../../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis), partly by blocking the proliferation of T [lymphocytes](../../glossary#lymphocyte) in mouse splenocytes [(31)](#reference31). In addition, curcumin has been found to reduce the secretion of TNF- and IL-1 and the production of COX-2-induced prostaglandin G2. In one study, curcumin inhibited the secretion of matrix metalloproteins (MMPs) \u2014 responsible for the degradation of the synovial joints \u2014 in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes [(31)](#reference31) and in human articular chondrocytes [(32)](#reference32). Curcumin has also been found to alleviate neuro-inflammation in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury, reducing [macrophage](../../glossary#macrophage) and microglial activation and increasing [neuronal ](../../glossary#neuron)survival [(33)](#reference33). Some compounds are not [carcinogenic](../../glossary#carcinogen) until they are [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) in the body by phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), such as [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) of the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family [(34)](#reference34). Primarily based on evidence from rodent studies, it is thought that curcumin may inhibit [procarcinogen](../../glossary#procarcinogen) bioactivation and help prevent [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) by inhibiting the activity of multiple CYP enzymes in humans [(35-37)](#reference35). Curcumin may also increase the activity of phase II detoxification enzymes, such as GSTs and However, it is important to note that the effect of curcumin on biotransformation enzymes may vary depending on the route of administration, the dose, and the animal model. In addition, curcumin intakes ranging from 0.45 to 3.6 g/day for up to four months did not increase [leukocyte](../../glossary#leukocyte) GST activity in humans [(9)](#reference9). Following [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested to allow for DNA repair or for activation of pathways leading to programmed cell death ( [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis)) if the damage is irreparable [(40)](#reference40). Defective cell-cycle regulation may result in the propagation of [mutations](../../glossary#mutation) that contribute to the development of cancer. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells [proliferate](../../glossary#proliferation) rapidly and are unable to respond to cell death signals that initiate apoptosis. Curcumin has been found to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by regulating a variety of [cell-signaling pathways](../../glossary#cell-signaling) [(3](#reference3), [41-45)](#reference41). For example, the inhibition of cell proliferation by curcumin has been associated with the Nrf2-dependent downregulation of DNA repair-specific flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) in breast cancer cells in culture [(46)](#reference46). Curcumin has been shown to induce p53-dependent or -independent apoptosis depending on the cancer cell type [(47)](#reference47). In a panel of cancer cell lines, p53-independent apoptosis induced by curcumin was mediated by the rapid increase of [ROS](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) and the activation of MAPK and c-jun kinase curcumin also suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in cancer cells [(47)](#reference47). [Malignant](../../glossary#malignant) and aggressive forms of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) can invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant tissues once cancer cells have acquired the ability to leave the primary site (reduced cell-to-cell adhesion and loss of polarity), migrate, and disseminate. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process by which epithelial cells acquire the ability to migrate and invade through downregulating [proteins](../../glossary#protein) like E-cadherin and -catenin and expressing mesenchymal markers MMPs, N-cadherin, vimentin. In breast cancer cells, curcumin prevented morphological changes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating vimentin. It was further shown that curcumin inhibited NF-B/Snail signaling involved in LPS-induced EMT [(49)](#reference49). In another study, curcumin increased the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of the non-coding then [cytokines,](../../glossary#cytokine) CXCL1 as well as MMPs, thereby reducing the [metastatic](../../glossary#metastasize) potential of breast cancer cells. Curcumin inhibited IL-6-induced [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), migration, and invasiveness of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells by reducing JAK/STAT3 [phosphorylation](../../glossary#phosphorylation) (i.e., activation) and [(30)](#reference30). Curcumin was found to exert its anticancer activities in many different types of cancer cells by regulating a variety of [signaling pathways](../../glossary#cell-signaling) (reviewed in [2](#reference2), [47](#reference47)). peptide) aggregates into oligomers and fibrils and forms deposits known as [amyloid (or senile) plaques](../../glossary#amyloid-plaque) outside [neurons](../../glossary#neuron) in the hippocampus and [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebrum) cortex of patients. Another feature of AD is the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed by phosphorylated activation, [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress), and [neuronal](../../glossary#neuron) death are also associated with the progression of the disease. Curcumin has been found to inhibit A fibril formation and extension and to destabilize preformed fibrils [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(51-53)](#reference51). Metal [chelation](../../glossary#chelate) metal ion (Cu2+/Zn2+)-induced A aggregation. Curcumin might also affect the trafficking of A peptide [precursor](../../glossary#precursor) (APP) and the generation of A peptides from APP [(54, 55)](#reference54). Abnormally activated microglia and hypertrophic astrocytes around amyloid plaques in AD brains release cytotoxic molecules, such as proinflammatory [cytokines](../../glossary#cytokine) and [ROS](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), which enhance A formation and deposition and further damage neurons. Curcumin was found to reduce the [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) response triggered by A peptide-induced microglial activation and increase neuronal cell survival [(56)](#reference56). When injected into the carotid artery of a transgenic mouse model of AD, curcumin was found to cross the blood-brain barrier, bind to amyloid plaques, and block the formation of A oligomers and fibrils [(53)](#reference53). In other animal models of AD, dietary curcumin decreased [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of inflammation and [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage), increased A peptide clearance by [macrophages](../../glossary#macrophage), dismantled amyloid plaques in the brain, stimulated neuronal cell growth in the hippocampus, and improved A-induced memory deficits (reviewed in [57](#reference57)). Note: It is important to keep in mind that some of the biological activities discussed above were observed in cultured cells and animal models exposed to curcumin at concentrations unlikely to be achieved in cells of humans consuming curcumin orally (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Oral curcumin administration has been found to inhibit the development of chemically-induced cancer in animal models of oral [(58, 59)](#reference58), 61)](#reference60), liver the Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) [gene](../../glossary#gene) similar to that in humans with [familial adenomatous polyposis](../../glossary#familial-adenomatous-polyposis), a genetic condition characterized by the development of numerous [colorectal adenomas](../../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) ( [polyps](../../glossary#polyp)) and a high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer). Oral curcumin administration has been found to inhibit the development of intestinal adenomas in ApcMin/+ mice [(66, 67)](#reference66). Despite promising results in animal studies, there is presently little evidence that high intakes of curcumin or turmeric are associated with decreased cancer risk in humans. A 30-day [phase II clinical trial](../../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) in 40 smokers with at least eight rectal aberrant crypt foci (ACF; precancerous lesions) found that the number of ACF was significantly lower with a daily supplementation with 4 g/day of curcumin compared to 2 g/day [(68)](#reference68). Several controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) in humans designed to evaluate the effect of oral curcumin supplementation on precancerous colorectal lesions, such way [(69)](#reference69). [Oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and related vascular complications. A large body of preclinical evidence suggests that the [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant), anti-inflammatory, and [glucose](../../glossary#glucose)-lowering activities of curcumin and its [analogs](../../glossary#analog) may be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of type 2 diabetes [(70)](#reference70). In a nine-month, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 237 subjects with [impaired glucose tolerance](../../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) (pre-diabetes), no progression to overt diabetes was reported with a daily ingestion of a mixture of curcuminoids (0.5 g), while 16.4% of placebo-treated participants developed diabetes [(71)](#reference71). In addition, curcumin [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) was shown to reduce [insulin resistance ](../../glossary#insulin-resistance)and improve measures of [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) -cell function and glucose tolerance. In an eight-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 67 individuals with type 2 diabetes, oral curcumin (a mixture of all three major curcuminoids; 0.6 g/day) failed to significantly lower the level of [glycated hemoglobin A1c](../../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) (HbA1c; a measure of glycemic [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglycerides) [(72)](#reference72). Yet, supplemental curcumin found to be as effective as [lipid](../../glossary#lipid)-lowering drug atorvastatin (10 mg/day) in reducing circulating markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) and inflammation (endothelin-1, TNF, IL-6) and in improving [endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function. Another [randomized trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) also reported that oral curcumin supplementation (1.5 g/day) for six months improved endothelial function, [insulin sensitivity](../../glossary#insulin-sensitive), and metabolic markers associated with [atherogenesis](../../glossary#atherogenic) (plasma triglycerides, visceral fat, total body fat) in participants with type 2 diabetes [(73)](#reference73). Finally, in a two-month [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 40 individuals with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease), daily curcumin ingestion (66.3 mg) significantly reduced urinary concentrations of [proteins](../../glossary#protein) and inflammation markers (TGF-, IL-8), suggesting that curcumin might be helpful with slowing the progression of kidney damage and preventing kidney failure [(74)](#reference74). Larger trials are needed to assess whether curcumin could be useful in the prevention or management of type 2 diabetes and vascular complications. The ability of curcumin to regulate a variety of [signaling pathways](../../glossary#cell-signaling) involved in cell growth, [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis), invasion, [metastasis](../../glossary#metastasize), and [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis) in preclinical studies elicited scientific interest in its potential as an anticancer agent in tumor therapy [(75)](#reference75). To date, most of the controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) of curcumin [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) in [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) patients have been [phase I trials](../../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial), which are aimed at determining feasibility, tolerability, safety, and providing early evidence of efficacy [(76)](#reference76). A phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) found that doses up to 3.6 g/day for four months were well tolerated, although the systemic [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of oral curcumin was low [(77)](#reference77). When colorectal cancer patients with liver [metastases](../../glossary#metastasize) took 3.6 g/day of curcumin orally for seven days, trace levels of curcumin [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) were measured in liver tissue, but curcumin itself was not detected [(11)](#reference11). In contrast, curcumin was measurable in normal and [malignant](../../glossary#malignant) colorectal tissue after patients with advanced colorectal cancer took 3.6 g/day of curcumin orally for seven days [(10)](#reference10). In a [pilot trial](../../glossary#pilot-trial) in patients awaiting [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) endoscopy or colorectal cancer resection, the administration of a mixture of three major curcuminoids (2.35 g/day for 14 days) resulted in detectable amounts of curcumin in colonic mucosa (mean concentration, 48.4 and bisdemethoxycurcumin (0.7 g/g) [(78)](#reference78). While these findings suggested that oral curcumin may likely be more effective as a therapeutic agent in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract than of other tissues, some phase I/II trials have also examined whether supplemental curcumin may confer additional benefits to conventional drugs against different types of cancer. Combining curcumin with anticancer drugs like gemcitabine in pancreatic and imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia [(82)](#reference82) may be safe and well tolerated. A recent single-arm, [phase II trial](../../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) combining three cycles of docetaxel/prednisone and curcumin (6 g/day) was carried out in 26 patients with castration-resistant [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancer [(83)](#reference83). The level of [prostate-specific antigen](../../glossary#prostate-specific-antigen) (PSA) was decreased in most patients and was normalized in 36% of them, and the co-administration of curcumin with drugs showed no toxicity beyond adverse effects already related to docetaxel [monotherapy](../../glossary#monotherapy). Many registered phase I/II clinical trials designed to investigate the effectiveness of curcumin alone or with first-line treatment in patients with breast, prostate, [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas), lung, or colorectal cancer are under way [(69)](#reference69). Although curcumin has been demonstrated to have anti- [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) and [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activities in cell culture and animal studies, few [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the efficacy of curcumin in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. A [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 40 men who had surgery to repair an inguinal hernia or hydrocele found that oral curcumin supplementation (1.2 g/day) for five days was more effective than placebo in reducing post-surgical [edema](../../glossary#edema), tenderness and pain, and was comparable to phenylbutazone therapy (300 mg/day) [(84)](#reference84). A preliminary [intervention curcumin with anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in 18 patients with [rheumatoid arthritis](../../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis) (RA) found that improvements in morning stiffness, walking time, and joint swelling after two weeks of curcumin supplementation (1.2 g/day) were comparable to those experienced after two weeks of phenylbutazone (NSAID) therapy (300 mg/day) [(85)](#reference85). In a more recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [open-label study](../../glossary#open-label-trial) in 45 RA patients, supplementation with a mixture of all three major curcuminoids (0.5 g/day for eight weeks) was found to be as effective as diclofenac (NSAID; 50 mg/day) in reducing measures of disease activity, tenderness, and swelling joints [(86)](#reference86). Larger [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether oral curcumin supplementation is effective in the treatment of RA. Radiation-induced skin [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) occurs in most patients receiving [radiation therapy](../../glossary#radiation-therapy) for sarcoma, lung, breast, or head and neck cancer. One [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 30 women prescribed radiation therapy for breast carcinoma in situ reported a reduction of radiation-induced [dermatitis](../../glossary#dermatitis) severity and moist desquamation with a [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) curcuminoid mixture (6 g/day for four to seven weeks). Curcumin failed to reduce skin redness and radiation-induced pain at the site of treatment [(87)](#reference87). [Ulcerative colitis](../../glossary#ulcerative-colitis) (UC) is a long-term condition characterized by diffuse and superficial [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) of the [colonic](../../glossary#colon) mucosa. Disease activity may fluctuate between periods of remission and periods of relapse. Preliminary evidence suggests that curcumin might be useful as an add-on therapy to control disease activity. One multicenter, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study has examined the efficacy of curcumin enema (2 g/day) in the prevention of relapse in 82 patients with quiescent UC [(88)](#reference88). Six-month treatment with curcumin significantly reduced measures of disease activity and severity and resulted in a lower relapse rate than with placebo in subjects on standard-of-care medication (sulfasalazine or mesalamine); yet, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who experienced relapse six months after curcumin was discontinued [(88)](#reference88). In another [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in active UC patients treated with mesalamine, the percentage of patients in clinical remission was significantly higher after a one-month treatment with oral curcumin (3 g/day) than with placebo [(89)](#reference89). Larger trials are needed to ensure that curcumin can be safely used with conventional UC treatments and to further support its potential therapeutic benefits for relapsing-remitting UC. Emerging evidence suggests that curcumin has anti-inflammatory and [antimicrobial](../../glossary#antimicrobial) properties that could be beneficial in the treatment of certain diseases of the oral cavity. For example, the [topical](../../glossary#topical) application of a curcumin gel was found to reduce [gingival](../../glossary#gingiva) bleeding and [periodontal](../../glossary#periodontium) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) after conventional periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing) [(90-92)](#reference90). A mouthwash containing curcumin was also found to be as effective as chlorhexidine in reducing [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) in individuals who underwent periodontal therapy for [gingivitis](../../glossary#gingivitis) [(93)](#reference93). Any part of the oral cavity may be affected by oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a currently incurable condition especially prevalent in Southeast Asia and India. OSMF is characterized by the formation of excess fibrous tissue (fibrosis) that leads to stiffness of the mucosa and restricted mouth opening. A few recent [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) showed that curcumin could improve some symptoms, such as burning sensations and reduced mouth opening (reviewed in [94](#reference94)). In an [open-label intervention study](../../glossary#open-label-trial) in 40 OSMF patients [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) to receive either the conventional treatment (weekly intra-lesional injections of [steroids](../../glossary#steroid)) or daily oral administration of a Curcuma longa Linn extract (600 mg/day) for three months, the burning sensation significantly improved in the curcumin-treated group, while tongue protrusion was reduced with conventional therapy. No differences between the two treatment groups were seen with respect to mouth opening [(95)](#reference95). A six-month follow-up of the effect of oral curcumin (2 g/day) in OSMF patients treated for three months found that curcumin outperformed steroid ointment in its ability to increase maximum mouth opening and to reduce self-reported burning sensation [(96)](#reference96). Further studies should assess the appropriate dose of curcumin to achieve the greatest benefits and determine whether curcumin can enhance the effect of standard-of-care treatment in limiting OSMF disease progression. [Alzheimer's disease](../../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) is a form of [dementia](../../glossary#dementia) characterized by deposition of [-amyloid plaques](../../glossary#amyloid-plaque), intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles, [neuronal](../../glossary#neuron) loss, eventually leading to brain [atrophy](../../glossary#atrophy) and [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) impairment in affected individuals [(57)](#reference57). When injected into the [carotid artery](../../glossary#carotid-arteries), curcumin was found to cross the blood-brain barrier in an animal model of AD [(53)](#reference53), though it is not known whether curcumin taken orally can reach the blood-brain barrier at sufficient concentrations and impede cognitive decline in humans. As a result of promising findings in animal models (see [Neuroprotective activity](#neuroprotective-activity)), a few recent [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined the effect of oral curcumin [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) on [cognition](../../glossary#cognition) in healthy older adults and AD patients [(57)](#reference57). A [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 60 healthy older adults (mean age, 68.5 years) investigated whether acute (80 mg) or chronic (80 mg/day for 4 weeks) oral intake of curcumin could improve their ability to cope with the mental stress and change in mood usually associated with undergoing a battery of cognitive tests [(97)](#reference97). A significant reduction in mental fatigue and higher levels of calmness and contentedness following cognitive test sessions were observed in individuals who consumed curcumin (either acutely or chronically) compared to the placebo group. Additionally, the results of cognitive ability tests suggested that curcumin treatment had limited benefits on cognitive function, as shown by better scores in measures of sustained attention and working memory compared to placebo [(97)](#reference97). The results of a six-month trial in 27 patients with AD found that oral supplementation with up to 4 g/day of curcumin \u2014 containing all three major curcuminoids \u2014 was safe [(6)](#reference6). Yet, measures of cognitive performance (using the Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] scoring scale) and levels of F2-isoprostanes ( [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) markers) and [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant) in blood were not found to be significantly different between curcumin- and placebo-treated subjects at the end of the intervention period. In another six-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with mild-to-moderate AD, curcumin failed to improve cognitive test scores and to reduce blood and [cerebrospinal fluid](../../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) (CSF) concentrations of -amyloid peptide, CSF concentrations of total and [phosphorylated](../../glossary#phosphorylation) Tau protein, and CSF concentrations of F2-isoprostanes [(98)](#reference98). Despite the lack of encouraging results from completed trials, several [randomized controlled studies](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are under way to determine whether supplemental curcumin has the ability to reverse or prevent cognitive deficits in both healthy and cognitively impaired individuals [(57)](#reference57). Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with abnormal neurotransmission; it is primarily treated with drugs that improve the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of [neurotransmitters](../../glossary#neurotransmitter) like [serotonin](../../glossary#serotonin), noradrenaline, and dopamine in the brain [(99)](#reference99). Characteristics of MDD also include alterations in the [hypothalamus](../../glossary#hypothalamus)- [pituitary](../../glossary#pituitary-gland)- [adrenal](../../glossary#adrenal-glands) axis, increased neuroinflammation, defective [neurogenesis](../../glossary#neurogenesis), and [neuronal](../../glossary#neuron) death. A few [clinical studies](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined the effect of curcumin alone or with conventional antidepressant drugs in MDD patients. A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of six [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) with curcumin significantly reduced depression symptoms [(100)](#reference100). However, in one of the studies included in this meta-analysis \u2014 a [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), controlled study in 56 adults diagnosed with MDD \u2014 curcumin treatment (~880 mg/day of curcuminoids) for eight weeks was no more effective than [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) in reducing self-reported depression- and anxiety-related symptoms [(101)](#reference101). Significant improvements in the severity and frequency of specific depression-related symptoms only occurred after four weeks of treatment, suggesting that a longer treatment period might be needed to uncover the antidepressant effects of curcumin [(100, 101)](#reference100). In another randomized, placebo-controlled trial, supplemental curcumin (330 mg/day) for five weeks failed to relieve depressive symptoms in patients treated with conventional antidepressants [(102)](#reference102). In contrast, in a six-week, randomized, (~880 mg/day of curcuminoids) alone yielded a similar response to the antidepressant, fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [Prozac]; 20 mg/day) in terms of depressive symptoms; no additional effect was observed when both curcumin and fluoxetine treatments were combined [(103)](#reference103). Moreover, in a randomized controlled study in 100 participants taking escitalopram (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [Lexapro]; 5 to 15 mg/week), supplemental curcumin (1,000 mg/day) for six weeks increased the antidepressant effect of the medication [(104)](#reference104). Curcumin also induced a reduction in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of inflammatory markers and an increase in plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor compared to placebo (antidepressant drug alone) [(104)](#reference104). Larger clinical trials are needed to address the long-term effect of curcumin in subjects with major depression. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a range of emotional (e.g., irritability, anxiety), behavioral (e.g., fatigue, insomnia), and physical symptoms (e.g., breast tenderness, headache) occurring prior to the monthly menstrual period in up to 90% of premenopausal women. In a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 70 women with PMS, the daily supplementation with 0.2 g of curcumin for 10 days during three consecutive menstrual cycles significantly reduced overall PMS severity, as assessed by a composite measure of all emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms [(105)](#reference105). Additional trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin in the management of PMS. Turmeric is the dried ground rhizome of Curcuma longa Linn [(106)](#reference106). It is used as a spice in Indian, Southeast Asian, and Middle Eastern cuisines. Curcuminoids comprise about 2%-9% of turmeric [(107)](#reference107). Curcumin is the most abundant curcuminoid in turmeric, providing about 75% of the total curcuminoids, while demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin generally represent 10%-20% and less than 5% of the total curcuminoids, respectively [(108)](#reference108). Curry powder contains turmeric along with other spices, but the amount of curcumin in curry powders is variable and often relatively low [(109)](#reference109). Curcumin extracts are also used as food-coloring agents [(110)](#reference110). Commercial curcumin is usually a mixture demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above). Curcuminoid extracts are available as dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) without a prescription in the US. The labels of a number of these extracts state that they are standardized to contain 95% curcuminoids, although such claims are not strictly regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some curcumin preparations also contain piperine, which may increase the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of curcumin by inhibiting its [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) [(108)](#reference108). However, piperine may also affect the metabolism of drugs (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Optimal doses of curcumin for [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) chemoprevention or therapeutic uses have not been established. It is unclear whether doses less than 3.6 g/day are biologically active in humans (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Curcuminoid-containing supplements taken on an empty stomach may cause [gastritis](../../glossary#gastritis) and [peptic ulcer disease](../../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease) [(108)](#reference108). In the United States, turmeric is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA as a food additive [(110)](#reference110). An increase in [gallbladder](../../glossary#gallbladder) contractions was observed in 12 healthy people [supplemented](../../glossary#supplement) with single doses of 20 to 40 mg of curcumin [(111, 112)](#reference111). Yet, serious adverse effects have not been reported in humans taking high doses of curcumin. A dose escalation trial in 24 adults found that single oral dosages up to 12 g were safe, and adverse effects, including diarrhea, headache, rash, yellow stool, were not related to dose [(7)](#reference7). In a [phase I trial](../../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial) in Taiwan, curcumin supplementation up to 8 g/day for three months was reported to be well tolerated in patients with precancerous conditions or noninvasive [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(8)](#reference8). Another [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) in the UK found that curcumin supplementation ranging from 0.45 to 3.6 g/day for four months was generally well tolerated by people with advanced [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer), although two participants experienced diarrhea and another reported nausea [(9)](#reference9). Increases in [serum](../../glossary#serum) alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase were also observed in several participants, but it was not clear whether these increases were related to curcumin supplementation or cancer progression [(3)](#reference3). In an [open-label](../../glossary#open-label-trial) [phase II trial](../../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial), curcumin treatment (8 g/day) in combination with the anticancer drug gemcitabine was associated with severe abdominal pain in 7 out of 17 patients with advanced [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) cancer, leading to the treatment being discontinued in five patients while curcumin dosage was reduced to 4 g/day in two patients [(79)](#reference79). Although there is no evidence that dietary consumption of turmeric as a spice adversely affects pregnancy or lactation, the safety of curcumin [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in pregnancy and lactation has not been established. Curcumin has been found to inhibit [platelet](../../glossary#platelet) aggregation 114)](#reference113), [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) to increase the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of bleeding in people taking [anticoagulant](../../glossary#anticoagulant) or antiplatelet by the chemotherapeutic agents, camptothecin, mechlorethamine, and doxorubicin at concentrations of 1 to 10 M [(115)](#reference115). In an animal model of breast cancer, dietary curcumin inhibited cyclophosphamide-induced tumor regression. Yet, it is not known whether oral curcumin administration will result in breast tissue concentrations that are high enough to inhibit cancer chemotherapeutic agents in humans [(11)](#reference11). Curcuminoids may interfere with the activity of efflux drug transporters of the [ATP](../../glossary#ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) family, including P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein (MRP), and breast cancer-resistant protein (BCRP), which function as ATP-dependent efflux pumps that actively regulate the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of a number of drugs limiting their systemic [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) [(116, 117)](#reference116). Curcumin was also found to affect [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of about one-half of all marketed drugs in the US [(119)](#reference119). In healthy Japanese volunteers, curcumin (2 g) was found to increase plasma sulfasalazine concentration following the administration of a therapeutic dose (2 g) of the anti-rheumatic drug sulfasalazine (Salazopyrin, Azulfidine) [(120)](#reference120). bioavailability of curcumin. Piperine may also interfere with efflux drug transporters and phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes and increase the bioavailability and slow the elimination of a number of Jane Higdon, Ph.D. Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State University Updated in January 2009 by: Victoria J.

Their [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and biological activities in humans appear to be strongly influenced by their chemical nature. Since the 1990s, there has been a growing interest in dietary flavonoids due to their likely contribution to the health benefits of fruit- and vegetable-rich diets. This article reviews some of the scientific evidence regarding the role of dietary flavonoids in health promotion and disease prevention in humans; it is not meant to be a comprehensive review on every health topic studied. Flavonoids are classified into 12 major subclasses based on chemical structures, six of which, namely anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, and isoflavones (Table 1-9) are of dietary significance. Glycosylated flavonols (bound to at least one sugar molecule) are the most widely distributed flavonoids in the diet [(2, 3)](#reference2). |Flavonoid Subclass||Dietary Flavonoids (aglycones)|| Some Common Food Sources (see also | Teas (particularly white, green, and oolong), cocoa-based products, grapes, berries, apples Apples, berries, cocoa-based products, red grapes, red wine Black tea Onions, scallions, kale, broccoli, apples, berries, teas Parsley, thyme, celery, hot peppers Citrus fruit and juices, grapefruits, lemons Daidzein, Genistein, Glycitein, Biochanin A, Formononetin Soybeans, soy foods, legumes For more detailed information on the health effects of isoflavones, a subclass of flavonoids with [estrogenic](../../glossary#estrogen) activity, see the article on [Soy Isoflavones](soy-isoflavones). For more information on the health benefits of foods that are rich in flavonoids, see the articles on [Fruit and Vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), [Legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), and [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea). The amount of flavonoids present in ingested food has little importance unless dietary flavonoids are absorbed and become available to target tissues within the body. During and after intestinal absorption, flavonoids are rapidly and extensively [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) in intestinal and liver cells such that they are likely to appear as [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (e.g., phase II metabolites) in the bloodstream and urine [(4)](#reference4). Additionally, the biological activities of flavonoid metabolites are likely to be different from those of their parent compounds [(5)](#reference5). Some of the factors influencing the metabolic fate and [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of dietary flavonoids are mentioned below. Most flavonoids occur in edible plants and foods as -glycosides, i.e., bound to one or more sugar molecules [(6)](#reference6). Exceptions include flavan-3-ols (catechins and proanthocyanidins) and fermented that are exposed to microbial -glucosidases, which [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) the release of sugar molecules from glycosylated isoflavones [(7)](#reference7). Even after food processing and cooking, most glycosides reach the [small intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine) intact. Only flavonoid aglycones (not bound to a sugar molecule) and a few flavonoid glucosides (bound to glucose) are easily absorbed in the small intestine [(8)](#reference8). Glycosylated flavonoids might be able to penetrate the mucus layer of the intestine and be deglycosylated on the cell surface before absorption. Those that cannot be deglycosylated in the small intestine may be [hydrolyzed](../../glossary#hydrolysis) by [bacterial](../../glossary#bacteria) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) in the [colon](../../glossary#colon) [(7)](#reference7). Nevertheless, colonic might remove sugar moieties and rapidly degrade aglycone flavonoids, thus limiting their absorption in the colon [(9)](#reference9). In contrast to [monomeric](../../glossary#monomer) flavan-3-ols (catechins), the [polymeric](../../glossary#polymer) nature of proanthocyanidins likely prevents their intestinal absorption. Flavan-3-ol monomers and procyanidins are transformed by the [intestinal microbiota](../../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) to 5-(hydroxyphenyl)--valerolactones which appear in the circulatory system and are [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) in urine as sulfate and glucuronide [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (Figure 10). Valerolactones may be further degraded by the colonic microbiota to smaller phenolic acids and aromatic compounds. also metabolize the gallate [esters](../../glossary#ester) pyrogallol. Microbe-derived flavonoid metabolites are readily absorbed into the circulatory system and excreted in both free forms and as phase II metabolites in urine [(9)](#reference9). The presence of [macronutrients](../../glossary#macronutrient) in food influences the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of co-ingested flavonoids (reviewed in [8](#reference8), [10, 11](#reference10)). affinity (non-) covalent interactions of flavonoids with food [proteins](../../glossary#protein), [carbohydrates](../../glossary#carbohydrate), and fats are directly associated with the physicochemical properties of flavonoids (reviewed in [8](#reference8)). Proteins in milk might reduce the absorption of polyphenols from cocoa or black tea. The presence of milk proteins bound to flavonoids was shown to weaken the flavonoid [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) capacity [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(12)](#reference12), and milk consumption has been shown to blunt the vascular benefits of tea flavonoids in healthy volunteers [(13)](#reference13). Some carbohydrate-rich foods may increase the deglycosylation and absorption of flavonoids by stimulating [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) motility, mucosal blood flow, and colonic [fermentation](../../glossary#fermentation). Conversely, dietary flavonoids have been shown to interfere with carbohydrate digestion and absorption (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). In the large intestine, gut deglycosylation, ring fission, dehydroxylation, demethylation, can then be absorbed or [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) [(9](#reference9), [14)](#reference14). The diversity and activity of [colonic](../../glossary#colon) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria), which are partly dependent on a person's dietary habits, will determine which metabolites can be produced from ingested flavonoids [(15, 16)](#reference15). The composition of the colonic [microbiota](../../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) can therefore affect the metabolic fate and [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of dietary flavonoids [(17)](#reference17). Flavonoids are recognized as [xenobiotics](../../glossary#xenobiotic) by the body such that they undergo extensive modifications first in the intestinal mucosa and then in the liver. Depending on their structural characteristics, flavonoids can be rapidly transformed by phase II detoxification enzymes to form methylated, glucuronidated, and/or sulfated [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) aglycones and facilitates their [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) in the [bile](../../glossary#bile) and urine [(11)](#reference11). Free (unconjugated) aglycones are generally absent from the bloodstream, with the possible exception of trace levels of catechins [(17)](#reference17). Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is the detoxifying [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) the hydroxyl producing rs4680 G>A \u2014 causes a valine-to- [methionine](../../glossary#methionine) substitution in the sequence of the enzyme. Individuals with the A/A [genotype](../../glossary#genotype) have a form of the enzyme that is three- to four-fold less active than the wild-type variant in G/G genotype carriers [(18)](#reference18). It has been suggested that subjects who are less efficient at eliminating green tea flavonoids may be more likely to benefit from their consumption [(19)](#reference19). Flavonoid [conjugates](../../glossary#conjugate) are [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) via the action of efflux transporters from the [ATP](../../glossary#ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) family, including P-glycoprotein, MRPs (multidrug resistance proteins), or BCRPs (breast cancer-resistant proteins). Depending on their physicochemical properties, some flavonoids may interfere with the activity of ABC transporters [(20)](#reference20). This implies that flavonoids can affect their own [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability), as well as that of other [substrates](../../glossary#substrate) of these transporters (e.g., pharmacological drugs) (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Flavonoid [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) may be to their binding affinity to [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) [proteins](../../glossary#protein) [(21)](#reference21). Greater binding affinity to plasma proteins (and thus, possibly, lower flavonoid bioavailability) has been linked to structural characteristics, such as [methylation](../../glossary#methylation) and galloylation. On the contrary, glycosylation reduced binding affinity to plasma proteins, suggesting that aglycones might have a limited bioavailability compared to glycosylated flavonoids. While glucuronidation is thought to facilitate the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of flavonoids from the body, glucuronides show little affinity to plasma proteins and might thus be able to diffuse to target tissues where deglucuronidation can take place [(8)](#reference8). In general, the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of flavonoids is low due to limited absorption, extensive [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism), and rapid [excretion](../../glossary#excretion). Isoflavones are thought to be the most bioavailable of all flavonoid subclasses, while anthocyanins and galloylated catechins are very poorly absorbed [(8](#reference8), [22)](#reference22). Yet, given the wide variability in structures within subclasses, it is difficult to generalize the absorbability and bioavailability of flavonoids based only on their structural classification. In addition, when evaluating the data from flavonoid research in cultured cells, it is important to consider whether the flavonoid concentrations and [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) used are physiologically relevant [(23)](#reference23). In humans, peak [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of soy isoflavones and citrus flavanones have not been found to exceed 10 micromoles/liter (M) after oral consumption. Peak plasma concentrations measured after the consumption of anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols (including those from tea) are generally lower than 1 M [(2)](#reference2). A recent quantitative analysis of 88 polyphenolic metabolites (not limited to flavonoids) identified in human blood and urine found median peak concentrations of 0.9 M and 3.2 M after food intake and oral [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement), respectively [(4)](#reference4). Flavonoids are effective [scavengers](../../glossary#scavenge) ( [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) and intracellular flavonoid concentrations in humans are likely to be 100 to 1,000 times lower than concentrations of other [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant), such as ascorbate ( [vitamin C](../../vitamins/vitamin-C)), uric flavonoids are actually flavonoid [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite), some of which have lower antioxidant activity than the parent flavonoid [(5)](#reference5). For these reasons, the relative contribution of dietary flavonoids to plasma and tissue antioxidant function [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) is likely to be very small or negligible [(26-28)](#reference26). Metal ions, such as [iron](../../minerals/iron) and [copper](../../minerals/copper), can [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) the production of [free radicals](../../glossary#free-radical). The ability of flavonoids to [chelate](../../glossary#chelate) (bind) metal ions appears to contribute to their [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(29, 30)](#reference29). In living organisms, most iron and copper are bound to [proteins](../../glossary#protein), limiting their participation in reactions that produce free radicals. Although the metal-chelating activities of flavonoids may be beneficial in [pathological](../../glossary#pathology) conditions of iron or copper excess, it is not known whether flavonoids or their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) function as effective metal chelators [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) [(26)](#reference26). Cells are capable of responding to a variety of different stresses or signals by increasing or decreasing the availability of specific [proteins](../../glossary#protein). The complex cascades of events that lead to changes in the [expression](../../glossary#gene-expression) of specific [genes](../../glossary#gene) are known as [cell-signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways or signal transduction pathways. These pathways regulate processes, such as [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), [differentiation](../../glossary#differentiation), [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) responses, [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) (programmed cell death), and survival. Although it was initially [hypothesized](../../glossary#hypothesis) that the biological effects of flavonoids would be related to their [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity, available evidence from cell culture experiments suggests that many of the effects of flavonoids, including antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, anticancer, and neuroprotective activities, are their to modulate cell-signaling pathways [(27)](#reference27). Intracellular concentrations of flavonoids required to affect cellular signaling are considerably lower than those required to affect cellular antioxidant capacity. Flavonoid [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) may retain their ability to interact with cell-signaling proteins even if their antioxidant activity is diminished [(31, 32)](#reference31). Effective signal transduction requires proteins known as kinases that [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) the [phosphorylation](../../glossary#phosphorylation) of target proteins, which become either activated or inhibited. Cascades involving specific phosphorylations or dephosphorylations of signal transduction proteins ultimately affect the activity of [transcription factors](../../glossary#transcription-factor) \u2014 proteins that bind to specific response elements on [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) and promote or prevent the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of target [genes](../../glossary#gene). Results of numerous studies in cell culture suggest that flavonoids may affect chronic disease by selectively inhibiting kinases [(27](#reference27), [33)](#reference33). Cell growth and proliferation are also regulated by growth factors that initiate cell-signaling cascades by binding to specific [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) in cell membranes. Flavonoids may alter growth factor signaling by inhibiting receptor phosphorylation or blocking receptor binding by growth factors [(34)](#reference34). Each flavonoid subclass contains many types of chemicals with varying biological activities (and potential health benefits) such that the activity of a specific flavonoid cannot easily be generalized. Some examples of major biological activities of flavonoids are highlighted below. Flavonoids have been shown to (1) reduce [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) by suppressing the [expression](../../glossary#gene-expression) of pro-inflammatory mediators [(35-37)](#reference35); (2) down-regulate the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules, which contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory white blood cells from the blood to the arterial wall [(38, 39)](#reference38); (3) increase the production of [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibit [(41)](#reference41); (5) inhibit [platelet](../../glossary#platelet) aggregation [(42)](#reference42); and (6) oppose smooth muscle cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and migration occurring during atherogenesis [(43)](#reference43). Flavonoids have been found to interfere with the digestion, absorption, and [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../../glossary#carbohydrate) (reviewed in [44](#reference44)). Each subclass of flavonoids has also demonstrated anti- [diabetic](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) properties, including (1) improving [insulin](../../glossary#insulin) secretion and viability of pancreatic -cells under glucotoxic or pro- [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) conditions, (2) increasing insulin-stimulated [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) uptake by target cells, (3) protecting muscle cells against [fatty acid](../../glossary#fatty-acid)-induced [insulin resistance](../../glossary#insulin-resistance), and (4) reducing [hyperglycemia](../../glossary#hyperglycemia) and improving glucose tolerance in animal models of [obesity](../../glossary#obesity) and/or type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(45)](#reference45). Flavonoids have been to can damage interfere with [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) and efflux transporters, possibly preventing the activation of [procarcinogenic](../../glossary#procarcinogen) chemicals and promoting their [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) from the body [(48, 49)](#reference48); (3) regulate [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), DNA repair, or activation of pathways leading to [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) (programmed cell death) in case of irreversible DNA damage [(50)](#reference50); and (4) inhibit tumor invasion and [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis) [(51, 52)](#reference51). Flavonoids are thought to (1) promote neurogenesis, [synaptic](../../glossary#synapse) growth, and [neuron](../../glossary#neuron) survival in the learning and memory-related brain regions (e.g., hippocampus) by stimulating the production of neurotrophins like BDNF; (2) protect hippocampal cells and in [neurodegenerative disorders](../../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease); (4) stimulate the production of [nitric oxide ](../../glossary#nitric-oxide)(NO), which improves endothelial function, increases [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebrum) blood flow, and protects artery walls against the buildup of [atherosclerotic](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) plaques (reviewed in [53, 54](#reference53)). Several [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted in the US and Europe have examined the relationship between some measure of dietary flavonoid intake and [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) or mortality. A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 prospective studies published between 1996 and 2012 reported that higher intakes in each flavonoid subclass were significantly associated with a reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(55)](#reference55). Top versus bottom quantiles of intake for each of the flavonoid subclasses were associated with an approximate 10% reduction in the risk of CVD. Another meta-analysis of eight prospective studies found a 14% reduced risk of [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) with the highest versus lowest quintile of flavonol intakes [(56)](#reference56). However, several serious limitations highlighted in a recent publication by Jacques et al. suggested caution when interpreting these results [(57)](#reference57). In particular, most of the prospective studies in these meta-analyses did not include all flavonoid subclasses nor calculate intakes using the latest and more complete versions of the USDA databases for the flavonoid content of foods [(58-60)](#reference58). Another major concern is the lack of adjustment regarding the overall quality of the diet. Consumers with higher flavonoid intakes are likely to have a greater consumption of fruit and vegetables and overall healthier diets than those with poor flavonoid intakes. Additionally, none of the studies excluded potential [bias](../../glossary#bias) due to constituents of flavonoid-rich foods that are known to either lower (e.g., other [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytochemical), [vitamins](../../glossary#vitamin), [dietary fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber)) or increase (e.g., [sodium](../../minerals/sodium), [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid)) the risk of cardiovascular events (discussed in [57](#reference57)). In the Framingham Offspring Cohort study that followed 2,880 adults for a mean of 14.9 years, consumption of all flavonoid subclasses except flavones and flavanones Yet, adjusting for [confounding factors](../../glossary#confounder), including fruit and vegetable intake and overall diet quality, attenuated these relationships such that they were no longer statistically significant. An analysis of a larger prospective study of the EPIC-Norfolk cohort (24,885 participants) that considered confounding by many dietary ( [vitamin C](../../vitamins/vitamin-C), [dietary fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber), fat, saturated fat, [potassium](../../minerals/potassium), sodium, and [alcohol](../../food-beverages/alcoholic-beverages)) found no significant association between flavan-3-ol intake and CVD-related or all-cause mortality [(61)](#reference61). A number of large prospective studies and small-scale, [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have investigated the effects of flavonoids on established [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of CVD, including those involved in [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress), [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), abnormal blood [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) profile, [endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction, and [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension); some of these studies are highlighted below. In a [cross-sectional analysis](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of the Framingham Offspring Cohort study, the highest versus lowest intake of anthocyanins (3.5 mg/day versus 23.5 mg/day) was associated adjustment for [confounding](../../glossary#confounder) variables [(62)](#reference62). Interestingly, a food-based analysis revealed that intakes of foods rich in anthocyanins, e.g., apples, red wine, and strawberries, were also [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with an overall [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) score based on 12 different [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker). Higher intakes of polymeric flavan-3-ols (i.e., theaflavins, thearubigins, of pro-inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Intake levels of total flavonoids and flavan-3-ol [monomers](../../glossary#monomer) (i.e., catechins) were inversely associated with concentrations of the biomarkers of oxidative stress. Although tea is a major source of flavan-3-ols, tea consumption was not correlated with the composite inflammation score or any components of this score in this study [(62)](#reference62). Cocoa is another source of flavan-3-ols, in particular (-)-epicatechin and procyanidins, that may provide [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits [(63)](#reference63). Indeed, a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 100 healthy adults (ages, 35-60 years) suggested that short-term benefits of cocoa flavan-3-ol consumption on cardiovascular health, including improvements in [lipoprotein](../../glossary#lipoprotein) profile (i.e., higher [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) and lower total and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol) and blood pressure, could be extrapolated to predict a 20%-30% reduced 10-year risk of [CVD](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and CVD-related mortality [(64)](#reference64). An increasing number of trials in which participants were fed with berries [(65-67)](#reference65) or juices [(68)](#reference68) rich in anthocyanins or with purified anthocyanins [(69)](#reference69) also reported reduced levels of inflammatory markers and/or improved [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) status, decreased LDL-cholesterol, improved [insulin sensitivity](../../glossary#insulin-sensitive), and lowered blood pressure (reviewed in [70](#reference70)). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 150 individuals with hypercholesterolemia, supplementation with a purified anthocyanin mixture (320 mg/day) for 24 weeks reduced circulating markers of inflammation, including dyslipidemic patients for 12 or 24 weeks with a mixture of 17 anthocyanins improved cholesterol clearance via the HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport from extra-hepatic tissues back to the liver and lowered LDL-cholesterol compared to a placebo in two randomized controlled trials [(72, 73)](#reference72). However, a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 52 healthy postmenopausal women found that daily consumption of 500 mg of elderberry anthocyanins (as cyanidin-3-glucoside) had no effect on inflammation markers, markers of vascular health, lipid profile, and glycemia; all of these measures were in normal range of concentrations at baseline [(74)](#reference74). Whether exposure to high-dose anthocyanins could lower the risk of CVD in subjects with established CVD risk factors and/or help maintain cardiovascular health in apparently healthy individuals remains to be confirmed. The [vascular endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells that line the inner surface of all blood vessels [synthesize](../../glossary#synthesis) an [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), whose function is essential to normal vascular physiology. Specifically, eNOS produces [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO), a compound that regulates vascular tone and blood flow by promoting the relaxation ( [vasodilation](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#vasodilation)) of all types of blood vessels, including arteries [(75)](#reference75). NO also regulates vascular [homeostasis](../../glossary#homeostasis) and protects the integrity cells [(76)](#reference76). In presence of [cardiovascular ](../../glossary#cardiovascular)risk factors (e.g., [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension), hypercholesterolemia, [hyperglycemia](../../glossary#hyperglycemia)), early alterations in the structure and function of the vascular endothelium are associated with the loss of normal NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Endothelial dysfunction results in widespread [vasoconstriction](../../glossary#vasoconstriction) and [coagulation](../../glossary#coagulation) abnormalities and is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis). Measures of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a surrogate marker of endothelial function, have been found to be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with risk of future cardiovascular events [(77)](#reference77). Preclinical studies have demonstrated the benefits of berry fruits, extracts, or purified anthocyanins on vascular function. Anthocyanin [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) to diabetic mice was found to improve [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus)-induced vascular dysfunction by promoting for weeks) also increased [serum](../../glossary#serum) adiponectin concentrations and improved FMD in 58 individuals with type 2 diabetes [(78)](#reference78). In a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) trial of 150 participants with hypercholesterolemia, supplemental anthocyanins increased FMD values by 28.4% compared [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) group [(79)](#reference79). Several small-scale, [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have also examined the effect of flavan-3-ol-rich food and beverages, including tea, red wine, purple grape juice, cocoa, and chocolate, on endothelium-dependent vasodilation. A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine intervention studies in a total of 213 participants estimated that the acute ingestion of 2 to 3 cups of tea (500 mL) \u2014 containing about 248 mg of flavonoids in green tea and 415 mg in black tea \u2014 significantly increased brachial FMD (see also the article on [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea#endothelial-dysfunction-prevention)) [(80)](#reference80). Another meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled studies found that acute (2 h post-ingestion) and chronic (18 months) consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa beverages and chocolate bars significantly increased FMD in participants [(81)](#reference81). A small 15-day, [cross-over intervention study](../../glossary#cross-over-trial) in [hypertensive](../../glossary#hypertension) individuals with endothelial dysfunction found that 100 g/day of flavan-3-ol-rich dark chocolate, but not 90 g/day of flavan-3-ol-free white chocolate, could restore FMD values almost to normal levels [(82)](#reference82). Also, using a similar protocol, the authors showed that dark chocolate intake blunted acute endothelial dysfunction-induced by a [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) load challenge in 12 healthy volunteers [(83)](#reference83). Other benefits of dark chocolate consumption included reductions in arterial stiffness (measured through pulse wave analysis) and serum concentrations of markers of [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) and vasoconstriction (8-isoprostaglandin F2 and endothelin-1). A randomized controlled trial in overweight and [obese](../../glossary#obesity) participants also reported that the daily consumption of a high-flavan-3-ol cocoa drink (902 mg/day of flavan-3-ols), but not that of a cocoa drink low in flavan-3-ols (38 mg/day), resulted in a sustained increase in FMD during the 12-week study [(84)](#reference84). A more recent four-week, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, controlled study in healthy overweight or obese adults found that the consumption of 22 g/day of natural cocoa (in the form of dark chocolate bar and cocoa drink; 814 mg/day of flavan-3-ols) increased arterial diameter and blood flow and lowered peripheral arterial stiffness, but there was no change in FMD [(85)](#reference85). Another recent [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to acute consumption of one bar (40 g) of dark chocolate (containing 10.8 mg of (+)-catechins and 36 mg of (-)-epicatechins) and daily consumption of two bars (80 g) for up to four weeks in 20 individuals with chronic heart failure [(86)](#reference86). Oral administration of pure flavan-3-ol (-)-epicatechin to healthy volunteers showed [NO](../../glossary#nitric-oxide)-dependent vasodilatory effects similar to those observed following flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa ingestion [(87)](#reference87). Administration of (-)-epicatechin also improved acetylcholine-induced vasodilation [(88)](#reference88). Endothelial nitric oxide production also inhibits the adhesion and aggregation of platelets, one of the first steps in atherosclerosis and blood clot formation [(76)](#reference76). A number of clinical trials that examined the potential for high flavonoid intakes to decrease various measures of platelet function outside of the body (ex vivo) have reported mixed results. A recent [systematic review](../../glossary#systematic-review) of these intervention studies suggested that consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa and grape seed extract was generally found to improve platelet function by inhibiting platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation [(89)](#reference89). Interestingly, in a cross-over, controlled study, the acute consumption of a flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa beverage (897 mg of total (-)-EC and procyanidins) exhibited additive anti-platelet effects to aspirin (81 mg) in healthy volunteers [(90)](#reference90). In contrast, the results of interventions using apigenin-rich soup, quercetin-rich supplements or onion soups, isoflavone-rich soy protein isolates, black tea, wines, berries, or grape juices have given inconsistent results (reviewed in [89](#reference89)). A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 20 short-term, [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including a total of 856 mainly healthy participants, found that consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich dark chocolate and cocoa products significantly reduced [systolic blood pressure](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) by 2.77 [mm Hg](../../glossary#mm-Hg) and [diastolic blood pressure](../../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) by 2.20 mm Hg. However, [heterogeneity](../../glossary#heterogeneity) across studies was high, and [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [bias](../../glossary#bias) was significant [(91)](#reference91). A greater blood pressure-reducing effect was observed in a subanalysis of studies using flavan-3-ol-free rather than flavan-3-ol-low control groups [(91)](#reference91). Another meta-analysis of 22 trials (highly heterogeneous) found reductions in diastolic blood pressure (-1.60 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (-1.64 mm Hg) with chocolate or cocoa intake but no change in systolic blood pressure [(81)](#reference81). Additionally, green tea flavan-3-ols have been shown to lower blood pressure especially in (pre-) [hypertensive](../../glossary#hypertension) subjects. A pooled analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials in 1,040 subjects found a 2.05 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 1.71 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure with green tea consumption for at least three weeks [(92)](#reference92). The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key regulator of arterial blood pressure, may partly explain how flavan-3-ol-rich food and beverages might exert blood pressure-lowering effects [(93)](#reference93). Some [intervention trials](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have also examined the effect of the flavonol quercetin on blood pressure in human subjects. In a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [cross-over](../../glossary#cross-over-trial), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 96 participants diagnosed disorders, supplementation with 150 mg/day of quercetin aglycone significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.6 mm Hg without affecting diastolic blood pressure and other cardiometabolic markers [(94)](#reference94). Similar results were found with 730 mg/day of quercetin in hypertensive individuals [(95)](#reference95) and with 500 mg/day of quercetin in women with type 2 [diabetes In a recent six-week, cross-over, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, daily ingestion of 162 mg of quercetin decreased 24 h-ambulatory blood pressure \u2014 but not systolic blood pressure in the resting state \u2014 in hypertensive but not in pre-hypertensive participants [(97)](#reference97). There was plasma endogenous NOS inhibitor. Additional trials may help establish whether the blood pressure-lowering effect of some flavonoids could be translated into long-term benefits for [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) health. The association between flavonoid consumption and [risk](../../glossary#risk) for type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) has been examined in a recent European, multicenter, [nested case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) \u2014 the \"EPIC-InterAct\" project \u2014 that included 16,835 diabetes-free participants and 12,043 diabetics. In this study, participants in the highest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of total flavonoid intake (>608.1 mg/day) had a 10% lower risk of diabetes than those in the lowest quintile (<178.2 mg/day) [(98)](#reference98). Specifically, the risk of diabetes with the intake of of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the possible health effects of green tea flavan-3-ol monomers (catechins) on [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and have provided conflicting results. A meta-analysis of seven trials in pre-diabetic and diabetic patients found no effect of green tea or green tea extracts on fasting [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) [glucose](../../glossary#glucose), fasting [serum](../../glossary#serum) [insulin](../../glossary#insulin), or sensitivity](../../glossary#insulin-sensitive) of 17 trials in pre-diabetic, diabetic, or overweight/obese subjects found that administration of green tea extracts for 4 to 16 weeks improved fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c level [(101)](#reference101). The effect on fasting glucose was observed only with high doses of catechins (457 mg/day) and when the [confounding](../../glossary#confounder) effect of caffeine was removed. Finally, a third meta-analysis of 25 trials found that ingestion of green tea extracts for at least two weeks could lower fasting blood glucose in both the presence or absence of caffeine [(102)](#reference102). Dark chocolate is another good source of flavan-3-ols such that the effects of cocoa flavan-3-ols have been examined in individuals at-risk or with established type 2 diabetes. In a 15-day, [cross-over](../../glossary#cross-over-trial), randomized controlled study, the daily consumption of 100 g of dark chocolate bars containing 110.9 mg of (-)-EC and 36.1 mg of (+)-C significantly improved measures of [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) -cell function and insulin sensitivity, along with cardiometabolic markers in glucose-intolerant and hypertensive subjects [(103)](#reference103). Daily supplementation with flavonoid-enriched chocolate containing 850 mg of flavan-3-ols and 100 mg of isoflavones for one year significantly improved insulin sensitivity and reduced a predicted risk of [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) at 10 years in 93 postmenopausal women treated for type 2 diabetes [(104)](#reference104). The EPIC-InterAct study did not find any association between dietary anthocyanin intake and risk of diabetes [(98, 99)](#reference98). Yet, a 10-fold increase in anthocyanin consumption was correlated with a 15% lower risk of diabetes in the pooled analysis of three large US [prospective cohorts](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (120,003 participants) [(105)](#reference105). Of note, this pooled analysis also reported a moderately higher risk of diabetes (+6%) in individuals in the highest versus lowest quintiles of flavone and flavanone intakes. Moreover, the consumption of berries, rich in anthocyanins, has been shown to trigger favorable glycemic responses in type 2 diabetics (reviewed in [70](#reference70)). In recent [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial), anthocyanins demonstrated beneficial effects on metabolic abnormalities in patients at-risk or diagnosed with diabetes. In an eight-week, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 38 healthy overweight and [obese](../../glossary#obesity) subjects, the consumption of 2 g/day of grape polyphenols rich in proanthocyanidins and challenge [(106)](#reference106). Another six-week randomized trial in individuals with diabetes showed that daily supplementation with Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas) extracts containing 600 mg of anthocyanins significantly lowered [serum](../../glossary#serum) levels of HbA1c and [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglycerides) and increased serum insulin concentrations [(107)](#reference107). The administration of 320 mg/day of anthocyanins for 24 weeks also improved serum [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) and [lipoprotein](../../glossary#lipoprotein) profile, decreased markers of oxidative stress and [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), elevated [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) capacity, and reduced insulin resistance compared to a placebo in patients with diabetes [(108)](#reference108). Further, supplemental anthocyanins up-regulated adiponectin expression and improved [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide)-mediated endothelium-dependent weeks of treatment (see also [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)) [(78)](#reference78). These promising findings warrant additional randomized controlled trials to confirm preventive and/or therapeutic benefits of (cocoa) flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins in type 2 diabetes. Although various flavonoids have been found to inhibit the development of chemically-induced [cancers](../../glossary#cancer) in animal models provide convincing evidence that high intakes of dietary flavonoids are associated with substantial reductions in human cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) (reviewed in [118](#reference118)). A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 [case-control](../../glossary#case-control-study) and 10 [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found little-to-no evidence to support a preventive role of dietary flavonoid intake in gastric and [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) [(119)](#reference119). In addition, a recently published analysis of two large prospective studies (the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [HPFS] and the Nurses' Health Study [NHS]) \u2014 using the most up-to-date flavonoid food composition databases \u2014 found no association between the risk of colorectal cancer and intakes of each subclass of flavonoids or flavonoid-rich foods (tea, blueberries, oranges) [(120)](#reference120). A meta-analysis of 19 case-control studies and 15 cohort studies found that total flavonoid intake and intakes of of the aerodigestive tract (mouth, pharynx, [larynx](../../glossary#larynx), esophagus, and stomach) in smokers but not in nonsmokers [(121)](#reference121). The risk of lung cancer was not significantly associated with high flavonoid intakes [(121)](#reference121), although an earlier meta-analysis of eight prospective studies (with substantial [heterogeneity](../../glossary#heterogeneity) across them) suggested a protective role of flavonoids against lung cancer in smokers only [(122)](#reference122). Further, a prospective analysis of over 45,000 postmenopausal women from the Multiethnic Cohort Study found a reduced risk of [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) cancer with the highest intakes of total isoflavones, daidzein, and genistein [(123)](#reference123). Additionally, limited evidence from [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) suggests no relationship between total flavonoid intake and ovarian cancer [(124-127)](#reference124). To date, there is little evidence that flavonoid-rich diets might protect against various cancers, but larger prospective cohort studies are needed to address the association. Because isoflavones are [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen), it is thought that they may interfere with the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) and activity of [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) [hormones](../../glossary#hormone), eventually influencing hormone-dependent A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) that examined breast cancer incidence in 369,934 women found an overall 11% reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of breast cancer with the highest versus lowest intake of soy isoflavones [(129)](#reference129). Subgroup analyses revealed a 24% lower risk of cancer in Asian but not in European or US women, and the risk was 22% lower in postmenopausal but not lower in premenopausal women. In addition to the ethnicity and menopausal status, [polymorphisms](../../glossary#polymorphism) for hormone [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) [(130)](#reference130) and phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) [(131)](#reference131) have been found to modify the association between isoflavone intake and breast cancer. Another recent meta-analysis of 12 observational studies (six [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), one case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study), flavonoids (except isoflavones) The results suggested that intakes of flavonols and flavones may also be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of breast cancer. Further, a pooled analysis of four case-control studies that stratified by menopausal status showed inverse associations between breast cancer and intakes of flavonols, flavones, or flavan-3-ols in postmenopausal women only. Finally, a meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies found an overall 16% reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence in women with high versus low isoflavone intakes [(129)](#reference129). A meta-analysis of 13 observational studies also suggested an inverse relationship between prostate cancer risk and consumption of soy products, especially tofu [(133)](#reference133). Yet, further analyses supported a protective role of soy food based only on case-control studies, which have inherent flaws such that associations may often be overestimated or underestimated. In a recent 12-month, multicenter, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [phase II clinical trial](../../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) in 158 Japanese men (aged 50 years) with elevated risk of prostate cancer, oral isoflavone (60 mg/day) resulted in a significant decrease in prostate cancer incidence in participants aged 65 years and older [(134)](#reference134). In this study, no changes were reported in sex hormone concentrations in blood, suggesting that isoflavones may reduce prostate cancer incidence without interfering with hormone-dependent pathways. Additional investigations will be necessary to determine whether supplementation with specific flavonoids could benefit cancer prevention or treatment. For more information on flavonoid-rich foods and cancer, see articles on [Fruit and Vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables#cancer-prevention), [Legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes#cancer-prevention), and [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea#cancer-prevention). [Inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress), and transition metal accumulation appear to play a role in the [pathology](../../glossary#pathology) of several [neurodegenerative diseases](../../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease), including [Parkinson's disease](../../glossary#parkinson-disease) [(135)](#reference135). Therefore, the various properties of flavonoids, including their role in protecting vascular health, could have beneficial effects on the brain, possibly in the protection against [cerebrovascular disorders](../../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease), [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) impairments, and subsequent [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) and [dementias](../../glossary#dementia). Dietary flavonoids and/or their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier [(54)](#reference54) and exert preventive effects towards cognitive impairments in animal models of normal and pathological aging [(53)](#reference53). The [cross-sectional](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) data analysis of 2,031 participants (ages, 70-74 years) from the Hordaland Health Study in Norway indicated that, when compared to non-consumers, consumers of flavonoid-rich chocolate, tea, and wine had better global cognitive function, assessed by a battery of six cognitive tests [(136)](#reference136). The [risk](../../glossary#risk) of poor performance in all tests was estimated to be 60 to 74% lower in consumers of all three flavonoid-rich foods compared to non-consumers. An early [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 1,367 older French men and women (aged 65 years; free from dementia at baseline) found that those with the lowest flavonoid intakes (<11.5 mg/day) had a 50% higher risk of developing dementia over the next five years than those with higher intakes [(137)](#reference137). In addition, those with higher dietary flavonoid intakes at baseline experienced significantly less age-related cognitive decline over a 10-year period than those with the lowest flavonoid intakes [(138)](#reference138). The effect of cocoa flavan-3-ols have been investigated in an eight-week, [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind) trial \u2014 the Cognitive, Cocoa, and Aging (CoCoA) study \u2014 in 90 individuals (ages, 64-82 years) with mild cognitive impairments (MCI); participants were given dairy-based cocoa drinks with either high (993 mg/day) or low (48 mg/day) levels of flavan-3-ols [(139)](#reference139). The daily consumption of the cocoa drink high in flavan-3-ols improved some, but not all, measures of cognitive process speed and flexibility and verbal fluency compared to baseline test scores and scores following low flavan-3-ol drink consumption. A composite test score reflecting overall cognitive performance was found to be significantly greater in those given cocoa drinks high rather than low in flavan-3-ols. The study also reported reductions in [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) risk markers (i.e., [systolic](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic blood pressure](../../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure), total and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol), [insulin resistance](../../glossary#insulin-resistance)), and these changes were proposed to partly contribute to ameliorate cognitive performance in those who consumed the flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa drink [(139)](#reference139). The data could be replicated in cognitively healthy older people (ages, 61-85 years), suggesting that cocoa flavan-3-ols might enhance some aspects of cognitive function during healthy aging [(140)](#reference140). Interestingly, a two-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled study has reported an increase in blood flow velocity in the middle [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebrum) artery of 21 healthy subjects (mean age, 72 years) following the daily intake of a flavan-3-ol-rich cocoa drink (900 mg/day of flavan-3-ols) [(141)](#reference141). Because cerebral blood flow is correlated with cognitive function in humans, these preliminary data suggest that cocoa flavan-3-ol consumption could exert a protective effect against dementia [(54)](#reference54). Yet, in other [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(142-144)](#reference142), the lack of an effect of cocoa flavan-3-ols on blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, mental fatigue, and cognitive performance in healthy young and old adults suggested that benefits may only be seen in very demanding cognitive exercises [(145)](#reference145). Some randomized controlled studies also reported improvements in measures of cognitive function in healthy and cognitively impaired subjects with other and flavonoid-rich foods may enhance cognitive function in the aging brain, it is not yet clear whether their consumption could lower the risk of cognitive impairments and dementia in humans. For more detailed information on flavan-3-ol-rich tea and cognitive function, see the article on [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea). Recent data analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimated flavonoid intakes in US adults (aged 19 years) average between 200 and 250 mg/day, with 80% being The main dietary sources of flavonoids include [tea](../../food-beverages/tea), citrus fruit, citrus fruit juices, berries, red wine, apples, and [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes). Individual flavonoid intakes may vary considerably depending on whether tea, red wine, soy products, or fruit and vegetables are commonly consumed (reviewed in [2](#reference2)). Information on the flavonoid content of some flavonoid-rich foods is presented in Tables 2-8. These values should be considered approximate since a number of factors may affect the flavonoid content of foods, including agricultural practices, environmental conditions, ripening, storage, and food processing. For additional information about the flavonoid content of food, the USDA provides databases for the content of selected foods in flavonoids [(60)](#reference60) and proanthocyanidins [(58)](#reference58). For more information on the isoflavone content of soy foods, see the article on [Soy Isoflavones](soy-isoflavones#sources) or the USDA database for the isoflavone g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces.| |Food||Flavon-3-ol Monomers# and Shiraz||6.8||-||10||-||-||-||-| *per 100 g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces. | #Catechins: C, (+)-catechin; g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces.| |Eriodictyol||Hesperetin||Naringenin| g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces.| 100 g (fresh weight) or 100 mL (liquids); 100 grams is equivalent to about 3.5 ounces; 100 mL is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces.| Bilberry, elderberry, black currant, blueberry, red grape, and mixed berry extracts that are rich in anthocyanins are available as dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) without a prescription in the US. The anthocyanin content of these products may vary considerably. Standardized extracts that list the amount of anthocyanins per dose are available. Numerous tea extracts are available in the US as dietary supplements and may be labeled as tea catechins or tea polyphenols. Green tea extracts are the most commonly marketed, but black and oolong tea extracts are also available. Green tea extracts generally have higher levels of catechins (flavan-3-ol [monomers](../../glossary#monomer)), while black tea extracts are richer in theaflavins and thearubigins (tea flavan-3-ol dimers and [polymers](../../glossary#polymer), respectively). Oolong tea extracts fall somewhere in between green and black tea extracts with respect to their flavan-3-ol content. Some tea extracts contain caffeine, while others are decaffeinated. Flavan-3-ol and caffeine content vary considerably among different products, so it is important to check the label or consult the manufacturer to determine the amounts of flavan-3-ols and caffeine that would be consumed daily with each supplement (for more information on tea flavan-3-ols, see the article on [Tea](../../food-beverages/tea#flavonoids)). Citrus bioflavonoid supplements also available in hesperidin-complex supplements, with daily doses from 500 mg to 2 g [(153)](#reference153). The peels and tissues of citrus fruit (e.g., oranges, tangerines, and clementines) are rich in Although dietary intakes of these naturally occurring flavones are generally low, they are often present in citrus bioflavonoid complex supplements. Several dietary supplements may also contain various amounts of baicalein (aglycone) and/or baicalin (glycoside). Some tea flavonol aglycone, quercetin, and its glycoside rutin are available as dietary supplements without a prescription in the US. Other names for rutin include rutoside, quercetin-3-rutinoside, and sophorin [(153)](#reference153). Citrus quercetin or rutin. A 50-mg soy isoflavone supplement usually isoflavones: mg), daidzein (daidzin; 19 mg), and (glycitin; about 6 mg). Smaller amounts of daidzein, genistein, and formononetin are also found in biochanin A-containing supplements (derived from red clover) [(153)](#reference153). No adverse effects have been associated with high dietary intakes of flavonoids from plant-based food. This lack of adverse effects may be explained by the relatively low [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and rapid [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and elimination of most flavonoids. Oral supplementation with quercetin [glycosides](../../glossary#glycoside) at doses ranging between 3 mg/day-1,000 mg/day for up to three months has not resulted in significant adverse effects in clinical studies (reviewed in [154](#reference154)). A [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 30 patients with chronic prostatitis reported one case of headache and another of tingling of the extremities associated with supplemental quercetin (1,000 mg/day for one month); both issues resolved after the study ended [(155)](#reference155). In a [phase I clinical trial](../../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial) in cancer patients unresponsive to standard treatments, administration of quercetin via [intravenous](../../glossary#intravenous) infusion resulted in symptoms of nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, and dyspnea (difficulty breathing) at doses 10.5 mg/kg body weight (~756 mg of quercetin for a 70 kg individual) [(156)](#reference156). Higher doses up to 51.3 mg/kg body weight (~3,591 mg of quercetin) were associated with renal (kidney) toxicity, yet without evidence of nephritis, infection, or obstructive uropathy (reviewed in [154](#reference154)). In a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), controlled study in healthy adults, the daily intake of 2 g of cocoa flavan-3-ols for 12 weeks was found to be well tolerated with no adverse side effects [(157)](#reference157). In [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) employing caffeinated green tea extracts, cancer patients who took 6 g/day in three to six divided doses reported mild-to-moderate [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) side effects, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [(158, 159)](#reference158). [Central nervous system](../../glossary#central-nervous-system) symptoms, including agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tremors, dizziness, and confusion, have also been reported. In one case, confusion was severe enough to require hospitalization [(158)](#reference158). In a [systematic review](../../glossary#systematic-review) published in 2008, the US Pharmacopeia (USP) Dietary Supplement Information Expert Committee identified 34 adverse event reports implicating the use of green tea extract products (containing 25%-97% of polyphenols) as the likely cause of liver damage (hepatotoxicity) in humans [(160)](#reference160). In a four-week clinical trial that assessed the safety of decaffeinated green tea extracts (800 mg/day of EGCG) in healthy individuals, a few of the participants reported mild nausea, stomach upset, dizziness, or muscle pain [(161)](#reference161). In the Minnesota Green Tea Trial (MGTT), 1,075 postmenopausal women were [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) to receive green tea extracts (1,315\u00b1116 mg/day of catechins; the equivalent of four 8-ounce mugs of brewed decaffeinated green tea) or a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) for one year. The total number of adverse events and the number of serious adverse events were not different between the treatment and placebo groups [(162)](#reference162). However, the use of green tea extracts was directly associated with abnormally high liver [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) levels in 7 out of the 12 women who experienced serious adverse events. Also, the incidence of nausea was twice as high in the green tea arm as in the placebo group [(162)](#reference162). The safety of flavonoid [supplements](../../glossary#supplment) in pregnancy and lactation has not been established [(153)](#reference153). ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters, including P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein (MRP), and breast cancer-resistant protein (BCRP), function as [ATP](../../glossary#ATP)-dependent efflux pumps that actively regulate the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of a number of drugs limiting their systemic [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) [(8)](#reference8). ABC transporters are found throughout the body, yet they are especially important in organs with a barrier function like the intestines, the blood-brain barrier, blood-testis barrier, and the [placenta](../../glossary#placenta), as well as in liver and kidneys [(163)](#reference163). There is some evidence that the consumption of grapefruit juice inhibits the activity of P-glycoprotein [(164)](#reference164). and (-)-EGCG, and others have been found to inhibit the efflux activity of P-glycoprotein in cultured cells and in animal models [(163)](#reference163). Thus, very high or [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) intakes of these flavonoids could potentially increase the toxicity of drugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein, e.g., digoxin, protease inhibitors, immunosuppressive agents, H2 receptor antagonists, some antibiotics, and others (reviewed in [165](#reference165)). Many anthocyanins and anthocyanidins, as been identified as inhibitors of BRCP-mediated transport, theoretically affecting drugs like anticancer inhibit MRP, potentially affecting MRP-mediated transport of from purple grape juice (500 mL/day) and dark chocolate (235 mg/day of flavan-3-ols) have been found to inhibit [platelet](../../glossary#platelet) aggregation ex vivo assays [(166-169)](#reference166). Theoretically, high intakes of flavonoids (e.g., from [supplements](../../glossary#supplement)) could increase the risk of bleeding when taken with [anticoagulant](../../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs, such in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of a broad range of compounds, from [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) molecules to therapeutic agents. The most abundant CYP isoform in the liver and intestines is cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); the CYP3A family [catalyzes](../../glossary#catalyst) the metabolism of about one-half of all marketed drugs in the US and Canada [(171)](#reference171). One grapefruit or as little as 200 mL (7 fluid ounces) of grapefruit juice have been found to irreversibly inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 [(164)](#reference164). The most potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 in grapefruit are thought to be furanocoumarins, particularly dihydroxybergamottin, rather than flavonoids. All forms of the fruit \u2014 freshly squeezed juice, frozen concentrate, or whole fruit \u2014 can potentially affect the activity of CYP3A4. Some varieties of other citrus fruit (Seville oranges, limes, and pomelos) that contain furanocoumarins can also interfere with CYP3A4 activity. Specifically, the inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by grapefruit consumption is known or predicted to increase the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of toxicity of more than 85 drugs. Because drugs with very low bioavailability are more likely to be toxic when CYP3A4 activity is inhibited, they are associated with a higher risk of overdose with grapefruit compared to drugs with high bioavailability. Some of the drugs with low bioavailability include, but are not limited to, agents (darifenacin) (reviewed in [171](#reference171)). Because of the potential for adverse drug interactions, some clinicians recommend that people taking medications with low bioavailability (i.e., undergoing extensive metabolism by CYP3A4) avoid consuming grapefruit and grapefruit juice altogether during the treatment period [(171)](#reference171). Flavonoids can bind nonheme [iron](../../minerals/iron), inhibiting its intestinal absorption [(172, 173)](#reference172). Nonheme iron is the principal form of iron in plant foods, dairy products, and iron [supplements](../../glossary#supplement). The consumption of one cup of tea or cocoa with a meal has been found to decrease the absorption of nonheme iron in that meal by about 70% [(174, 175)](#reference174). Flavonoids can also inhibit intestinal [heme](../../glossary#heme) iron absorption [(176)](#reference176). Interestingly, ascorbic acid greatly enhances the absorption of iron (see the article on [Iron](../../minerals/iron#nonheme-iron)) and is able to counteract the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on nonheme and heme iron absorption [(173](#reference173), [176, 177)](#reference176). To maximize iron absorption from a meal or iron supplements, flavonoid-rich food and beverages and flavonoid supplements should not be consumed at the same time.

J Nutr. 2011;141(5):828-834. ] [(PubMed)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21430251) Contents Some [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have reported significant associations between high intakes of [cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#cancer-prevention) and lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of several types of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(1)](#references). Cruciferous vegetables differ from other classes of vegetables in that they are rich sources of sulfur-containing compounds known as glucosinolates (for detailed information, see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#introduction)) [(2)](#reference2). The potential health benefits of consuming cruciferous vegetables are attributed to compounds derived from the [enzymatic](../../glossary#enzyme) [hydrolysis](../../glossary#hydrolysis) (breakdown) of glucosinolates. Among these compounds is indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a compound derived from the degradation of an indole glucosinolate commonly known as glucobrassicin (Figure 1). A number of commonly consumed [cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables), including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage, are good sources of glucobrassicin glucosinolates, is physically separated from glucosinolates in intact plant cells [(3)](#reference3). When raw cruciferous vegetables are chopped or chewed, plant cells are damaged such that glucobrassicin is exposed to myrosinase. The hydrolysis of glucobrassicin initially produces a [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) molecule and the unstable [aglycone](../../glossary#aglycone), thiohydroximate-O-sulfonate. The spontaneous release of a sulfate [ion](../../glossary#ion) results in the formation of another unstable intermediate form, 3-indolylmethylisothiocyanate [(4)](#reference4). This compound easily splits into thiocyanate ion and I3C (Figure 1). In the [acidic](../../glossary#acidic) environment of the stomach, I3C molecules can combine with each other to form a complex mixture of polycyclic aromatic compounds, known collectively as acid condensation products (Figure 2) [(5)](#reference5). Some of the most prominent acid condensation products include 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), 5,11-dihydroindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ), and a cyclic triindole (CT) (Figure 2). The biological activities of individual acid condensation products may differ from those of I3C (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). When cruciferous vegetables are cooked, plant myrosinase is inactivated thus the hydrolysis of glucosinolates is prevented. Intact glucosinolates then transit to the [colon](../../glossary#colon) and are [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) by human intestinal [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria). The generation of I3C from glucobrassicin may still occur to a lesser degree in the large intestine, due to the myrosinase activity of colonic bacteria [(4)](#reference4). Thus, when cruciferous vegetables are cooked, I3C can still form in the colon, but I3C-derived acid condensation products are less likely to form in the more [alkaline](../../glossary#alkaline) environment of the intestine. No I3C could be detected in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) following oral administration of single doses of I3C, ranging from 200 to 1,200 mg, to healthy women at high risk for breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(6)](#reference6). However, DIM was detected and peaked in plasma around two hours after I3C ingestion, at concentrations from <100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) with oral doses of 400 to 600 mg of I3C up to 500 ng/mL-600 ng/mL with oral doses of 1,000 to 1,200 mg of I3C. All DIM disappeared from the blood within 24 hours [(6)](#reference6). Formulation strategies, such as the encapsulation of I3C and DIM into nanoparticles or liposomes [(7-9)](#reference7), are being developed with the aim of increasing the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and evaluating the safety and efficacy of these compounds in humans. [Biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) play major roles in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and elimination of many biologically active compounds, including physiologic regulators (e.g., [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen)), drugs, and environmental chemicals ( [xenobiotics](../../glossary#xenobiotic); e.g., [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen), toxins). In general, phase including the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family, [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) reactions that increase the reactivity of [hydrophobic](../../glossary#hydrophobic) (fat-soluble) compounds, which prepares them for reactions catalyzed by phase II detoxifying enzymes. Reactions catalyzed by phase II enzymes usually increase water solubility and promote the elimination of these compounds [(10)](#reference10). I3C and some I3C condensation products can bind to a [protein](../../glossary#protein) in the [cytoplasm](../../glossary#cytoplasm) of cells called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Figure 3) [(11-13)](#reference11). In fact, ICZ is one of the most potent ligands for the AhR known with an affinity approaching that of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). I3C acid condensation products, as well as indoles and their acid condensation products formed from tryptophan metabolism, appear to be important endogenous ligands for the AhR [(13)](#reference13). Binding allows AhR to enter the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) where it forms a complex with the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein. This AhR/Arnt complex binds to specific [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) sequences, known as xenobiotic response elements (XRE), in the regulatory regions ( [promoters](../../glossary#promoter)) of target [genes](../../glossary#gene), especially those involved in [xenobiotic](../../glossary#xenobiotic) [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) [(14)](#reference14). The promoters of genes coding for a number of [CYP enzymes](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) and several [phase II enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) profiling of I3C- or DIM-treated human [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells showed that both compounds upregulated the [phase I enzyme](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), CYP1A1, and the q1) and aldo-keto reductase [(15)](#reference15). Another study in human prostate cancer cells demonstrated that the removal of AhR abolished I3C- or DIM-induced CYP1A1 [mRNA](../../glossary#mRNA) expression [(16)](#reference16). The expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 was also upregulated in human primary liver cells challenged with DIM [(17)](#reference17). Further, I3C and DIM have been found to interfere with CYP activities involved in [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) metabolism (see [Anti-estrogenic activities](#anti-estrogenic-activities)). Increasing the activity of biotransformation enzymes is generally considered a beneficial effect because the elimination of potential [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) or toxins is enhanced. However, there is a potential for adverse effects because some [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen) require biotransformation by phase I enzymes to become active carcinogens [(18)](#reference18). I3C and DIM have been shown to induce the expression of [phase II](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) detoxifying and [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway. Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the [protein](../../glossary#protein) Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../../glossary#cytosol) (Figure Keap1 responds to [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals or chemical inducers by freeing Nrf2. Upon release, Nrf2 translocates to the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoters](../../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes and scavengers. Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code for numerous mediators isoform) expression in liver [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells [(20)](#reference20). In addition, the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of Nrf2 coding gene, which was abnormally repressed through promoter [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) hypermethylation, was enhanced in mouse [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancer cells treated with DIM. DIM subsequently restored the expression of the Nrf2-target genes, NQO1 and GST\u00b51 [(21)](#reference21). DIM also reversed Nrf2 gene silencing in transgenic mouse prostate cancer tissues, inducing Nrf2 expression, and subsequently, NQO1 expression (Figure 4). This was accompanied by the suppression of [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and the induction of [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) in prostate cancer tissues [(21)](#reference21). Similar observations have been with I3C [(22)](#reference22). [Endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen) are [steroid](../../glossary#steroid) [hormones](../../glossary#hormone) [synthesized](../../glossary#synthesis) mammals. In breast tissue, CYP19 (aromatase) [catalyzes](../../glossary#catalyst) the final steps in the conversion (testosterone or androstenedione) to [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen) (17-estradiol or estrone, respectively). Both I3C and DIM have been found to downregulate the expression of CYP19 in non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic estrogen-responsive (ER+) breast expression increased in I3C/DIM-treated tumorigenic estrogen-independent (ER-) breast cells [(23)](#reference23). Prolonged exposure to [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen) is thought to play a role in [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) development through [CYP](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450)-mediated generation of estrogen reactive of estrogens. can CYP1A1/2 and CYP1B1, respectively. and 4HE2 are further metabolized to 2- and 4-metoxymetabolites by the phase II enzyme, catechol-O-methyltransferase 17-estradiol, while 4-HE2 can be converted to [free radicals](../../glossary#free-radical) that can form DNA adducts and promote [carcinogenesis](../../glossary#carcinogenesis) [(26, 27)](#reference26). In different breast cancer cell lines, I3C and DIM have been shown to upregulate the expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 at the transcript ( [mRNA](../../glossary#mRNA)) level but not at the [protein](../../glossary#protein) level [(28)](#reference28). the [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogens to 2-hydroxyestrone (2HE1), 16HE1 is highly estrogenic and has been found to stimulate the [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) of several estrogen-sensitive cancer cell lines [(30, 31)](#reference30). It has been [hypothesized](../../glossary#hypothesis) that shifting the metabolism of 17-estradiol toward 2HE1, and away from 16HE1, could decrease the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of estrogen-sensitive cancers, such as breast cancer [(32)](#reference32). In controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial), oral supplementation with I3C or has consistently increased urinary 2HE1 concentrations or urinary 2HE1:16HE1 ratios in women [(33-39)](#reference33). However, large [case-control](../../glossary#case-control-study) and [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have failed to find significant associations between urinary 2HE1:16HE1 ratios and risk of breast and [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) cancer [(40-43)](#reference40). [Endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen), including 17-estradiol, exert their by binding to specific [nuclear](../../glossary#nucleus) [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) called estrogen receptors (ERs). Within the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus), estrogen-activated ERs can bind to specific [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) sequences, known as estrogen response coactivator [proteins](../../glossary#protein) and [chromatin](../../glossary#chromatin) remodeling factors to promoters, thereby triggering the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of target genes [(44)](#reference44). There are two major ER subtypes, ER and ER, coded by two separate genes ESR1 and ESR2, respectively. ER is the main driver of the [proliferative](../../glossary#proliferation) effect of estrogens, while the expression of ER has been [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with mammary gland tumorigenesis [(45)](#reference45). Elevated ER levels promote cellular proliferation in the breast and uterus, possibly increasing the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing estrogen-sensitive cancers [(46)](#reference46). In [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen)-sensitive human breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells challenged with 17-estradiol, I3C has been found to inhibit the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of estrogen-responsive [genes](../../glossary#gene) without binding to either ER or ER [(47, 48)](#reference47). In fact, the binding of I3C to AhR was shown to trigger the [proteasome](../../glossary#proteasome)-dependent degradation of ER [(49)](#reference49). I3C-induced loss of ER resulted in the downregulation of ER-responsive gene products like the [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) GATA3. Since GATA3 regulates the transcription of the ER coding gene ESR1, I3C prevented the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) of new ER transcripts and [proteins](../../glossary#protein), eventually abolishing the ER [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathway. The disruption of the GATA3/ER cross-regulatory loop by I3C ultimately halted ER-dependent cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) [(49)](#reference49). Acid condensation products of I3C that bind and activate AhR may also inhibit the transcription of estrogen-responsive genes by competing for co-activators or increasing ER degradation [(14](#reference14), [50)](#reference50). I3C treatment also affected the expression of other ER-responsive genes, including those coding for insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGFR1) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), involved in cell proliferation and deregulated in breast cancer (Figure 5) [(51)](#reference51). I3C and condensation derivatives have been found to affect multiple [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways that are often deregulated in [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells. Below are some examples illustrating how I3C, DIM, or ICZ may influence cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis), migration, invasion, [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis), and [immunity](../../health-disease/immunity) by targeting specific signaling pathways [(23)](#reference23). Once a cell divides, it passes through a sequence of stages \u2014 collectively known as the cell cycle \u2014 before it divides again. Following [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested at damage checkpoints, which allows for DNA repair or activation of pathways leading to cell death ( [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis)) if the damage is irreparable [(52)](#reference52). Defective cell cycle regulation may result in the propagation of [mutations](../../glossary#mutation) that contribute to the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer). In addition, unlike normal cells, cancerous cells lose their ability to respond to death signals that initiate apoptosis. I3C-induced downregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (Akt) cell survival [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathway in mice with nasopharyngeal carcinoma resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis [(53)](#reference53). Inactivation of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway in DIM-treated [colon](../../glossary#colon) cancer cells decreased the expression of downstream targets, c-myc and cyclin D1, that promote cell proliferation and survival [(54)](#reference54). In [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancer cells, I3C opposed the anti-apoptotic effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) by limiting EGF receptor autophosphorylation (activation) and reducing EGF-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and expression of the pro-survival target molecules, Bcl-x(L) and BAD [(55)](#reference55). In another study, DIM caused apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by stimulating p38 mitogen-activated [(56)](#reference56). The anti-proliferative effect of DIM in cancer cells has also been linked to the inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Specifically, DIM was found to reverse HDAC-mediated epigenetic silencing of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for key regulators of the cell cycle [(57, 58)](#reference57). A recent [genome](../../glossary#genome)-wide analysis of DNA [methylation](../../glossary#methylation) also showed that DIM could reverse aberrant promoter methylation in prostate cancer cells, at least partly through downregulating the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) [(59)](#reference59). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes a process of epithelial cell transformation whereby cells lose their polarity and adhesion properties while gaining migratory and invasive properties through the expression of mesenchymal [genes](../../glossary#gene). Inhibition of EMT by I3C and ICZ in breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells has been associated with upregulation of an epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and downregulation of vimentin, adhesion metalloproteins \u2014 [proteins](../../glossary#protein) and [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) known to promote migration [(60)](#reference60). DIM also inhibited migration and invasion of liver cancer cells [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) and [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) through inactivating the FAK [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathway [(61)](#reference61). Moreover, DIM has been shown to reverse [methylation](../../glossary#methylation)-associated dysregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion, [chemotaxis](../../glossary#chemotaxis), and [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) that contributes to cancer progression [(59)](#reference59). DIM was able to inhibit lung [metastasis](../../glossary#metastasis) in mice with liver [(61)](#reference61) or mammary tumors [(62)](#reference62). To fuel their rapid growth, invasive tumors must also develop new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels by a process known as [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis). I3C inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced [macrophage](../../glossary#macrophage) (VEGF), and prevented the formation of capillary-like structures from co-cultured human umbilical endothelial cells [(63)](#reference63). Similarly, cells [(64)](#reference64). DIM also activities in human umbilical endothelial cells [(65)](#reference65). Uncontrolled [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) has been associated with several [chronic diseases](../../glossary#chronic-disease), including [cancer](../../glossary#cancer). In the oxide synthase (iNOS), has been found to be mitigated by DIM treatment [(66)](#reference66). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) is a major [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) regulating the expression of many pro-inflammatory [genes](../../glossary#gene) like those coding for COX-2 and iNOS. Specifically, DIM inhibited TPA-induced activation of activity of NF-B [(66)](#reference66). In addition, recent animal studies showed that I3C and/or DIM could modulate cell-mediated immune response in experimental DIM differentially via the activation or suppression of [microRNA](../../glossary#microRNA)-dependent pathways controlling cell cycle progression and [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis). The inclusion of I3C in the maternal diet was found to protect the offspring from lymphoma and lung tumors induced by dibenzo[a]pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon [(70, 71)](#reference70). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are chemical pollutants formed during incomplete combustion of organic substances, such as coal, oil, wood, and tobacco [(72)](#reference72). However, the physiological relevance of cell culture and animal studies to human health is unclear since little or no I3C is available to tissues after oral administration (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) [(6)](#reference6). Some [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) provide some the [hypothesis](../../glossary#hypothesis) that higher intakes of [cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) are associated with lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) for some types of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#cancer-prevention)) [(1)](#references). Cruciferous vegetables are relatively good sources of nutrients that may have protective effects against cancer, including [vitamin C](../../vitamins/vitamin-C), [folate](../../vitamins/folate), [selenium](../../minerals/selenium), [carotenoids](carotenoids), and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber). In addition, glucosinolates be hydrolyzed to a variety of potentially protective [isothiocyanates](isothiocyanates), in addition to indole-3-carbinol (see the article on [Isothiocyanates](isothiocyanates#metabolism-bioavailability)). Consequently, evidence for an [inverse association](../../glossary#inverse-association) between cruciferous vegetable intake and cancer risk provides relatively little information about the specific effects of indole-3-carbinol on cancer risk. At present, the effects of I3C or DIM supplementation on cancer risk in humans are not known. Infection with certain strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) is an important [risk](../../glossary#risk) factor for cervical cancer [(73)](#reference73). Transgenic mice that express cancer-promoting HPV genes develop cervical cancer with chronic 17-estradiol administration. In this model, feeding I3C markedly reduced the number of mice that developed cervical cancer [(74)](#reference74). A small [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in women examined the effect of oral I3C supplementation on the progression of precancerous cervical lesions classified as [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia](../../glossary#cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia) (CIN) 2 or CIN 3 [(75)](#reference75). After 12 weeks, four out of the eight women who took 200 mg/day had complete regression of CIN, and four out of the nine who took 400 mg/day had complete regression; none of the 10 women who took a placebo had complete regression. HPV was present in 7 out of the 10 women in the placebo group, seven out of eight women in the 200 mg I3C group, and eight out of nine women in the 400 mg I3C group [(75)](#reference75). However compared to placebo, oral supplementation with DIM (2 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks in 64 women with CIN 2 or CIN 3 lesions failed to improve clinical parameters during a one-year follow-up period [(76)](#reference76). In another six-month [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind) DIM supplementation (150 mg/day) failed to promote HPV clearance and prevent CIN progression in 551 women with low-grade cell abnormalities in cervical smears [(77)](#reference77). Although oral supplementation of I3C or DIM appears relatively safe and well tolerated, results obtained with I3C are only preliminary, and interventions with DIM failed to show preventative or therapeutic efficacy in women with precancerous lesions of the cervix. The intravaginal administration of DIM in the form of suppositories may prove to be a more effective approach to reverse CIN in women [(78)](#reference78). HPV infection has also been associated with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), a precancerous condition that may progress to vulval cancer [(79)](#reference79). A small [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) trial in 12 women with VIN found that supplementation with 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day of I3C for six months improved overall symptoms, as well as lesion size and appearance [(80)](#reference80). Additional trials are necessary to determine whether I3C might be an effective treatment for VIN. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare disease of children and adults, characterized by generally benign growths (papillomas) in the respiratory tract, which are caused by HPV infection [(81)](#reference81). These papillomas occur most commonly on or around the vocal cords in the [larynx](../../glossary#larynx) (voice box), but they may also affect the trachea, bronchi, and lungs. The most common treatment for RRP is surgical removal of the papillomas. Since papillomas often recur, [adjunct](../../glossary#adjunct) treatments may be used to help prevent or reduce recurrences [(82)](#reference82). In immune-compromised mice transplanted with HPV-infected laryngeal tissue, 25% of the mice fed I3C developed laryngeal papillomas compared to 100% of the control mice [(83)](#reference83). In a small [observational study](../../glossary#observational-study) of RRP patients, increased ratios of urinary 2HE1:16HE1 resulting from increased [cruciferous vegetable](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) consumption were associated with less severe RRP [(84)](#reference84). In an uncontrolled [pilot study](../../glossary#pilot-study), the effect of daily I3C supplementation (400 mg/day for adults and 10 mg/kg daily for children) on papilloma recurrence has been examined in RRP patients [(85)](#reference85). Over a five-year follow-up period, 11 of the original 49 patients experienced no recurrence, 10 experienced a reduction in the rate of recurrence, 12 experienced no improvement, and 12 were lost to follow-up [(86)](#reference86). I3C given for 6 months to 3 years to five children with an aggressive form of the disease halted the growth of the papillomas in three children after two years of treatment [(87)](#reference87). In some patients, I3C may be an effective adjunct treatment to reduce the growth or recurrence of respiratory papillomas. [Systemic lupus erythematosus](../../glossary#systemic-lupus-erythematosus) (SLE) is an [autoimmune disorder](../../glossary#autoimmune-disease) characterized by chronic [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) that may result in damage to the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, or brain [(88)](#reference88). [Estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) is thought to play a role in the [pathology](../../glossary#pathology) of SLE because the disorder is much more common in women than men, and its onset is most common during the reproductive years when [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogen levels are highest [(89)](#reference89). The potential for I3C toward the highly estrogenic metabolite 16HE1 (see [Anti-estrogenic activities](#anti-estrogenic-activities)), led to interest in its use in SLE [(35)](#reference35). In an animal model of SLE, I3C feeding decreased the severity of kidney disease and prolonged survival [(90)](#reference90). A small uncontrolled trial of I3C supplementation (375 mg/day) in female SLE patients found that I3C supplementation increased urinary 2HE1:16HE1 ratios, but the trial found no significant change in SLE symptoms after three months [(90)](#reference90). Controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine whether I3C supplementation could have beneficial effects in SLE patients. Glucobrassicin, the glucosinolate [precursor](../../glossary#precursor) of I3C, is found Brussels and turnip [(91, 92)](#reference91). Although glucosinolates are present in relatively high concentrations in cruciferous vegetables, glucobrassicin makes up only about 8%-12% of the total glucosinolates [(93)](#reference93). Total glucosinolate contents of selected cruciferous vegetables are presented in Table 1. However, the amount of total glucosinolates and the amount of indole-3-carbinol formed from glucobrassicin in food is variable and depends, in part, on the processing and preparation of foods (for more detailed information, see the article cup, | savoy||\u00bd chopped|| |Watercress||1 cup, | red||\u00bd chopped|| | |Broccoli||\u00bd cup, chopped|| | |Horseradish||1 tablespoon (15 g)|| | 24 |Cauliflower||\u00bd cup, chopped|| | 22 |Bok choi (pak choi)||\u00bd cup, chopped|| | 19 I3C is available without a prescription as a dietary [supplement](../../glossary#supplement), alone or in combination products. Dosage ranges between 200 mg/day and 800 mg/day [(95)](#reference95). I3C supplementation increased urinary 2HE1 concentrations in doses of 300 to 400 mg/day [(39)](#reference39). I3C doses of 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day improved the regression of [cervical (CIN) in a preliminary [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) [(75)](#reference75). I3C in doses up to 400 mg/day has been used to treat recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)) [(85, 86)](#reference85). DIM is available without a prescription as a dietary [supplement](../../glossary#supplement), alone or in combination products. In a small [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial), DIM supplementation at a dose of 108 mg/day for 30 days increased urinary 2HE1 [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) in postmenopausal women with a history of breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(34)](#reference34). Slight increases in the [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentrations of the liver [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were observed in two women who took unspecified doses of I3C [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) for four weeks [(39)](#reference39). One person reported a skin rash while taking 375 mg/day of I3C [(35)](#reference35). High doses of I3C (800 mg/day) have been associated with symptoms of disequilibrium and tremor, which resolved when the dose was decreased [(85)](#reference85). In a [phase I study](../../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial) in women at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for breast cancer, 5 out of 20 participants had [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms with single doses 600 mg, although others had no adverse effects with single doses up to 1,200 mg [(6)](#reference6). No adverse effects were reported with daily consumption of 400 mg of I3C for four weeks [(6)](#reference6). In some animal models, I3C supplementation was found to enhance [carcinogen](../../glossary#carcinogen)-induced cancer development when given chronically after the carcinogen [(96-99)](#reference96). When administered before or at the same time as the carcinogen, oral I3C inhibited tumorigenesis in animal models of cancers of the long-term effects of I3C supplementation on cancer risk in humans are not known, the contradictory results of animal studies have led several experts to caution against the widespread use of I3C and DIM supplements in humans until their potential risks and benefits are better understood [(99](#reference99), [109, 110)](#reference109). The safety of I3C or DIM [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy or lactation has not been established [(95)](#reference95). No drug interactions with I3C or DIM supplementation in humans have been reported. However, preliminary evidence that I3C and DIM can increase the activity of CYP1A2 [(111, 112)](#reference111) suggests the potential for I3C or DIM supplementation to decrease [serum](../../glossary#serum) concentrations of medications [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) by CYP1A2 [(113)](#reference113). Both I3C and DIM modestly increase the activity of CYP3A4 in rats when administered chronically [(114)](#reference114). This observation raises the potential for adverse drug interactions in humans since CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of approximately 60% of therapeutic drugs. The [acidic](../../glossary#acidic) environment of the stomach allows I3C molecules to condense and generate a number of biologically active I3C oligomers (Figure 2). Drugs that block the production of stomach acids, like antacids, Histamine2 (H2) [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) [antagonists](../../glossary#antagonist), and proton-pump inhibitors, would likely prevent the generation of DIM and ICZ. However, it is not known whether these drugs limit the biological activities attributed to I3C and its derivatives [(95)](#reference95).

Toxicol [(PubMed)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12730619) Contents Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and kale, are rich sources of sulfur-containing compounds called glucosinolates (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables)). are biologically active [hydrolysis](../../glossary#hydrolysis) (breakdown) products of glucosinolates. Cruciferous vegetables contain a variety of glucosinolates, each of which forms a different isothiocyanate when hydrolyzed (Figure 1) [(1)](#references). For example, broccoli is a good source of glucoraphanin, the glucosinolate [precursor](../../glossary#precursor) precursor of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), while garden cress rich of benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). At present, scientists are interested in the cancer-preventive activities of vegetables that are rich in glucosinolates (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#cancer-prevention)), as well as individual isothiocyanates [(3)](#reference3). The [hydrolysis](../../glossary#hydrolysis) of glucosinolates, which is [catalyzed](../../glossary#catalyst) by a class of [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) called myrosinases (-thioglucosidases), leads to the formation of breakdown such thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, indoles, oxazolidine-2-thiones (e.g., on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables)). In intact plant cells, myrosinase is physically separated from glucosinolates. Yet, when plant cells are damaged, myrosinase is released and comes in contact with glucosinolates, catalyzing their conversion into highly reactive [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) that impart a pungent aroma and spicy (some say bitter) taste. Likewise, when raw cruciferous vegetables are chopped during the food preparation process, glucosinolates are rapidly hydrolyzed by myrosinase, generating metabolites that are then absorbed in the proximal intestine. In contrast, cooking cruciferous vegetables before consumption inactivates myrosinase, thus preventing the breakdown of glucosinolates. However, lightly cooking (i.e., light steam for <5 minutes) will preserve some of the myrosinase and allow for isothiocyanate conversion. A small fraction of intact glucosinolates may be absorbed in the [small intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine), but a large proportion reaches the [colon](../../glossary#colon) [(4)](#reference4). In the colon, myrosinase produced by the microbiota can catalyze the generation of a wide range of metabolites from glucosinolates, depending on the [pH](../../glossary#pH) and the presence of [cofactors](../../glossary#cofactor) [(4, 5)](#reference4). The hydrolysis of glucosinolates at neutral pH results in the formation of unique isothiocyanates (Figure 1). For example, sinigrin, glucoraphanin, isothiocyanates (like sulforaphane) are promptly [conjugated](../../glossary#conjugation) to [glutathione](../../glossary#glutathione) by a class of phase II detoxification [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) known as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in the liver, and then sequentially metabolized in the mercapturic acid pathway (Figure 2). This mechanism is meant to increase the solubility of isothiocyanates, thereby promoting a rapid [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) in the urine. Using sulforaphane as the model isothiocyanate, it has indeed been established that its metabolites \u2014 sulforaphane-glutathione, sulforaphane-cysteine-glycine, sulforaphane-cysteine, and sulforaphane N-acetylcysteine \u2014 collectively known as dithiocarbamates (Figure 2), are ultimately excreted in the urine [(4)](#reference4). The composition and content of glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables are relatively stable but depend on the genus and species and can vary with plant growing and post-harvest storage conditions and culinary processing [(6, 7)](#reference6). Since most [cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) are cooked prior to eating, [bacterial](../../glossary#bacteria) myrosinase in the gut, rather than plant myrosinase, is responsible for the initial step in glucosinolate degradation (Figure 2). In a feeding study involving 45 healthy subjects, the mean conversion rate of glucosinolates (of which 85% was glucoraphanin) to dithiocarbamates over a 24-hour period was estimated to be around 12% with wide variations among participants (range, 1.1 to 40.7%) [(6)](#reference6). In contrast, 70%-75% of ingested isothiocyanates were found to be [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) to dithiocarbamates. Therefore, following the ingestion of cooked cruciferous vegetables, the conversion of glucosinolates into isothiocyanates by gut bacteria appears to be a limiting step in the generation of dithiocarbamates [(6)](#reference6). However, differences in individuals' capacity to metabolize glucosinolates have not been linked to differences in gut [microbiota](../../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) composition [(8)](#reference8). Many isothiocyanates, particularly sulforaphane, have been shown to induce the expression of [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway [(9, 10)](#reference9). Briefly, Nrf2 is a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) that is bound to the protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the [cytosol](../../glossary#cytosol) (Figure 3). Keap1 responds to [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) signals or chemical inducers by freeing Nrf2. Isothiocyanates can react with sulfhydryl residues of Keap1, causing the release of Nrf2. Nrf2 can then translocate to the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) and bind to the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the [promoters](../../glossary#promoter) of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes and scavengers. Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes code for several mediators administered [ip](../../glossary#intraperitoneal-injection), [iv](../../glossary#intravenous), or [sc](../../glossary#subcutaneous), rather than [po](../../glossary#oral-administration)) was shown to exert protective effects on many tissues and organs by activating the Nrf2/ARE-dependent pathway [(12)](#reference12). For example, sulforaphane reduced contrast agent-induced kidney damage in rats by increasing Nrf2 nuclear translocation and upregulating the expression of HO-1 damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage)-induced vascular endothelial cell injury mouse model of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(14)](#reference14). In a rat model of hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury \u2014 whereby cellular damage is caused by the restoration of oxygen delivery to a hypoxic liver \u2014 pre-treatment with sulforaphane limited the reduction HO-1, and decreased ischemic death and [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) of liver cells [(15)](#reference15). Human studies are limited. In a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, oral sulforaphane (in the form of broccoli sprout homogenate) increased the expression of NQO-1 and HO-1 in the upper airway within two hours of ingestion [(16)](#reference16). Yet, in a recent trial in patients with [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](../../glossary#chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease) (COPD), oral administration of sulforaphane for four weeks failed to induce the expression of Nrf2, NQO-1, and HO-1 in alveolar macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells [(17)](#reference17). The therapeutic potential of sulforaphane has also been linked to its capacity to target pro- [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) pathways. Sulforaphane was found to attenuate [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) injury in a mouse model of acute pancreatitis by stimulating Nrf2-induced [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) [(18)](#reference18). Concomitantly, nuclear factor of NF-B target [genes](../../glossary#gene) that code for mediators, (TNF-), interleukin-1 (Figure 3) [(18)](#reference18). the NF-B pathway, sulforaphane also targets other mediators of the inflammatory response, including the enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Sulforaphane in the lungs of mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by downregulating the expression of NF-B, IL-6, TNF- and COX-2, as well as decreasing [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) and PGE2 [(19)](#reference19). Other isothiocyanates have been shown to prevent the degradation of the NF-B inhibitor, IB, the nuclear translocation activity of NF-B [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) or in cultured cells (Figure 3) [(20)](#reference20), which all can lead to a decrease in inflammatory responses. The modulation of Nrf2 and NF-B [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways by isothiocyanates is especially relevant to the prevention of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) because both [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) are significant contributors in the development and progression of cancer. [Biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) play important roles in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and elimination of a variety of chemicals, including drugs, toxins, and [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen). In general, phase I metabolizing enzymes [catalyze](../../glossary#catalyst) reactions that increase the reactivity of [hydrophobic](../../glossary#hydrophobic) (fat-soluble) compounds, preparing them for reactions catalyzed by phase II biotransformation enzymes. Reactions catalyzed by phase II enzymes generally increase water solubility and promote the elimination of the compound from the body [(21)](#reference21). Isothiocyanates have been found to modulate the activity of phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), especially those of the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family. Using a primary rat hepatocyte-based model, (e.g., sulforaphane, AITC) and aromatic (e.g., BITC, PEITC) have been found to downregulate CYP3A2 [mRNA](../../glossary#mRNA) expression, as well as the activity of benzyloxyquinoline debenzylase, a marker of CYP3As [(22)](#reference22). Aromatic able to upregulate CYP1A1 CYP1A2 mRNA expression and the activity of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), a marker of CYP1A1/2 activities [(22)](#reference22). In this model, sulforaphane inhibited EROD activity, yet failed to affect CYP1A1/2 mRNA expression [(22)](#reference22). Using human liver microsomes, it was also recently reported that sulforaphane [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (0-200 M) had little-to-no effect CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 [(23)](#reference23). The ability of PEITC to alter the expression and activity of CYP enzymes has been generally associated with a protective effect against (pro)carcinogen-induced tumor development in animal experiments (reviewed in [24](#reference24)). Increasing the activity of biotransformation enzymes may be beneficial if the elimination of potential [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) or toxins is enhanced. Yet, some [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen) require phase I enzymes in order to become active carcinogens capable of binding [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) and forming cancer-causing DNA adducts. Inhibition of specific CYP enzymes involved in carcinogen activation has been found to prevent the development of cancer in animal models [(3)](#reference3). Many isothiocyanates are potent inducers and [reactive oxygen species](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) [(25)](#reference25). The [genes](../../glossary#gene) for these and other phase II enzymes contain AREs and are therefore under the control of Nrf2 (see [Antioxidant activity](#antioxidant-activity)). Limited data from [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) suggest that glucosinolate-rich foods can increase phase II enzyme activity in humans. When smokers consumed 170 g/day of watercress, increased [(26)](#reference26). Brussels sprouts are rich in a number of glucosinolates, including [precursors](../../glossary#precursor) of AITC and sulforaphane. Consumption of 300 g/day (11 oz/day) of Brussels sprouts for one week significantly increased plasma and intestinal GST concentrations in nonsmoking men [(27, 28)](#reference27). After a cell divides, it passes through a sequence of stages \u2014 collectively known as the cell cycle \u2014 before dividing again. Following [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested to allow for DNA repair or activation of pathways leading to programmed cell death ( [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis)) when the damage cannot be repaired [(29)](#reference29). Defective cell cycle regulation and pro-survival mechanisms may result in the propagation of [mutations](../../glossary#mutation) that contribute to the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer). Isothiocyanates have been found to modulate the expression of the cell cycle regulators, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), as well as trigger apoptosis in a number of cancer cell lines [(20)](#reference20). In a mouse model of colorectal cancer, oral administration of PEITC reduced both the number and size of polyps; these changes were associated with activation of the CDK inhibitor, p21, inhibition of various of apoptosis [(30)](#reference30). In a transgenic [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) adenocarcinoma BITC limited the progress of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to a well-differentiated carcinoma [(31)](#reference31). This was related to a decreased expression of Ki67 (a marker of cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation)) and a downregulation of cyclin A, cyclin D1, and CDK2, which regulate cell cycle progression [(31)](#reference31). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes a process of epithelial cell transformation whereby cells lose their polarity and adhesion properties while gaining migratory and invasive properties through the expression of mesenchymal [genes](../../glossary#gene). Inhibition of the EMT by sulforaphane in [thyroid](../../glossary#thyroid) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells has been associated with upregulation of an epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and downregulation of a [transcription factor](../../glossary#transcription-factor) (SNAI2), various [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) (matrix metalloprotein [MMP]-2 and MMP-9) known to contribute to EMT and promote migration [(32)](#reference32). In a [xenograft](../../glossary#xenograft) mouse model of breast cancer, BITC inhibited high fat diet-driven promotion of breast tumor growth, as well as lung and liver [metastasis](../../glossary#metastasis) [(33)](#reference33). This study suggested that BITC might prevent the infiltration of [macrophages](../../glossary#macrophage) in the tumor environment [(33)](#reference33). In another model of breast tumor metastasis, PEITC inhibited the migration of tumor cells to the brain after injection into the heart of mice, limiting the growth of metastatic brain tumors [(34)](#reference34). To fuel their rapid growth, invasive tumors must also develop new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels by a process known as [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis). Isothiocyanates have been shown to prevent the formation of capillary-like structures from human umbilical endothelial cells (reviewed in [35](#reference35)). Isothiocyanates likely inhibit the expression and function of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) that control angiogenesis, as reported in endothelial cells and malignant cell lines [(35)](#reference35). In the [nucleus](../../glossary#nucleus) of a cell, [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) is coiled around [proteins](../../glossary#protein) called [histones](../../glossary#histone), thereby forming the [chromatin](../../glossary#chromatin). The N-terminal tails of histones are targets for poly ADP ribosylation, patterns have differential effects on chromatin structure, and, in synergy with DNA methylation, are implicated in the regulating expression of the [genome](../../glossary#genome) [(36)](#reference36). Within [gene](../../glossary#gene) regulatory regions, the acetylation of lysine residues of histone tails has been correlated with activation of [transcription](../../glossary#transcription). Conversely, the deacetylation of histone deacetylases (HDAC) access of [transcription factors](../../glossary#transcription-factor) to the DNA and suppresses transcription. Because abnormal epigenetic marks disrupt the expression of specific tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells, compounds that re-induce their transcription, like those inhibiting HDACs, can potentially promote [differentiation](../../glossary#differentiation) and [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) in transformed (precancerous) cells [(37)](#reference37). Isothiocyanates have been found to inhibit HDAC expression and/or activity in cultured cancer cells [(38-43)](#reference38). Moreover, [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) evidence for HDAC inhibition by sulforaphane from a mouse model using [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancer [xenografts](../../glossary#xenograft) [(44)](#reference44). In humans, HDAC activity was reduced in blood cells following ingestion of 68 g (one cup) of sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprouts [(44)](#reference44). Isothiocyanates may also affect [microRNA](../../glossary#microRNA)-mediated In bladder cancer cells, E-cadherin induction by sulforaphane was partly due to the upregulation of miR-200c expression resulting in the miR-200c-dependent inhibited androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells by repressing miR-141 expression and miR-141-mediated downregulation of small [heterodimer](../../glossary#heterodimer) partner (shp), repressor of AR [(46)](#reference46). Bacterial infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with a marked increase in the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [peptic ulcer disease](../../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease) and [gastric](../../glossary#gastric) cancer [(47)](#reference47). In the test tube and in tissue culture, purified sulforaphane inhibited the growth and killed multiple strains of H. pylori, including antibiotic resistant strains [(48)](#reference48). In an animal model of H. pylori infection, sulforaphane administration for five days eradicated H. pylori from 8 out of 11 [xenografts](../../glossary#xenograft) of human gastric tissue implanted in immune-compromised mice [(49)](#reference49). In another H. pylori-infected mouse model, a functional Nrf2 pathway was found to be required for the reduction of gastric [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) and infection in mice fed broccoli sprouts [(50)](#reference50). In a small [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial), consumption 56 g/day (2 oz/day) of glucoraphanin-rich broccoli sprouts for one week was associated with H. pylori eradication in only three out of nine gastritis patients [(51)](#reference51). In another trial, daily consumption of 70 g/day (~2-3 servings/day) of glucoraphanin-rich broccoli sprouts for two months significantly reduced markers of inflammation and infection in H. pylori-infected volunteers compared to those who consumed alfalfa sprouts [(50)](#reference50). However, the extent to which glucoraphanin was converted to sulforaphane in broccoli sprout-fed participants was not measured. Isothiocyanates are thought to play a prominent role in the potential anticancer and [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits associated with [cruciferous vegetable](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) consumption [(52, 53)](#reference52). Genetic variations in the sequence of [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for GSTs may affect the activity of GSTs. Such variations have been identified in humans. Specifically, null variants of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 [alleles](../../glossary#allele) contain large deletions, and individuals who inherit two copies of the GSTM1-null or GSTT1-null alleles cannot produce the corresponding GST [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) [(54)](#reference54). It has been proposed that a reduced GST activity in these individuals would slow the rate of [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of isothiocyanates, thereby increasing tissue exposure to isothiocyanates after cruciferous vegetable consumption [(55)](#reference55). In addition, GSTs are involved in \"detoxifying\" potentially harmful substances like [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen), suggesting that individuals with reduced GST activity might also be more susceptible to [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) [(56-58)](#reference56). Further, induction of the expression and activity of GSTs and other phase II detoxification/ [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) enzymes by isothiocyanates is an important defense mechanism against [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) associated with the development of diseases like cancer and [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(11)](#reference11). The ability of glucoraphanin-derived sulforaphane to reduce oxidative stress in different settings is linked to activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Yet, whether potential protection conferred by isothiocyanates via the Nrf2-dependent pathway is diminished in individuals carrying GST null variants is currently unknown. Some, but not all, [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have suggested that GST [genotypes](../../glossary#genotype) could influence the associations between cruciferous vegetable consumption and [risk](../../glossary#risk) of disease [(59)](#reference59). Naturally occurring isothiocyanates and their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) have been found to inhibit the development of chemically-induced cancers of the lung, liver, [esophagus](../../glossary#esophagus), stomach, [small intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine), [colon](../../glossary#colon), and breast in a variety of animal models [(20)](#reference20). Although observational studies provide some evidence that higher intakes of cruciferous vegetables are associated with decreased cancer risk in humans [(59)](#reference59), it is difficult to determine whether such protective effects are related to isothiocyanates or other factors associated with cruciferous vegetable consumption (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables#cancer-prevention)). Clinical evidence of a protective effect of isothiocyanates in humans is scarce. For example, in a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [cross-over intervention](../../glossary#cross-over-trial), administration of PEITC (40 mg/day for five days) caused a modest, yet significant, 7.7% reduction in the metabolic activation of the tobacco-specific lung carcinogen, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, in cigarette smokers [(60)](#reference60). Another [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in men with biochemically relapsing cancer after radical prostatectomy suggested that [prostate-specific antigen](../../glossary#prostate-specific-antigen) (PSA) values tended to increase less in those given daily oral sulforaphane (4.4 or 26.6 mg/day) for six months compared to those receiving the [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(61)](#reference61). In a recent [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), randomized, placebo-controlled trial in women with abnormal mammograms, two-to-eight week consumption of about 250 mg/day of broccoli seed extract (~220 mg of glucoraphanin/day) before surgery failed to affect the expression of markers of [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and gene expression, including ki-67, p21, HDACs, and acetylated in breast tissues collected surgery [(62)](#reference62). [Cruciferous vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables), such as bok choi, kale, kohlrabi, mustard, sources of isothiocyanates [(63)](#reference63). Unlike some other phytochemicals, glucosinolates are present in relatively high concentrations in commonly consumed portions of cruciferous vegetables. For example one-half cup of raw broccoli might provide more than 25 mg of total glucosinolates. The glucosinolate content of selected cruciferous vegetables is presented in Table 1 [(64)](#reference64). Note that while the composition and content of glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables are relatively stable, they depend on the genus and species and can vary greatly with plant growing and post-harvest storage conditions, as well as culinary processing. |Food (raw)||Serving||Total Glucosinolates g)|| | 98 |Mustard greens||\u00bd cup, chopped (28 g)|| | 79 |Turnip||\u00bd cup, cubes (65 g)|| | 60 |Cabbage, savoy||\u00bd cup, chopped (45 g)|| | 35 |Kale||1 cup, chopped (67 g)|| | 67 |Watercress||1 cup, chopped (34 g)|| | 32 |Kohlrabi||\u00bd cup, chopped (67 g)|| | 31 |Cabbage, red||\u00bd cup, chopped (45 g)|| | 29 |Broccoli||\u00bd cup, chopped (44 g)|| | 27 |Horseradish||1 tablespoon (15 g)|| | 24 |Cauliflower||\u00bd cup, chopped (50 g)|| | 22 |Bok choy (pak choi)||\u00bd cup, chopped (35 g)|| | 19 Table 2 lists vegetables that are relatively good sources of some of the isothiocyanates that are currently being studied for their isothiocyanates formed from glucosinolates in foods are variable and depend partly on food processing and preparation (see the article on [Cruciferous Vegetables](../../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables)). In a recent study that examined total isothiocyanate content in 73 samples from nine types of raw cruciferous vegetables commonly consumed in the US (namely broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprout, kale, collard green, mustard green, and turnip greens), an average yield of 16.2 \u00b5mol/100 g wet weight was reported, with a 41-fold difference of isothiocyanate yield across the vegetables. The lowest mean level of isothiocyanate yield was found with raw cauliflower (1.5 \u00b5mol/100 g), while raw mustard greens had the highest yield (61.3 \u00b5mol/100g) [(66)](#reference66). The amount of glucoraphanin, the [precursor](../../glossary#precursor) of sulforaphane, in broccoli seeds remains more or less constant as those seeds germinate and grow into mature plants. Thus, three-day old broccoli sprouts are concentrated sources of glucoraphanin, which contain 10 to 100 times more glucoraphanin by weight than mature broccoli plants [(67)](#reference67). Broccoli sprouts that are certified to contain at least 73 mg of glucoraphanin (also called sulforaphane glucosinolate) per 1-oz serving are available in some health food and grocery stores. Dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing extracts of broccoli sprouts, broccoli, and other cruciferous vegetables are available without a prescription. Some products are standardized to contain a minimum amount of glucosinolates and/or sulforaphane. However, the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of isothiocyanates was found to be much lower with the consumption of broccoli supplements devoid of myrosinase than with the consumption of fresh broccoli sprouts. Peak concentrations of sulforaphane [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) were found to be eight- and five-times greater in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) and urine, respectively, following fresh broccoli versus supplement consumption [(68)](#reference68). Interestingly, total HDAC activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of broccoli sprout consumers was reported to be significantly lower than in PBMC of subjects who consumed the supplement (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)) [(69)](#reference69). No serious adverse effects of isothiocyanates in humans have been reported. The majority of animal studies have found that isothiocyanates inhibited the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) when given prior to the chemical [carcinogen](../../glossary#carcinogen) (pre-initiation). However, very high intakes of PEITC or BITC (25 to 250 times higher than average human dietary isothiocyanate intakes) have been found to promote bladder cancer in rats when given after cancer initiation by a chemical carcinogen [(70)](#reference70). The relevance of these findings to human urinary bladder cancer is not clear, since at least one [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found cruciferous vegetable consumption to be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of bladder cancer in men [(71)](#reference71). Other potential toxic effects reported in rodents have not been corroborated by observations in humans [(20)](#reference20). Although high dietary intakes of glucosinolates from cruciferous vegetables are not known to have adverse effects during pregnancy or lactation, there is no information on the safety of purified isothiocyanates or [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing high doses of glucosinolates and/or isothiocyanates during pregnancy or lactation in humans. Isothiocyanates are not known to interact with any drugs or medications. However, the potential for isothiocyanates to inhibit various isoforms of the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) (CYP) family of [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) raises the potential for interactions with drugs that are CYP substrates (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Isothiocyanates may sensitize [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells to anticancer drugs and/or increase drug cytotoxicity, as shown in [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) and animal models. Yet, these potential benefits of isothiocyanates in cancer therapy have not been explored in clinical trials [(72)](#reference72).

Expert Opin The enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone (Figure 1), are formed by the action of intestinal [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) on lignan [precursors](../../glossary#precursor) found in plants [(1)](#references). Because enterodiol and enterolactone can mimic some of the effects of [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen), their plant-derived precursors are classified as [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogens). Lignan precursors that have been identified in the human diet include pinoresinol, lariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and others (Figure 2). Secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were among the first lignan precursors identified in the human diet and are therefore the most extensively studied. Lignan precursors are found in a wide variety of foods, including flaxseeds, sesame seeds, [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), [whole grains](../../food-beverages/whole-grains), fruit, and vegetables. While most research on phytoestrogen-rich diets has focused on [soy isoflavones](../phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones), lignans are the principal source of dietary phytoestrogens in the typical Western diet [(2, 3)](#reference2). When plant lignans are ingested, they can be by intestinal [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) to the enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, in the intestinal [lumen](../../glossary#lumen) and then absorbed into the bloodstream [(4)](#reference4). Enterodiol can also be converted to enterolactone by intestinal bacteria. Thus, enterolactone levels measured in blood and urine reflect the activity of intestinal bacteria in addition to dietary intake of plant lignans. Not surprisingly, antibiotic use has been associated with lower [serum](../../glossary#serum) enterolactone concentrations [(5)](#reference5). Because data on the lignan content of foods are limited, blood and urinary enterolactone levels are sometimes used as markers of dietary lignan intake. A [pharmacokinetic](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) study that measured [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) and urinary levels of enterodiol and enterolactone after a single dose (0.9 mg/kg of body weight) of secoisolariciresinol, the principal lignan in flaxseed, found that at least 40% was available to the body as enterodiol and enterolactone [(6)](#reference6). Plasma enterodiol concentrations peaked at 73 nanomoles/liter (nmol/L) an average of 15 hours after ingestion of secoisolariciresinol, and plasma enterolactone concentrations peaked at 56 nmol/L an average of 20 hours after ingestion. Thus, substantial amounts of ingested plant lignans are available to humans in the form of enterodiol and enterolactone. Considerable variation among individuals in urinary and serum enterodiol:enterolactone ratios has been observed in flaxseed feeding studies, suggesting that some individuals convert most enterodiol to enterolactone, while others convert relatively little [(1)](#references). Individual differences in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of lignans, likely due to differing composition and activities of gut microbes, can influence the biological activities and health effects of these compounds [(7)](#reference7). Several other factors, including antibiotic use, age, [BMI](../../glossary#body-mass-index), and smoking, may also help explain the variation of circulating enterolignan concentrations among individuals [(7)](#reference7); these and other potential [confounding factors](../../glossary#confounder) should be controlled for in [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study). [Estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen) are [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling) molecules (i.e., [hormones](../../glossary#hormone)) that exert their effects by binding to estrogen [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) within cells (Figure 3). The estrogen-receptor complex interacts [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) to change the [expression](../../glossary#gene-expression) of estrogen-responsive [genes](../../glossary#gene). Estrogen receptors are present in numerous tissues other than those associated with reproduction, including bone, liver, heart, and brain [(8)](#reference8). Although [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) can also bind to estrogen receptors, their estrogenic activity is much weaker than [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogens, and they may actually block or antagonize the effects of estrogen in some tissues [(9)](#reference9). Scientists are interested in the tissue-selective activities of phytoestrogens because anti-estrogenic effects in reproductive tissue could help reduce the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of hormone-associated [cancers](../../glossary#cancer) (breast, uterine, ovarian, and [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) cancers), while estrogenic effects in bone could help maintain [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density). The enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, are known to have weak estrogenic activity. At present, the extent to which enterolignans exert weak estrogenic and/or anti-estrogenic effects in humans is not well understood. Enterolignans have biological activities that are unrelated to their interactions with [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) [receptors](../../glossary#receptor). By altering the activity of [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) involved in estrogen [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism), lignans may change the biological activity of [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogens [(10)](#reference10). Lignans have also been shown to display [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity in laboratory studies [(11)](#reference11), although the significance in humans is not entirely clear since lignans are rapidly and extensively metabolized. For example, a [cross-sectional study](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study) found that a with [serum](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#serum) enterolactone concentrations in men [(12)](#reference12), but this association could be due to enterolactone and/or other antioxidants present in lignan-rich foods. Moreover, enterolignans may have anti-inflammatory properties, as well as anti-proliferative and anticancer activities that are independent of estrogen signaling [(13-15)](#reference13). Diets in foods and seeds, [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), and [fruit vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables)) have been consistently associated with reductions in [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardioavascular-disease). However, it is likely that numerous nutrients and [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) found in these foods contribute to their cardioprotection. Higher dietary intakes of two lignans, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, were not linked to total cardiovascular disease in 16,162 middle-aged and older women participating in the Dutch PROSPECT European Prospective study Into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study [(16)](#reference16). A large [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted within Spain's PREDIMED trial \u2014 a trial evaluating the effects of a Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular disease outcomes \u2014 followed 7,172 older adults at high risk of cardiovascular disease for a mean of 4.3 years [(17)](#reference17). In this study, the highest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of dietary lignan intake (mean intake, 0.94 mg/day), measured by a [food frequency questionnaire](../../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) at baseline, was associated with a 49% lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease compared to the lowest quintile (mean intake, 0.44 mg/day of lignans). The primary dietary source of lignans in this cohort was virgin olive oil [(17)](#reference17), which itself is known to be cardioprotective. In a prospective, [nested case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) in 334 middle-aged Finnish men, followed for an average of 7.7 years, higher [serum](../../glossary#serum) enterolactone concentrations (a marker of plant lignan intake) were associated with a lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of acute [coronary](../../glossary#coronary-artery) events [(18)](#reference18). A [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 1,889 Finnish men followed for an average of 12 years, found those with the highest serum enterolactone concentrations were significantly less likely to die from [coronary heart disease](../../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) or [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardioavascular-disease) than those with the lowest concentrations [(19)](#reference19). However, a study in male smokers did not find strong support for an association between serum enterolactone concentration and CHD [(20)](#reference20). Additionally, a nested case-control study in men and women residing in the Netherlands did not find association between [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of enterolactone or enterodiol and nonfatal [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (236 cases and 283 controls), although the study population was young (ages 20-59 at baseline) and followed for only a mean of 4.5 years [(21)](#reference21). A 2017 [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of three of these studies found no association between blood enterolactone concentration and non-fatal myocardial infarction [(22)](#reference22). Moreover, dietary lignan intake was not linked to coronary cardiovascular disease in women participating in the Dutch PROSPECT EPIC study [(16)](#reference16). Clinical trials of lignan [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) would be needed to determine the effects of lignans on coronary heart disease. Blood lipids. Flaxseeds are among the richest sources of plant lignans in the human diet, but they are also good sources of other nutrients and [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytochemical) with cardioprotective effects, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](../../other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids) (i.e., -linolenic acid) and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber). [Supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) trials have generally used ground or milled flaxseed (i.e., flax meal), which has a higher [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of enterolignans compared to whole flaxseed [(23)](#reference23). Five small [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found that adding 30 to 50 g/day of flaxseed to the usual diet for 4 to 12 weeks resulted in modest 8%-20% decreases in low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentration [(24-28)](#reference24), but four other trials did not observe significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol after adding 30 to 40 g/day of flaxseed to the diet [(29-32)](#reference29). A [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) controlled trial in adults, ages 44 to 75 years, found that supplementation with 40 g/day of flaxseed led to significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol after five weeks, but the cholesterol reductions were not statistically significant following 10 weeks' supplementation [(33)](#reference33). Additionally, a one-year clinical trial in postmenopausal women reported that supplementation with 40 g/day of flaxseed did not lower LDL-cholesterol compared to a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) containing wheat germ [(34)](#reference34). Most of these trials were in healthy participants free of cardiovascular disease. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 84 patients with peripheral artery disease, 30 g/day of flaxseed for 12 months did not reduce total or LDL-cholesterol compared to placebo, although cholesterol reductions within the flaxseed-supplemented group were evident at 1 month and 6 months compared to baseline but not at 12 months [(35)](#reference35). Any effect of flaxseed supplementation on blood lipids might be attributed to flaxseed constituents other than lignans (i.e., protein, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, phytochemicals). At least two trials have investigated the effect of supplementation with isolated flaxseed lignan. In mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside \u2014 derived from flaxseed \u2014 had no effect on LDL-cholesterol concentration or other measured blood lipids despite significant increases in [serum](../../glossary#serum) enterolactone concentration [(36)](#reference36). Additionally, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial in 68 patients with type 2 diabetes and mild hypercholesterolemia found no effect of 360 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside for 12 weeks on concentration of blood cholesterol or other blood lipids [(37)](#reference37). Large-scale supplementation trials with isolated lignans would be needed to determine whether lignans have cholesterol-lowering effects. Blood pressure. A 2016 [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) pooled the results of 15 [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design) controlled trials, some in healthy participants and some in participants with chronic disease (i.e., type 2 [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [metabolic syndrome](../../glossary#metabolic-syndrome), [peripheral arterial with flaxseed was linked to a 2.9 [mm Hg](../../glossary#mm-Hg) reduction in [systolic blood pressure](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and a 2.4 mm Hg reduction in [diastolic blood pressure](../../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure); these blood pressure reductions were greater in trials of longer duration (12 weeks vs. <12 weeks; [38](#reference38)). Additionally, data stratification by supplement type revealed a benefit of supplemental flaxseed powder but not of lignan extracts containing 360 to 600 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside [(38)](#reference38), suggesting the non-lignan constituents of flaxseed may be responsible for any blood pressure-lowering effects. Overall, there is limited evidence that dietary intake of plant lignans is associated with breast cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk); studies on the association have reported conflicting results. Two [prospective cohort studies](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#prospective%20study) examining plant lignan intake and breast cancer found no association [(39, 40)](#reference39). A more recent prospective study reported no association between total lignan intake and breast cancer in premenopausal women [(41)](#reference41). In another prospective analysis, the same group of authors found postmenopausal women in the highest [quartile](../../glossary#quartile) of dietary lignan intake had a 17% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women in the lowest quartile, but this protective association was only observed in women with [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen)-positive and progesterone-positive tumors [(42)](#reference42). A prospective cohort study of 51,823 postmenopausal Swedish women, followed for an average of 8.3 years, found that women in the highest quartile of lignan intake (1,036 mg/day) had a 17% lower risk of invasive breast tumors compared to those in the lowest quartile (lignan intake <712 mg/day) [(43)](#reference43). In this study, a strong inverse association of lignan intake and breast cancer risk was observed in women who had used postmenopausal hormones at some point in their life, but no association was evident in those who had never used such hormones [(43)](#reference43). A 2009 [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) did not find an overall association between dietary lignan intake and breast cancer, but when the analysis was limited to postmenopausal women, the authors reported a 15% reduction in risk of breast cancer with high lignan intake [(44)](#reference44). A similar result was found in a subsequent meta-analysis that included 11 prospective cohort and 10 [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study): no association of lignan intake and breast cancer was observed in women overall, but data stratification by menopausal status revealed that the highest lignan intakes were associated with a 14% lower risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women (13 studies; [45](#reference45)). Several studies, mainly case-control studies, have examined the relationship between blood or urine concentrations of enterolactone and breast cancer, reporting conflicting results [(46-48)](#reference46). Two meta-analyses did not find an association between blood concentrations of enterolactone and breast cancer [(44, 45)](#reference44). At present, it is not clear whether high intakes of plant lignans or high circulating levels of enterolignans offer significant protection against breast cancer. [Randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of lignan [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) would be needed to address this question. Overall, there is limited evidence that dietary lignan intake or circulating enterolignan concentration (a marker of lignan intake) is associated with [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) or ovarian cancer. In a [case-control study](../../glossary#case-control-study) of lignans and endometrial cancer, US women with the highest intakes of plant lignans had the lowest [risk](../../glossary#risk) of endometrial cancer, but the reduction in risk was statistically significant in postmenopausal women only [(49)](#reference49). However, two population-based, case-control studies, one conducted in the US [(50)](#reference50) and one in Australia [(51)](#reference51), found dietary lignan intake was not linked to endometrial cancer. Moreover, a prospective case-control study in three different countries (US, Sweden, and Italy) did not find an association between circulating enterolactone and endometrial cancer in premenopausal or in postmenopausal women [(52)](#reference52). A large case-cohort study among Danish women, ages 50-64 years, also reported no association of [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) enterolactone concentration and endometrial cancer [(53)](#reference53). In an early case-control study among US women ages 40 to 85 years, those with the highest combined intakes of the lignans, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol, had the lowest risk of ovarian cancer \u2014 intakes greater than 708 mg/day of these lignans were associated with a 57% lower risk of ovarian cancer compared with intakes less than 304 mg/day [(54)](#reference54). A case-control study in Australia reported no association of total dietary lignans and risk of ovarian cancer but found a significant, inverse association of matairesinol and lariciresinol, individually, with ovarian cancer [(51)](#reference51). However, two other studies, a population-based case-control study in the US [(55)](#reference55) and a [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in Sweden [(56)](#reference56) found no relationship between dietary lignan intake and ovarian cancer. Although some of these studies support the [hypothesis](../../glossary#hypothesis) that diets rich in plant foods may be helpful in decreasing the risk of hormone-associated cancers, they do not provide strong evidence that lignans in particular are protective against endometrial or ovarian cancer. Several [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have examined the association between dietary lignan intake or circulating enterolignan concentration (a marker of lignan intake) and [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), with most reporting no association. A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of three studies (two population-based, [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) and one [nested case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study)) found was not linked to prostate cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) [(57)](#reference57). Moreover, a meta-analysis of nested case-control studies did not find circulating concentration of enterolactone (total of 2,828 cases and 5,593 controls pooled from five studies) or enterodiol (total of 1,002 cases and 1,197 controls pooled from two studies) to be associated with prostate cancer [(58)](#reference58). Yet another meta-analysis found no association between dietary lignan intake (total lignans, or matairesinol or secoisolariciresinol, separately) or circulating enterolactone concentration and prostate cancer risk [(59)](#reference59). While adherence to a plant-based diet may be linked to a lower risk of prostate cancer [(60)](#reference60), evidence that dietary lignans are protective is lacking. Research on the effects of dietary lignan intake on [osteoporosis](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#osteoporosis) [risk](../../glossary#risk) is very limited. In a [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 2,580 postmenopausal women and 4,973 men enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) study, dietary intake of matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol was not associated with bone density, when assessed by ultrasound of the heel bone [(61)](#reference61). In two much smaller [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study), urinary enterolactone [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) was used as a marker of dietary lignan intake. One study of 75 postmenopausal Korean women, who were classified as osteoporotic, [osteopenic](../../glossary#osteopenia), or normal on the basis of [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) measurements, found that urinary enterolactone positively with BMD of the [lumbar spine](../../glossary#lumbar-spine) and hip [(62)](#reference62). However, a study of 50 postmenopausal Dutch women found that higher levels of urinary enterolactone excretion were associated with higher rates of bone loss [(63)](#reference63). In two separate [placebo](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#placebo) controlled trials, [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) of postmenopausal women with 25 to 40 g/day of ground flaxseed for three to four months did not significantly alter biochemical markers of bone formation or bone [resorption](../../glossary#resorption) (loss) [(31](#reference31), [64)](#reference64). In a placebo-controlled trial that included a daily walking intervention in both groups of older adults, supplementation with a flaxseed lignan complex (containing 543 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol) for six months had no effect on bone mineral density measured by [DXA](../../glossary#DXA) [(65)](#reference65). More research is necessary to determine whether high dietary intakes of plant lignans can decrease the risk or severity of osteoporosis. More than 10% of the US population has type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and another 35% has [impaired glucose control](../../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) (prediabetes) that places them at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) of developing type 2 diabetes [(66)](#reference66). A number of dietary [polyphenols](../../glossary#polyphenolic-compound) found in plant-based foods may affect [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and thus aid in the prevention or management of the condition. A few [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have examined the association of lignan intake and incidence of diabetes. A [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in 6,547 Iranian adults, followed for a mean of 3.0 years, reported an [inverse association](../../glossary#inverse-association) between dietary lignan intake (measured by [food frequency questionnaire](../../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire)) and incidence of type 2 diabetes [(67)](#reference67). In particular, this study found the highest versus lowest [quartile](../../glossary#quartile) of lignan intake (median of 9.1 mg/day vs. 1.6 mg/day) to be associated with a 40% lower risk of type 2 diabetes [(67)](#reference67). However, no association between lignan intake (highest vs. lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of intake, median of 2.3 mg/day vs. 0.6 mg/day) and type 2 diabetes was reported in a prospective, case-cohort study conducted in Europe that included more than 15,000 adults (EPIC-InterAct; [68](#reference68)). Studies that utilize [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of lignan intake, such as urinary concentrations of enterodiol or enterolactone, provide a more accurate estimate of lignan intake compared to self-reported questionnaires [(69)](#reference69). A prospective, [nested case-control study](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) of two cohorts of US women participating in the Nurses' Health Study (NHSI with mean age of 66 years and NHSII with mean age of 45 years) found lower concentrations of enterodiol and enterolactone in diabetic case subjects than in controls [(70)](#reference70). Upon adjustment for potential [confounders](../../glossary#confounder), only higher concentrations of urinary enterolactone were associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and this was driven by a significant association in the younger cohort of women [(70)](#reference70). A nested case-control study within men and women participating in the Singapore Chinese Health Study (mean age, 59.8 years) reported no association between urinary enterodiol or enterolactone and type 2 diabetes [(71)](#reference71). Because higher lignan intakes may be a marker of a healthy diet in general, randomized controlled trials of lignan [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) in healthy individuals would inform whether lignans affect glucose homeostasis and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hypercholesterolemic individuals found that lignan extract containing 600 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside decreased fasting glucose concentrations compared to placebo, and the effect was stronger in those with higher baseline glucose concentrations [(72)](#reference72). Supplementation with an extract containing 300 mg/day of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside had no effect on fasting glucose concentrations [(72)](#reference72). A few studies have examined whether dietary lignan intake is related to all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) investigated the relationship between lignan intake and all-cause mortality in 40,622 adults (ages 29-70 years) [(73)](#reference73). After a mean follow-up of 13.6 years, dietary lignan intake was not associated with all-cause mortality [(73)](#reference73). Additionally, dietary lignan intake was not linked to all-cause mortality in a much smaller study that followed 570 older Dutch men for 15 years [(74)](#reference74). In this study, an inverse association was observed for intake of a specific lignan, matairesinol, with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related mortality, including death from coronary heart disease, although wine consumption modified these associations [(74)](#reference74). However, an analysis of a 4.8-year trial that investigated the health effects of a Mediterranean diet in 7,172 older adults at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for cardiovascular disease (the PREDIMED trial in Spain) revealed that those in the highest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of lignan intake (mean of 0.94 mg/day) had a 40% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to the lowest quintile (mean of 0.44 mg/day of lignans; [75](#reference75)). A found no association of lignan intake with all-cause mortality (3 studies mentioned above) or with mortality related to cardiovascular disease (2 studies; [76](#reference76)). Other studies have assessed whether blood or urinary [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of lignan intake are associated with mortality. In a prospective cohort study of 1,889 healthy, middle-aged Finnish men, followed for a mean of 12.2 years, the highest quartile of [serum](../../glossary#serum) enterolactone concentration was associated with a 56% lower risk of [coronary heart disease](../../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease)-related mortality and a 45% lower risk of cardiovascular disease-related mortality; no association of serum enterlactone and all-cause mortality was found in this study [(19)](#reference19). However, serum enterolactone was not associated with coronary death in a case-cohort study in Finnish male smokers [(20)](#reference20). In a national cross-sectional survey of US adults (NHANES 1999-2004), those in the highest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of urinary total enterolignan concentration had a lower risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality, and those with the highest urinary enterolactone concentrations had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality [(77)](#reference77). These measures were not associated with mortality from cancer in this analysis, and urinary enterodiol concentration was not related to any of the mortality endpoints [(77)](#reference77). A 2017 meta-analysis that combined results of these studies of lignan biomarkers found that enterolactone was inversely associated with both cardiovascular disease-related mortality and all-cause mortality [(22)](#reference22). Most recently, a case-cohort study within the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort found that higher pre-diagnostic [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of enterolactone were linked to a lower risk of all-cause and diabetes-specific mortality among adults with type 2 diabetes [(78)](#reference78). Lignans are present in a wide variety of plant foods, including seeds (flax, pumpkin, sunflower, poppy, sesame), [whole grains](../../food-beverages/whole-grains) (rye, oats, barley), bran (wheat, oat, rye), beans, fruit (particularly berries), vegetables, and beverages like tea, coffee, and wine [(47](#reference47), [79, 80)](#reference79). Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, total dietary lignan intakes, although this varies with dietary pattern [(80)](#reference80). Flaxseed is by far the richest dietary source of plant lignans [(81)](#reference81), and lignan [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) can be improved by crushing or milling flaxseed [(23)](#reference23). Lignans are not associated with the oil fraction of foods, so flaxseed oils do not typically provide lignans unless ground flaxseed has been added to the oil. A variety of factors may affect the lignan content of plants, including geographic location, climate, maturity, and storage conditions. Table 1 provides the total lignan (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, and lariciresinol) content [(82)](#reference82). The [Phenol-Explorer (version 3.6) database](http://phenol-explorer.eu/) lists content of 25 different lignans in various foods. Surveys have found median total lignan intake to be 0.98 mg/day in the 0.76 mg/day in [(85)](#reference85). Plant lignans are the principal source of [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) in the diets of people who do not typically consume soy foods. The daily phytoestrogen intake of postmenopausal women in the US was estimated to be less than 1 mg/day, with 80% chopped|| |Apricots||\u00bd cup, | cup, chopped|| |Strawberries||\u00bd | (4 oz)|| | 0.2 rye bread||1 slice|| | 0.1 Dietary [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) containing lignans derived from flaxseed are available in the US without a prescription [(87)](#reference87); secoisolariciresinol is the primary lignan in such supplements [(82)](#reference82). Lignan [precursors](../../glossary#precursor) in food are not known to have any serious adverse effects. Flaxseeds, which are rich in lignan precursors as well as [dietary fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber), may increase stool frequency or cause diarrhea in doses of 45 to 50 g/day in adults [(24](#reference24), [88)](#reference88). One small, [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study found that 50 mg/day of sesame lignans (1:1 mixture of sesamin and episesamin) for 28 days did not result in any serious adverse effects, although abdominal flatulence was associated with the sesame lignan supplementation [(89)](#reference89). The safety of lignan [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in pregnant or lactating women has not been established; therefore, lignan supplements should be avoided by women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or trying to conceive.

In addition to being rich in [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber) and plant [protein](../../glossary#protein), the diets of our ancestors were also rich in phytosterols \u2014 plant-derived compounds that are structurally very similar to [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) (Figure 1). There is increasing evidence to suggest that the reintroduction of plant foods providing phytosterols into the modern diet could improve [serum](../../glossary#serum) [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) (cholesterol) profiles and help reduce the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(1)](#references). Cholesterol in human blood and tissues is derived from the diet, as well as from [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) cholesterol [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis). In contrast, all phytosterols in human blood and tissues are derived from the diet because humans cannot synthesize phytosterols [(2)](#reference2). While cholesterol is the predominant sterol in animals, including humans, a variety of sterols are found in plants [(3)](#reference3). Nutritionists recognize two classes of phytosterols: (1) Plant sterols have a double bond in the sterol ring. The most abundant sterols in plants and the human diet are -sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol (Figure 2). (2) Plant stanols lack a double bond in the sterol ring. Stanols, especially sitostanol and campestanol, comprise only about 10% of total dietary phytosterols (Figure 3). Phytosterols: a collective term for plant-derived sterols and stanols. Plant sterols or stanols: to plant-derived sterols or stanols; these [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytochemical) are added to food or supplements. Plant sterol or stanol esters: plant sterols or stanols that have been esterified by creating an [ester](../../glossary#ester) bond between a [fatty acid](../../glossary#fatty-acid) and the sterol or stanol. Esterification occurs in intestinal cells and is also an industrial process. Esterification makes plant sterols and stanols more fat-soluble so they are easily incorporated into fat-containing foods, including margarines and salad dressings. In this article, the weights of plant sterol and stanol esters are expressed as the equivalent weights of free (unesterified) sterols and stanols. Dietary [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) must be incorporated into mixed [micelles](../../glossary#micelle) in order to be absorbed by the cells that line the intestine ( [enterocytes](../../glossary#enterocyte)) [(4)](#reference4). Mixed micelles are mixtures formed in the [small intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine) after a fat-containing meal is consumed. Transport across the apical membrane of enterocytes is mediated by intestinal cholesterol transporter, Niemann Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is also involved in the uptake of phytosterols [(5)](#reference5). Inside the enterocyte, cholesterol is esterified in a reaction [catalyzed](../../glossary#catalyst) by intestinal acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs; also present in the liver) and incorporated into [triglyceride](../../glossary#triglycerides)-rich [lipoproteins](../../glossary#lipoprotein) known as [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicrons), which are secreted into the intestinal lymphatics. The thoracic lymphatic duct then collects most of the lymph before draining into the systemic blood circulation [(6)](#reference6). As circulating chylomicrons become depleted of triglycerides, they become chylomicron remnants, which are taken up by the liver. In the liver, cholesterol from chylomicron remnants may be repackaged into other lipoproteins for transport throughout the circulation or, alternatively, secreted into [bile](../../glossary#bile), which is released into the small intestine. Although varied diets typically contain similar amounts of phytosterols and [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol), [serum](../../glossary#serum) phytosterol concentrations are usually several hundred times lower than serum cholesterol concentrations in humans [(7)](#reference7). Less than 5% of dietary plant sterols and less than 0.5% of dietary plant stanols are systemically absorbed, in contrast to about 50%-60% of dietary cholesterol [(8, 9)](#reference8). Like cholesterol, phytosterols must be incorporated into mixed [micelles](../../glossary#micelle) before they are taken up by [enterocytes](../../glossary#enterocyte). Once inside the enterocyte, systemic absorption of phytosterols is inhibited by the activity of an efflux transporter, consisting of a pair of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) [proteins](../../glossary#protein) known as ABCG5 and ABCG8. ABCG5 and ABCG8 each form one half of a transporter that secretes phytosterols and unesterified cholesterol from the enterocyte into the intestinal [lumen](../../glossary#lumen). Phytosterols are secreted back into the intestine by ABCG5/G8 transporters at a much greater rate than cholesterol, resulting in much lower intestinal absorption of dietary phytosterols than cholesterol [(10)](#reference10). Within the enterocyte, phytosterols are not as readily esterified as cholesterol, so they are incorporated into [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicrons) at much lower concentrations. Those phytosterols that are incorporated into chylomicrons enter the circulation and are taken up by the liver. Once inside the liver, phytosterols are rapidly secreted into [bile](../../glossary#bile) by hepatic ABCG5/G8 transporters. Although cholesterol is also secreted into bile, the rate of phytosterol secretion into bile is much greater than cholesterol secretion [(11)](#reference11). Thus, the low serum concentrations of phytosterols relative to cholesterol can be explained by decreased intestinal absorption and increased [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of phytosterols into bile. It is well established that high intakes of plant sterols or stanols concentrations in humans (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)). Different mechanisms appear to underlie the cholesterol-lowering effect of phytosterols (reviewed in [12](#reference12)). In the intestinal [lumen](../../glossary#lumen), phytosterols displace cholesterol from mixed [micelles](../../glossary#micelle) and reduce cholesterol absorption [(13)](#reference13). It is also suggested that phytosterols might interfere with the esterification and incorporation of cholesterol into [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicrons) inside the [enterocytes](../../glossary#enterocyte) [(12)](#reference12). In a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [cross-over trial](../../glossary#cross-over-trial), (0.46 g/day) and high (2.1 g/day) phytosterol-enriched beverages reduced cholesterol absorption by about 10% and 25%, respectively [(14)](#reference14). Moderate and high phytosterol intakes also significantly increased the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of [biliary](../../glossary#bile) and dietary cholesterol in the feces by 36% and 74%, respectively [(14)](#reference14). Although the mechanisms are currently not clear, phytosterols might facilitate cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues and [macrophages](../../glossary#macrophage) lining vessel walls. Cholesterol is then transported to the liver and incorporated into [bile](../../glossary#bile) stored in the [gallbladder](../../glossary#gallbladder). While plant sterols may promote the hepatobiliary secretion of cholesterol into the intestinal lumen, they are also [hypothesized](../../glossary#hypothesis) to facilitate the disposal of cholesterol via a nonbiliary route called transintestinal cholesterol efflux (TICE) [(12)](#reference12). A decrease in intestinal-derived [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) entering the circulation as [chylomicrons](../../glossary#chylomicrons) triggers the [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) production of cholesterol in order to maintain cholesterol [homeostasis](../../glossary#homeostasis) [(14)](#reference14). Cell surface [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) expression is also up-regulated to enhance a receptor-mediated uptake of circulating LDL-cholesterol into cells [(15)](#reference15). This process results in an increased clearance of circulating LDL from the blood. Within the cells, LDL particles are dismantled in [lysosomes](../../glossary#lysosome) and cholesterol becomes available for metabolic needs. Through inhibiting the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, LDL and LDL-derived cholesterol then suppress the [transcription](../../glossary#transcription) of the [genes](../../glossary#gene) coding for 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and other [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) involved in the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) of cholesterol and of the LDL-receptor [(16)](#reference16). The net result is the maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis within tissues (especially in the liver) and a reduction in [serum](../../glossary#serum) LDL-cholesterol concentration. Of note, some individuals with low intestinal cholesterol absorption efficiency [(17)](#reference17) and/or high basal cholesterol synthesis rate [(18)](#reference18) have been found to be poorly responsive to phytosterol therapy (reviewed in [19](#reference19)). Experiments in cell culture and animal models have suggested that phytosterols might have biological activities unrelated to cholesterol lowering. However, their significance in humans is not yet known. [Cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) is an important structural component of mammalian [cell membranes](../../glossary#cell-membrane) [(20)](#reference20). Displacement of cholesterol with phytosterols has been found to alter the physical properties of cell membranes [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(21)](#reference21), which [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) activity [(22, 23)](#reference22). Limited evidence from an animal model of [hemorrhagic stroke](../../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) suggested that very high intakes of phytosterols could displace cholesterol in red blood cell membranes, resulting in decreased deformability and potentially increased fragility [(24, 25)](#reference24). However, daily phytosterol supplementation (1 g/1,000 kcal) for four weeks did not alter red blood cell fragility in humans [(26)](#reference26). Limited evidence from animal studies suggests that very high phytosterol intake could alter testosterone [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) by inhibiting 5--reductase, a membrane-bound [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) dihydrotestosterone, a more potent [metabolite](../../glossary#metabolite) [(27, 28)](#reference27). It is not known whether phytosterol consumption alters testosterone metabolism in humans. No significant changes in free or total [serum](../../glossary#serum) testosterone concentrations were observed in men who consumed 1.6 g/day of plant sterol [esters](../../glossary#ester) for one year [(29)](#reference29). Phytosterols have been found to inhibit [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation), induce [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis), and reduce invasiveness of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells in culture (reviewed in [30](#reference30)). There is currently little evidence to suggest that phytosterol consumption could substantially contribute to lower the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of cancer in humans (see [Cancer](#cancer-prevention)). Limited data from cell culture and animal studies suggest that phytosterols may attenuate the [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) activity of immune cells, including [macrophages](../../glossary#macrophage) and [neutrophils](../../glossary#neutrophil) [(31, 32)](#reference31). The result of a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 20 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that reductions in total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol concentrations with phytosterol-enriched foods were not associated with changes in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentration of [C-reactive protein](../../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP), a surrogate marker of chronic low-grade [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) [(33)](#reference33). Typical diets across different populations have been estimated to provide 150 to 450 mg/day of naturally occurring phytosterols. Nevertheless, the consumption of vegetarian diets and of food products enriched with phytosterols can help achieve much greater intakes of phytosterols (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Relatively few studies have considered the effects of naturally occurring dietary phytosterol intakes on [serum](../../glossary#serum) [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, while an abundance of studies have examined the [lipid](../../glossary#lipid)-lowering effect of phytosterol-enriched foods. Lipid-lowering effect: Elevated [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentration is a [risk](../../glossary#risk) disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) [(34, 35)](#reference34). Numerous [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have found that daily consumption of foods enriched with free or esterified forms of plant sterols or stanols lowers concentrations of [serum](../../glossary#serum) total and LDL-cholesterol [(36-40)](#reference36). This wealth of evidence has been summarized in several [meta-analyses](../../glossary#meta-analysis) combining the results of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(41-46)](#reference41). A dose-dependent relationship was reported between total phytosterol intake levels (from less than 1 g/day to 4 g/day) and LDL-cholesterol reduction in a recent meta-analysis of 124 human studies [(47)](#reference47). When analyzed separately, plant sterols and stanols showed similar dose-response effects on LDL-cholesterol concentrations for average doses ranging from 0.6 g/day to 3.3 g/day. Average doses of phytosterols between 0.6 and 1.1 g/day were found to significantly lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations by at least 5%, while an average intake of 3.3 g/day resulted in reductions of about 12.4% [(47)](#reference47). Another meta-analysis that analyzed the results of 59 randomized controlled trials suggested that reductions in LDL-cholesterol were greater in those with higher baseline concentrations of LDL-cholesterol [(41)](#reference41). Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of phytosterol-enriched food intake (1.8 to 6 g/day of phytosterols) in patients treated with statins (drugs that inhibit [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) cholesterol [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis)) found that co-administration of phytosterols and statins significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared to statin therapy alone [(48)](#reference48). The concentrations of [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol and [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglycerides) were unaffected by the combination of phytosterols and statins compared to statin alone. In subgroup analyses, the effect of combining phytosterols and statins on blood [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) profile was not found to be significantly influenced by lipid baseline values, phytosterol dosage, or study duration [(48)](#reference48). Effect on vascular health: Impairment of [vascular endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) and [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(49)](#reference49). A recent 5 mmol/L [193 consuming 3 g/day of phytosterols added to low-fat spread on brachial artery dilation (FMD), a surrogate marker of endothelial health [(50)](#reference50). Assessment of arterial stiffness \u2014 using measures of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI) \u2014 and blood pressure also showed no difference between supplemented and placebo groups, despite a significant 6.7% reduction in total and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol. Other trials in individuals with hypercholesterolemia [(51, 52)](#reference51) and type 1 [diabetes mellitus](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(53)](#reference53) also failed to find an effect of phytosterol-enriched spread consumption on brachial artery diameter, FMD, and/or arterial stiffness. Nonetheless, the results of a [randomized controlled trial](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 92 individuals of whom 72% had serum cholesterol 5 mmol/L suggested beneficial effects of plant stanol-enriched spread consumption (corresponding to 3 g/day of stanols for six months) on arterial stiffness and endothelial function, as assessed by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) measures, respectively [(54)](#reference54). Finally, a 21-month randomized controlled trial used retinal photography to examine the effect of phytosterol-enriched margarine consumption on retinal microcirculation in 43 statin-treated subjects [(55)](#reference55). Reductions in LDL-cholesterol concentration by 9.7% and 11.2% with plant sterols (2.5 g/day) and plant stanols (2.5 g/day), respectively, were not accompanied by significant changes in the diameter of retinal arterioles and venules, a proxy measure to assess microvascular health [(55)](#reference55). At present, whether phytosterols can improve vascular health in individuals with endothelial dysfunction is unclear. The lack of an effect of phytosterols in most of the abovementioned trials may be due to the inclusion of apparently healthy participants who may have normal endothelial function [(50)](#reference50). [Effect on the risk of coronary heart disease: Elevated ] [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) is an established [risk](../../glossary#risk) factor for [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) [(56)](#reference56). The pooled analysis of 27 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of statin drug therapy found a 24% decrease in the risk of major [coronary](../../glossary#coronary-artery) events and a 12% decrease in vascular mortality per 1 millimol/L (1 mM) reduction in LDL-cholesterol concentration, irrespective of gender and level of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) risk [(57)](#reference57). Yet, at present, the effect of long-term use of foods enriched with plant sterols or stanols on CHD risk is not known. The addition of plant sterol- or stanol-enriched foods to a heart-healthy diet that is low in [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and rich in [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables), [whole grains](../../food-beverages/whole-grains), and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber) offers the potential for additive effects in CHD risk reduction. For example, following a diet that substituted [monounsaturated](../../glossary#monounsaturated-fatty-acid) and [polyunsaturated fats](../../glossary#polyunsaturated-fatty-acid) for saturated fat resulted in a 9% reduction in [serum](../../glossary#serum) LDL-cholesterol after 30 days, but the addition of 1.7 g/day of plant sterols to the same diet resulted in a 24% reduction [(58)](#reference58). In addition, one-month adherence to a diet providing a portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, including plant sterols (1 g/1,000 kcal), soy protein, almonds, and viscous fibers, lowered serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations by an average of 30% \u2014 a decrease that was not significantly different from that induced by statin therapy [(59)](#reference59). The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III included the use of plant sterol or stanol esters (2 g/day) as a component of maximal dietary therapy for elevated LDL-cholesterol [(60)](#reference60). The 2013 report of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) task force advised clinicians to consider the use of phytosterol-enriched foods as dietary [adjuncts](../../glossary#adjunct) for high-risk patients with insufficient LDL-cholesterol response to statin therapy [(61)](#reference61). However, stepping back from a general recommendation, the ACC and American Heart Association (AHA) did not include phytosterols in their 2013 report on lifestyle management guidelines to reduce cardiovascular risk [(62)](#reference62). Likewise, the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans \u2014 issued jointly by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture \u2014 does not mention phytosterols in the composition of healthy eating patterns [(63)](#reference63). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of health claims on food labels indicating that regular consumption of foods enriched with plant sterol or stanol esters, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease (see [Foods enriched with plant sterols and plant stanols](#enriched-food)) [(61, 64)](#reference61). In the EU, disease risk reduction claims for phytosterols are restricted to certain [fortified](../../glossary#fortification) food products and include a number of mandatory statements such as the fact that these products are not intended for people who do not need to control their blood cholesterol level [(65)](#reference65). [Clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) finding daily consumption of foods enriched with plant sterols or stanols can significantly lower [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations do not account for naturally occurring phytosterols in the diet [(66)](#reference66). Relatively few studies have considered the effects of dietary phytosterol intakes on [serum](../../glossary#serum) LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Limited evidence, primarily from [cross-sectional studies](../../glossary#cross-sectional-study), suggests that dietary phytosterols may play an important role in decreasing cholesterol absorption. A cross-sectional study in the UK found that dietary phytosterol intakes were [inversely related](../../glossary#inverse-association) to serum total and after adjusting for [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber) intake [(67)](#reference67). Similarly, an analysis in a Swedish population found that dietary intake of phytosterols was inversely associated with total cholesterol in both men and women and with LDL-cholesterol in women [(68)](#reference68). Dietary phytosterol intakes were also found to be inversely associated with LDL-cholesterol concentrations in another cross-sectional study in healthy Spanish participants [(69)](#reference69). In single-meal tests, removal of 150 mg of phytosterols from corn oil increased cholesterol absorption by 38% [(70)](#reference70), and removal of 328 mg of phytosterols from wheat germ increased cholesterol absorption by 43% [(71)](#reference71). Although these findings suggest that moderate intakes of phytosterols could have an important impact on [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) health, the intake of phytosterols (83 to 966 mg/day) from natural sources was not found to be associated with reduced risks of CHD, [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction), or total [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) during the 12.2-year follow-up of 35,597 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-The Netherlands (EPIC-NL) [(72)](#reference72). Limited data from animal studies suggest that very high intakes of phytosterols, particularly sitosterol, may inhibit the growth of breast and [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) (reviewed in [73](#reference73)). Only a few [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) have examined associations between dietary phytosterol intakes and cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) in humans [(30)](#reference30). A series of [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) in Uruguay found that dietary phytosterol intakes were lower in people diagnosed with stomach, lung, or breast cancer than in cancer-free control groups [(74-76)](#reference74). Case-control studies in the US found that women diagnosed with breast or [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) (uterine) cancer had lower dietary phytosterol intakes than women who did not have cancer [(77, 78)](#reference77). In contrast, another case-control study in the US found that men diagnosed with prostate cancer had higher dietary campesterol intakes than cancer-free men, but total phytosterol consumption was not associated with prostate cancer risk [(79)](#reference79). Although higher intakes of plant foods containing phytosterols may be associated with lower cancer risk, it is not clear whether potential anticancer health benefits can be attributed to phytosterols or to other compounds in plant foods (e.g., [vitamins](../../glossary#vitamin), [minerals](../../glossary#mineral), and [fiber](../../other-nutrients/fiber)). [Benign prostatic to describe a noncancerous enlargement of the [prostate](../../glossary#prostate). The enlarged prostate may exert pressure on the urethra, resulting in difficulty urinating. Plant extracts that provide a mixture of phytosterols (marketed as -sitosterol) are often included in herbal therapies for urinary symptoms related to BPH. However, relatively few controlled studies have examined the efficacy of phytosterol [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in men with symptomatic BPH. In a six-month study of 200 men with symptomatic BPH, 60 mg/day of a -sitosterol preparation improved symptom scores, increased peak urinary flow, and decreased post-void residual urine volume compared to [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(80)](#reference80). A follow-up study reported that these improvements were maintained for up to 18 months in the 38 participants who continued -sitosterol treatment [(81)](#reference81). Similarly, in a six-month study of 177 men with symptomatic BPH, 130 mg/day of a different -sitosterol preparation improved urinary symptom scores, increased peak urinary flow, and decreased post-void residual urine volume compared to placebo [(82)](#reference82). A [systematic review](../../glossary#systematic-review) that combined the results of these and two other controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found that -sitosterol extracts increased peak urinary flow by an average of 3.9 mL/second and decreased post-void residual volume by an average of 29 mL [(83)](#reference83). Although the results of a few clinical trials suggest that relatively low doses of phytosterols can improve lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH, further research is needed to confirm these findings [(84)](#reference84). Unlike the typical diet in most developed countries today, the diets of our ancestors were rich in phytosterols, likely providing as much as 1 g/day [(1)](#references). Present-day dietary phytosterol intakes have been estimated to vary from 150 to 450 mg/day in different populations [(85)](#reference85). Vegetarians, particularly vegans, generally have the highest intakes of dietary phytosterols [(86)](#reference86). Phytosterols are found in all plant foods, but the highest concentrations are found in unrefined plant oils, including vegetable, nut, and olive oils [(3)](#reference3). [Nuts](../../food-beverages/nuts), seeds, [whole grains](../../food-beverages/whole-grains), and [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes) are also good dietary sources of phytosterols [(4)](#reference4). The phytosterol content of selected foods are presented in Table 1. For information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search the [USDA food |Food||Serving||Phytosterols* (mg)| USDA food composition database, the values of phytosterol content of foods are likely to be underestimates since they account only for major sterols (sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol). In addition, the values correspond to the amounts of free and esterified phytosterols in foods, because phytosterol glycosides are not quantified by the current method unless glycosides (sugars) are removed before quantification [Clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) that demonstrated a [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering effect have primarily used plant sterol or stanol [esters](../../glossary#ester) solubilized in fat-containing foods, such as margarine or mayonnaise [(44)](#reference44). Additional studies indicate that low-fat or even nonfat foods can effectively deliver plant sterols or stanols if they are adequately solubilized [(37](#reference37), [(96)](#reference96), and orange juice [(97, 98)](#reference97) have been reported to lower [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol in [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial). A variety of foods containing added plant sterols or stanols, including margarines, mayonnaises, vegetable oils, salad dressings, yogurt, milk, soy milk, orange juice, snack bars, and meats, are available in the US, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand [(37)](#reference37). A 2008 [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) found that phytosterols added to fat spreads, mayonnaise, salad dressings, milk, or yogurt more effectively reduced LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared to phytosterols incorporated into chocolate, orange juice, cheese, meats, and cereal bars [(41)](#reference41). In most clinical trials, dividing the daily dose of phytosterols among two or three meals appeared to effectively lower LDL-cholesterol [(41)](#reference41). Nevertheless, consumption of the daily dose of plant sterols or stanols with a single meal has also been found to lower LDL-cholesterol in a few clinical trials [(89-91](#reference89), [99, 100)](#reference99). In the US, FDA-authorized health claims on food labels specify that the daily dietary intake of plant sterol (1.3 g/day) or stanol esters (3.4 g/day) that has been associated with a reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of heart disease should be consumed in two servings eaten at different times of the day with other foods, as part of a diet low in [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and cholesterol [(61, 64)](#reference61). In the EU, food labels must indicate that the beneficial effect of phytosterols is obtained with a daily intake of 1.5 to 3 g of plant sterols/stanols in order to use the following European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)-approved statement: \"Plant sterol and stanol esters have been shown to lower blood cholesterol. High cholesterol is a risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease\" [(65)](#reference65). Available without a prescription in the US, -sitosterol [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) typically contain a mixture of -sitosterol with other phytosterols and/or with substances like pumpkin seed oil and saw palmetto extract [(101)](#reference101). Doses of 60 to 130 mg/day of -sitosterol have been found to alleviate the symptoms of [benign and phytostanol supplements should be taken with a meal that contains fat. In the US, plant sterols and stanols added to a variety of food products are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA [(102)](#reference102). Additionally, the Scientific Committee on Foods of the EU concluded that plant sterols and stanols added to various food products are safe for human use [(103)](#reference103). However, the Committee recommended that intakes of plant sterols and stanols from food products should not exceed 3 g/day because there is no evidence of health benefits at higher intakes and there might be undesirable effects at high intakes [(65)](#reference65). Few adverse effects have been associated with regular consumption of plant sterols or stanols for up to one year. People who consumed a plant sterol-enriched spread providing 1.6 g/day did not report any more adverse effects than those consuming a control spread for up to one year [(29)](#reference29), and people consuming a plant stanol-enriched spread providing 1.8 to 2.6 g/day for one year did not report any adverse effects [(104)](#reference104). Consumption of up to 8.6 g/day of phytosterols in margarine for three to four weeks was well tolerated by healthy men and women and did not adversely affect intestinal [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) or female [hormone](../../glossary#hormone) levels [(105)](#reference105). Although phytosterols are usually well tolerated, nausea, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation have occasionally been reported [(106)](#reference106). Sitosterolemia, also known as phytosterolemia, is a very rare hereditary disease that results from inheriting a [mutation](../../glossary#mutation) in both copies of the ABCG5 or ABCG8 [gene](../../glossary#gene) [(107)](#reference107). Individuals who are [homozygous](../../glossary#homozygous) for a mutation in either transporter [protein](../../glossary#protein) have dramatically elevated [serum](../../glossary#serum) phytosterol concentrations due to increased intestinal absorption and decreased [biliary](../../glossary#bile) [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of phytosterols. Although serum cholesterol concentrations may be normal or only mildly elevated, individuals with sitosterolemia are at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for premature [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis). Other clinical symptoms include tuberous and tendon xanthomas (i.e., cutaneous lipid depositions), [hematological](../../glossary#hematology) abnormalities, and sometimes joint pain and arthritis. People with sitosterolemia should avoid foods or [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) with added plant sterols [(37)](#reference37). Two studies have examined the effect of plant sterol consumption in [heterozygous](../../glossary#heterogeneous) carriers of sitosterolemia, a more common condition. Consumption of 3 g/day of plant sterols for four weeks by two heterozygous carriers [(108)](#reference108) and consumption of 2.2 g/day of plant sterols for 6 to 12 weeks by 12 heterozygous carriers did not result in abnormally elevated [serum](../../glossary#serum) phytosterols [(109)](#reference109). Because [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) has been reported in subjects with sitosterolemia, phytosterols have been attributed atherogenic effects. However, no relationship between serum concentrations of sitosterol and campesterol and risk of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) has been identified in a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) in 11,182 participants [(110)](#reference110). Phytosterol-enriched foods and [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) are not recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women because their safety has not been studied [(106)](#reference106). At present, there is no evidence that high dietary intakes of naturally occurring phytosterols, such as those consumed by vegetarian women, adversely affects pregnancy or lactation. There is some evidence showing that statin administration initially reduces plant sterol concentrations in blood. This might be attributed to the reduction of circulating [LDL](../../glossary#LDL), the major transport [lipoprotein](../../glossary#lipoprotein) of plant sterols, due to enhanced [hepatic](../../glossary#hepatic) uptake of LDL. However, statin therapy appears to increase the absorption of plant sterols that can be then transported by the remaining LDL particles [(111)](#reference111). Further, the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of plant sterols or stanols may be additive to that of statins. The result of a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) suggested that consumption of 2 to 3 g/day of plant sterols or stanols by individuals on statin therapy may lower both total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) and LDL-cholesterol by an additional 0.30 mmol/L (11.6 to alone [(48)](#reference48). Ezetimibe (marketed as Zetia) is another [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering drug that may interfere with the intestinal absorption of phytosterols, thus significantly reducing phytosterol concentration in blood [(112)](#reference112). Because plant sterols and stanols decrease [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) absorption and [serum](../../glossary#serum) [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol concentrations, their effects on fat-soluble [vitamin](../../glossary#vitamin) status studied in [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial). [Plasma](../../glossary#plasma) [vitamin A](../../vitamins/vitamin-A) (retinol) concentrations were not of plant sterol [esters](../../glossary#ester) or plant stanol esters for up to one year [(29](#reference29), [44)](#reference44). Although the majority of studies found no changes in plasma [vitamin D](../../vitamins/vitamin-D) (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) concentrations, one [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in individuals consuming 1.6 g/day of sterol esters for one year observed a small (7%) but statistically significant decrease in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations [(29)](#reference29). There is little evidence that plant sterol or stanol consumption adversely affects [vitamin K](../../vitamins/vitamin-K) status. Consumption of 1.6 g/day of sterol esters for six months was associated with a nonsignificant, 14% decrease in plasma vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) concentrations, and the level of [carboxylated](../../glossary#carboxylation) osteocalcin, a functional indicator of vitamin K status, was unchanged [(29)](#reference29). Other studies of shorter duration also found no change in plasma concentrations of phylloquinone [(113, 114)](#reference113) or vitamin K-dependent clotting factors with the consumption of plant sterol and stanol esters [(115)](#reference115). Consumption of phytosterol-enriched foods has been found to decrease plasma [vitamin E](../../vitamins/vitamin-E) (-tocopherol) concentration in a number of studies [(44](#reference44), [114)](#reference114). However, those decreases generally do not persist when plasma -tocopherol concentrations are standardized to LDL-cholesterol concentrations, suggesting that observed reductions in plasma -tocopherol are due in part to reductions in its [lipoprotein](../../glossary#lipoprotein) carrier, LDL. A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) found no adverse effects of phytosterol-enriched food consumption (average dose of 2.5 g/day) on fat-soluble vitamin status in well-nourished people [(116)](#reference116). Dietary [carotenoids](carotenoids) are fat-soluble [phytochemicals](../../glossary#phytochemical) that [lipoproteins](../../glossary#lipoprotein). A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled studies](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) reported about 5 to 20% reductions in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) hydrocarbon carotenoids after consumption of plant sterol- or stanol-enriched foods for one month to one year [(116)](#reference116). Even when standardized to [serum](../../glossary#serum) total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, decreases in -carotene, -carotene, and lycopene may persist, suggesting that phytosterols could inhibit the absorption of these carotenoids. Total cholesterol-standardized concentrations of xanthophyll carotenoids, zeaxanthin and -cryptoxanthin, but not lutein, were also found to be significantly reduced by 5 to 15% with the consumption of phytosterol-enriched foods [(116)](#reference116). Although it is not clear whether reductions in plasma carotenoid concentrations confer any health [risks](../../glossary#risk) (see the article on [Carotenoids](carotenoids)), a few studies showed that increasing intakes of carotenoid-rich [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) would prevent phytosterol-induced decreases in plasma concentrations of carotenoids [(117)](#reference117). In one randomized controlled study, advice to consume five daily servings of fruit and vegetables, including one serving of carotenoid-rich vegetables, was enough to maintain plasma carotenoid levels in people consuming 2.5 g/day of plant sterol or stanol esters [(118)](#reference118). 2005 by: Jane Higdon, Ph.D. Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State University Updated in September 2008 by: Victoria J.

Certain plants produce resveratrol and other stilbenoids in response to stress, injury, fungal infection, or ultraviolet (UV) radiation [(2)](#reference2). Resveratrol is a fat-soluble compound that occurs in both trans and cis molecular configurations (Figure 1). Both cis- and trans-resveratrol also occur as [glucosides](../../glossary#glucoside), i.e., bound to a [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) molecule. One major resveratrol derivative is resveratrol-3-O--glucoside, also called piceid (Figure 1) [(3)](#reference3). Since the early 1990s, when the presence of resveratrol in red wine was established [(4)](#reference4), the scientific community has been exploring the effects of resveratrol on health. Specifically, it was postulated that resveratrol intake via moderate red wine consumption might help explain the fact that French people have a relatively low incidence of [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) in spite of consuming foods high in [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid), a phenomenon dubbed the \"French Paradox\" (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)) [(5)](#reference5). Since then, reports on the potential for resveratrol to prevent [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), delay the development of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) and [neurodegenerative diseases](../../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease), improve glycemic control in type 2 [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and extend lifespan in experimental models have continued to generate scientific interest (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). Initial studies of the [pharmacokinetics](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) of trans-resveratrol in humans found only traces of the unmetabolized resveratrol in the [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) upon oral exposure of single trans-resveratrol doses of 5 to 25 mg. Indeed, trans-resveratrol appears to be well absorbed by humans when taken orally, but its [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) is relatively low due to its rapid [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) and elimination [(6)](#reference6). Once absorbed, resveratrol is rapidly metabolized by conjugation to glucuronic acid and/or sulfate, forming resveratrol glucuronides, sulfates, and/or sulfoglucuronides. Sulfate conjugates are the major forms of resveratrol [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) found in plasma and urine in humans [(7)](#reference7). Preliminary studies found that the administration of single oral doses of 25 mg of trans-resveratrol to healthy volunteers resulted in peak blood concentrations of total resveratrol (i.e., trans-resveratrol plus its metabolites) around 60 minutes later, at about 1.8-2 moles/liter (M), depending on whether resveratrol was administered in wine, vegetable juice, or grape juice [(8, 9)](#reference8). A study in 40 healthy subjects who received single ascending doses of oral trans-resveratrol (i.e., 0.5 g, 1 g, 2.5 g, and 5 g) showed that plasma concentrations of unmetabolized resveratrol peaked between 0.8 and 1.5 hours after resveratrol administration at levels ranging from 0.3 M to 2.3 M [(10)](#reference10). Of note, these values were markedly below those used to elicit chemopreventive effects of resveratrol in [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) experiments (>5 M). In contrast, following a single oral dose of 5 g of trans-resveratrol, the peak plasma concentrations of certain resveratrol conjugates were found to be about two to eight times higher than those of unmetabolized resveratrol [(10)](#reference10). Also, compared to a single dose administration, the repeated intake of 5 g/day of trans-resveratrol for 29 days was found to result in significantly greater peak plasma concentrations of trans-resveratrol and two resveratrol glucuronide conjugates [(11)](#reference11). Repeated doses of 1 g/day of trans-resveratrol (a dose less likely to cause side effects; see [Safety](#safety)) could yield maximum plasma concentrations of about 22 M for resveratrol-3-O-sulfate (the most abundant sulfate conjugate in humans) and about 7-8 M for typical monoglucuronide conjugates [(12)](#reference12). A few studies have examined the influence of food matrix on resveratrol absorption and/or bioavailability (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). One study has reported that bioavailability of trans-resveratrol from red wine did not differ when the wine was consumed with a meal (low- or high-fat) versus on an empty stomach [(14)](#reference14). Yet, in another study, the absorption of [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) resveratrol was found to be delayed, but not reduced, by the presence of food in the stomach [(15)](#reference15). A third study found that the bioavailability of supplemental resveratrol was reduced by the amount of fat in the diet, but not by the co-administration of quercetin (another polyphenol) or alcohol [(16)](#reference16). Information about the bioavailability of resveratrol in humans is important because most of the experimental research conducted to date has been 'preclinical,' i.e., in vitro, exposing cells to resveratrol concentrations up to 100 times greater than peak plasma concentrations observed in humans, and in animal models given very high (non dietary) doses of resveratrol [(13)](#reference13). While cells that line the digestive tract are exposed to unmetabolized resveratrol, other tissues are likely exposed to resveratrol metabolites. At present, little is known about the biological activity of resveratrol metabolites. Yet, if some tissues are capable of converting resveratrol metabolites back to resveratrol, stable resveratrol conjugates in tissues could serve as a pool in the body from which resveratrol might be regenerated [(6](#reference6), [12)](#reference12). The biological significance of resveratrol has been primarily investigated in test tubes and cultured cells, and to a lesser extent, in animal models. Of note, a recent publication by Tom\u00e9-Carneiro et al. [(13)](#reference13) thoroughly reviewed the most relevant preclinical studies published in the most recent decades. It is important to keep in mind that many of the biological activities discussed below were observed in cells cultured in the presence of resveratrol at higher concentrations than those likely to be achieved in humans consuming resveratrol orally (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). In the test tube, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOX) [(21)](#reference21). However, there evidence that resveratrol is an important antioxidant [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo). Upon oral consumption of resveratrol, circulating and intracellular levels of resveratrol in humans are likely to be much lower than that of other important antioxidants, such as [vitamin resveratrol [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite), which comprise most of the circulating resveratrol, may be lower than that of resveratrol [(22)](#reference22). [Endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) are [steroid](../../glossary#steroid-hormone) [hormones](../../glossary#hormone) [synthesized](../../glossary#synthesis) mammals; these hormones bind to estrogen [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) within cells. The estrogen-receptor complex [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) [genes](../../glossary#gene) [(23)](#reference23). The chemical structure of resveratrol is very similar to that of the synthetic estrogen agonist, diethylstilbestrol (Figure 2), suggesting that resveratrol might also function as an estrogen agonist, i.e., might bind to estrogen receptors and elicit similar responses to endogenous estrogens. However, in cell culture experiments, resveratrol was found to act either as an estrogen agonist or as an estrogen antagonist depending on such factors as cell type, estrogen receptor isoform (ER or ER), and the presence of endogenous estrogens [(23)](#reference23). Most recently, resveratrol was shown to improve endothelial wound healing through an ER-dependent pathway in an animal model of arterial injury [(24)](#reference24). Some compounds are not [carcinogenic](../../glossary#carcinogen) until they have been [metabolized](../../glossary#metabolism) in the body by phase I [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes), especially [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) [(2)](#reference2). P450 enzymes [(25, 26)](#reference25), resveratrol might help prevent [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) by limiting the activation of [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen). In contrast, increasing the activity of phase II detoxification enzymes generally promotes the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of potentially toxic or carcinogenic chemicals. Resveratrol has been found to increase the expression and activity of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) in cultured cells [(27)](#reference27) and may be a weak inducer of other phase II enzymes [(28)](#reference28). Following [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) damage, the cell cycle can be transiently arrested to allow for DNA repair or activation of pathways leading to cell death ( [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis)) if the damage is irreparable [(29)](#reference29). Defective cell cycle regulation may result in the propagation of [mutations](../../glossary#mutation) that contribute to the development of cancer. Moreover, unlike normal cells, [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cells [proliferate](../../glossary#proliferation) rapidly and are unable to respond to cell death signals that initiate apoptosis. Resveratrol has been found to induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (programmed cell death) in a number of cancer cell lines (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). [Cancerous](../../glossary#cancer) cells invade normal tissue aided by [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) called [matrix metalloproteinases](../../glossary#matrix-metalloproteinase). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the activity of at least one type of matrix metalloproteinase [(30, 31)](#reference30). To fuel their rapid growth, invasive tumors must also develop new blood vessels by a process known as [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis). Resveratrol has been found [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) [(36)](#reference36). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the activity of several inflammatory [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro), including an [inflammatory](../../glossary#inflammation) process in which [lipids](../../glossary#lipid) deposit in plaques (known as atheromas) within arterial walls and increase the risk of [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) [(41)](#reference41). One of the earliest events in the development of atherosclerosis is the recruitment of inflammatory white blood cells from the blood to the arterial wall by vascular cell adhesion molecules [(42)](#reference42). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the expression of adhesion molecules in cultured endothelial cells [(43, 44)](#reference43). The [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays an important role in the progression of [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension), [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis), and [restenosis](../../glossary#restenosis) (when treated arteries become blocked again). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the proliferation of VSMCs in culture [(45-47)](#reference45), as well as [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) [(48)](#reference48). Resveratrol appeared to reduce VSMC proliferation via an ER-dependent mechanism, hence preventing the narrowing of vessels in a mouse model of arterial injury [(48)](#reference48). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is an [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) that the formation of nitric oxide (NO) by [vascular endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells. NO is needed to maintain arterial relaxation ( [vasodilation](../../glossary#vasodilation)), and impaired NO-dependent vasodilation is associated an increased risk of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(49)](#reference49). Because physiological concentrations of resveratrol were found to stimulate eNOS activity in cultured endothelial cells [(50-52)](#reference50), resveratrol might help maintain (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)). [Platelet](../../glossary#platelet) aggregation is one of the first steps in the formation of a blood clot that can occlude a [coronary](../../glossary#coronary-artery) or [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebral) artery, resulting in [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) or [stroke](../../glossary#stroke), respectively. Resveratrol has been activation and aggregation [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vivo) [(53-55)](#reference53). Age-related mood alterations and memory deficits result from a decrease in the function of the hippocampus in the elderly. Resveratrol was shown to stimulate neurogenesis and blood vessel formation in the hippocampus of healthy old rats. These structural changes were associated with significant improvements in spatial learning, memory formation, and mood function [(56)](#reference56). One feature of [Alzheimer's disease](../../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) is the accumulation of -amyloid peptide into (amyloid) plaques](../../glossary#senile-plaque) outside [neurons](../../glossary#neuron) in the hippocampus and cortex of AD patients [(57)](#reference57). Senile plaques are toxic to cells, resulting in progressive neuronal dysfunction and death. Resveratrol was found to facilitate the clearance of -amyloid peptide and promote cell survival in primary neurons in culture and neuronal cell lines [(58-60)](#reference58). Resveratrol also reduced senile plaque counts in various brain regions of a transgenic AD mouse model [(61)](#reference61). Abnormally activated microglia and hypertrophic astrocytes around the senile plaques in AD brains release cytotoxic molecules, such as proinflammatory mediators and [ROS](../../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), which enhance the formation and deposition of -amyloid peptides and further damage [neurons](../../glossary#neuron) [(57)](#reference57). Resveratrol was found able to inhibit the inflammatory response triggered by -amyloid peptide-induced microglial activation in microglial cell lines and in a mouse model of [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebral) amyloid deposition [(62)](#reference62). A decreased occurrence of microglial activation and astrocyte hypertrophy was also reported in healthy aged rats treated with resveratrol [(56)](#reference56). [Mitochondrial](../../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and [oxidative stress](../../glossary#oxidative-stress) are thought to be involved in the [etiology](../../glossary#etiology) progression of several Resistance against oxidative stress-related damage in primary neuronal cells treated with resveratrol has been associated with the limited infarct size during [ischemia](../../glossary#ischemia)-reperfusion in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking the HO-1 [gene](../../glossary#gene) [(66)](#reference66). Also, resveratrol was able to correct experimentally induced oxidative stress and the associated [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) dysfunction in rats [(67)](#reference67). Resveratrol has been found to inhibit the [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) of a variety of human [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) cell lines, including those from breast, [prostate](../../glossary#prostate), stomach, colon, [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas), and [thyroid](../../glossary#thyroid) cancers [(2)](#reference2). In animal models, oral administration, [topical](../../glossary#topical) application, and/or injection of resveratrol inhibited the development of chemically-induced cancer at many sites, including [gastrointestinal tract](../../glossary#gastrointestinal), liver, skin, breast, prostate, and lung (reviewed in [68, 69](#reference68)). The anti-cancer effects of resveratrol in rodent models involved the reduction of cell proliferation, the induction of [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis), and the inhibition of [angiogenesis](../../glossary#angiogenesis), tumor growth, and [metastasis](../../glossary#metastasize) (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). Yet, a few animal studies have reported a lack of an effect of oral resveratrol in inhibiting the development of lung cancer induced by [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) in cigarette smoke [(70, 71)](#reference70), and the study of resveratrol administration on colon cancer has given mixed results [(72-74)](#reference72). At present, it is not known whether resveratrol might be beneficial in the prevention and/or the treatment of cancer in humans. The low [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) of resveratrol reported in human studies limits the clinical evaluation of possible systemic health effects of resveratrol in humans (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)). Yet, in a [pilot study](../../glossary#pilot-study), unmetabolized resveratrol and conjugates have been detected in colorectal tumor tissues from 20 cancer patients following daily oral supplementation with either 4 g or 8 g of resveratrol for 29 days. Resveratrol appeared to be well tolerated and significantly, though modestly, reduced cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) compared to baseline [(75)](#reference75). A micronized formulation of resveratrol (named SRT501), which was meant to increase resveratrol delivery to target tissues, was given for 14 days to 6 patients with [colorectal cancer](../../glossary#colorectal-cancer) and liver metastasis trial [(76)](#reference76). Unmetabolized resveratrol was measurable in the liver of five out of six patients who consumed 5 g of SRT501, and SRT501 administration resulted in an increased detection of the apoptotic marker, cleaved caspase-3, in [hepatic](../../glossary#hepatic) tumor tissues. Yet, in an unrandomized and unblinded trial in patients with multiple myeloma, the administration of SRT501 was associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including kidney failure, such that the trial was halted [(77)](#reference77). Since kidney failure is a frequent complication in myeloma patients, it is unclear whether kidney failure cases should be solely attributed to the use of SRT501. Nevertheless, there is a need to find safe ways to increase resveratrol bioavailability in humans before exploring its putative benefits in clinical settings [(6](#reference6), [78)](#reference78). Significant reductions in [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) risk have been associated with moderate consumption of [alcoholic beverages](../../food-beverages/alcoholic-beverages) [(79)](#reference79). The \"French Paradox\" \u2014 the observation that incidence of [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) was relatively low in France despite high levels of dietary [saturated fat](../../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) and cigarette smoking \u2014 led to the idea that regular consumption of red wine might provide additional protection from cardiovascular disease [(80)](#reference80). Red wine contains variable and usually low concentrations of resveratrol (see [Sources](#sources)) and higher concentrations of [flavonoids](flavonoids) like procyanidins. These polyphenolic compounds have displayed [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant), anti-inflammatory, and other potentially anti-atherogenic effects in the test tube and in some animal models of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) [(81)](#reference81). The results of [epidemiological studies](../../glossary#epidemiological-study) addressing this question have been inconsistent. While some large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that wine drinkers were at lower risk of cardiovascular disease than beer or liquor drinkers [(82-84)](#reference82), others found no difference [(85-87)](#reference85). Socioeconomic and lifestyle differences between people who prefer wine and those who prefer beer or liquor may explain part of the additional benefit observed in some studies: people who prefer wine tend to have higher incomes, more education, smoke less, and eat more [fruit and vegetables](../../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) and less saturated fat than those who prefer other alcoholic beverages [(87-92)](#reference87). Although moderate alcohol consumption has been consistently associated with reductions in coronary heart disease risk, it is not yet clear whether red wine polyphenols confer any additional risk reduction. Interestingly, studies that administered alcohol-free red wine to rodents noted improvements in various parameters related to cardiovascular disease [(93, 94)](#reference93), and a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled human study found that heart disease patients administered red grape polyphenol extract experienced acute improvements in [endothelial function](../../glossary#endothelial-dependent-vasodilation) [(95)](#reference95). Whether increased consumption of polyphenols from red wine provides any additional [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) benefits beyond those associated with red wine's alcohol content needs to be further examined (see the article on [Alcoholic Beverages](../../food-beverages/alcoholic-beverages)) [(96)](#reference96). Endothelial dysfunction is usually associated with the presence of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) risk factors (e.g., [insulin resistance](../../glossary#insulin-resistance), [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension), and hypercholesterolemia) and is thought to precede the clinical manifestation of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by abnormal vasoconstriction, to [vascular endothelial cells](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium), [coagulation](../../glossary#coagulation), and [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis) [(97)](#reference97). studies: Resveratrol has been found to exert a number of protective effects on the [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) system [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro), [98, 99)](#reference98), of enhancing the production of [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) [(52)](#reference52), and control of the production of inflammatory [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) mediators [(38](#reference38), [100, 101)](#reference100). However, the concentrations of resveratrol required to produce these effects are often higher than those measured in human [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) after oral consumption of resveratrol [(9)](#reference9). Some animal studies also suggested that high oral doses of resveratrol could decrease the risk of thrombosis and atherosclerosis [(102, 103)](#reference102), although one study found increased atherosclerosis in animals fed resveratrol [(104)](#reference104). Other protective effects of resveratrol [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) include the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and the lowering of blood pressure in various models, as well as the limitation of infarct size in post [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction) rats (reviewed controlled [cross-over study](../../glossary#cross-over-study), metabolic syndrome were randomized to receive resveratrol (100 mg/day) for three months either immediately at the beginning of the study or three months later. Resveratrol [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) resulted in improved values of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, a surrogate marker of vascular health. Yet, FMD returned to baseline values within three months after discontinuing resveratrol [(105)](#reference105). One study limitation was that the resveratrol formulation contained additional compounds (i.e., vitamin D3, quercetin, and rice bran phytate), which may also affect endothelial function. One [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in healthy overweight or obese volunteers (BMI, 25-34 kg/m2) found that a single dose of trans-resveratrol (30 mg, 90 mg, or 270 mg) improved brachial FMD around 60 minutes after administration [(106)](#reference106). In a second study, the same investigators found that FMD improvements were similar whether participants had received a single dose of resveratrol (75 mg) or a daily dose (75 mg/day of resveratrol) for six months [(107)](#reference107). In a few additional studies, resveratrol was shown to improve endothelial function by reducing vascular [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) and endothelial activation. A randomized, [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study in 41 healthy subjects found that daily supplementation with resveratrol (400 mg), grapeseed extract (400 mg), and quercetin (100 mg), for one month significantly reduced the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) in endothelial cells, suggestive of a protective effect against endothelial dysfunction [(108)](#reference108). The daily intake of a resveratrol-rich grape supplement was compared to resveratrol-free grape supplement in a year-long, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 75 individuals at high risk for [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD). Administration of the resveratrol-rich supplement (resveratrol: 8 mg/day for 6 months, then 16 mg/day for another 6 months) significantly improved the profile of circulating inflammatory markers, reducing levels of [C-reactive protein](../../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) and Tumor Necrosis Factor- (TNF-), as of thrombogenic factor, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) [(109)](#reference109). [low-density lipoprotein](../../glossary#LDL) (oxLDL) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) after suggested a cardioprotective effect of resveratrol [(110)](#reference110). Supplementation of patients with stable [coronary heart disease](../../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) with the same regimen also improved the profile of circulating inflammatory markers and reduced the expression of proinflammatory [genes](../../glossary#gene) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [(111)](#reference111). The expression of [microRNAs](../../glossary#microRNA) and [cytokines](../../glossary#cytokine) specifically involved in atherogenic and pro-inflammatory signals were also found to be downregulated in the PBMCs of supplemented patients [(112)](#reference112). Finally, although it is not clear whether [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension) is a cause or an effect of endothelial dysfunction, a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) suggested that high doses of resveratrol (150 mg/for at least one month) might help lower [systolic blood pressure](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) in individuals at risk for CVD [(113)](#reference113). While preliminary human studies suggest that resveratrol may have beneficial effects on [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) health, there is currently no convincing evidence that these effects can be achieved in the amounts present in one to two glasses of red wine (see [Sources](#sources)). For more information regarding resveratrol and cardiovascular disease, see [(114)](#reference114). Caloric restriction is known to extend the lifespan of a number of species, including yeast, worms, flies, fish, rats, and mice [(115)](#reference115). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), caloric restriction stimulates the activity of an [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) known as Silent information regulator 2 protein (Sir2) or acetylated lysine residues in target [proteins](../../glossary#protein) (see the article on [Niacin](../../vitamins/niacin)). Providing resveratrol to yeast increased Sir2 activity in the absence of caloric restriction and extended the replicative (but not the chronological) lifespan of yeast by 70% [(117)](#reference117). Resveratrol feeding also extended the lifespan of worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) by a similar mechanism [(118)](#reference118). Additionally, resveratrol dose-dependently lifespan of a vertebrate fish (Nothobranchius furzeri) [(119)](#reference119). Resveratrol was also found to extend the lifespan of mice on a high-calorie diet such that their lifespan was similar to that of mice fed a standard diet [(120)](#reference120). Although resveratrol increased the activity of the Sir2 [homologous](../../glossary#homologous) human sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the test tube [(117)](#reference117), there are no [epidemiological](../../glossary#epidemiological-study) data to link resveratrol, SIRT1 activation, and extended human lifespan. Moreover, the supraphysiological concentrations of resveratrol required to increase human SIRT1 activity were considerably higher than concentrations that have been measured in human [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) after oral consumption. The results of a nine-year [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) in over 700 older adults (65 years) indicated that participants who were alive at the end of the study had baseline concentrations of total urinary resveratrol [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (used as a [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) of resveratrol intake) similar to those who died during the study period [(121)](#reference121). Based on a lack of correlation with baseline [inflammatory](../../glossary#inlammation) markers, [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) incidence, and all-cause mortality, the authors concluded that higher versus lower [quartiles](../../glossary#quartile) of urinary resveratrol metabolite concentrations did not predict [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [chronic disease](../../glossary#chronic-disease) or mortality. However, key experts identified several limitations regarding the quality of the research [(122, 123)](#reference122). Specifically, the use of single measures of total urinary resveratrol metabolites at baseline has been highlighted as being unlikely to reflect lifetime consumption of wine or exposure to dietary resveratrol [(122)](#reference122). In a mouse model of [Alzheimer's disease](../../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD), caloric restriction has been shown to limit the production and deposition of neurotoxic -amyloid peptide in the brain [(124)](#reference124). Similar to the effect of caloric restriction, resveratrol was found to improve [obesity](../../glossary#obesity) and [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus)-related metabolic deregulations via the activation of and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [(125)](#reference125), as well as to promote the AMPK-dependent clearance of -amyloid peptide in the brain of an AD mouse model [(60)](#reference60). Resveratrol has also exhibited additional neuroprotective properties in cultured cells and animal models (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). Although resveratrol [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) to the brain is uncertain [(78)](#reference78), a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study has reported an increase in [cerebral](../../glossary#cerebral) blood flow in the prefrontal cortex of healthy young subjects (ages, 18-29 years) following a single oral dose of 500 mg of resveratrol. However, resveratrol intake did not improve performance in [cognitively](../../glossary#cognitive) demanding tasks undertaken during the post-administration period [(126)](#reference126). More recently, the co-administration of resveratrol (200 mg/day) and quercetin (320 mg/day) for 26 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study significantly improved measures of memory function and enhanced blood [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) control in 46 healthy, overweight older adults (ages, 50-80 years; BMI, 25-30 kg/m2) [(127)](#reference127). Additional evidence of the of resveratrol to mimic the metabolic benefits of caloric restriction on cognitive health may come from ongoing [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) in both healthy older individuals and AD patients [(128)](#reference128). More than one out of three American adults has [impaired glucose tolerance](../../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) (also known as prediabetes), which places them at increased risk of developing type 2 [diabetes](../../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(129)](#reference129). Impaired glucose tolerance is associated with [insulin resistance](../../glossary#insulin-resistance) in skeletal muscle \u2014 the major peripheral tissue for [insulin](../../glossary#insulin)-mediated [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) uptake \u2014 as well as defective insulin secretion by [pancreatic](../../glossary#pancreas) -cells. Muscle insulin resistance, which is thought to be the earliest stage in the development of type 2 diabetes, is characterized by excess [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) exposure, impaired insulin [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signaling), impaired glucose uptake, [mitochondrial](../../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction, reduced [fatty acid](../../glossary#fatty-acid) [oxidation](../../glossary#oxidation), and increased expression of pro-inflammatory [cytokines](../../glossary#cytokine). In animal studies, resveratrol has been shown to improve [insulin sensitivity](../../glossary#insulin-sensitivity), glucose tolerance, and lipid profiles in obese and/or metabolically abnormal animals (reviewed in [130](#reference130)). In humans, short-term [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) with resveratrol has been associated with beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, the effect of oral resveratrol supplementation (1,000 mg/day for 45 days) on the control of glucose metabolism was assessed in 70 subjects with type 2 diabetes [(131)](#reference131). Comparison of changes between baseline and end-of-study measures between placebo and intervention groups showed that resveratrol significantly lowered both fasting glucose and fasting insulin concentrations and improved measures of glycemic control ( [HbA1c](../../glossary#hemoglobin-A1c) level) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR). In addition, the level of [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol was increased while the level of [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol and [systolic blood pressure](../../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) were significantly reduced. No changes were found in measures of [diastolic blood pressure](../../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure), total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol), [triglycerides](../../glossary#triglyceride), and markers of liver function [(131)](#reference131). Additionally, in a randomized, [open-label](../../glossary#open-label-trial), and controlled study, the effect of oral resveratrol (250 mg/day) on glycemic control and lipid metabolism was assessed in 62 type 2 diabetics [(132)](#reference132). During the three-month study period, changes in biochemical and clinical parameters, including fasting glucose concentration, HbA1c level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, were significantly improved with resveratrol compared to control (i.e., no resveratrol). Doses as low as 10 mg/day of resveratrol also resulted in lower insulin resistance in a four-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 19 male subjects with type 2 diabetes [(133)](#reference133). Obesity (defined as a body mass index [BMI] 30 kg/m2) is a well-known risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. A few clinical studies have evaluated the effects of resveratrol on key metabolic variables in overweight or obese subjects with no overt metabolic dysfunction and found little or no metabolic benefits following resveratrol treatment [(134-136)](#reference134). Yet, at present, there is no available evidence to suggest whether overweight or obese individuals with impaired glucose tolerance could benefit from resveratrol supplements and reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes [(137)](#reference137). Current data suggest that resveratrol could improve specific metabolic variables in individuals with type 2 diabetes [(138, 139)](#reference138), but more research is needed to assess its effect in individuals at risk for diabetes, including obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Resveratrol is found in grapes, wine, grape juice, peanuts, cocoa, and berries of Vaccinium species, including blueberries, bilberries, and cranberries [(140-143)](#reference140). In grapes, resveratrol is found only in the skins [(144)](#reference144). The amount of resveratrol in grape skins varies with the grape cultivar, its geographic origin, and exposure to fungal infection [(145)](#reference145). The amount of [fermentation](../../glossary#fermentation) time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is also an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Because grape skins are removed early during the production process of white and ros\u00e9 wines, these wines generally contain less resveratrol than red wines [(4)](#reference4). Therefore, because of variations between types of wine, vintages, and regions, it is very difficult to provide accurate estimates of resveratrol content in the thousands of wines from worldwide wineries. Yet, it appears that resveratrol content in wine is usually low, highly variable and unpredictable, and resveratrol is only a minor compound in the complete set of grape and wine polyphenols [(13)](#reference13). The predominant form of resveratrol in grapes and grape juice is trans-resveratrol-3-O--glucoside (trans-piceid), and wines contain significant amounts of resveratrol aglycones, thought to be the result of sugar cleavage during fermentation [(3](#reference3), [140)](#reference140). Many wines also contain significant amounts of cis-resveratrol (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above), which may be produced during fermentation or released from viniferins (resveratrol polymers) [(146)](#reference146). Red wine is a relatively rich source of resveratrol, but other polyphenols are present in red wine at considerably higher concentrations than resveratrol (see the article on [Flavonoids](flavonoids#food-sources)) [(147)](#reference147). Estimates of resveratrol content of some beverages and foods are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. These values should be considered approximate since the resveratrol content of foods and beverages can vary Most resveratrol [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) available in the US contain extracts of the root of Polygonum cuspidatum, also known as Fallopia japonica, Japanese knotweed, or Hu Zhang [(150)](#reference150). Red wine extracts and grape extracts (from Vitis vinifera) containing resveratrol and other polyphenols are also available as dietary supplements. Resveratrol supplements may contain anywhere from less than 1 milligram (mg) to 500 mg of resveratrol per tablet or capsule, but it is not known whether there is a safe and effective dosage for chronic disease prevention in humans (also see the section on [Safety](#safety)). In rats, daily oral administration of trans-resveratrol at doses up to 700 mg/kg of body weight for 90 days resulted in no apparent adverse effects [(151)](#reference151). Other toxicity studies conducted in animal models estimated that the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for resveratrol was 200 mg/kg/days and 600 mg/kg/day in rats and dogs, respectively [(152)](#reference152). Resveratrol is not known to be toxic or cause significant adverse effects in humans, but there have been only a few controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) to date (reviewed in [153](#reference153)). A trial evaluating the safety of oral trans-resveratrol in 10 subjects found that a single dose of 5,000 mg resulted in no serious adverse effects [(10)](#reference10). In a follow-up study, mild-to-moderate [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) side effects, including nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea, have been reported in participants who consume more than 1,000 mg/day of resveratrol for up to 29 consecutive days [(11)](#reference11). Mild diarrhea was also reported in six out of eight individuals who consumed 2,000 mg of resveratrol twice daily for two periods of eight days in an [open-label](../../glossary#open-label-trial) and within subject-control study [(16)](#reference16). The safety of resveratrol-containing [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy and lactation has not been established [(150)](#reference150). Because there is no known safe amount of alcohol consumption at any stage of pregnancy [(154)](#reference154), pregnant women should avoid consuming wine as a source of resveratrol. Until more is known about the [estrogenic](../../glossary#estrogen) activity of resveratrol in humans, women with a history of estrogen-sensitive [cancers](../../glossary#cancer), such as breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers, should resveratrol [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) (see [Estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities](#estrogenic-anti-estrogenic-activities)) (i.e., from [supplements](../../glossary#supplement)) could increase the risk of bruising and bleeding when taken with [anticoagulant](../../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and [biotransformation enzymes](../../glossary#biotransformation-enzymes) involved in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of a broad range of compounds, from [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) molecules to therapeutic agents. The most abundant CYP isoform in the human liver and intestines is cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which [catalyzes](../../glossary#catalyze) the metabolism of about half of all marketed drugs in the US [(156)](#reference156). Resveratrol has been reported to inhibit CYP3A4 activity [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(157, 158)](#reference157) and in healthy Therefore, high intakes of resveratrol (i.e., from [supplements](../../glossary#supplement)) could potentially reduce the metabolic clearance of drugs that undergo extensive first-pass metabolism by CYP3A4, hence increasing the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and [risk](../../glossary#risk) of toxicity of these drugs. Some of the many drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 include HMG-CoA drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction (sildenafil). Of note, a recently completed [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) (NCT01173640) examined the potential for single and multiple doses of resveratrol (1,000 mg) to interfere with the metabolism of midazolam in healthy volunteers, and results are soon to be published [(153)](#reference153). Other CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP2D6 and CYP2C9) may also be inhibited by resveratrol (reviewed in [159](#reference159)). Finally, resveratrol was found to be a weak inducer of the expression and activity of CYP1A2, which catalyzes the metabolism of several drugs, including acetaminophen (paracetamol) and the antidepressant drugs, clomipramine and imipramine [(28](#reference28), [156)](#reference156). This suggests that resveratrol may interfere with CYP1A2-mediated drug metabolism by increasing drug clearance, possibly lowering circulating drug concentrations below therapeutic levels.

[Pharmacokinetic](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies have indicated that [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) concentrations of daidzein and genistein peaked about six hours after isoflavone intake, preceded by a smaller initial peak one hour post-meal [(2, 3)](#reference2). The initial peak reflects isoflavone absorption [hydrolysis](../../glossary#hydrolysis) of isoflavone [glycosides](../../glossary#glycoside) to [aglycones](../../glossary#aglycone) by -glucosidases in the intestine](../../glossary#small-intestine), while the second peak corresponds to isoflavone aglycones absorbed after the hydrolysis of glycosides by [bacterial](../../glossary#bacteria) the [colon](../../glossary#colon) [(2)](#reference2). composition of one's colonic microbiota can influence the metabolic fate and biological effects of isoflavones. Indeed, the extent of at least some of the potential health benefits of soy intake are thought to depend on one's capacity to convert isoflavones to key [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) during digestion. Specifically, some colonic bacteria can convert the soy isoflavone daidzein to equol, a metabolite that has greater [estrogenic](../../glossary#estrogen) activity than daidzein, and to other metabolites, such as O-desmethylangolensin [O-DMA], that are less estrogenic (Figure 2) [(4, 5)](#reference4). Equol appears in [plasma](../../glossary#plasma) about eight hours after isoflavone intake owing to the transit time of daidzein to the colon and its subsequent conversion to equol by the microbiota. Studies measuring urinary equol [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) after soy consumption indicated that equol was produced by about 25%-30% of the adult population in Western countries compared to 50%-60% of adults living in Asian countries and Western adult vegetarians [(4, 6)](#reference4). Note that individuals possessing equol-producing bacteria are called \"equol producers\" as opposed to \"equol non-producers.\" Although prolonged soy food consumption has not been associated with the ability to produce equol, the type of soy food consumed might influence the composition of microbiota to include equol-producing bacteria (discussed in [4](#reference4)). [Estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities] Soy isoflavones are known to have weak [estrogenic](../../glossary#estrogen) or [hormone](../../glossary#hormone)-like activity due to their structural similarity with 17--estradiol (Figure 3). Estrogens are [signaling](../../glossary#cell-signailing) molecules that exert their effects by binding to estrogen [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) within cells (Figure 3). The estrogen-receptor complex interacts [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) to change the [expression](../../glossary#expression) of estrogen-responsive [genes](../../glossary#gene). Estrogen receptors (ER) are present in numerous tissues other than those associated with reproduction, including bone, liver, heart, and brain [(7)](#reference7). Soy isoflavones can preferentially bind to and transactivate estrogen receptor- (ER-) \u2014 rather than ER- \u2014 mimicking the effects of estrogen in some tissues and antagonizing (blocking) the effects of estrogen in others [(8)](#reference8). Scientists are interested in the tissue-selective activities of [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) because anti-estrogenic effects in reproductive tissue could help reduce the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of hormone-associated cancers (breast, uterine, and [prostate](../../glossary#prostate)), while estrogenic effects in other tissues could help maintain [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density) and improve blood [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) profiles (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). The extent to which soy isoflavones exert estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects in humans is currently the focus of considerable scientific research. Soy isoflavones and their [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) also have biological activities that are unrelated to their interactions with [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) [receptors](../../glossary#receptor) [(9)](#reference9). By inhibiting the [synthesis](../../glossary#synthesis) and activity of certain [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) involved in estrogen [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism), soy isoflavones may alter the activity of [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) estrogens and androgens [(10-13)](#reference10). Soy isoflavones to inhibit tyrosine kinases [(14)](#reference14), [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) that play critical roles in the signaling pathways that stimulate cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation). Additionally, isoflavones can act as [antioxidants](../../glossary#antioxidant) [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(15)](#reference15), but the extent to which they contribute to the antioxidant status of humans is not yet clear. [Plasma](../../glossary#plasma) F2-isoprostanes, [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of [lipid peroxidation](../../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo), were significantly lower after two weeks of daily consumption of soy protein containing 56 mg of isoflavones than after consumption of soy protein providing only 2 mg of isoflavones [(16)](#reference16). However, daily supplementation with 50 to 100 mg of isolated soy isoflavones did not significantly alter plasma or urinary F2-isoprostane concentrations [(17, 18)](#reference17). Since soy isoflavones are structurally similar to [endogenous](../../glossary#endogenous) [estrogens](../../glossary#estrogen), it has been suggested that they might help protect against [hormone](../../glossary#hormone)-associated [cancers](../../glossary#cancer). High isoflavone intake from soy foods in Asian countries (average range, 25 to 50 mg/day) has been suggested to contribute to reducing the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of breast cancer; in contrast, the incidence of breast cancer remains elevated in Europe, North America, and Australia/New Zealand [(19)](#reference19) where average isoflavone intakes in non-Asian women are generally less than 2 mg/day [(20)](#reference20). Nevertheless, several hereditary and lifestyle factors likely also contribute to this difference [(19, 21)](#reference19). In a [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of one [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and seven [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) conducted in Asian populations and in Asian Americans, higher versus lower intakes of dietary soy isoflavones (20 mg/day vs. 5 mg/day) were found to be associated with a 29% reduced risk of breast cancer [(22)](#reference22). In [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) conducted in Western populations, median intake of soy isoflavones was reportedly low (0.3 mg/day) and not associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer [(22, 23)](#reference22). Moreover, a lifelong exposure to isoflavones may be needed to lower the risk of developing breast cancer later in life [(21)](#reference21). This would explain why moderate versus low intakes of isoflavones (10.8 mg/day vs. 0.23 mg/day; cohort followed for a median of 7.4 years) during adulthood was not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in British women enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study [(24)](#reference24). A few case-control studies also reported that early soy exposure \u2014 during childhood and adolescence \u2014 might be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer later in life [(25-28)](#reference25). Further, a meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies suggested that high versus low isoflavone intakes might be associated with a modest reduction in risk of recurrence ( [RR](../../glossary#relative-risk)=0.84, 95% [CI](../../glossary#confidence-interval): 0.71-0.99) in breast cancer survivors (see for breast cancer survivors](#adverse-effects)) [(23)](#reference23). While lower circulating [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) concentrations have been linked to a lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women [(29)](#reference29), a meta-analysis of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in this population found no effect of soy isoflavone supplementation on the circulating concentrations of estrogenic [hormones](../../glossary#hormone), estradiol (21 studies) and estrone (7 studies), and of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG; 17 studies) [(30)](#reference30). Another meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials in 1,287 women found no overall effect of soy isoflavones (40 to 120 mg/day) consumed for six months to three years on mammographic breast density, used as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk [(31)](#reference31). Subgroup analyses showed no effect in postmenopausal women (four studies) but a modest increase in breast density \u2014 of unclear clinical significance \u2014 in premenopausal women (five studies). Further, in a recent [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial, soy isoflavone supplementation (50 mg/day for one year) also failed to affect breast density in women (ages, 30 to 75 years) with breast cancer [(32)](#reference32). There is currently little evidence that taking soy isoflavone supplements decreases the risk of incident and recurrent breast cancer. It is thought that the development of [endometrial](../../glossary#endometrium) (uterine) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) could be related to prolonged exposure to unopposed [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen), i.e., estrogen not counterbalanced with the [hormone](../../glossary#hormone) progesterone [(33)](#reference33). Excess estrogen relative to progesterone may result in endometrial thickening, a potential [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) of estrogen-induced [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and a of Whether high intakes of isoflavones with anti-estrogenic activity in uterine tissue could be associated with a lower [risk](../../glossary#risk) of endometrial cancer has been examined in a number of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study). A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of two [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and eight [case-control studies](../../glossary#case-control-study) found the highest versus lowest quantile of isoflavone intake to be associated with a 19% lower risk of endometrial cancer [(35)](#reference35). One of the two prospective studies included in the meta-analysis found no association between consumption of total soy foods, [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), and tofu and risk of endometrial cancer in a cohort of 46,027 multiethnic US women (mean age at cohort entry, 61.6 years) followed for a median 13.6 years [(36)](#reference36). Nevertheless, a 34% lower risk of endometrial cancer was found to be associated with the highest versus lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of total this cohort [(36)](#reference36). In the second prospective study, no association was observed between the top versus bottom [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of isoflavone intakes (median intakes, risk of endometrial cancer risk in 49,121 Japanese women (ages, 45 to 74 years) [(37)](#reference37). Because the consumption of isoflavones is much lower in non-Asian versus Asian cohorts, comparisons among populations are quite problematic and limit the scope of pooled analyses of observational studies [(38)](#reference38). Finally, a recent meta-analysis of 23 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no overall effect of isoflavone supplementation (5 to 154 mg/day) for up to three years on endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women [(39)](#reference39). Nevertheless, a subgroup analysis of 10 trials showed that supplementation of postmenopausal women with isoflavone doses >54 mg/day of isoflavones could significantly decrease endometrial thickness [(39)](#reference39). Although limited evidence from case-control studies showed an [inverse relationship](../../glossary#inverse-association) between consumption of soy foods and endometrial cancer, there is little evidence from [intervention trials](../../glossary#intervention-trial) to suggest that taking soy isoflavone supplements could decrease the risk of endometrial cancer. Incidence rates of [prostate](../../glossary#prostate) [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) are much higher in Northern America, Northern and Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand compared to Asian countries, such as Japan and China, where isoflavone-rich soybeans are common components of the diet [(19)](#reference19). Soy food consumption has been associated with a reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of prostate cancer in recent pooled analyses of [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) [(40, 41)](#reference40). In a study of 19 men with prostate cancer, daily soy supplementation resulted in soy isoflavone concentrations six-fold higher in prostate tissue than in [serum](../../glossary#serum) [(42)](#reference42). The results of cell culture and animal studies have suggested a potential role for soy isoflavones in limiting the progression of prostate cancer (reviewed in [43](#reference43)). A number of small, short-term [randomized controlled interventions](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the effect of soy foods/isoflavones on [biomarkers](../../glossary#biomarker) of prostate cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) [(44)](#reference44). Compared to supplementation with milk protein, consumption of a diet supplemented with soy protein isolate high in isoflavones (~107 mg/day) limited the rise in androgen [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) density in prostate tissue after six months but did not modify prostatic estrogen receptor- expression or circulating sex steroid hormone profile in men at high risk of developing prostate cancer [(45)](#reference45). In addition, dietary soy protein supplementation had no effect on [prostate-specific antigen](../../glossary#prostate-specific-antigen) (PSA) in serum or markers of cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) and [apoptosis](../../glossary#apoptosis) in premalignant tissue. Yet, supplemental soy protein isolate \u2014 regardless of isoflavone content \u2014 for six months resulted in a lower cancer incidence compared to milk control [(46)](#reference46). In a multicenter, randomized, [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 158 Japanese men (ages, 50 to 75 years) with negative prostate biopsy but rising serum PSA, supplemental isoflavones (60 mg/day) for one year had no effect on circulating concentrations of PSA and sex steroid hormones, or on the overall incidence of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer. However, prostate cancer incidence was found to be significantly lower with isoflavones compared to placebo in the subset of men aged 65 years and older [(47)](#reference47). Some trials found that supplementation with soy products, soy dietary proteins, or soy isoflavones could reduce or slow down the rising of serum PSA concentration in men with localized prostate cancer prior to therapy [(48-50)](#reference48), as well as in those with PSA biochemical recurrence following radiotherapy and/or prostatectomy [(51-53)](#reference51). However, other trials failed to show an effect of soy food/isoflavones on serum PSA in prostate cancer patients prior to [(54, 55)](#reference54) or after therapy [(56-58)](#reference56). [Clinical studies](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have also failed to show a protective effect of soy isoflavones on circulating concentrations of sex hormones (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in patients with prostate cancer [(44)](#reference44). Pooled analyses of current data are hindered by the [heterogeneity](../../glossary#heterogeneous) in soy/soy isoflavone preparations and dosage regimens in short-term interventions (mostly 6 months) in small sample-size trials. Therefore, despite a good safety profile for supplemental soy isoflavones and soy proteins in prostate cancer patients, larger randomized controlled trials with longer periods of intervention are required to assess whether soy isoflavones could influence the development and/or progression of prostate cancer. More information about soy foods and prostate cancer risk may be found in the article on [Legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes#prostate-cancer-prevention). The decline in [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) production that accompanies menopause places middle-aged women at [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [osteopenia](../../glossary#osteopenia) and [osteoporosis](../../glossary#osteoporosis). The measurement [bone mineral density](../../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) loss by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is generally used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis [(59)](#reference59). Whether the estrogenic properties of soy isoflavones might play any role in preserving bone health and preventing bone loss is unclear. To date, the results of [observational](../../glossary#observational-study) and [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) examining the potential protection of soy isoflavones against BMD loss have been inconsistent. A recent review by Zheng et al. [(60)](#reference60) discussed some potential factors relative to study design (e.g., intervention duration, isoflavone dosages) and target populations (e.g., ethnic and genetic differences, hormonal status) that could explain the conflicting study results. For instance, the results of short-term (6 months) [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) assessing the effects of increased soy intake on biochemical markers of bone formation and bone [resorption](../../glossary#resorption) are inconsistent. Some controlled trials in postmenopausal women have found that increasing intakes of soy foods, soy protein, or soy isoflavones improved markers of bone resorption and formation [(61-64)](#reference61) or attenuated bone loss [(64, 65)](#reference64), but other trials have found no significant benefit of increasing soy intakes [(66-69)](#reference66). Trials of longer duration also showed conflicting [results.](#reference60) A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (trial duration, 12 to 24 months) concluded that a mean dose of 87 mg/day of soy isoflavones resulted in no significant changes in [lumbar spine](../../glossary#lumbar-spine), total hip, or [femoral neck](../../glossary#femoral-neck) BMD of postmenopausal women [(70)](#reference70). Mixed results also emerged from studies conducted in different ethnic populations. Compared to Caucasian women, the incidence of hip [fractures](../../glossary#fracture) tend to be lower among Asian women who are habitual soy food consumers [(71, 72)](#reference71), suggesting that long-term soy food consumption might protect against bone loss or osteoporotic fracture [(73, 74)](#reference73). Moreover, pooled analyses combining intervention trials in Caucasian and Asian postmenopausal women reported significant increases in BMD with supplemental soy isoflavones [(75-77)](#reference75). In contrast, a meta-analysis of 12 placebo-controlled trials in Caucasian postmenopausal women found no effect of soy isoflavone supplementation (dose range, 52 to 120 mg/day) for six months to three years on lumbar spine BMD [(78)](#reference78). The rate of bone loss is not linear during the 10-year period surrounding the final menstrual period and is especially increased during the menopausal transition, starting about one year before to two years after the final menstrual period. Surprisingly, the recent US Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) that followed Black, White, Japanese, and Chinese women reported that Japanese women with the highest versus lowest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of dietary isoflavone intakes (median intakes, 36.3 mg/day versus 4 mg/day) had an increased rate of BMD loss during menopause transition [(79)](#reference79). In other ethnic groups, no such associations could be found between habitual dietary isoflavone intakes and the rate of bone loss before, after, or during menopause transition [(79)](#reference79). Most meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials to date have reported a weak, positive effect of supplemental soy isoflavones on BMD in postmenopausal women [(70](#reference70), [75-77)](#reference75). Yet, it remains to be elucidated whether supplementation with soy isoflavones might be of any benefit to perimenopausal/early postmenopausal women before the acute loss of estrogen or to older postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis [(60)](#reference60). Finally, some authors have proposed that the effect of soy isoflavones on bone health may be dependent on whether or not the individual produces the daidzein [metabolite](../../glossary#metabolite), equol (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) [(80-84)](#reference80). However, a randomized controlled trial found that supplementation with soy isoflavones increased calcium retention capacity in postmenopausal women regardless of their equol-producing capacity [(85)](#reference85). At present, the clinical benefits of soy isoflavones as an alternative to bone-sparing treatments in women undergoing menopause remain to be determined. To date, large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), mainly in Asian populations, investigating whether habitual soy food/isoflavone consumption is related to the incidence of [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [myocardial infarction](../../glossary#myocardial-infarction), have found mixed results. In the Japan Public Health Center-based Study (mean follow-up, 13.5 years), consumption of soy foods was associated with a reduced [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [stroke](../../glossary#stroke) in Japanese women (ages, 40 to 59 years) \u2014 but not in men. In this cohort, the highest versus lowest [quintile](../../glossary#quintile) of soy isoflavone intakes was found to be associated with a 65% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a 63% lower risk of myocardial infarction in women [(86)](#reference86). In addition, an early data analysis of 64,915 Chinese women (ages 40 to 70 years) enrolled in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) found an [inverse relationship](../../glossary#inverse-association) between soy food intake and risk of incident CHD during a 2.5-year follow-up period [(87)](#reference87). However, a higher soy protein intake was associated with a higher risk of incident CHD in 55,474 Chinese men (ages, 40 to 74 years) from the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS; mean follow-up of 5.4 years) [(88)](#reference88). Moreover, a recent report of the SWHS cohort followed for 10 years reported a 24% higher risk of ischemic stroke with the highest versus lowest quintile of isoflavone (mean [nested studies](../../glossary#nested-case-control-study) within both Shanghai prospective studies found no correlations between soy food intake and incident CVD events when measures of urinary isoflavonoids were used as a more objective estimate of isoflavone exposure compared to dietary assessment with [food-frequency questionnaires](../../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) [(89, 90)](#reference89). Further, no significant associations were found between long-term soy food, soy protein, and soy isoflavone consumption and CHD-, stroke-, and total CVD-related mortality in a 14.7-year follow-up of 60,298 participants of the Singapore Chinese Health Study [(91)](#reference91). Low consumption of soy foods in Western cohorts makes it more difficult to analyze possible longitudinal associations between isoflavone intake and CVD incidence or mortality in these populations [(92-95)](#reference92). A number of [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined soy intake in relation to several cardiometabolic [risk](../../glossary#risk) factors. A recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) concluded that intake of either soy products (i.e., whole soybeans, soy milk, nuts, oil, and flour), soy protein isolate, or soy isoflavones for one month to one year could significantly improve [serum](../../glossary#serum) [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) profiles in healthy and hypercholesterolemic individuals by lowering circulating triglycerides, total [cholesterol](../../glossary#cholesterol), and [LDL](../../glossary#LDL)-cholesterol, and by increasing [HDL](../../glossary#HDL)-cholesterol [(96)](#reference96). Further analyses suggested that soy protein without isoflavones was more effective at lowering total and LDL-cholesterol than soy protein containing isoflavones, and the consumption of soy isoflavones alone (as [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) or extracts) showed no significant effects on serum lipid profiles [(96)](#reference96). In addition, a [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [randomized controlled studies](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) indicated that neither soy foods nor soy isoflavones could lower blood [homocysteine](../../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations, a known risk factor for CVD, in high-risk middle-aged and older adults [(97)](#reference97). Another meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled studies reported a reduction in circulating [C-reactive protein](../../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) \u2014 an [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation) marker associated with increased cardiovascular risk \u2014 following soy isoflavone intake (from soy foods or isoflavone extracts) in postmenopausal women with elevated baseline CRP concentrations (>2.2 mg/L) [(98)](#reference98). In a recent six-month 253 postmenopausal equol-producing women with prehypertension, supplementation with whole soy \u2014 but not daidzein \u2014 improved lipid profiles and lowered the concentrations of CRP [(99)](#reference99). Whether potential cardiovascular benefits of soy isoflavone intake depend on individuals' capacity to produce isoflavone [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite) (like equol) needs to be more closely examined. Current evidence suggests that whole soy components other than isoflavones may have favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors. The preservation of normal arterial function plays an important role in [cardiovascular disease](../../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) prevention. The ability of all types of blood vessels, including arteries, to dilate in response to [nitric oxide](../../glossary#nitric-oxide) (NO) produced by the [endothelial](../../glossary#vascular-endothelium) cells that line their inner surface is compromised in people at high [risk](../../glossary#risk) for cardiovascular disease [(100)](#reference100). In the presence of [cardiovascular](../../glossary#cardiovascular) risk factors (e.g., [hypertension](../../glossary#hypertension), hypercholesterolemia, [hyperglycemia](../../glossary#hyperglycemia)), impaired endothelial function results in widespread [vasodilation](../../glossary#vasodilation) and [coagulation](../../glossary#coagulation) abnormalities and is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../../glossary#atherosclerosis). Measures of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a surrogate marker of endothelial function, have been found to be [inversely associated](../../glossary#inverse-association) with risk of future cardiovascular events [(101)](#reference101). A [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine small [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials found that supplementation with soy isoflavones (50 to 99 mg/day; isolated or from isoflavone-containing soy protein) for a median eight-week period significantly increased brachial FMD, especially in postmenopausal women with low FMD levels [(102)](#reference102). A more inclusive meta-analysis of 17 trials in either healthy individuals or in individuals with [hyperlipidemia](../../glossary#hyperlipidemia) showed an increase of FMD with the intake of isolated isoflavones but not of isoflavones-containing soy protein [(103)](#reference103). Arterial stiffness or impaired arterial distensibility, another marker of vascular damage and an indicator of cardiovascular disease risk, is generally assessed using measures of aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV) [(104)](#reference104). Some, but not trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) have suggested that supplementation with isoflavone-containing soy protein or isoflavone extracts might significantly decrease arterial stiffness [(105-107)](#reference105). A recent randomized, [double-blind](../../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study found that carotid-femoral PWV could be significantly reduced 24 hours after a single oral intake of 80 mg of soy isoflavones but only in participants able to produce equol [(3)](#reference3). Long-term interventions are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of such a result. Finally, whether whole soy or isoflavones reduce the burden of [subclinical](../../glossary#subclinical) atherosclerosis [(99](#reference99), [108)](#reference108) and lower blood pressure [(109)](#reference109) in individuals at high CVD risk requires further examination. Scientific research on the effect of soy isoflavones on [cognitive](../../glossary#cognitive) function has been recently reviewed by Soni et al. [(110)](#reference110). An [observational study](../../glossary#observational-study) \u2014 the Honolulu-Asia Asian Study \u2014 that examined the relationship between soy intake and cognitive function found that Hawaiian men who reported consuming tofu (non-fermented soy product) at least twice weekly during midlife were more likely to have poor cognitive test scores 20 to 25 years later than those who reported consuming tofu less than twice a week [(111)](#reference111). In an Indonesian study of elderly men and women, consumption of tofu was associated with worse memory, while consumption of tempeh (fermented soy) was associated with improved memory [(112)](#reference112). In the multicenter, [prospective](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), SWAN [phytoestrogen](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) ancillary study, the highest versus lowest [tertile](../../glossary#tertile) of isoflavone intakes was found to be associated with better scores in the processing speed test but worse scores in the verbal memory test in late perimenopausal and postmenopausal Asian women [(79)](#reference79). The results of several [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have been mixed. In a review of 12 trials, only half reported an improvement in cognitive function with soy isoflavone supplementation [(110)](#reference110). Postmenopausal women given soy extracts, providing 60 mg/day of soy isoflavones for 6 to 12 weeks, performed better on cognitive tests of picture recall (short-term memory), learning rule reversals (mental flexibility), and a planning task compared to women given a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo) [(113, 114)](#reference113). In a longer trial, postmenopausal women given [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) that provided 110 mg/day of soy isoflavones for six months performed better on a test of verbal fluency than women given placebos [(115)](#reference115). In a [cross-over trial](../../glossary#cross-over-trial) lasting six months, women receiving 60 mg/day of soy isoflavones experienced significant improvements in cognitive performance and overall mood compared to when the women were given a placebo [(116)](#reference116). However, in larger placebo-controlled trials, 80 mg/day of isoflavones for six months [(117)](#reference117) or 99 mg/day of isoflavones for one year [(118)](#reference118) did not affect performance on a battery of cognitive function tests, including tests for memory, attention, verbal fluency, motor control, and [dementia](../../glossary#dementia) in postmenopausal women. In addition, in the 30-month Women's Isoflavone Soy Health trial in 313 postmenopausal women, daily supplementation with 91 mg of soy isoflavones significantly improved visual memory but failed to improve other aspects of cognition or global cognition [(119)](#reference119). Nevertheless, a recent [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 randomized controlled trials found a significant improvement in the pooled summary of cognitive function tests in healthy postmenopausal women supplemented with 60 to 160 mg/day of soy isoflavones for 6 to 30 months [(120)](#reference120). There has been little investigation regarding the potential effects of soy isoflavones in individuals with cognitive impairments [(121)](#reference121). Menopause-related vasomotor symptoms, including hot flashes (flushes) and sweats, affect over 75% of middle-aged US women [(122)](#reference122). Concern over potential adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy [(123, 124)](#reference123) has led to an increased interest in the use of [phytoestrogen](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) in the management of menopausal symptoms [(125)](#reference125). To date, the effects of increasing soy isoflavone intake on the frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms have been examined in over 60 [randomized controlled trials](../../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of small sample size [(126)](#reference126). The results of these trials have been mixed, as reflected by the conclusions of several [systematic reviews](../../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analyses](../../glossary#meta-analysis) published in the last decade [(125](#reference125), [127-134)](#reference127). However, a systematic Cochrane review published in 2013 concluded that supplements containing primarily genistein (four studies; 30 to 60 mg/day for 12 weeks to one year) \u2014 but not dietary soy (13 studies), soy isoflavone extracts (12 studies), or red clover extracts (nine studies) \u2014 significantly reduced the frequency of hot flashes [(131)](#reference131). This result was consistent with previous analyses reporting alleviation of hot flashes in higher- rather than lower-genistein supplementation trials [(126](#reference126), [133, 134)](#reference133). Nevertheless, in Taku et al. [(133)](#reference133), supplemental soy isoflavone extract (30 to 80 mg/day for six weeks to one year) was found to result in a net 17.4% reduction in hot flash frequency in 13 [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials (1,196 women). In addition, the meta-analysis of nine trials (988 women) showed a 30.5% reduction in hot flash severity with soy isoflavone extracts (30 to 135 mg/day for 12 weeks to one year) [(133)](#reference133). Moreover, the observation that longer trials showed a greater efficacy of soy isoflavones was confirmed in a recent model-based meta-analysis by Li et al. [(135)](#reference135). In this analysis of 16 studies, the authors estimated that supplementation with soy isoflavones required 48 weeks of treatment, compared to only 12 weeks for estradiol, in order to achieve close to 80% of its maximum effect [(135)](#reference135). Besides, the maximum effect of soy isoflavones was found to account for only 57% of the maximum effect of estradiol [(135)](#reference135). Evidence from [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) suggested that one's ability to produce equol might contribute to reducing the occurrence or severity of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women (see [Metabolism and Bioavailability](#metabolism-bioavailability)) [(136, 137)](#reference136). Several relatively small [intervention studies](../../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined the potential of equol to relieve these symptoms (reviewed in [138)](#reference138). A recent study in Chinese postmenopausal and equol-producing women showed no benefits of daily supplementation with soy flour (40 g) or daidzein (63 mg) for six months on the frequency or severity of menopausal symptoms [(139)](#reference139). Yet, an earlier randomized controlled study found that, compared to equol non-producing women, those able to produce equol experienced improvements in menopausal symptoms like hot flashes following soy isoflavone supplementation (135 mg/day) for six months [(140)](#reference140). In addition, the 12-week administration of 10 mg/day of equol to equol non-producing Japanese women experiencing three or more daily hot flashes significantly reduced the frequency and severity of hot flashes and neck and shoulder muscle stiffness compared to a placebo [(141)](#reference141). In another study, daily supplementation with soy isoflavone (containing 24 mg of daidzein and 22 mg of genistein) or equol (10, 20, or 40 mg) supplements over an eight-week period resulted in equivalent reductions of the frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal women with five or more daily hot flashes; however, 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day of equol supplements proved to be more effective than soy isoflavone supplements in the subgroup of women experiencing eight or more hot flashes per day [(142)](#reference142). Nevertheless, because this study lacked an inert placebo control group, the results should be viewed with caution. At present, supplements containing sufficient amounts of genistein may help alleviate vasomotor symptoms in women transitioning through menopause [(126,](#reference126) [143)](#reference143). Isoflavones are found in small amounts in a number of [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), grains, and vegetables, but soybeans are by far the most concentrated source of isoflavones in the human diet [(144, 145)](#reference144). Average dietary isoflavone intakes in Japan, China, and other Asian countries range from 25 to 50 mg/day [(20)](#reference20). Dietary isoflavone intakes are considerably lower in Western countries. Twenty-four-hour dietary recall data collected from 36,037 individuals in 10 countries (participating in the EPIC study) showed average isoflavone intakes to be lower than 1 mg/day [(146)](#reference146). Compared to other European countries, the isoflavone intake was slightly higher in the British general population (2.3 mg/day) and health-conscious cohort (19.4 mg/day) [(146)](#reference146). Traditional Asian foods from soybeans include tofu, tempeh, miso, and natto. Edamame refers to varieties of soybeans that are harvested and eaten in their green phase. Soy products that are gaining popularity in Western countries include soy-based meat substitutes, soy milk, soy cheese, and soy yogurt. The isoflavone content of a soy protein isolate depends on the method used to isolate it. Soy protein isolates prepared by an ethanol wash process generally lose most of their associated isoflavones, while those prepared by aqueous wash processes tend to retain them [(147)](#reference147). Some foods that are rich in soy isoflavones are listed in Table 1, along with their isoflavone content. Because the isoflavone content of soy foods can vary considerably among brands and among different lots of the same brand [(147)](#reference147), these values should be viewed only as a guide. Given the potential health implications of diets rich in soy isoflavones, accurate and consistent labeling of the soy isoflavone content of soy foods is needed. Of note, foods of animal origin also contain low levels of isoflavones (and other [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen)), derived from animal feeds and pastures [(148)](#reference148). More information on the isoflavone content of foods is available from the [USDA Food Composition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/) website and the USDA Database for the Isoflavone Content of Selected content of soy foods can vary considerably between brands and between different lots of the same brand (147); therefore, these values should be viewed only as a guide.| Soy isoflavone extracts and [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) are available as dietary supplements without a prescription in the US. These products are not standardized, and the amounts of soy isoflavones they provide may vary considerably. Moreover, quality control may be an issue with some of these products [(150)](#reference150). When isoflavone supplements available in the US were tested for their isoflavone content by an independent laboratory, the isoflavone content in the product differed by more than 10% from the amount claimed on the label in approximately 50% of the products tested [(151)](#reference151). Soy protein-based infant formulas are made from soy protein isolate and contain significant amounts of soy isoflavones (Table 2). In 1997, the total isoflavone content of soy-based infant formulas that were commercially available in the US ranged from 32 to 47 mg/liter feed (formerly Wyeth-Ayerst)||8 fl oz.||6.4||1.8||3.9||0.7| Soy isoflavones have been consumed by humans as part of soy-based diets for many years without any evidence of adverse effects [(145)](#reference145). The 75th percentile of dietary isoflavone intake has been reported to be as high as 65 mg/day in some Asian populations [(153)](#reference153). Although diets rich in soy or soy-containing products appear safe and potentially beneficial, the long-term safety of very high [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) doses of soy isoflavones is not yet known. One study in older men and women found that 100 mg/day of soy isoflavones for six months was well tolerated [(154)](#reference154). Yet, longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the safety of isoflavones. The safety of high intakes of soy isoflavones and other [phytoestrogens](../../glossary#phytoestrogen) for breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) survivors is an area of concern among scientists and clinicians. The results of cell culture and animal studies have been conflicting; some preclinical studies showed that soy isoflavones might stimulate the growth of [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) [receptor](../../glossary#receptor)-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells [(155, 156)](#reference155), while others that they might either potentiate [(157, 158)](#reference157) or abrogate the anticancer effects of tamoxifen tissue [(159, 160)](#reference159). Very limited data from [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) suggested that increased consumption of soy isoflavones (38 to 45 mg/day) may show weak estrogenic effects in human breast tissue [(161, 162)](#reference161). However, a study in women with biopsy-confirmed breast cancer found that supplementation with 200 mg/day of soy isoflavones did not increase breast cell [proliferation](../../glossary#proliferation) \u2014 a marker of breast cancer [risk](../../glossary#risk) \u2014 over the two to six weeks before surgery when compared to a control group that did not take soy isoflavones [(163)](#reference163). A few large [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined the association between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer recurrence and survival. In the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study that followed 5,042 female breast cancer survivors for a median of 3.9 years, consumption of isoflavone-rich soy foods was significantly associated with a 29% lower risk of death and a 32% lower risk of cancer recurrence [(164)](#reference164). In this study, soy isoflavone intake was associated with a significant 23% reduced risk of cancer recurrence and a nonsignificant 21% reduced risk of death [(164)](#reference164). A pooled analysis of data from 9,514 breast cancer survivors from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study [(164)](#reference164), the Life After Cancer Epidemiology study [(165)](#reference165), and the Women's Healthy Eating and Living study [(166)](#reference166) found a 25% reduced risk of recurrence with soy isoflavone intakes 10 mg/day (compared to intakes of <4 A subgroup analysis showed that the [inverse association](../../glossary#inverse-association) between soy isoflavone intake and recurrence was significant only among women taking the anticancer drug, tamoxifen. No inverse association was reported between soy isoflavone intake and the risks of all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality [(167)](#reference167). Given the available data, some experts think that women with a history of breast cancer, particularly ER+ breast cancer, should not increase their consumption of phytoestrogens, including soy isoflavones [(168)](#reference168). Nevertheless, there is not enough evidence to discourage breast cancer survivors from consuming soy foods in moderation [(143](#reference143), [169)](#reference169). Infant formula made from soy protein isolate has been commercially available since the mid-1960s [(170)](#reference170). As much as 25% of the infant formula sold in the US is soy protein-based formula [(171)](#reference171). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports the use of soy protein isolate-based formula for normal growth and development of term infants whose needs are not being met by human milk or cow's milk-based formulas [(171)](#reference171). Soy protein-based formulas are especially indicated for infants with galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency, but they have no proven value in the prevention or management of infantile colic and fussiness [(171)](#reference171). Since infants fed soy-based formulas are exposed to relatively high levels of isoflavones [(152)](#reference152), which they can absorb and [metabolize](../../glossary#metabolism), concern has been raised regarding potential long-term effects on anthropometric growth, bone health, as well as reproductive, [endocrine](../../glossary#endocrine-system), and immune functions [(152](#reference152), [172)](#reference172). In addition to the AAP review [(171)](#reference171), a recent [systematic review](../../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../../glossary#meta-analysis) of data published between 1909 and 2013 found no clinical concerns regarding nutritional adequacy, sexual development, thyroid disease, immune function, and neurodevelopment in infants fed soy protein-fed formulas [(173)](#reference173). Specifically, this review identified 14 [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) comparing infants fed soy-based formula with infants fed human milk or cow's milk-based formula and found that soy-based formula adequately supported growth and development in the first year of life [(173)](#reference173). In addition, the results of three [observational studies](../../glossary#observational-study) suggested no adverse effects of soy protein-based formula on the neurodevelopment of children [(174-176)](#reference174). Two of these observational studies of low-to-moderate quality also reported associations between soy protein-based formula intake and marginal adverse events, including early [menarche](../../glossary#menarche) [(176, 177)](#reference176) and increased duration of menstrual bleeding [(176)](#reference176). A recent [prospective cohort study](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) (the Beginnings study) examining the effects of early infant feeding on reproductive organ development during childhood found no differences in the volume and structure of the reproductive organs of 101 five-year-old boys and girls who were either breastfed or fed soy protein- or cow's milk-based formula as infants [(178)](#reference178). Finally, no adverse health effects have been associated with the presence of phytates and aluminum in soy protein-based formulas fed to full-term infants (reviewed in [173](#reference173)). At present, there is no convincing evidence that infants fed soy protein-based formula are at greater [risk](../../glossary#risk) for adverse effects than infants fed cow's milk-based formula. Nonetheless, if current evidence shows a safety profile for use of soy protein-based formulas in term infants, they are not designed or recommended for preterm infants [(171)](#reference171). Also, recent preliminary findings suggesting potential links between consumption of soy protein-based formulas and adverse effects in autistic children deserve further investigation [(179, 180)](#reference179). Claims that soy food/isoflavone consumption can have adverse effects on male reproductive function, including feminization, erectile dysfunction, and infertility, are primarily based on animal studies and [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) [(181)](#reference181). Exposure to isoflavones (including at levels above typical Asian dietary intakes) has not been shown to affect either the concentrations of [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) and testosterone, or the quality of sperm and semen [(181, 182)](#reference181). Thorough reviews of the literature found no basis for concern but emphasized the need for long-term, large scale comprehensive human studies [(181, 183)](#reference181). In cell culture and animal studies, soy isoflavones have been found to inhibit the activity of [thyroid](../../glossary#thyroid) peroxidase, an [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) required for thyroid However, high intakes of soy isoflavones do not appear to increase the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of hypothyroidism as long as dietary iodine consumption is adequate [(186)](#reference186). Since the addition of iodine to soy-based formulas in the 1960s, there have been no further reports of hypothyroidism in soy formula-fed infants [(187)](#reference187). Several [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial), mostly in women with sufficient iodine intakes, have not found increased consumption of soy isoflavones to result in clinically significant changes in circulating thyroid hormone concentrations [(188-192)](#reference188). To date, studies have not examined the effect of an isoflavone-rich diet on fetal development or pregnancy outcomes in humans, and the safety of isoflavone [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy has not been established. [Fermented](../../glossary#fermentation) soy foods contain highly variable amounts of the biologically active amine, tyramine, which is [catabolized](../../glossary#catabolism) in the body by monoamine oxidase [enzyme](../../glossary#enzyme) (MAO) and [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) in the urine. The ingestion of very high amount of tyramine may saturate the detoxification system and lead to clinical symptoms of intoxication. Because individuals taking MAO inhibitors (MAOIs; phenelzine, tranylcypromine) are at greater [risk](../../glossary#risk) of adverse effects, they should avoid consuming fermented soy products [(193, 194)](#reference193). Because [colonic](../../glossary#colon) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) play an important role in the [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of soy isoflavones, antibiotic therapy could decrease their biological activity [(193)](#reference193). Some evidence from animal studies suggested that high intakes of soy isoflavones, particularly genistein, could interfere with the antitumor effects of tamoxifen (Nolvadex) [(159)](#reference159). Yet, a recent pooled analysis of three [prospective cohort studies](../../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found that the risk of recurrence in breast [cancer](../../glossary#cancer) survivors was reduced to a greater extent with soy isoflavone intake in tamoxifen users than in nonusers (see [Safety for breast cancer survivors](#adverse-effects)) [(167)](#reference167). Nonetheless, until more is known about potential interactions in humans, those taking tamoxifen or other selective [estrogen](../../glossary#estrogen) [receptor](../../glossary#receptor) modulators (SERMs) to treat or prevent breast cancer should be cautious and seek medical advice regarding the use of soy protein [supplements](../../glossary#supplement) or isoflavone extracts [(193)](#reference193). High intakes of soy protein may interfere with the efficacy of the [anticoagulant](../../glossary#anticoagulant) medication warfarin. There is one [case report](../../glossary#case-report) of an who developed subtherapeutic normalized ratio](../../glossary#international-normalized-ratio) (INR; prothrombin time) values upon consuming ~16 ounces of soy milk daily for four weeks [(195)](#reference195). INR values returned to therapeutic levels two weeks after discontinuing soy milk. The amount of levothyroxine required for adequate [thyroid](../../glossary#thyroid) [hormone](../../glossary#hormone) replacement has been found to increase in infants with [congenital hypothyroidism](../../glossary#congenital-hypothyroidism) fed soy formula [(187](#reference187), [196)](#reference196). Taking levothyroxine at the same time as a soy protein supplement also increased the levothyroxine dose required for adequate thyroid hormone replacement in an adult with hypothyroidism [(197)](#reference197). Regular consumption of a diet high in soy \u2014 rather than supplementation with isoflavone extracts or isoflavone containing isolated soy protein \u2014 may help lower fasting [glucose](../../glossary#glucose) concentrations [(198)](#reference198). It is unknown whether individuals taking antidiabetic agents might be at risk of hypoglycemia if they follow a soy-based meal replacement plan rather than a diet plan recommended by the American Diabetes Association [(199)](#reference199).

Plants use chlorophyll to trap light needed for photosynthesis [(1)](#references). The basic structure of chlorophyll is a porphyrin ring similar to that of [heme](../../glossary#heme) in [hemoglobin](../../glossary#hemoglobin), although the central atom in chlorophyll is [magnesium](../../minerals/magnesium) instead of [iron](../../minerals/iron). The long hydrocarbon (phytol) tail attached to the porphyrin ring makes chlorophyll fat-soluble and insoluble in water. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b represent about 99% of the chlorophyll species found in edible plants (Figure 1; [2](#reference2)), while some algae and microalgae contain minor quantities chlorophyll c pigments (e.g., Laminaria ochroleuca, Undaria pinnatifida) [(3)](#reference3). Chlorophyll a and b only have a small difference in one of the side chains but an intact phytol tail, while the common characteristic of chlorophyll c isoforms is the absence of a phytol tail. These structural differences cause each type of chlorophyll to absorb light at slightly different wavelengths. Metallo-chlorophyll derivatives, including chlorophyllins, can be chemically synthesized or produced in industrial food processing; these compounds contain [zinc](../../minerals/zinc), iron, or [copper](../../minerals/copper) in place of the central magnesium atom [(2)](#reference2). The most studied chlorophyllin, sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), is a semi-synthetic mixture of sodium copper salts derived from chlorophyll [(4, 5)](#reference4). SCC is often simply called 'chlorophyllin' in the older scientific literature, with newer publications specifying whether iron, zinc, copper, or magnesium chlorophyllin were studied. During its synthesis, the magnesium atom at the center of the ring is replaced with copper (or other metals), and the phytol tail is lost. Unlike natural chlorophyll, chlorophyllins (regardless of the metal used) are water-soluble. Although the content of different SCC mixtures may vary, two compounds commonly found in commercial SCC are trisodium copper chlorin e6 and disodium copper chlorin e4 (Figure 2). Little is known about the [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) and [metabolism](../../glossary#metabolism) of chlorophyll in humans, although it is known that chlorophyll undergoes extensive metabolism once consumed. Animal model studies show only about 1%-3% of chlorophyll is absorbed, while the rest is [excreted](../../glossary#excretion) in the feces, primarily as pheopytin and pyropheophytin metabolites, indicating that significant transformation and microbial metabolism occur in the gastrointestinal tract (reviewed in [2](#reference2)). A recent study in eight healthy adults found pheophytin and pheophorbide derivatives in the blood of most subjects following consumption of 1.2 kg boiled spinach, a concentrated source of chlorophyll [(6)](#reference6). Sodium copper chlorophyllin was originally thought to be poorly absorbed because of its lack of apparent toxicity. However, a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trial](../../glossary#clinical-trial) found that significant amounts of copper chlorin e4 in the [serum](../../glossary#serum) of people taking chlorophyllin tablets (300 mg/day) [(7)](#reference7), indicating that it is indeed absorbed. [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies have found chlorin e4 to have a higher stability than chlorin e6 [(2)](#reference2). More research, however, is needed to understand the bioavailability and metabolism of natural chlorophylls and chlorin compounds in synthetic chlorophyllin. Chlorophyll and sodium copper chlorophyllin are able to form tight molecular complexes with certain chemicals known or suspected to cause [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), including polyaromatic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke [(8)](#reference8), some amines found in cooked meat [(9)](#reference9), and aflatoxin-B1 [(10)](#reference10). The binding of chlorophyll or SCC to these potential [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) may interfere with [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption of potential carcinogens, reducing the amount that reaches susceptible tissues [(11)](#reference11). This has been demonstrated in humans: a [cross-over study](../../glossary#cross-over-trial) in three volunteers that used accelerator mass spectrometry to study the [pharmacokinetics](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) of an ultra-low dose of aflatoxin-B1 found a 150-mg dose of either SCC or chlorophyll could decrease absorption of aflatoxin-B1 [(12)](#reference12). SCC can neutralize several physically relevant [oxidants](../../glossary#oxidant) [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) [(13-16)](#reference13), and limited data from animal studies suggest that SCC [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) may decrease [oxidative damage](../../glossary#oxidative-damage) induced by chemical [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) and radiation [(17, 18)](#reference17). While chlorophyll and its derivatives have demonstrated [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) activity in in vitro assays [(15](#reference15), [19)](#reference19), the relevance of these findings to humans is not clear. To initiate the development of [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), some chemicals ( [procarcinogens](../../glossary#procarcinogen)) must first be metabolized to active [carcinogens](../../glossary#carcinogen) that are capable of damaging [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) or other critical molecules in susceptible tissues. Since [enzymes](../../glossary#enzyme) in the [cytochrome P450](../../glossary#cytochrome-P450) family are required for the activation of some procarcinogens, inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes may decrease the [risk](../../glossary#risk) of some types of chemically induced cancers. [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies indicate that SCC may decrease the activity cytochrome P450 enzymes [(8](#reference8), [20, 21)](#reference20). Phase II biotransformation enzymes promote the elimination of potentially harmful toxins and carcinogens from the body. Limited data from animal studies indicate that SCC may increase the activity of the phase II enzyme quinone reductase [(22)](#reference22). One [in vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) study showed that human [colon](../../glossary#colon) cancer cells undergo cell cycle arrest after treatment with SCC [(23)](#reference23). The mechanism involved inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity. Ribonucleotide reductase plays a pivotal role in [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) synthesis and repair and is a target of currently used cancer therapeutic agents, such as hydroxyurea [(23)](#reference23). While this may provide a potential avenue for SCC in the clinical setting, sensitizing cancer cells to DNA damaging agents, [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) studies are needed. The porphyrin structure of chlorophyll is analogous to the [heme](../../glossary#heme) structure found in blood and muscle tissue. Because heme-bound iron has higher [bioavailability](../../glossary#bioavailability) than nonheme iron (the most common form of iron in plant-based sources, e.g., [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), spinach), iron uptake from iron chlorophyll is of interest. Toxicity studies in rats suggest iron chlorophyllin is generally safe for mammalian consumption [(24)](#reference24). [In vitro](../../glossary#in-vitro) studies demonstrate that iron chlorophyllin is as good as heme in delivering iron to intestinal cells, and significantly better than the most common supplemental form of iron (i.e., ferrous sulfate) when incorporated into most food matrices [(25)](#reference25). However, work in this area is nascent and has not yet been validated in humans. It is also not known if metallo-chlorophyll derivatives of copper or zinc increase absorption of these essential divalent metals. Aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1), a liver [carcinogen](../../glossary#carcinogen) produced by certain species of fungus, is found in moldy grains and [legumes](../../food-beverages/legumes), including corn, peanuts, and soybeans [(4](#reference4), [11)](#reference11). In hot, humid regions of Africa and Asia with improper grain storage facilities, high levels of dietary AFB1 are associated with increased [risk](../../glossary#risk) of [hepatocellular carcinoma](../../glossary#hepatocellular-carcinoma). Moreover, the combination of [hepatitis](../../glossary#hepatitis) B infection and high dietary AFB1 exposure increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma still further. In the liver, AFB1 is metabolized to a carcinogen capable of binding [DNA](../../glossary#DNA) and causing [mutations](../../glossary#mutation). In animal models of AFB1-induced liver [cancer](../../glossary#cancer), administration of SCC at the same time as dietary AFB1 exposure significantly reduces AFB1-induced DNA damage in the livers of rainbow trout and rats [(26-28)](#reference26) and dose-dependently inhibits the development of liver cancer in trout [(29)](#reference29). Likewise, natural chlorophyll has also been found to inhibit AFB1-induced liver cancer in the rat [(28)](#reference28). Collectively, this evidence supports a role for SCC and/or chlorophyll itself in limiting cancer initiation. In contrast, data suggest a limited role for SCC in influencing cancer progression. For example, one rat study found that SCC did not protect against aflatoxin-induced liver damage when given after tumor initiation [(30)](#reference30). Because of the long time period between AFB1 exposure and the development of cancer in humans, an [intervention trial](../../glossary#intervention-trial) might require as long as 20 years to determine whether SCC [supplementation](../../glossary#supplement) can reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people exposed to high levels of dietary AFB1. However, a [biomarker](../../glossary#biomarker) of AFB1-induced DNA damage (AFB1-N7-guanine) can be measured in the urine, and high urinary levels of AFB1-N7-guanine have been associated with significantly increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma [(31)](#reference31). In order to determine whether chlorophyllin could decrease AFB1-induced DNA damage in humans, a [randomized](../../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled intervention trial was conducted in 180 adults residing in a region in China where the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is very high due to unavoidable, dietary AFB1 exposure and a high [prevalence](../../glossary#prevalence) of chronic hepatitis B infection [(32)](#reference32). Participants took either 100 mg of SCC or a placebo before meals three times daily. After 16 weeks of treatment, urinary levels of AFB1-N7-guanine were 55% lower in those taking SCC than in those taking the placebo, suggesting that SCC supplementation before meals can substantially decrease AFB1-induced DNA damage. Although a reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma has not yet been demonstrated in humans taking SCC, scientists are hopeful that supplementation will provide some protection to high-risk populations with unavoidable, dietary AFB1 exposure [(11)](#reference11). It is not known whether SCC will be useful in the prevention of cancers in people who are not exposed to significant levels of dietary AFB1, as is the case for most people living in the US. Many questions remain to be answered regarding the exact mechanisms of cancer prevention by SCC, the implications for the prevention of other types of cancer, and the potential for natural chlorophylls in the diet to provide cancer protection. Observations in the 1940s and 1950s that [topical](../../glossary#topical) SCC had deodorizing effects on foul-smelling wounds led clinicians to administer SCC orally to patients with [colostomies](../../glossary#colostomy) and [ileostomies](../../glossary#ileostomy) in order to control fecal odor [(33)](#reference33). While early [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) indicated that SCC doses of 100 to 200 mg/day were effective in reducing fecal odor in ostomy patients [(34, 35)](#reference34), a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial found that 75 mg of oral SCC three times daily was no more effective than placebo in decreasing fecal odor assessed by colostomy patients [(36)](#reference36). Several case reports have been published indicating that oral SCC (100-300 mg/day) decreased subjective assessments of urinary and fecal odor in incontinent patients [(33](#reference33), [37)](#reference37). [Trimethylaminuria](../../glossary#trimethylaminuria) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the [excretion](../../glossary#excretion) of trimethylamine, a compound with a \"fishy\" or foul odor. One study in a small number of Japanese patients with trimethylaminuria found that oral SCC (60 mg three times daily) for three weeks significantly decreased urinary trimethylamine concentrations [(38)](#reference38). Research in the 1940s indicated that chlorophyllin slowed the growth of certain [anaerobic](../../glossary#anaerobic) [bacteria](../../glossary#bacteria) in the test tube and accelerated the healing of experimental wounds in animals. These findings led to the use of [topical](../../glossary#topical) SCC solutions and ointments in the treatment of persistent open wounds in humans [(39)](#reference39). During the late 1940s and 1950s, a series of largely uncontrolled studies in patients with slow-healing wounds, such as vascular ulcers and pressure (decubitus) ulcers, reported that the application of topical SCC promoted healing more effectively than other commonly used treatments [(40, 41)](#reference40). In the late 1950s, SCC was added to papain and urea-containing ointments used for the chemical debridement of wounds in order to reduce local [inflammation](../../glossary#inflammation), promote healing, and control odor [(33)](#reference33). SCC-containing papain/urea ointments are still available in the US by prescription [(42)](#reference42). Several studies have reported that such ointments are effective in wound healing [(43)](#reference43). A spray formulation of the papain/urea/SCC therapy is also available [(44)](#reference44). A few small studies have investigated SCC as a topical treatment for various skin conditions. In a [pilot study](../../glossary#pilot-study) of 10 adults (ages 18-30 years) who had mild-to-moderate [acne vulgaris](../../glossary#acne-vulgaris) and enlarged facial pores, twice daily application of a 0.1% liposomal SCC gel for three weeks improved a number of clinical parameters of the Global Acne Assessment Scale (i.e., facial oiliness, facial blotchiness, presence and size of facial pores, and number of acne lesions) compared to baseline [(45)](#reference45). Additionally, a pilot study in 10 women (ages 40 years or older) with noticeable photodamage and solar lentigines found that twice daily topical application of a gel containing 0.66% SCC complex salts for eight weeks improved various clinical measures, including tactile and visual roughness of facial skin, skin radiance, fine lines, pore size, and overall photodamage [(46)](#reference46). A few [case reports](../../glossary#case-report) have also observed some improvement in facial redness and rosacea with application of topical SCC [(47)](#reference47). While the reports from these studies are interesting, [placebo](../../glossary#placebo)-controlled [clinical trials](../../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine whether SCC may have utility in treating various skin conditions. Chlorophylls are the most abundant pigments in plants, with chlorophyll a being two to four times as prevalent as chlorophyll b [(6](#reference6), [48)](#reference48). Dark-green leafy vegetables like spinach are rich sources of natural chlorophylls. The chlorophyll content of selected vegetables are presented in are often marketed as [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) sources of chlorophyll. Because natural chlorophyll is not as stable as SCC and is much more expensive, most over-the-counter chlorophyll supplements actually contain sodium copper chlorophyllin. Oral preparations of sodium copper chlorophyllin (also called chlorophyllin copper complex) are available as a dietary [supplement](../../glossary#supplement) and as an over-the-counter drug (Derifil) used to reduce odor from [colostomies](../../glossary#colostomy) and [ileostomies](../../glossary#ileostomy), or to reduce fecal odor due to incontinence [(50)](#reference50). Oral doses of 100 to 300 mg/day in three divided doses have been used to control fecal and urinary odor (see [Therapeutic Uses of Chlorophyllin](#therapeutic-uses)). In the US, SCC is found in minor quantities in some types of green table olives [(51)](#reference51). It is also approved for use as a green color additive in a limited number of foods like chewing gum [(52)](#reference52), as well as in drugs and cosmetics, as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations 21 [(53)](#reference53). In US supermarkets, canned green beans thermally processed in a zinc chloride solution to produce zinc chlorophyll derivatives within the green beans themselves are sold under the trademarked name \"veri-green\" [(54)](#reference54). Because zinc chlorophyll derivatives are more robust to heat and acid treatment, they better retain a bright green color as compared to native magnesium-bound chlorophyll [(48)](#reference48). Natural chlorophylls are not known to be toxic, and no toxic effects have been attributed to chlorophyllin despite more than 50 years of clinical use in humans [(11](#reference11), [33](#reference33), [39)](#reference39). When taken orally, [supplemental](../../glossary#supplement) chlorophyll or sodium copper chlorophyllin may cause green discoloration of urine or feces, or yellow or black discoloration of the tongue [(55)](#reference55). There have also been occasional reports of diarrhea related to oral SCC use. When applied [topically](../../glossary#topical) to wounds, SCC has been reported to cause mild burning or itching in some cases [(56)](#reference56). Oral chlorophyllin may result in false positive results on guaiac card tests for occult blood [(57)](#reference57). Since the safety of chlorophyll or chlorophyllin supplements has not been tested in pregnant or lactating women, they should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation.
