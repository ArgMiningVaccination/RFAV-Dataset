Many questions still need to be answered, as researchers continue their efforts to develop new vaccines, improve vaccine efficacy and mitigate adverse events. How do we identify the right targets for vaccines? Are there biomarkers that can be used to predict vaccine efficacy? How do factors such as dosage amount or the microbiome impact immunes response to vaccines? The advent of massively parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the ability to quickly sequence and analyze DNA and RNA helps advance our understanding of the genetics behind vaccine response and enhance vaccine development research. Jump to: [Pathogen analysis and target discovery](#pathogen) | [Adaptive immunity\u2014immune [Innate immunity and signaling pathways](#innate) | [Microbiome analysis](#microbiome) Ion Torrent targeted NGS offers rapid, multi-dimensional genetic analysis at scale for vaccine research across the development workflow, from discovery to vaccine efficacy. Whether you need to study pathogen biology and target discovery or comprehensively analyze host immune response, Ion Torrent has the solution to help researchers quickly and cost-effectively study and improve vaccine development. Benefits of using Ion Torrent targeted NGS for vaccine development research include: Sequencing the entire SARS-CoV-2 viral genome can generate new insights about the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and novel drug targets that could inform vaccine and therapeutics research. All viral mutations must be taken into consideration during vaccine or therapeutic development, or it may render a candidate less effective as the virus continues to evolve. Ion Torrent NGS enables sequencing of the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify key mutations for investigating community spread and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications for vaccine research. The [Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Insight Research Assay](/de/de/home/life-science/sequencing/dna-sequencing/microbial-sequencing/microbial-identification-ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing/viral-typing/coronavirus-research.html) is part of a fast, automated, and acccurate targeted NGS workflow that enables coronavirus typing in under a day, with coverage of >99% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and variants, including all serotypes. This end-to-end solution also includes the assay and plug-in suite developed with researchers working to slow the spread of the virus. |Objective:||Objectives:||Objective:||Objectives:| NGS solutions Targeted NGS can help identify genetic patterns related to virulence, antigens and neoantigens that elicit an immune response, as well as genetic factors that may contribute to immunity or may lead to adverse events. Genetic information advances vaccine development research and could lead to therapeutics with greater specificity for better protection against infection or improve treatment outcome in the future for diseases such as cancer. Vaccines enable our adaptive immune system to quickly recognize and fight against infectious disease, as well as boost our immune system to attack diseases such as cancer. An accurate, targeted NGS approach is needed to sequence these complex genetic rearrangements correctly and understand how the immune system evolves over time for disease causing agents like SARS-CoV-2, or understand the cancer immunity cycle to improve cancer vaccine therapies. Immune repertoire analysis also enables sample stratification for clinical research studies, facilitating interpretation and potentially improving vaccine efficacy. Innate immune response involves molecules such as interferons and cytokines, but their relative contributions to response and adverse events remain poorly understood. Targeted gene expression analysis provides a scalable cost-effective approach to understand how genes are regulated in response to antigens and vaccines. Characterizing innate immunity and the various immune signaling pathways may potentially help improve vaccine efficacy, minimize risk of adverse events and provide information on appropriate options. The gut microbiome is considered our \"second genome\" and believed to influence human immunity including complex interactions in microbe-microbe and host-microbe relationships that may impact vaccine response and potentially vaccine efficacy. Targeted NGS can capture species information that may be critical due to their immunomodulatory and antiviral properties, including microbes that may not be culturable. Unlike other NGS approaches, Ion Torrent focused NGS solutions for vaccine development research provide the speed, scalability, and accuracy you need to spend more time developing vaccine solutions and less time looking for them.
