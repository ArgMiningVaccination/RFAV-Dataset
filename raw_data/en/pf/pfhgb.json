When Michelle Ranavat experienced severe [postpartum hair fall](https://www.allure.com/story/michelle-lee-postpartum-hair-loss) six years ago, she discovered the only thing that helped: Ayurvedic oil from India. Ranavat was impressed with her regimen and wanted to explore more Ayurvedic recipes. But she couldn't find the same quality of ingredients in the United States. It was 2016. Ranavat had been laid off from her job at Lehman Brothers, so she was back working at her dad's pharmaceutical business. It was an industry she grew up in; instead of attending \"fancy Summer camps\" as a kid, Ranavat would visit the company's warehouse. \"I was picking and packing orders... I literally grew up [there],\" she tells Allure. A science-obsessed teen, Ranavat ended up receiving a degree in industrial engineering. Though her mother \u2014 who immigrated to the U.S. from India with Ranavat's father in the 1970s \u2014 taught her some \"basic things\" like how to make a yogurt honey mask or use turmeric in her skin-care routine, Ranavat never envisioned a career in beauty. But as an adult with children of her own, searching for Ayurvedic hair oil left her seriously thinking about launching a brand. \"That was the lightbulb moment when everything in my life came together: my science background, knowing how to source quality [ingredients], along with this interest in the beauty world,\" Ranavat says. First, Ranavat and her father went to an Ayurvedic conference. \"We just immersed ourselves in experts in the field and got a sense for what it was,\" she explains. \"I want[ed] to put my own spin on it. I want[ed] to make this something that represents who I am.\" After the conference, Ranavat started to learn how to recognize and source ingredients for a potential beauty line. When she stepped out onto her first production factory floor, she felt \"very at home.\" With that, Ranavat began her eponymous brand in 2017. This month, it will become the first South Asian-founded Ayurvedic skin-care brand to launch on [sephora.com](https://shop-links.co/cgDcdrbGhf9). Ayurveda, a traditionally South Asian whole-body system of healing, has been practiced for over 5,000 years. And so Ranavat is clear that this interpretation is her own, and not the definitive or only way to experience the practice, which means \"knowledge of life\" and is based on balancing the three life forces, or doshas, of the body. Ranavat's versions of some Ayurvedic recipes tweak the quality of active ingredients. Take, for instance, the [Radiant Rani Brightening Saffron Serum](https://www.ranavat.com/products/brightening-saffron-serum). It's Ranavat's twist on kumkumadi, translates to \"saffron oil,\" and is an ages-old concoction of 21 Ayurvedic herbs infused in oil. \"A lot of South Asians have [hyperpigmentation](https://www.allure.com/story/the-science-of-beauty-podcast-hyperpigmentation-guide-episode), and this overnight oil is a luxurious way to brighten,\" she says. \"That appealed to me, but I found it to be a bit thick, and lacking the sensory experience I wanted.\" So she cut the rich, viscous sesame oil base it is traditionally brewed in with some rice bran oil, which results in a drier feeling on the skin. Ranavat also addded a tinge of rose to harmonize the scent profile. But she didn't change the meditative way in which the oil is brewed. The herbs and oils are added in a specific order to copper cauldrons in a clean room with an attendant Ayurvedic doctor present. This infusion is then hand-stirred by experienced artisans over the period of 10 days. \"Made in India, to me, represents something incredibly luxurious,\" Ranavat says. \"And the history of those hands... if they've been doing it for decades, it's not about mixing anymore, it's about art, preservation, and the experience. Having that expertise and local connection comes through in the efficacy, but also in the experience and the soul.\" I typically only use [unscented](https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-of-beauty-fragrance-free-sensitive-skin-care-products) skin-care products because fragrance often triggers itching or burning in my [sensitive skin](https://www.allure.com/story/what-is-sensitive-skin). But I made an exception for this serum, which I did not find to be irritating at all. When I use it, I tap on a few drops of the rich (but not too heavy) texture over a water-based moisturizer. I never do a full face of makeup without it; it makes foundation glide on and look more natural and glowy without getting uncomfortable or greasy. While I don't have specific pigmentation issues, after months of use my skin does seem more even in tone. Plus, the saffron and rose scent unfailingly brings indulgent Indian desserts to me \u2014 and that makes me smile. According to cosmetic chemist [Lalita Iyer,](https://www.instagram.com/skinchemy/) saffron has been used as a medicinal plant for decades, especially in India. As she says, \"Crocus sativus flower extract offers antioxidant and UV protection benefits for the skin.\" Ranavat's team takes great pains to source pure saffron: the brand's stock is stored in a safe and is tested before production to ensure that it's the real deal. This is important because saffron is the [world's most expensive spice](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-saffron-world-most-expensive-spice-2018-4), which inevitably means fakes abound. (Just last year, [Europol busted an organized crime group in Spain](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/spice-worth-its-weight-in-gold-multi-million-euros-fake-saffron-trafficking-scheme-uncovered) that was trafficking \"adulterated saffron\" worth over 10 million euros.) [Kiran Mian](https://www.hudsondermlaser.com/), M.D. a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, also highlighted one of the formulation's other skin-brightening ingredients. \"Licorice root is known for its anti-pigmentation and anti-inflammatory properties,\" she notes. \"It's also the perfect ingredient to lighten dark spots associated with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\" (Both Dr. Mian and Iyer helped Allure evaluate Ranavat's product lineup.) I also love which gently zaps dead cells without making my skin feel tight or over-exfoliated. Dr. Mian says turmeric in the formula is an anti-inflammatory and an antioxidant with skin-brightening properties. She added that papaya enzyme, a chemical exfoliant, sloughs off dead skin without friction or irritation. On some days, I swap my functional cleanser for a more elevated experience and use the brand's [Luminous Ceremony Cream Cleanser](https://www.ranavat.com/products/luminous-ceremony-cream-cleanser), which has a coddling, melty texture. It efficiently dissolves oil and makeup, but it washes off clean without any residue. It even brings a ritualistic vibe to my most mundane beauty act \u2014 washing my face \u2014 because its fresh rose scent compels me to take deep, meditative breaths while doing so. Dr. Mian is also a fan. \"With sesame seed oil being anti-inflammatory and noncomedogenic, it's the perfect lipid-rich ingredient to gently cleanse the skin of dirt and oils,\" she says. Iyer name-checks the cleanser's antibacterial and antioxidant Ayurvedic herb manjistha, saying it could help with acne. Plus, Iyer adds that cetearyl alcohol and sorbiton olivate is a well-known emulsifying combination that offers moisturizing and soothing properties. The Ayurvedic powerhouses really come out to play in Ranavat's [Renewing Bakuchi Cr\u00e8me.](https://www.ranavat.com/products/eternal-reign-renewing-bakuchi-creme?_pos=1&_sid=82924f1b8&_ss=r) Iyer antioxidants, including bakuchiol, which has been [shown to mitigate signs of aging](https://www.allure.com/story/what-is-bakuchiol-retinol-alternative) like fine lines. \"Triphala (a herbal remedy comprising the fruits haritaki, bibhitaki and amla), offers a combination of brightening, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects,\" she explains. According to Dr. Mian, the herb ashwagandha exerts antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties to fight acne. She also likes the addition of [glycerin](https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-glycerin-skin-care-products), a substance that holds onto water and keeps skin hydrated. The cr\u00e8me's base has enough heft to feel satisfying on dry or normal skin, but not too much to overwhelm oilier complexions like mine. I find that to be the case for most products in the line \u2014 each one seems to hit a sweet spot for balanced hydration, and can be layered or used solo. Perhaps the product that best showcases Ranavat's laser-focus on ingredients is the fan-favorite [Mighty Majesty Fortifying Hair Serum](https://www.ranavat.com/products/mighty-majesty-fortifying-hair-serum?_pos=1&_sid=cbccc4530&_ss=r). It's a modest formula, with just three ingredients. First there is the organic steam-distilled jasmine, which is an antifungal and gives the serum a heady, rich scent. There's also cold-pressed sunflower oil, which Ranavat said was chosen for its vitamin E- and antioxidant-rich profile, as well as its ability to soak into the hair strand. Finally, there's amla oil. \"Amla is packed with phytonutrients and has been a part of South Asian hair care for centuries,\" Dr. Mian explains. Its antioxidant properties help to decrease stress on the hair and strengthen it with oleic acid and other fatty acids. I found it to be the perfect gateway product for hair-oiling amateurs. For decades, the [South Asian community](https://www.allure.com/story/kulfi-beauty-kajal-eyeliner-colors-priyanka-ganjoo-interview) has watched its cultural capital in the form of indigenous [ingredients](https://www.allure.com/story/turmeric-skin-benefits) and beauty and [wellness traditions](https://www.self.com/story/yoga-indian-cultural-appropriation) be [co-opted](https://www.allure.com/story/90s-trend-comeback-of-asian-cultural-appropriation-in-fashion-and-beauty) and [monetized](https://www.allure.com/story/gucci-turbans-hijabs-cultural-appropriation-milan-fashion-week) by the beauty and wellness industries without credit. So the impact of her brand's inclusion on Sephora's shelves isn't lost on Ranavat. As she puts it, \"it really matters that we've created the space for ourselves, and can stand next to traditional skin-care and hold our own.\" Ranavat is available at [sephora.com](https://shop-links.co/cgDcdrbGhf9) beginning February "}
