Many cultural beliefs date back hundreds or thousands of years, and the knowledge has been passed down through generations. Non-traditional health care practices can be used alone or alongside traditional American medicine to provide a more holistic approach and culturally competent care to diverse populations. This paper will explain the role of integrative/non- traditional medicine today, which non-traditional medicine practices are common to the U.S. and Texas, and the specific practices of Chinese, Latino, andMori cultures to provide an explanation of non-traditional medicine approaches to healthcare in todays health care world. Integrative/Non-Traditional Medicine Complimentary alternative medicine or integrative medicine are alternative non- traditional therapies that can be used in combination with traditional therapies for a holistic approach to healthcare. Therapies include acupuncture, ayurveda, homeopathy, naturopathy, and Chinese medicine. Touch therapies such as chiropractic care, massage, Tai Chi, and yoga can be used to heal the body through touch. Dietary supplements, herbal medicine, and nutritional/diet therapies can be used to treat many chronic diseases. Energy therapies include electromagnetic therapy, Reiki, and Qigong. Mind exercises include meditation, biofeedback, and hypnosis. Art, dance, music, and guided imagery are sensory treatments that can be therapeutic (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.). Understanding a variety of these alternative treatments is important to provision of holistic or \"whole person\" care, where the physical as well as spiritual needs are addressed, and healing is improved. It's like attacking an ailment or disease from every angle to ensure healing is achieved. It is also important to be aware of the treatments a person may be using as part of their culture to avoid any undesirable interactions with prescribed medications. "}
