The company was apparently hoping to put the lid on the controversy, but the admission and subsequent clarifications only raised more questions than they answered. Panacea officials said the company applied to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in 2008 to extend the shelf life of the vaccine from 24 months to 36 months after extensive tests. \"The tests showed the vaccine had the stability required,\" a Panacea official said. \"The vaccines were tested at the Central Research Institute, Kasauli. CDSCO gave the company permission to extend the vaccine's shelf life on September 10, 2010.\" \"The medicines should be stored at temperatures between 2\u00baC and 8\u00baC,\" he said. \"We would have had to remove the vials from refrigeration to remove the old labels. This could have led to contamination.\" The seized vials were manufactured in 2011. If the company received permission to extend the expiry date in 2010, why was it still using the labels with a use-by date of two years? Panacea said it would make an official statement on Tuesday. The approval to extend the shelf-life of the vaccine has the medical community concerned. Doctors say the practice is unusual and could lead to a dangerous trend. \"I don't believe it is ethical to extend the shelf life of a vaccine or drug,\" pediatrician Dr Gita Mathai said. \"Doctors usually use drugs that have a shelf life of seven years but have a use-by date restricted to four years.\" \"Extending the expiry date could reduce the efficacy of the vaccine,\" she said. Doctors said expired drugs could have nasty side effects too. \"Only long-term tests can confirm that a vaccine is potent a year after its expiry date,\" said Kerala-based pediatrician Dr Jacob Puliyel. Doctors say the company should make things clear. "}
