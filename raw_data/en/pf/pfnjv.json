To save lives and slow the spread of COVID -19, independent state and federal public health advisory committees recommend first protecting heal th care workers caring for patients with COVID -19, people who are at the highest risk of being hospitalized or dying, and those at high risk of exposure to COVID -19. Keep practicing the 3 W's \u2014 wear a mask, wait six feet apart, wash your hands \u2014until everyone has a chance to get vaccinated. Our goal is to vaccinate as many people as possible given the limited supply of vaccines. Group 1 : The goal is to protect the health care workers and North Carolinians who are at the highest risk of being hospitalized or dying from COVID -19. Health care workers in Group 1 are those with in -person patient contact. Health care workers in this group are defined as paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients, bodies, or infectious materials. This group also in cludes individuals who are involved in COVID -19 vaccination efforts, including health care personnel and volunteers supporting vaccination efforts. Health care settings include, but are not limited to, settings such as : hospitals long-term care facilities outpatient clinics vaccination site s home health care public health clinical services emergency medical services mortuaries pharmacies Health care workers comprise clinical staff members, including nursing or medical assistants and support staff membe rs (e.g., those who work in food, environmental, and administrative services) and pharmacies.

How do health care workers in this first group get their vaccine? Local Health Departments, health care employers, hospitals and health systems, long -term care pharmacies, clinics and other enrolled vaccinating providers all play a role in vaccinating health care workers in Group 1. Eventually, any vaccine provider enrolled in the state's COVID -19 Vaccine Management System and who is administering vaccines may vaccinate Group 1 , since eligible individuals can continue to be vaccinated as North Carolina moves to additional vaccination phases. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS should : Coordinate with local health care employers to vaccinate their eligible employees Coordinate with hospitals, health systems and other local vaccine providers to ensure the most timely access to vaccinations for eligible health care workers HEALTH CARE EM PLOYERS should: Contact their local health department to coordinate vaccination opportunities for their employees Understand that the ability for Local Health Departments to schedule appointments will depend on the supply of vaccine available HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS should : Vaccinat e non-employed or non -affiliated community -based health care worker s in addition to their own eligible employees NC Department of Health and Human Services | Group 1 | March 1 , 202 1 Page 3 Work with the Local Health Department to coordinate access to vaccine for non-affiliated health care workers How do long -term care staff and residents get their vaccine? The federal government manages vaccinations for most staff and residents of long -term care facilities through the newly created Pharmacy Partnership for Long -Term Care Program with CVS and Walgreens. Staff and residents will be vaccinated at the same time. Other long-term care staff and residents will receive vaccinations through their Local Health Departments and other long -term care pharmacies if not participating in the federal program . North Carolina is working to enroll other vaccinating providers who may also reach this population. "}
