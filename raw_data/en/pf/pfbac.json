It is effective in various diseases related to oxidative and inflammatory reactions, including respiratory diseases [ [2](#B2-nrp-17-206)]. PG contains several nutrients such as polysaccharides, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals [ [3](#B3-nrp-17-206)]. It also contains substantial amounts of phytochemicals beneficial to health, with saponins being the representative bioactive compounds. In particular, platycodin D is a component with excellent quantitative and qualitative physiological activity [ [4](#B4-nrp-17-206)]. It has recently been reported that extraction of PG root with an additional fermentation process increases the proportion of its active ingredient [ [5](#B5-nrp-17-206) [6](#B6-nrp-17-206)]. In our previous study, we isolated a substance with increased saponin and platycodin D content by PG extraction by adding a hydrolysis process before fermentation. Exposure to this hydrolyzed and fermented Platycodon grandiflorum extract (HFPGE) in an in vitro system resulted in increased macrophage phagocytosis and cytokines such as tumor Thus, we deduced that the HFPGE showed the potential to act as an effective immunostimulatory agent. [8](#B8-nrp-17-206)]. Immunodeficiency results in susceptibility to infectious diseases and tumor development, while over activation of the immune system can lead to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, while strengthening the immune system to help maintain health, the immunity needs to be maintained and coordinated in harmony. While efforts to use functional food ingredients to develop immune enhancing agents are on the rise, there is increasing interest in plant ingredients with broader and greater therapeutic effects, relatively low toxicity, and immunomodulatory effects [ [9](#B9-nrp-17-206)]. [10](#B10-nrp-17-206) [11](#B11-nrp-17-206) [12](#B12-nrp-17-206)]. Administration of CPA to experimental animals causes a rapid change in helper T (Th)1/Th2 bias, resulting in immunosuppression [ [13](#B13-nrp-17-206)]. CPA inhibits the differentiation of T cells, and thus the amount of cytokines secreted from T cells is also reduced [ [14](#B14-nrp-17-206) [15](#B15-nrp-17-206)]. Therefore, CPA is used experimentally to create immunosuppression models. It has been reported that PG extract has an anticancer effect by enhancing immunity in a CPA-induced immunosuppression model [ [5](#B5-nrp-17-206)], and is effective in restoring the antibody secretion ability and the number of immune cells [ [13](#B13-nrp-17-206)]. However, studies on the immune enhancing effect of PG and its mechanism are insufficient. Therefore, this study was undertaken to confirm the immune-enhancing effect by administering HGPGE to CPA-induced immunosuppressed BALB/c mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials HFPGE Experimental and 1](#F1-nrp-17-206)). Determination of Igs and cytokines in serum Splenocytes isolation Determination of splenocytes proliferation Determination of cytokines in splenocytes Statistical analysis RESULTS HFGPE administration does not affect the BW gain in CPA-induced immunosuppressed BALB/c mice [Fig. 2A and B](#F2-nrp-17-206)). The weight of the spleen was significantly increased by CPA treatment compared to NOR animals, which were not overcome by HFPGE treatment ( [Fig. 2C](#F2-nrp-17-206)). No significant difference was obtained in the thymus weight between all experimental groups ( [Fig. 2D](#F2-nrp-17-206)). HFGPE increases immunosuppressed BALB/c mice [Table 1](#T1-nrp-17-206)). Taken together, these results indicate that in the CPA-induced immunosuppressed model, exposure to HFPGE effectively increases Ig secretion, with some differences depending on the xlink:type of Ig. BALB/c mice [Table 2](#T2-nrp-17-206)). results suggest that exposure to HFPGE increases the secretion of cytokines reduced by CPA treatment, and has the potential to contribute to the enhancement of cytokine secretion related to cell-mediated immunity in particular. Table 2 HFGPE administration promotes the proliferation of splenocytes in CPA-induced immunosuppressed BALB/c mice [Fig. 3](#F3-nrp-17-206)). To investigate the effect of HFPGE administration on the proliferation of T cells in splenocytes, the proliferation index was investigated after activating cells with ConA. The proliferation index of splenocytes in the NOR group treated with ConA was determined to be 1.055 \u00b1 0.002, which was significantly increased compared to the NOR group cells not stimulated with the mitogen. Values were significantly decreased in the CON group, and increased significantly in the T150 and T300 groups as compared to the CON group. Similar to stimulation with ConA, the proliferation index was significantly increased when the splenocytes were stimulated with LPS, and the proliferation index decrease after exposure to CPA was significantly increased by the administration of HFPGE ( [Fig. 3](#F3-nrp-17-206)). These results indicate that exposure to HFPGE increases the immune capacity of lymphocytes through proliferation of splenocytes. HFPGE administration increases immunosuppressed the levels of IL-4, IL-8, and TGF- were measured in the collected conditioned media after stimulation of splenocytes with 100 \u00b5g/mL LPS. All three cytokines were significantly decreased in the CON group compared to the NOR group, and increased in the HFPGE-administered group. However, unlike the cell-mediated immunity-related cytokines measured after stimulation with ConA, there was no dose-dependent increase by HFPGE. Compared to the CON group, levels of IL-4, IL-8, and TGF- obtained in the T300 group were 31.1%, 20.9%, and 33.3%, respectively, which was lower than the cytokine increase in the ConA stimulated HFPGE-administered group ( [Table 4](#T4-nrp-17-206)). These results indicate that stimulation with a mitogen enhances both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity after exposure to HFPGE, and was particularly effective for cell-mediated immunity. Table 3 has been reported that an additional fermentation process during PG extraction enhances the pharmacological effects [ [6](#B6-nrp-17-206) [16](#B16-nrp-17-206)]. By adding a hydrolysis process, we obtained an extract with high total flavonoids, crude saponin, and platycodin contents as compared to fermented PGE. The HFPGE thus obtained showed excellent immunostimulatory effect in an in vitro study [ [7](#B7-nrp-17-206)]. In the current study, we further confirmed the immune enhancing effect of HFPGE in BALB/c mice in an in vivo system. [17](#B17-nrp-17-206)]. As a major component of human immunity, IgG binds to and neutralizes pathogens, activates the complement system, binds to the toxin and neutralizes it, and plays an important role in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [ [18](#B18-nrp-17-206)]. The IgA antibody plays an important role in the immune function of the mucous membrane. In blood, IgA interacts with Fc receptors to initiate inflammatory reactions, regulates ADCC, and plays a role in the degranulation of eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and macrophages, phagocytosis by neutrophils, and respiratory burst activity [ [19](#B19-nrp-17-206)]. IgM is the largest antibody, accounting for 5-10% of all antibodies. It is the first antibody secreted when exposed to an antigen [ [9](#B9-nrp-17-206)]. Spleen is the major site of specific IgM production [ [20](#B20-nrp-17-206)]. In our study, the concentrations of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM were decreased by 6.63%, 6.67%, and 50%, respectively, in the CON group as compared to the NOR group. This was increased by HFPGE administration by varying extents depending on the xlink:type of Ig; IgG was increased in both T150 and T300 groups as compared to the levels obtained in the CON group, but was significantly lower than the NOR group levels; IgA increased to the same level or higher in the HFPGE treatment groups than in the NOR group. However, there was no significant difference in the levels of IgM between T150 and T300; compared to the NOR group, maximum decrease of IgM was obtained in the CON group, which significantly increased and recovered to the NOR group level by both HFPGE administrations. [Fig. 2B](#F2-nrp-17-206)). Other studies have reported similar observations that the treatment of CPA induces immunosuppression and causes weight loss as a side effect [ [21](#B21-nrp-17-206) [22](#B22-nrp-17-206)]. However, unlike other papers [ [16](#B16-nrp-17-206)] which reported that the administration of PG extract, especially an extract with a high platycodin D content, improved this weight loss problem, in our study, HFPGE administration could not recover the CPA-induced weight loss side effect. This may be due to differences in the age, experimental period, CPA dose and treatment time, and experimental diet between studies. The HFPGE doses used in this study (150 and 300 mg/kg BW) are within the 100-500 mg/kg BW levels used as extract concentrations in many other studies. Considering that even a lower dose of PGE (150 mg/kg BW) than in our study (300 mg/kg BW) had an effect on weight improvement, there is a possibility that weight loss may be a side effect caused by administering a high concentration of HFPGE. However, there was no difference in the dietary intake and behavior of the animals between all the experimental groups and the control group, thereby indicating that there is no problem in the stability of the concentration of HFPGE used in this study (data not shown). In the future, a follow-up study is needed to determine the cause. [23](#B23-nrp-17-206)] However, even at a low dose of 75 mg/kg BW administration of fermented PGE, the Ig concentration was significantly higher than that of immunosuppressed animals. It was reported that fermented PGE had a greater immune-enhancing effect than the general PGE because of the high content of platycodin D present [ [16](#B16-nrp-17-206)]. Comparing this with our study, although we administered a higher dose, the effect of increasing Ig levels in the blood was clear. In the previous study, fermented PGE had a greater immunostimulatory effect compared to normal PGE, with significant increase in the Ig concentration compared to immunosuppressed animals even with a low dose of 75 mg/kg BW. It was reported to be due to the high content of platycodin D [ [16](#B16-nrp-17-206)]. In our HFPGE, not only fermentation but also a hydrolysis process was added, resulting in increased content of active ingredients such as platycodin D, thereby increasing the immune-enhancing effect. [24](#B24-nrp-17-206) [25](#B25-nrp-17-206)]. The CPA mechanism of action is mainly achieved by reducing the number of T cells, transmitting a signal to target cells, and suppressing the secretion of cytokines that affect the regulation of immune responses [ [26](#B26-nrp-17-206)]. However, CPA treatment has many side effects such as nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and neurotoxicity [ [24](#B24-nrp-17-206)]. Therefore, there is active research on traditional medicinal plants that can reduce these side effects. These plants usually have characteristics that are involved in T cell proliferation and activation [ [27](#B27-nrp-17-206)]. CD4+ Th cells are roughly classified into functionally different subsets (Th1 and Th2) according to their secretory cytokines and immunological roles. In this study, we measured the serum concentrations of IL-12 All four cytokines were significantly decreased in the CON group compared to the NOR group, and increased in the HFPGE-treated groups. In the case of IL-8, only the NOR level was recovered by HFPGE administration. However, IL-12 was significantly increased in the HFPGE-treated group at a level more than twice the concentration of the NOR group. TNF- and TGF- were also significantly higher than the NOR group, by 1.3 and 1.2 times, respectively ( [Table 2](#T2-nrp-17-206)). In other words, oral administration of HFPGE effectively improves both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity, and was more effective in improving cell-mediated immunity than humoral immunity. [28](#B28-nrp-17-206)]. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) exist in the bone marrow, but some of them enter the circulation under normal conditions [ [29](#B29-nrp-17-206)]. When conditions are right, circulating HSPCs generate lineage descendant cells outside the bone marrow [ [30](#B30-nrp-17-206)]. This process, called extramedullary hematopoiesis, occurs mainly in the developing embryo's liver, but can also occur in adult tissues, including the spleen. In certain disease conditions, splenic HSPCs expand greatly and generate the progeny locally [ [28](#B28-nrp-17-206)]. As such, in the spleen, various immune stimuli occur between antigen presenting cells (macrophage, dendritic cells) and lymphocytes (T cells, B cells) that detect the antigen, leading to the production of various antibodies and activation of T cells. In this study, splenocytes were isolated from the spleen of BALB/c mice raised on an HFPGE treatment, and the effect of HFPGE on proliferation was investigated. In splenocytes not stimulated with mitogen, the proliferation index was decreased in CPA-treated animals, but HFPGE administration significantly increased the index, more than the NOR group. Similar results were obtained in splenocytes stimulated with ConA or LPS ( [Fig. 3](#F3-nrp-17-206)). Therefore, we determined that exposure to HFPGE significantly increases the proliferation of both T cells and B cells. [28](#B28-nrp-17-206)]. Cytokines are classified according to several criteria. Representative Th1 cells include secreted Th2 cells include IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-, which enhance the humoral immune response [ [31](#B31-nrp-17-206)]. In this study, to determine the effect of HFPGE on the concentration of cytokines secreted by splenocytes, the splenocytes were stimulated with mitogen and cultured, following which the concentrations of cytokines were measured in the conditioned media. We determined that secreted IL-8, and TGF-), both were significantly reduced in the CON group compared to NOR group. However, in the T150 and T300 groups, the cytokine concentrations were increased to a level that was statistically equal to or higher than that of the NOR group after stimulation with the two mitogens. In particular, there was a dramatic increase in cytokines 6 mg/day to 8 g/day in clinical trials, and the dose varies greatly depending on the extraction method of PGE and the target disease. In this study, 150 and 300 mg/kg BW/day administered to mice correspond to 0.75 and 1.5 g/day, respectively, when applied to the human. This is considered a moderate dose compared to other studies. Investigating the bioavailability and the physiological concentration of HFPGE used in this study is very important for future application to humans. There has been no report on the bioavailability and physiological concentration of PGE so far; hence, there is a need for future studies on the bioavailability and "}
