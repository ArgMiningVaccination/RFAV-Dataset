A commonly cited survey in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) found that more Americans were consulting alternative care providers than allopathic/conventional physicians. In 1998, David Eisenberg published a follow up to this landmark survey, showing a marked increase in both the use of alternative care and the number of individuals seeking such care. The study revealed that 42.1% of Americans consulted at least 1 of 16 alternative therapies during 1997, an increase from 33.8% in 1990. Total visits to alternative practitioners soared from 427 million in 1990 to 629 million in 1997. This explosion of alternative care in the United States has begun to force prominent medical schools across the country to offer courses in alternative medical techniques. Over seventy-five major medical schools have begun to teach courses in alternative modalities. Moreover, the alternative care industry has established several journals to cover its expanding field. - Type - Notes and Comments - Information [American Journal of Law & Medicine](/core/journals/american-journal-of-law-and-medicine), [Volume 26](/core/journals/american-journal-of-law-and-medicine/volume/ACF607D8F351E42632E72BD992299412), [Issue 2-3: The Changing Face of Law and Medicine in the New Millennium](/core/journals/american-journal-of-law-and-medicine/issue/C807A1AE6C78DAA2B98D8A32CC933E6E), 2000 , pp. 295 - 310 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 American Society of Law, Medicine and Ethics and Boston University 2020 References 1 See Andrews, Lori B., 77ie Shadow of the Healthcare System, 32 Hous.

See also Mehmet C. Oz, Book Review Essay, 20 J. Legal Med. 141, 144-45 (1999) (reviewing Michael H. Cohen, Complementary & Alternative Medicine: Legal Boundaries and Regulatory Perspectives (1998)). Because the states can regulate all aspects of medical practice, decisions often rest on individual state medical practice acts, which generally define the practice of medicine as the diagnosing, preventing, treating, and curing of disease. This approach has a predictable bias toward biomedicine, leaving precious little room for alternative medicine, especially because states have applied the definition of medical practice quite broadly. Id. at 144-45. 76 See Cohen, supra note 6, at 85 (noting that state medical boards have the authority to punish departures from \"prevailing medical practice\"). Michael Cohen notes that alternative practitioners would have to avoid diagnosing disease and limit the scope of their practice to fall within \"statutorily defined conduct.\" See id.; see also Andrews, supra note 1, at 1306 (noting that local medical societies frequently instigate medical suits against alternative providers even when they are statutorily authorized to provide healthcare services). 77 See Cohen, supra note 6, at 89. 78 See id. 79 See generally Cohen, supra note 6, at 97-98 (noting that legislative efforts to license alternative modalities would broaden opportunities to heal patients since alternative modalities would complement traditional medicine). 80 See generally id.

This case involved a disciplinary action against a homeopathic care provider who was charged with practicing gross negligence, practicing with negligence on more than one occasion, and failing to maintain records.

The author notes that allopathic medicine often denies patients any degree of control over the healthcare services they receive. Id. Alternative medicine gives the patient back that lost control since it is often the patient that seeks out the unconventional provider after determining what type of treatment he or she would like to try.

In this article, the CBO lists several different factors that contribute to the excessive costs of medical care. One reason for this exorbitant bill is because consumers delegate enormous control to their physicians. Id. at 722. \"With such power, physicians are in the position of being able to create a demand for their own services.\" Id. In addition, when physicians have the incentive to earn higher incomes from providing more care, financial self interest creates a money pit filled with excessive spending.
