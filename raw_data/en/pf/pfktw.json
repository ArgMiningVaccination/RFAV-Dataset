Ayurveda is a medical system from India that is used around the world.1 Herbs are used in Ayurvedic remedies to promote health or treat disease. These remedies come from Ayurvedic practitioners, from stores or online, and from the Unites States and other countries . Ayurvedic remedies are available in many forms including capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and liquids. Much of the time, especially when obtained directly from a practitioner, they are compounded and not branded. Heavy metals in Ayurveda Many Ayurvedic remedies have been found to be contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, and mercury, and some-called rasa shastra-intentionally contain minerals, gems, and sometimes heavy metals. 23 Multiple Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR) have been issued regarding lead poisoning in consumers of Ayurvedic remedies 4 . Products produced both overseas and in the U.S. may contain metals . There have been cases in California of lead poisoning associated with the use of Ayurvedic remedies . Most of these cases of lead poisoning occurred in adults, including pregnant women; however, children and infants have also been affected. Laboratory testing of these remedies found lead levels as high as 200,000 micrograms per gram (mcg/g). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended limit for the daily intake of lead from all sources (the Interim Reference Level (IRL)) is: 3 mcg per day for children 12.5 mcg per day for adults Ayurvedic remedies are not evaluated bythe FDA for safety, efficacy, or quality before they are sold. While any product considered a \"drug,\" \"food additive,\" or \"dietary supplement\" is subject to some degree of regulation, many supplements and herbal products sold in the U.S., or on the internet, are not reviewed by the FDA.5 Example of Ayurvedic Pill Example of Ayurvedic Pill What is lead poisoning? There is no known safe level of lead in the body. Lead can damage the nervous system, renal system, cardiovascular system, reproductive and endocrine systems, and other major organs. At lower levels a person with lead poisoning may be asymptomatic; however, long-term lead exposure above 5-10 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) increases the risk for health effects such as high blood pressure, kidney disease, cognitive dysfunction, adverse reproductive outcomes, and even death from cardiovascular disease. Higher levels of lead exposure can cause anemia, abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, and fatigue. Very high levels of lead in the body can cause encephalopathy, seizures, coma, and death. Example of Ayurvedic Pill Children are especially vulnerable to the effects of lead. In children, even low levels of lead in the body can cause a decrease in IQ and problems with learning and behavior. Pregnant women and their unborn babies are also at increased risk from lead exposure, as lead readily crosses the placenta. Increased lead levels during pregnancy are associated with maternal hypertension, spontaneous abortion, decreased fetal growth, premature birth, and adverse neurodevelopmental effects in the infant. Ask your patients whether they take any herbal products or other remedies If you think that your patient or their family may have been exposed to lead, order a blood lead test, even if they do not exhibit symptoms. A venous blood lead test is the best diagnostic test for lead exposure. A typical adult blood lead level in the U.S. is less than 1 mcg/dl. Blood lead levels at or above the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reference level (currently 5 mcg/dl) are considered elevated, and efforts should be undertaken to remove any sources of exposure.
