High Dose Vitamin C helps with chronic syndromes, and autoimmune diseases, and can help produce urgent immune support. Research has also, shown that it is a great support for cancer. Ingredients: Vitamin C (Electrolytes) Best Uses: Immune Support, Cancer support, Chemotherapy Support Dosages: 10g of Vitamin C, 15g of Vitamin C, 25g of Vitamin C, 50g of Vitamin C, 75g of vitamin C, and 100g of vitamin C Requirements: G6PD test (blood work) for infusions 15-100 In a new [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170109134014.htm), published recently in the December issue of the journal Redox Biology, scientists at the University of Iowa explain how high-dose vitamin C, also known as ascorbate, kills cancer cells. The scientists found that vitamin C breaks down easily, forming hydrogen peroxide, which can damage tissue and DNA. The scientists also discovered that tumor cells are not as capable as normal cells at removing the detrimental hydrogen peroxide. In fact, the researchers found that cancer cells are easily damaged by the hydrogen created by the vitamin C, and, as a result, they die when exposed to a high amount of hydrogen peroxide. Says Buettner, a professor of radiation oncology and a member of the research team: \"This explains how the very, very high levels of vitamin C used in our clinical trials do not affect normal tissue but can be damaging to tumor tissue.\" High doses of vitamin C protect the body from oxidative stress that can damage cells. Cancer cells thrive in an environment rich with free radicals. IV high-dose vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, which fights and eliminates free radicals, effectively preventing the formation of new cancer cells and slowing down the growth of existing tumors. Different cancers affect the systemic immune system in different ways. While different tumor types have different effects on the immune system, all of them diminish the immune system's ability to fight infection as well as cancer. IV Vitamin C strengthens the immune system, helping it to fight cancer. Multiple animal studies have shown that high-dose vitamin C blocked tumor growth in animal examples of pancreatic, liver, prostate, sarcoma, and ovarian cancers and malignant mesothelioma. Many preclinical studies have demonstrated that high dose vitamin C could kill cancer cells or retard tumor growth in vivo. A study at the University of Iowa has shown that IV high-dose vitamin C kills cancer cells and has demonstrated how the vitamin achieves this feat. Some studies of high-dose IV vitamin C in cancer patients have found improved quality of life, as expressed in improved physical, mental, emotional, and physical well-being, with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pain, and appetite loss diminishing. Patients also show an increased resilience to the adverse effects of cancer treatments. Researchers have found that high-dose IV vitamin C used in conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation and other treatments, seems to improve the effectiveness of these treatments. Some studies had the opposite results though and the investigation continues. Complementary and alternative medicine providers and physicians have been using high-dose IVC for many decades with few side effects. In clinical trials, IV high-dose ascorbic acid has also caused very few side effects. One study of this practice found that out of 9,328 patients, only 1% reported minor side effects, including lethargy, fatigue, change in mental status, and vein irritation. In patients with a history of kidney disorders, kidney failure has been reported after ascorbic acid treatment. Patients with a tendency to develop kidney stones should not be treated with high-dose vitamin C. Patients and doctors must keep in mind that vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron by the body. High doses of the vitamin may be harmful to patients with hemochromatosis - a condition that causes the body to absorb and store more iron than it needs.
