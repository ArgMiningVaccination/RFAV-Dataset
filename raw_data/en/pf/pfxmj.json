[ The Associated Press: US Health Officials To Target High-Risk Alternative Remedies ](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/us-health-officials-target-high-risk-alternative-remedies-51861671) U.S. health officials plan to crack down on a growing number of unproven alternative remedies, focusing on products containing dangerous ingredients that have occasionally been linked to serious injury and death.
