Jones authored the book Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. The Tuskegee Syphilis experiment was a study of 600 African American males that started in 1932 and ended in 1972 (Jones, 1993, p. 1) The study was not beneficial. This paper will summarize the book Bad Blood as well as address theoretical perspectives, methodology, and ethics of the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. In the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study was mentioned. Throughout Henrietta's time of being sick with cervical cancer, she was not told she had the disease. Scientists took samples of Henrietta's cells and brought them to the prestigious Tuskegee Institute for further study (Skloot pg. 23). It was at this same institute that the Tuskegee Syphilis Study was performed. The U.S Public Health Service Team Department was the one to sponsor the study (Batten). This particular study was done to see the different effects syphilis had on African American males. Throughout this study, there were many things that were done unethically and took many years to be made known. The Tuskegee study of Untreated Syphilis began in 1932, mainly designed to determine the history of untreated latent syphilis on 600 African American men in Tuskegee, Alabama. 201 out of 600 men were non-syphilitic just unknowingly involved in the study as a control group This study is known to be \"the most infamous biomedical research study in the U.S history\". Most of these men had never visited a doctor and they had no idea what illness they had. All of the men agreed to be a participant thinking they were being treated for \"bad blood\" and plus they were given free medical care and meals. But unfortunately, the experiment was also never clearly explained to them, they had thought it was just the best possible treatment expected to cure the sickness they might have had. Many social and political changes have taken place in the American society in the past few decades that make it unlikely for a study such as the Tuskegee study to not be widely criticized. The major social change that has taken place is a result of social media. Social media plays a major role because it is a way to quickly spread information around the world. Social media allows people around the world to share their experiences and opinions about all types of issues, thus allowing them to educate others about different situation that are occurring. Political changes that have occurred include new rules that guarantee what happened in the Tuskegee study does not happen again. There are now laws that require every study to be examined and approved by committees before any experiment involve humans is The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, her family, and researchers who have exploited her cell line under the name of advance in medical research. In 1951, when Henrietta Lacks was treated for cervical cancer at John's Hopkin hospital, a physician collected her cervical cancer cells and handed to a researcher without proper process of informed consent. In a research lab, her cancer cells were harvested and disseminated to other labs. Henrietta's cancer cells become the first immortal human cell line and became widely used for scientific research. When her cell lines were sold by billions throughout the entire country and HeLa cells became popular research tools in the scientific community, The code of ethics in which an individual abides by speaks volume. High ethical values are very important in every facet of life. Honesty, loyalty and trust worthiness make up the moral compass in which to live. This moral compass can often be blemished with the ugliness of immorality, deceit and greed. The Tuskegee Syphilis study and The Stanford Prison Experiment are experiments indicative of how research and an individual's ethical values can become distorted. After her death in 1951, for six decades, the name Henrietta Lacks was not a recognized name in the eyes of the society, but cells containing her DNA did. HeLa Cells are the first immortal human cells, cancerous cells taken from Henrietta's cervix never die, in fact they multiply every twenty-four hours. After spending 10 years to perfect her first book, author of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot encapsulated the life, the death, and aftermath of Henrietta Lacks' life. Throughout her book, Rebecca Skloot takes the reader on an extraordinary journey through the lens of the Lacks family, dealing with controversial issues regarding science, ethics, race, and class. The journey of the Lacks families started in Henrietta's hometown Clover, Virginia then progressed to the \"colored\" ward of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks details the experiences of social injustice and humanizes a woman whose legacy has been defined by the power of her cells. Skloot seamlessly tells the story of Henrietta and her family's struggle to come to terms with their interactions with the health care system and their mother's story. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman from a rural town in Virginia, was diagnosed with an aggressive case of cervical cancer and treated at Johns Hopkins. During treatment, a tissue sample was taken from her cervix without her consent. The sample was for Dr. George Gey, who was able to grow Henrietta cells in culture and discovered that her cell line was immortal. Henrietta's condition worsened and she died at the age \"The Article Exploitation of prisoners in clinical research: perceptions of study participants\" written by Paul Christopher states \"Given the history of and continued potential for prisoner exploitation, biomedical research should be permitted only if there is a strongly favorable benefit-risk ratio for the prisoner.\" Even though Henrietta Lacks was not in a clinical trial she did not receive all the information from her Doctors which led to her downfall. This lack of information not only hurt her but it also hurt her family. The worst part yet Henrietta and her family were not the only ones who were lied to because Chester Southam not only used prisoners for research but he used hospitalized people. He told the patients that he was checking their immune system when in fact he was injecting them with HeLa cells. \"The Article Exploitation of prisoners in clinical research: perceptions of study participants\" stated that \"all but 1 participant agreed that there should be more research studies for prisoners to join if they wanted to.\" To prevent something like this from happening again researchers must be monitored at all times by someone who is not included in the making of the trial or drug. There also need to be monthly reviews of the research and if there anything wrong then the trial should be shut down until further notice. As long as this crucial step is followed then For the benefit of patient the medical profession has long subscribed to a body of ethical statements. It is used to safeguard the patient life and rights. But there have been times where these same rights are infringed upon and it is mostly due to lack of knowledge, social standing, or lack of monetary means all of which encompass a persons socio-economic status. Two different case studies will be evaluated to determine whether or not there truly is an effect on medical ethics. The first will be the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, and the case of Henrietta Lacks and the Hela cells. It has now been a quarter of a century, and yet the images and heartache that still evolve when the words \"Tuskegee Syphilis Study\" are brought up, still haunts people around the world and touches upon many professionals such as social workers, medical examiners, and so forth. Sometimes people hear about this disgusting human experiment in a highly visible way directed to the entire country as an example of what we as a country and people, in general, should not do. This occurred when the study first made national news in 1972, when President Clinton offered a formal apology, or when Hollywood actors star in a fictionalized television movie of the story. On the other hand the audience may become fainter: kept alive only by memories and stories told in the African American community, in queries that circulate over the world wide web and radio talk shows, or even in courses such as this one being taught by social workers, historians, sociologists, or bioethicists. This is neither the first nor the last unethical human experiment done under the human study for the medical purposes umbrella, basically stating it is ok to sacrifice a few people in the name of medical research. Stanford Prison Experiment is a popular experiment among social science researchers. In 1973, a psychologist named Dr. Philip Zimbardo wants to find out what are the factors that cause reported brutalities among guards in American prisons. His aim was to know whether those reported brutalities were because of the personalities of the guards or the prison environment. However, during the experiment, things get muddled unexpectedly. The experiment became controversial since it violates some ethical standards while doing the research. The tem ethics refers to the moral principles that guide a person's behavior, with respect to the rightness and wrongness of their actions. In the field of nursing, these moral principles govern the relationship between the nurse and the patient, members of the healthcare team, and society at large. Nurses must constantly question whether a certain procedure or course of treatment is in the best interest of the patient. When viewing the film \"Miss Evers' Boys\", it was clear that the doctors, researchers, and even Miss Evers were not acting in the best interest of all the patients. This movie depicted true events of a study that took place in Macon County, Alabama, in 1932. This study was referred to as the \"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis The author utilized excessive methodology throughout his book during the Tuskegee Experiment Study. Throughout the study, the helping professionals had many challenges and made changes when conducting this experiment. During this time, the helping professionals had no legal guidelines or stipulations until the last few years of the study. In the book, there were several methodologies that were utilized during the experiment. The methodologies consist of physicians that conducted a study or knowledgeable about the diseases, evidenced-based literature reviews, experiments, laboratory blood work, X-rays, drugs, and educational programs. Medical Research has the potential to advance society and make life better for everyone in it. However, the ends cannot justify the means; the rights of the subjects of research cannot be violated no matter the possible benefit to mankind. Despite this, time and time again, it has been very easy for, at least allegedly well-meaning scientists to violate the rights of their research subjects because they wanted to help society as a whole. Such experiments were not performed in secret by a minority of scientists; they were often done \"by respected investigators at leading medical institutions and were published in medical journals (Scandals and Tragedies 3).\" It is vital that we understand the circumstances of these experiments and why they happened so "}
