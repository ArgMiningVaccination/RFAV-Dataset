T he total global burden is ex- pected to increase to over 22 million new cases and 13 million deaths per year, mainly due to a general raise in life expectancy, as well as behavioral fa ctors involving environmental carcinogens [2,3]. The result of this development urges for nov el approaches to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer more effectively. These active resea rch areas already provide successful translation into a holistic cancer management strate gy. For example, vaccines against human papillomavirus infe ction have already contributed in red ucin g t he over all frequency of cervical cancers [4], mammography screening has le d t o a r e d u c t i o n i n breast-cancer related death [5], and immunotherapy has the pote ntial for unprecedented responses for certain patients [6,7]. Herein lies the general challeng e in cancer management; cancers across patients are a particularly heterogeneous disease [8], which makes it im p e r a t i v e t o s e l e c t a p e r - sonalized treatment combination in order to overcome resistance s [9]. This paradigm of applying tailored treatment to every individual patient, is com monly referred to as 'preci- sion medicine'. This thesis investigates how novel quantitative radioimaging based diag- nostic approaches to phenotype tumors can be used in conjunctio n with tissue based genotyping of tumors to assess tumors more accurately. We prese nt results of multiple studies, in which we have documented mechanistic connections be tween radioimaging, gene expression traits, somatic mutations, and clinical outcome s including overall survival, progression-free survival, an d pathologic histology. The core of this thesis are radi ogenomic analyses linking radio imaging and mo- lecular biology for precision medicine in cancer. In the follow ing, the thesis objectives are f o r m u l a t e d a n d t h e s t r u c t u r e o f t h e t h e s i s i s o u t l i n e d . N e x t , w e recapitulate the funda- mental importance of precision medicine in cancer and the role of radiation oncology in clinical care. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of \"radio mics\", an automated, quan- titative approach to assess the radiographic phenotype of a tum o r b a s e d o n m a c h i n e learning. Furthermore, we review current radiomics literature w ith a focus on prognostic and predictive value of radiomic approaches across several canc er types, as well as prelim- inary results exploring molecular relationships. In addition, w e will build on current radi- omics literature to motivate the thesis goals of unraveling the mechanistic connections of radiomics, tumor biology, and clinical outcomes. Thesis Objectives Radiomics is a novel field that seeks to innovate current cance r management by automati- cally converting standard medical images of tumors into actiona ble quantitative data. This data can then be objectively characterized using computational statistics and machine learning to create predictive models of disease progression. De spite the enormous poten-Introduction and Outline 11 tial to complement current diagn ostic approaches, including gen omic profiling, little is known about the biological princ iples that underlie radiomics. The goal of this thesis is to elucidate biological mechanisms t hat drive radiomic imaging phenotypes in solid tumors, information that could be l everaged to predict bene- fits of targeted drugs (i.e., imaging-biomarkers). To this end, we present integrative anal- yses that combined quantitative imaging, molecular interrogatio n, and clinical parameters. These results were obtained on large, independent, and novel co horts of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma multiforme, which a r e t w o o f t h e m o s t a g - gressive and common cancer types in adults. Moreover, we made a ll underlying data as well as documented analysis code publicly available wherever po ssible, to ensure repro- ducibility of our results and ena ble further translational rese arch. Figure 1: Integrative Radiomics for Precision Medicine. The goal of this thesis is to create holistic views of solid tu mors from three different combined angles: imaging, biology, and clinical factors. This is achieved by profiling tu mors with radiomics, molecul ar methods, and clinical follow-up, respectively. The end goal of this holistic view is an advanced understanding of the current state of a tumor to assign more effective therapies to individual patients . Chapter 1 12 Outline This doctoral thesis is structured in five parts comprising ten chapters in total. Part 1 is a general introduction to radiomic s, its potential impact of prec ision medicine in cancer, and the challenges of biological rea soning of radiomic based biomar kers. The core of this the- sis is structured in Part 2 to 4 that present published studies conducting research on the underlying biology of radiomics, their implications on targeted therapies, and the need for rigorous and technical machine learning methods for radiomic pr ognostication. Finally, Part 5 discusses those results in the context of current clinic al practice and future devel- opments. We briefly summarize the thesis chapters below. Part 1: Introduction Chapter 1 provides background information and literature research on pre cision medicine in cancer, biomarkers, radiation oncology and its potential for cancer diagnostics, the emerging field of quantitative ra diomics, and challenges in rev ealing the biological basis of radiomic based predictions for clinical decision support. Part 2: Radiomics and it s Underlying Biology Chapter 2 defines the biological basis of radiomics by linking a broad s et of radiomic fea- tures extracted from CT lung tumor scans to molecular pathways based on global gene expression analyses. Furthermore, we link these results to clin ical factors, including tumor stage, histology, and overall surv ival. Importantly, we validat ed our results on several lev- els, including statistical valid ation with independent datasets and biological experiments. Finally, we shed light on the current academic discussion wheth e r r a d i o m i cs a d d s p r o g- nostic value to existing predicto rs based on genomic or clinica l data. Chapter 3 extends the results from Chapter 3 to associations between vol umetric pheno- typic features of glioblastoma derived from MRI and gene expres sion data. Chapter 4 adds novel insight about how such volu metric features are connected to somatic mutations of oncodriver and tumor suppressor genes. Part 3: Radiomics for Targeted Therapies Chapter 5 presents an extensive study tha t investigated prognostic value of radiomics for patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic treat- ment currently approved for recurrent glioblastoma in the US. T his study was conducted on data from a clinical phase II trial that contributed to acce lerated approval be the US FDA. Introduction and Outline 13 Chapter 6 aimed at defining a radiomic res ponse phenotype to gefitinib, a n EGFR inhibi- tor. Similar to Chapter 5, this study investigated whether radi omics could be a valuable tool to predict an EGFR target i n patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Here as well, this study was performed on data fro m a clinical phase II trial. Part 4: Prognostic Value of Radiomic Machine Learning Chapter 7 evaluates a diverse host of machine learning algorithms for ra diomic prognosti- cation in lung cancer. This study aimed at suggesting optimal m achine learning methods for future radiomic studies using overall survival as clinical endpoint. Chapter 8 provides insights on how pathological response can be predicted in lung cancer by incorporating unsupervised machine learning methods. Chapter 9 extends those results by incorporating advanced supervised mach ine learning methods to optimize radiomic pre dictions. The clinical endpoint here was, for the first time, distant metastasis and in cluded independent validation of the results. Part 5: Discussion and Future Perspectives Chapter 10 concludes this doctoral thesis by discussing the overall impact that our radio- mic studies have on the general scientific and oncological comm unity. Individual studies that are part of this thesis are linked to each other and embed ded into future perspectives to innovate clinical decisio n making in cancer care. Precision Medicine and Tumor Heterogeneity Precision medicine refers to the paradigm of offering patients individualized treatment on the basis of their personal data. In oncology, different layers of patient data are already considered when treating patients, including tissue, family his tory, demographics, and blood markers [10-12]. More sophisticated approaches that take the biological makeup of a tumor into account are increasingly available in clinical pra ctice [13-16], especially geno- typing of tumors to test applicability of compounds that target specific genetic mutations. One of the major obstacles of individualizing patients with can cer is that cancer is a heterogeneous disease, which limits both diagnostics and trea tment. It is well established t h a t t h e d e g r e e o f h e t e r o g e n e i t y v a r i e s t e m p o r a l l y [ 1 7 ] , i n t e n s ifying these issues in later stage cancers where diagnostic and treatment are even more deci sive. Generally, the scien- tific and clinical community between inter- and int ra-tumor heterogeneity. Inter-tumor heterogeneity refers to the heterogeneity of tumors observed across differen t patients [18]. This entails that gene mutations, expression, an d metabolism in tumors may Chapter 1 14 differ even for cancers of the same tissue. Consequently, the d isease phenotype may dif- fer as well, requiring adaptation of treatment. To date, howeve r, treatment is largely based on tissue type, histology of the tumor, and risk factors such as age, gender, or other risk factors [19]; basing treatm ent on molecular profiling woul d enable to individualize treatment even further. Cases where molecular profiling has alr eady been successful in treating patients mainly include genetic testing for targetable mutations [20]. Intra-tumor heterogeneity refers to heterogeneity of the population of cancerous cells that a tumor is comprised of [18]. The genetic and genomic land scape of these cells varies substantially explained by darwinian clonal evolution [9]. As a result, genomic profiling of tumors may deliver contradicting views on mutations, expression , and metabolism of a cell mass, depending on the spatial and temporal properties of the sampled tissue [8,9]. This means, for example, that even though a certain number of c ancerous cells may con- tain a specific mutation that is susceptible to a targeted drug , the tumor as a system can become resistant to that drug as soon as cells without the corr esponding mutation have outgrown the other susceptible cells. This adaptation of diseas e phenotype is one of the most common mechanism of acqu ired drug resistance [21]. While molecular profiling via sin biopsy can account for inter-tumor heterogenei- ty, single-needle assessment is limited by intra- tumor heterogeneity [8] as the spatial location of the tissue sample is crucial. Multiple approaches have been suggest- ed to account for intra-tumor heterogeneity, including combinat ion therapies, single-cell analysis, and assessment of molecular cell-free DNA [22-25]. T he ideal scenario of preci- sion medicine in practice would be a holistic view that incorpo rates multiple of those ap- proaches on a longitudinal scale for immediate intervention. Co mmon goals of those ap- proaches include understanding of the mechanisms of treatment r esponse and combating the development of resistances to expand life expectancies of p atients living with cancer. Biomarkers Biomarkers are a fundamental tool in precision medicine. Biomar kers are defined as an objective state of a biological process that can be measured re producibly and which indi- cates a medical condition of a patient [26,27]; examples range from blood pressure, over genomic assays, to radioimaging based parameters. Biomarkers ar e developed to predict clinical endpoints based on which treatment options can be desi gned to improve morbidi- ty and mortality. The underlying assumption is that the same tr eatment may not show the same efficacy in patients that sh ow different biological indica tions. In oncology, a variety of biomarkers have been proposed on the basis of nucleic acids (e.g. genetic mutations or expression), proteins, or anti bodies [28]. Such biomarkers can be used for screening, di fferential diagnosis, prognosis, a nd prediction of treatment response or recurrence. Most often, these biomarkers have been developed from analyz-Introduction and Outline 15 i n g a l t e r a t i o n s t o h e a l t h y i n d i v i d u a l s . A b i o m a r k e r ca n a l s o b e a simultaneous measure- ment of a group of biological processes; for example, the combi ned expression of a group of genes, termed gene signature, can be used for prognosis [29] . Biomarkers for cancer subtype identification: An important in oncology is predicting tumor subt ypes to stratify patients into more effective treatment groups. A prominent example of this is inhibition of epidermal- growth-factor-receptor (EGFR) in cases where a sensitizing mutation is present in this gene [30,31]. Drugs that target this mutation, such as Erlotinib, Gefitinib, and Afatini b, have shown dramatic effica- cy in lung cancer [32] and simila r results have been suggested for other EGFR targets in colon cancer [33]. Without an effective biomarker to assess mut ational status of tumors, targeted drugs could not be prescribed. As noted earlier, applicability of single-needle biopsy based b iomarkers is limited in clinical practice due to intra-tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, alternati ve approaches towards biomarkers are currently being explored to augment molecular pr ofiling of tumors. One of these approaches is tumor phenotyping based on radiographic ima ging [34]. Imaging bi- omarkers aim at assessing tumor phenotype by analyzing images o f tumors generated from radiographic scanners [35]. Medical Imaging in Cancer Medical imaging is crucial to an integral cancer management and is used clinically, as well as pre-clinically [36]. Medical imaging can generate visualizat ions on multiple scaling lev- els, ranging from molecular imag ing (e.g., cell surface recepto rs) to anatomical imaging (e.g., organs) [36,37]. In clinic al oncology, radiology deals w ith anatomical imaging tech- niques to visualize solid and soft tissue within the body of pa tients, particularly tumors. Importantly, these techniques are non-invasive, meaning that ti ssue will not be damaged to create a visualization. Non-i nvasiveness also implies that r adiographic interrogation can be applied longitudinally for long-term monitoring without addi tional acquisition risk to patients, which is a considerable advantage compared to invasiv e biopsies. Radiation on- cologists utilize anatomical imagi ng to detect, locate, and dia gnose a tumor [36]. Further- more, imaging serves as guidance t o o l i n s u r g i c a l r e s e c t i o n o f tumors and is utilized in treatment planning in radiation therapy. Imaging modalities: Different imaging techniques have been developed; for example, X- R a y , C o m p u t e d T o m o gr a p h y ( C T ) , M a g n e t i c R e s o n a n ce I m a gi n g ( M R ) , or Positron Emis- (PET) [36]. are used for diffe rent purposes, mainly de- pending on the tissue of the can cer. For example, while CT is t he primary imaging modality to visualize lung cancer, MRI is the primary choice for brain c ancer. Furthermore, PET pro- vides functional images, which i ndicate metabolically active ar eas of tumors [38]. Chapter 1 16 Imaging criteria for disease assessment: Several imaging based criteria have been devel- oped to assess characteristics, such as tumor stage or response to treatment, for example the Tumor Nodule Metastasis (TNM) system [39], the Response Eva luation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) [40], or the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncol ogy Criteria (RANO) [41,42]. While these criteria are widely implemented in hospita ls treating patients with cancer, performance of these metrics is limited due to inherent oversimplifications. For example, treatment response by RECIST has been documented to no t correlate with sur- vival outcome in many cases [43], which from a clinical perspec tive it should. Similarly, reproducibility issues have been r eported for TNM staging and r esponse by RANO [44-46]. greatest with crit eria such as RECIST, RANO, or TNM are A) that these re- quire subjective human measurements [46], B) that these criteri a incorporate only a lim- ited subset of available information [47], and C) that these cr iteria provide qualitative as- sessment only [48]. Hence, there is an urgent need for the deve lopment of objective and quantitative imaging metrics that leverage as much available in formation as possible. Radiomics Radiomics is an emerging field aiming at generating actionable insights from standard ana- tomical imaging in an automated way. Hereby, the goal is to qua ntify the imaging pheno- type of a tumor to inform treatment decisions [49]. As genomics refers to the collectivity of all genes within a cell, radiomics refers to the collectivit y of all quantitative radiographic features of a subject of interest. Although radiomics can be ap plied to any condition that can be imaged, radiomics is most developed in oncology. Here, r adiomics has the potential to improve human-derived imaging diagnostic and response criter ia by providing an objec- tive, comprehensive, and quantit ative view of a tumor [37,50]. T o a c h i e v e t h i s , a l a r g e number of quantitative features defining tumor intensity, shape , and texture are automat- ically extracted from the entire visually segmented tumor volum e and subsequently char- acterized using data mining and machine learning [51]. Human in teraction in classification and scoring of tumors is not required, but quality control by a physician is desired. Radiomics for predictive disease modeling: Multiple studies have documented prognostic and predictive value of radiomic s for several clinical endpoint s [49,52-57]. Aerts et al. found significant prognostic valu e of a radiomic CT signature d eveloped for overall survival that validated across multiple i ndependent cohorts of patients with lung and head & neck cancer [49]. Prognostic value across several cancer types has b een also observed in a radi- omic PET signature [58,59], In c olorectal cancer, a seminar stu dy by Huang et al. described a radiomics nomogram to predict lymph node metastases [60]. Fur ther studies suggest that radiomic approaches can dist inguish between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue [61,62], which is especially relev ant in population screening [ 5]. These studies have in common that they investigated how radiomi c quantities are associated with clinical out comes to build prognostic and p redictive models. The cen-Introduction and Outline 17 tral hypothesis of radiomics is that medical images of tumors d o not only visualize the tu- mor burden, but deliver minable data about the tumor type that is currently not used clin- ically [50]. Furthermore, these data are likely to be complemen tary to already clinically available data from patient history or biopsies [63]. In this c ase, radiomics could lead to the development of advanced clinical decision support system th at incorporate automat- ed medical image analysis into their workflow. Radiomic innovation for clinical cancer management: Radiomics has several novel and complementary advantages compared to more traditional approache s, including single- needle biopsy based diagnostics [64]. First, radiomics is medic al imaging based and there- fore non-invasive, which allows longitudinal monitoring at low additional acquisition risk t o p a t i e n t s . S e c o n d , r a d i o m i c s u s e s o b j e c t i v e m e a s u r e m e n t s t h a t are predefined and hence can be reproduced by any physician given the same data. T hird, radiomics provides quantitative, not just qualitativ e, measurements. Fourth, radio mics is comprehensive and not subject to intra-tumor heterogeneity as the entire (visible ) t u m o r i s t a k e n i n t o a c - count, not just a sample from it. Finally, radiomics has unprec edented potential to play a central role in clinical cancer management, as imaging is routi nely and frequently used in oncology and therefore avoids major additional costs of a novel technology; the innova- tion of radiomics is not the generation of data, but the transl ation and analysis of existing and previously unconsidered data. Radiomics workflow The radiomic workflow can be grouped into the four steps: 1) im age acquisition, 2) tumor segmentation, 3) high-throughput feature extraction, and 4) int egrated analysis (Figure 2). All of these steps are active research areas that are hypothesi zed to ultimately lead to bet- ter risk stratification of patie nts into more beneficial treatm ent groups. Figure 2: The Radiomics Workflow . Radiomics is organized in four steps, starting with the acqui sition of medical images of a tumor via radiographic imaging modalities, such as c o m p u te d t o m o g r a p hy ( CT ) o r m a g n e t i c r e s o - nance imaging (MRI). On the basi s of these images, tumors are s egmented in 3D, usually along the axial dimen- s i o n . F r o m t h e se g m e n t e d t u m o r v olumes, quantitative radiomic f eatures are automatically extracted in high- throughput, including first-order statistics, shape features, a nd texture features. Finally , these features are ana- lyzed and can be further integra ted with other sources, such as gene expression data and clinical records. Chapter 1 18 1) Image acquisition: The first step in the radiomics pipeline is the acquisition of images of the region of interest, in this case the tumor. Image acquisiti on has experienced substan- tial advances over the last decade, especially in terms of hard ware and image reconstruc- tion algorithms [36,37]. In addition, standardized imaging prot ocols have contributed in harmonizing images across hospit als [37,65]. From those images, segmentations are of the tumors are obtained. 2) Segmentation: Delineation or segmentation of the three dimensional tumor vol ume is the basis of extracting radiomic tumor imaging features, althou gh historically features were also extracted from two dimensional slides [66-68]. Segmen tation of tumors is usu- ally performed on axial slices following the image acquisition of radiographic modalities. While manual segmentation of tumors is the current standard for most tumors and imag- ing modalities, semi-automated and fully automatic tools are av ailable. For instance, the GrowCut algorithm implemented into the 3D-Slicer platform (www. slicer.org) is a freely available semi-automatic segmentation algorithm [69,70]. An exa mple for fully automatic segmentation of brain lesions is given by the BraTumIA (Brain T umor Image Analysis) algo- rithm [71], which has been shown to readily yield accurate segm entations [72,73]. Regard- less of whether automated procedures have been employed or not, the final tumor seg- mentation has to be verified by an experienced radiation oncolo gist. 3) Feature extraction: Quantitative imaging features are extracted from the segmented tu- mor images in high-throughput a nd can broadly be grouped into f irst-order statistics, tumor shape, and tumor texture [37]. First-order statistics are distr ibutional parameters of the gray-level intensity values of the tumors that include minimum, maximum, mean, variance, dynamic range, kurtosis, skewness, entropy, and energy. Shape f eatures include sphericity, volume, diameter, and elongation. Texture an important group; these features quantify re-occurring gray-level patterns within an image. For exam- ple, how often gray-levels of the same discretized values are a djacent to each other, or the number of voxels (i.e., pixels in three dimensions) that a stre tch of increasing gray-level values has. In this way, texture features can be a proxy to qua ntifying intra-tumoral hetero- geneity. In fact, texture features seem to be amongst the most promising features in terms of prognosis [49,55,74,75]. First-order statistics and texture features are often also extract- ed after filtering methods, such as wavelets or Laplace of Gaus sian, have been applied to the original image. A comprehensive open source package for rad iomic feature extraction is PyRadiomics, available through GitHub at https://github.com/Rad iomics/pyradiomics. 4) Integrated analysis: Finally, the crucial part of the radiomics workflow is the anal ysis of the extracted features. From all features, the most informative are selected with unsuper- vised and supervised feature selection procedures [63]. A numbe r of current studies also employ a stability dataset for preprocessing to filter for high ly reproducible features [49,68,76]. As all features are quantitative, statistical model s can be fitted to test for cor-Introduction and Outline 19 relations and predictive power for clinical endpoints, includin g overall and progression- free survival [64]. In addition to clinical records, an importa nt step is integrating the radi- omic imaging data with molecular data, such as gene expression and mutation. Hereby, the goal is to gain wider insights of the disease progression b y leveraging as many data sources as possible while assuming that these data types delive r complementary infor- mation to each other. Other Type of Image Features While this thesis deals with automated quantitative radiomic fe atures, other types of fea- tures can be extracted from medical imaging [64]. The available feature sets range from qualitative to quantitative featur es. Semantic features, such a s the MRI scoring scheme VA- SARI (Visually AcceSAble Rembrandt Images, https://wiki.nci.nih .gov/display/CIP/VASARI), provide semantic meaning to their annotation. The advantage of these features is that they are typically developed by an expert radiologist. However, this also implies that human as- sessment is required and therefor e intra- and inter variability and time management may become issues. Furthermore, these features cannot provide quant itative annotations, but yield a qualitative, and sometime s ordinal, perspective. Other types of standardized lexica similar to VASARI have been described and documented [77-81]. The Biological Found ation of Radiomics A fundamental concern about effo rts aiming at clinical translat ion of radiomics is that the underlying biology of radiomics is poorly understood. As an inc reasing number of studies document prognostic and predictive value of radiomic features, it is crucial to enrich these associations with their biological rationale to reason about th e validity of radiomics based predictive tools. For example, a central hypothesis of radiomic s is that molecular hetero- geneity of tumors can translate into macroscopic imaging featur es [82,83]. Furthermore, enhancing radiomics with biological knowledge would allow a mor e holistic view of the disease state of a tumor and thereby close translational gaps o f imaging biomarkers. These goals could be achieved by developing and applying integr ative analyses that com- bine radiomic image analysis, mol ecular information, and clinic al records. Gene expression analyses: Preliminary studies have investigated associations of radiomic derived features and molecular data. In terms of expression of genes, Segal et al. [84] were among the first to suggest that global gene expression pat terns in primary human liver cancer could be decoded by radiomic features derived from CT imaging. The authors hypothesized that a combination of 28 features could reconstruc t 78% of expressed genes, revealing cell proliferation and liver functions. A more target ed approach was conducted by Kuo et al. [85] who investigated whether predefined imaging phenotypes correlated with transcriptional responses to doxorubicin in hepatocellular carcinoma. Similarly, Diehn Chapter 1 20 et al. [86] how semantic neuroimaging features in gliob lastoma multiforme (GBM) relate to expression of genes, such as EGFR. Associations of ra diomic features, gene ex- pression, and patient survival in non-small cell lung cancer (N SCLC) was first well described by Gevaert et al. [66]. More recently, Itakura et al. [75] also suggested three novel radio- mic imaging phenotypes in GBM. In a seminal study by Aerts et a l. [49], the authors re- vealed biological pathways that were associated with four featu re of a prognostic radiomic signature that validat ed across multiple d atasets [49,87]. Mutations in the genome: In terms of genomic mutations, a number of studies focused on investigating whether radiomics yields predictive value for a s mall number of widely ac- cepted oncogenetic driver mutati ons. For example, Liu et al. [8 8] demonstrated that radi- omic features predict the presen ce of EGFR mutations in an Asia n cohort of patients with peripheral NSCLC adenocarcinoma. Similarly, a recent study sugg ested that radiomic fea- tures can predict EGFR across multiple cohorts [89]. Associations of radi- omics and genetic mutations in NSCLC, including EGFR, KRAS, and ALK, have been also de- scribed by other work [90-93]. The biological challenge of radiomics: Various further preliminary studies have been pub- lished with regard to radiomics an d some type of molecular char acterization [94-101], but validity of these studies has generally been hampered by the fa ct that those results are based on small sample sizes, lack independent validation, or fo cused only on a subset of radiomic features and biological entities, such as genes. Furth ermore, the canonical links between radiomics, its underlying biology, and the final clinic al patient outcome have not been described with a convincing body of data driven evidence y et. To this end, this thesis aims at uncovering the underlying biology of radiomics and inte rpreting those results in the context of clinical patient outcome. The end goal of these studies is to point out both phenotypic (on the imaging level) and genotypic (on the molecul ar level) differences across patients who are treated for solid tumors to gain a holi stic view of the disease state of the cancer and enable possib ilities of offering more persona lized treatments.

Aerts Chapter 2 30 ABSTRACT Medical imaging can visualize ch aracteristics of human cancer n oninvasively. Radiomics is an emerging field that translates these medical images into qua ntitative data to enable phenotypic profiling of tumors. While radiomics has been associ ated with several clinical endpoints, the complex relations hips of radiomics, clinical fac tors, and tumor biology are largely unknown. To this end, we analyzed two independent cohor ts of respectively 262 N o r t h A m e r i c a n a n d 8 9 E u r o p e a n p a t i e n t s w i t h l u n g c a n c e r , a n d c onsistently identified previously undescribed associati ons between radiomic imaging fe atures, molecular pathways, and clinical factors. In particular, we found a relat ionship between imaging features, immune response, inflammation, and survival, which wa s further validated by immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, a number of imaging fea tures showed p r e d i c t i v e v a l u e f o r s p e c i f i c p a thways; for example, intra-tumo r heterogeneity features predicted activity of RNA polyme rase transcription (AUC = 0.62, p = 0 . 0 3 ) a n d i n t e n s i t y dispersion was predictive of the autodegration pathway of ligase (AUC = 0.69, p <10-4) . F i n a l l y, w e o b s e r v e d t h a t p r o g n o s t i c b i o m a r k e r s p e r f o r m e d h i ghest when combining radiomic, genetic, and clinical information (CI = 0.73, p<10-9) indicating complementary value of these data.

The underlying biology of radiomics 31 ELIFE DIGEST Medical imaging covers a wide range of techniques that are used to look inside the body, including X-rays, MRI scans and ultrasound. A process called ra diomics uses computer al- gorithms to process the data collected by these techniques to i dentify and precisely measure a large number of features that would not otherwise be quantifiable by human experts. By doing so, radiomics can automatically measure the r adiographic characteristics of a tumor. For example, radiomics can establish the size, shap e and texture of a tumor to help to diagnose cancer an d guide its treatment. Research has suggested that radiomics can predict certain clini cal characteristics of cancer, such as how far through the body the cancer has spre ad, how likely it is to re- spond to treatment, and how likely a patient is to survive. How ever, these radiomic char- acteristics have not yet been pr ecisely linked to the biologica l p r o ce s s e s t h a t d r i v e h o w cancer develops and spreads. Cancers develop as a result of genetic changes that activate \"m olecular path- ways\" in the cells and trigger processes such as cell division and inflammation. To work out exactly which changes are behind a particular tumor, a samp le of the tumor from bi- opsy or surgery is analyzed using genomics techniques. Linking radiomics features to the molecular processes active in a tumor can generate further info rmation that can comple- ment the molecular data. Images are routinely collected on all cancer patients yet molecu- lar data is not. Hence, in some cases, the images can be used t o infer the molecular un- derpinnings of cancer in individual patients. Grossmann et al. have now analyz ed radiomic, genomic and clinic al data collect- ed from approximately 350 patients with lung cancer. The analys is revealed links between biological processes normally det ected by genomics - in particu lar, inflammatory respons- e s - a n d r a d i o m i c s f e a t u r e s . F u r t h e r m o r e , t h e s e f e a t u r e s c o u l d also be associated with clinical characteristics, such as tumor type and patient surviv al rates. These results were further validated by using a technique called immunohistochemic al staining on tumor tis- sue obtained by surgery. Further investigation revealed that certain radiomics features can predict the state of molecular pathways that are key to cancer development (such as the inflammato- ry response). Furthermore, Grossmann et al. found that combinin g data from radiomics, genomics and clinical parameters predicts how the cancer will p rogress better than any of these parameters can predict on their own. These results demons trate the complemen- tary value of radiomic data to genomic and c linical data. There are many different algorithms that can be used to process images for radi- omics. Before radiomics can be u sed clinically to assess the bi ological processes underlying the tumors of patients, a specific algorithm needs to be decide d upon and then tested in prospective clinical trials. Chapter 2 32 INTRODUCTION 'Precision medicine' promotes the molecular characterization of a p a t i e n t ' s t u m o r w i t h genomic approaches, which requires tissue extraction usually ob tained via biopsy. A num- ber of examples demonstrate succe ssful translation of genomic i nformation obtained from biopsies into clinical applicatio n s ( D o r o s h o w a n d K u m m a r , 2 0 1 4 ) , but these approaches also have inherent limitations, such as their invasive nature o r sampling artifacts caused b y i n t r a - t u m o r h e t e r o g e n e i t y ( S o t t o r i v a e t a l . , 2 0 1 3 ; F i s h e r e t al., 2013; Gerlinger et al., 2012). These limitations can be addressed by medical imaging th at has served as crucial diagnostic tool and treatment gu idance in clinical oncology. In contrast to biopsies, medi- cal imaging is usually noninvasiv e, can be applied longitudinal ly, and provides information about the entire visible tumor volume. In this way, medical ima ging has the potential to characterize phenotypic information of tumors and thus compleme nt molecular interroga- t i o n ( C h o i e t a l . , 2 0 1 6 ) . A s i m a g i n g i s a l r e a d y u s e d r o u t i n e l y throughout the course of treatment this facilitates ready a ccess to this type of data. T herefore, imaging has the po- tential to serve as valuable diagnostic tool in clinical decisi on making by complementing biological interrogation or serv i n g a s a s u r r o g a t e i n s e t t i n g s where biospecimen-derived diagnostics is not feasible, such as in longitudinal monitoring . Radiomics is an emerging field th at translates these medical im ages into minea- ble data by extracting a large number of quantitative imaging f eatures that objectively define tumor intensity, shape, size, and texture (Gillies et al ., 2016; Aerts, 2016; Lambin et al., Kumar et al., 2012) in a robust and reproducible way (Zhao et al., 2016; Fried et al., 2014; Balagurunathan et al. , 2014; Leijenaar et al., 2013) . As this approach is applied to existing standard of care images, radiomics can be cost-effecti vely integrated with ge- nomics or serve as surrogate in cases where biopsies are not fe asible (O'Connor et al., 2015). Hence, such strategies can be of value for the developme nt of clinical biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and pred iction of response to specifi c treatments (Choi et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016a, 2016b; 2015; Gevaert et al., 2013; Mattonen et al., 2016; Grossmann et al., 2017). Due to the enormous potential fo r precision medicine, an increasing number of studies have investigated associations bet ween imaging and tumor b i o l o g y i n d i f f e r e n t c a n c e r t y p e s ( A e r t s e t a l . , 2 0 1 4 ; G e v a e r t et al., 2012; Diehn et al., 2008; Grossmann et al., 2016; et al., 2015; Segal et al. , 2007; Li et al., 2016; Yoon et al., 2015). However, these studies focused on specific genet ic associations, or tended to be underpowered due to a limited number of available samples an d lacked validation via independent datasets. Here, we present a broad radio mic-genomic anal ysis in independe nt and large cohorts of patients with lung cancer. We rigorously investigate d the mechan istic connec- tions between imaging phenotypes and underlying molecular pathw ays. Furthermore, we validated key associations via i mmunohistochemical staining and related these associa- The underlying biology of radiomics 33 tions to clinical factors. In addition, we developed and valida ted radiomic predictors of pathway activation status, and investigated the prognostic valu e of combining radiomic biomarkers with genetic and clinical data. In this study, we ai med at uncovering whether radiomic approaches have the potential to predict both molecula r and clinical characteris- tics of tumors noninvasively and therefore have the potential t o augment clinical decision- making using data extracted from standard of care medical image s. RESULTS To uncover the mechanistic connections between radiomic phenoty pes, molecular path- ways, and clinical information, we performed an integrated radi omic-genomic analysis of a lung cancer discovery cohort (Dataset1, n = 2 6 2 ) , a n d v a l i d a t e d o u r r e s u l t s o n a n i n d e - pendent validation cohort (Dataset2, n = 89). We defined and radiomic fea- tures from CT scans (Figure 1A) quantifying tumor intensity, sh ape, and texture (Figure 1B), detailed in Supplementary file 1. Our approach to integrat e radiomic, genomic, and clinical data is outlined in Figu re 2 and clinical cohort chara cteristics are given in Table 1. Figure 1 (A) Workflow of extracting radiomic features: (I) A lung tumor is scanned in multiple slices. (II) Next, the tumor is delineated in every slice and validated by an experienced physi cian. This allows creation of a 3D representation of the tumor outlining phenotypic d ifferences of tumors. (III) Rad iomic features are extracted from this 3D mask, and (IV) integrated with genomic and clinical data. ( B) Representative examples of lung cancer tumors.

Chapter 2 34 Figure 2 Schema of our strategy to define robust radiomic-pathway-clinic al relationships. Two independent lung cancer cohorts (D1 and D2) with radiomic ( R), genomic (G), and clinical (C) data were ana- lyzed. D1 (n = 262) was used as a discovery cohort and D2 (n = 89) was used to validate our findings. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) appro ach assessed scor es for radiomi c-pathway associations. These scores were bi- clustered to modules that contain features and pathways with co herent expression patterns. These modules may overlap and vary in size. Clinical association to overall survi val (red), pathologic histology (purple), and TNM stage (yellow) was statistically tested in both datasets, a nd results were combined in a meta-analysis to investigate relationships of modules. Association modules of radiomic features and molecular pathways To investigate the main associations of radiomics and underlyin g molecular pathways, we radiomic-pathway coher ency. Bi-clustering al- lowed simultaneous grouping of coherently expressed features an d pathways into a single module, thereby reducing dimensionality. Using this approach, w e identified thirteen ra- diomic-pathway modules in Dataset1 that were independently vali dated in Dataset2 (FDR < 0.05).

For example, texture entropy and cluster feature s, as well as voxel intensity variance features were associated with the immune system, the p 53 pathway, and other Chapter 2 38 pathways involved in cell cycle regulation in modules M2, M9, a nd M12 (Table 2 and Figure 3A). In another module (M8), we found those featur es to also be associated with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) receptor signaling . Further examples for radiomic-pathway links included two module s (M13 and M7) that were highly enriched for pathways involved in mitochon drial pathways, tran- scription, translation, and onl y one exception, all fea- tures in the larger module (M13) were voxel intensity entropy f eatures. In addition to this feature type, the smaller module (M7) contained mainly textural variance and information correlation features. Table 3 Pathway prediction and clinical association.

Three modules (M2, M9, and modules M4-8, and M10-13) were significantly associated stage and five modules (M5, M6, and The exac t p-values of all modules are given in Supplementary file 2. We examined and summarized the relationships of clinical status , module size, and over- lap of modules in a network (Figure 3B and Table 3). We found t hat smaller modules tend- ed not to be associated with the tested clinical factors. The t otal number of shared fea- tures or pathways was Jaccard r ange [0.01, 0.59]). Inter- estingly, with showed diff erent clinical associations. Radiomic predictors of pathway status To test whether radiomic features can predict if a pathway is a ctivated or deleted in indi- vidual patients, we fitted univariate models of radiomic featur es on Dataset1 and selected f o r e v e r y m o d u l e t h e s t r o n g e s t p r e d i c t o r i n D a t a s e t 1 a c c o r d i n g t o t h e a r e a u n d e r t h e curve (Fawcett, 2006) (AUC) for v alidation in Dataset2. As show n in Table 3 and Table 3\u2014 source data 1, the overall biological and radiomic themes in a module were well repre- sented by these individual predictors. For example, a Laplace o f Gaussian intensity stand- ard deviation feature was predictive of the autodegration pathw ay of the = 0.69, p <10 4) in module M2, which was also associated with p53. Im- portantly, COP1 mediates p53 and may interact with autophagy (R abbani et al., 2 0 1 4 ; K o b a y a s h i e t a l . , 2 0 1 3 ) , w h i c h a r e k n o w n d r i v e r s o f t u m o r igenesis. Indeed, this module M2 was associated with OS. We found further examples of this radiomic-genomic- clinical link to be important: For example, a texture feature ( information correlation) pre- dicted trafficking of GLUR2 containing AMPA receptors (AUC = 0. 69, p<104) in module 5, which was associated with lipoprotein metabolism and stage. Fur ther, two shape features 0.66, also associated with axon guid ance and histology. Furthermore, we assessed these representative features in terms of their predic- tive value for driver mutations in the discovery cohort; based on a subset of 60 patients whose tumors were profiled with Sanger sequencing, we estimate that the prevalence of mutated EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 are 15%, 35%, and 20%, respectivel y. In particular, we found strong performance for mutations in EGFR and KRAS by seve ral features, but only one considerable performance for TP53 (Figure 3\u2014figure suppleme n t 1 ) . I n t e r e s t i n g l y , Chapter 2 40 predictive value for EGFR and KR AS were selective in that featu res had relatively high per- formance for one gene but not both. Predictive power for smokin g history was low to moderate (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2). Immunohistochemical investigation To further investigate putative connections between radiomics, immune response path- ways, and OS we performed immunohistochemical staining of 22 tu mors for CD3, a T-cell c o - r e c e p t o r . T h e s e t u m o r s w e r e p r e d i c t e d t o s h o w r e l a t i v e l y h i g h o r l o w i m m u n e r e - sponse by a radiomics feature se lected from the three modules ( M2, M9, and M12) that were associated with OS. As represented in Figure 4, we found a greement between radi- omics and pathology; cases that were pathologically scored to h ave high CD3 enrichment also expressed significantly highe r radiomic values (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=0.008). Furthermore, we tested the extent to which radi omic predictors of inflam- mation can be reproduced immunohistochemically. We built on our previous results sug- gesting that the radiomic shape feature sphericity predicts NFk B activation (module 10) and analyzed 24 stained tumors that were predicted to have rela tively high or low NFkB activity for of NFkB (Figure sup plement 1). Pathological assessment of enrichment for RelA revealed that those cases tha t indicated high RelA en- r i c h m e n t o n a v e r a g e a l s o h a d h i g h e r r a d i o m i c f e a t u r e s c o r e s ( o n e-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=0.06). Prognostic value of radiomic signatures To build on previously published results, we investigated progn ostic value of an existing radiomic signature for survival of lung cancer. We fitted a Cox proportional-hazards model of this signature on Dataset1 and observed significant validati on by the concordance- index (CI) on Dataset2 (CI = 0.60, Noether p=0.04). Furthermore , we tested combinations of clinical, genetic, and radiomic data and observed that the c ombinations of data types tended to result in higher performances than given by the indiv idual data alone (Figure 5). I n p a r t i c u l a r , t h e p e r f o r m a n c e o f a c l i n i c a l m o d e l i n c r e a s e d f r om CI = 0.65 (Noether p=0.001) to CI = 0.73 (p=2\u00d710 9) when adding the radiomic and an existing gene signature (38Hou et al., 2010); this increase was significant at p=0.001 by permutation test. This combined radiomic-genetic-clinic a l m o d e l a l s o p e r f o r m e d s i g n i f i cantly better than the combined radiomic-clinical model (p=0.007) and the clinical-gen etic model (p=0.01). Add- ing radiomics to clinical data alone did not result in a signif icant increase (p=0.3). We re- peated this analysis with a novel radiomic survival signature a nd other published gene signatures (Yuan et al., 2004; Ch en et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2 00939-41), and found that the clinical-genetic-radiomic models consistently yielded the highe st performances in nearly all cases (Figure 5\u2014figure suppl ement 1 and Figure 5\u2014figure sup plement 2). The underlying biology of radiomics 41 Figure 4 Test for agreement between radiomic and pathological immune res ponse assessment.

DISCUSSION Medical imaging plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis, treat ment, and response monitor- ing. Radiomics allows quantification of the radiographic phenot ype of a tumor (Kuo and Jamshidi, 2014; Gillies et al., 2010; Rutman and Kuo, 2009), bu t the underly- ing connections of radiomics to tumor biology and clinical fact ors have not been elucidat- ed yet. In this study, Chapter 2 42 Figure 5 Combining prognostic signatures for overall survival. We tested combinations of clinical, genomic, and radiomic signa tures. To a clinical Cox proportional-hazards regression model with stage and histology, we first added a pub lished gene signature and next a published radi- omic signature. These models were fitted on Dataset1 and evalua ted with the C-index (CI) on Dataset2. An aster- isk indicates significance (p<0.05). Combining different data t ypes resulted in increased prognostic performances. By adding radiomic and genomic information, the initial perform ance of the clinical model was increased from CI = 0.65 (Noether p=0.001) to CI = 0.73 (p=2\u00d710 9). we identified novel and consistent associations between radiomi c phenotype data, under- lying molecular pathways, and c linical factors of patients with lung cancer in a North American cohort, and validated our findings in a European cohor t and with immunohisto- chemical staining. In addition, we presented radiomic predictor s for pathway activations, and demonstrated the complementary prognostic value of combinin g radiomic, genetic, and clinical information. Preliminary studies have previou sly investigated associations b etween imaging features, clinical factors, and molecular data for a number of cancer types as outlined in recent reviews (Gillies et al., 2016; Kuo and Ja mshidi, 2014; G illies et al., 2010; Rutman and Kuo, 2009; Cook et al., 201 3). Our analysis builds on these s t u d i e s i n t h a t w e p e r - formed a rigorous classification of a comprehensive set of radi omic features in terms of underlying molecular pathways on a genome-wide scale and clinic al fa ctors in lar ge and independent cohorts. Although the long-term vision is to augmen t clinical decision mak- i n g, t h e cu r r e n t go a l o f o u r s t u d y i s t o s a t i s f y t h e n e e d o f t h e radiomic and oncological community to better understand the underlying biological ration ale of radiomic predic- The underlying biology of radiomics 43 tions. Furthermore, we are the first to publicly share all stud y data and analysis code with the growing radiomic and biomedi cal community to enable further translational research. We identified and independently validated thirteen radiomic-pat hway modules with coherent expression patterns, eleven of which were signifi cantly associated with OS, stage, or histology. By basin g these clinical associations exclusively on radiomic fea- tures, we could demonstrate that the associated molecular pathw ays robustly matched radiomic- based hypotheses. For example, based on radiomic feat ures modules M2, M9, and M12 were prognostic and also associated with stage. These m odules were highly en- r i ch e d f o r i m m u n e s ys t e m , p 5 3 , a n d c e l l - cy cl e r e gu l a t i o n p a t h w a ys, biological processes that are widely recognized to play key roles in lung cancer. Fo r example, it has been estab- lished that cell cycle regulation is of utmost importance in lu ng cancer (Baldi et al., 2011). Furthermore, the status of p53 is reported to be a predictor of survival in lung cancer pa- tients (Ahrendt et al., 2003) and a recent review has laid out how p53 can modulate innate immune system responses (Menende z et al., 2013). Radiomic featu res in these quan tified textural entropy and persion image intensity values suggesting associations between textural heterogeneity, cell cycling, and prognosis. Therefore, these results suggest that noninvasive radiomic surr ogates may benefit diag- nostic methods in assessing cell cycling and imm une system stat es of tumors. We aimed at confirming our stat istical results indicating conne ctions be- tween radiomics, immune response, and survival by immunohistoch emical staining of lymphocytes in cases for which a relatively high or low immune response was predicted according to a radiomics score. We generally found high agreeme nt between pathology and radiomics, especially in cases where immune response was pr edicted to be high. In cases of predicted low responders that showed high pathological immune response, the cause of disagreement may be a heavy distribution of CD3 cluste rs in the extreme periph- ery of th e tu mor with very little staining in the b ulk of the t umor. In cases of predicted high responders that showed littl e to no immune response, this could be due to the lack of normal tissue margin around the ed ge of the tumor section or a sampling effect. Similarly, we stained tissue for RelA, the p65 subunit of NFkB, to validat e radiomic predictions of inflammation. Overall, we found high agreement between patholog y and radiomics, alt- hough at lower statistical significance. Future studies with wh ole mount sections stained with multi-plex phenotyping can help determine the relationship between a radiomic and a genetic immune or inflammation signature, and the gold standa rd. A variety of textural features were also associated with stage and histology (module M5). Similar associations have been reported by Ganesha n et al. (2010), who suggested that 2D texture features of lung cancer CT scans coul d predict if tu- mor stage was II or above. Here, we found that texture features were enriched for axon guidance and lipoprotein metabolism. Furthermore, we observed s trong associations be- tween image intensity entropy features and pathways involved in gene expression, tran- scription regulation, and mitochondrial processes (M13 and M7). Previous research has suggested that imaging can detect consequences of an increase i n the hypoxia-inducible Chapter 2 44 factor as a result of absence of oxygen (Gillies et al., 2010). Hence, if extracting quantita- tive information about mitochondrial pathways from medical imag es leads to assessment of hypoxia status of a tumor, this may ultimately aid in clinic al decision-making as alterna- t i v e t h e r a p i e s f o r h y p o x i c t u m o r a r e a s a r e b e i n g d e v e l o p e d ( D e n ny, 2010; Bryant et al., 2014). Indeed, previous work has indicated that CT pixel intens ities correlate with hypoxia markers (Ganeshan et al., 2013) . Those two modules (M1 and M3) that were not associated with any of the tested clinica l factors were relatively small modules; these modules suggested radiomic associations to circadian clock and neu- ral system. The impact of these pathways to the clinical factor s we tested is not apparent from current lung cancer literature, which could explain why th ese modules did not show clinical associations. Our results further suggest that radiomic approaches could have the potential to predict molecular states of pathways. We found that the highest predictors of every mod- ule was also a suitable representative of the overall biologica l and radiomic themes of that module. Amongst these examples of pathways that showed high pre dictability in terms of radiomics, we found various pathways essential for tumorigenesi s such as cell cycle path- ways (e.g., G0 and early G1), signaling pathways (e.g., tested those radi- omic pathway predictors for predictive value of driver mutation s. Thereby, the highest performances were found for mutations in EGFR and KRAS, which i s in line with current radiomic-genetic literature (Aer ts et al., 2016; Gutman et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Rizzo et al., 2016). Interestingly, however, the highest performance for the tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator TP53 we found was given by a textural entropy feature that also predicted G0 and early G1 (module M12). In addition, features e xpressed selectivity for predicting mutations, which was suggested previously (Gutman et al., 2015). These results highlight the diagnostic potential, as ready information on pat hway and mutation status may permit advanced patient stratification. Previous studies ha ve indicated that gene ex- pression can be predicted by imaging features (Gevaert et al., 2012; Segal et al., 2007; Gevaert et al., 2014). To our knowledge, however, no stud y has examined and inde- pendently validated radiomic mode ls for biological validation such as immunohistochemical staining. Finally, verified a previously described prognostic radiomic signature and ob- served that the best performance is achieved when combining rad iomic, genetic, and clin- ical data. These results strongly suggest that radiomic data co ntain complementary prog- nostic information and are robust, as the published radiomic si gnature (Aerts et al., 2014) has not been tested on our data before. Notably, these prognost ic improvements were relatively stable to substitution of radiomic or gene signature s. A related indication of im- proved survival predictions by combining imaging features and m olecular data has been recently given for glioblastoma, however without validation (Ni colasjilwan et al., 2015). It is worth noting that for the first time we also demonstrate tha t radiomic prognostication generalizes across cohorts fr om different continents. The underlying biology of radiomics 45 Three research tracks have recen tly been proposed for clinical translation of such imaging biomarkers (O'Connor et al., 2017), including biologica l validation, technical vali- dation, and evaluation of cost-effectiveness. Our study conform s with several of these roadmap recommendations by advancing results on a previously pr oposed radiomic signa- ture (Aerts et al., 2014) with a dditional biological validation and investigations on how genetic data and clinical factors impact this signature. Fixing a radiomic signature for tech- nical validation and cost-effectiveness verification should be considered in subsequent studies to overcome additional translational gaps. Although the long-term vision would be to augment clinical decision maki ng, the current goal of our st udy is to contrib- ute in satisfying the need of the radiomic and oncological comm unity to understand the underlying biology of radiomic predictions. Our study is limited by its retrospective nature. Imaging proto cols are not stand- ardized and hence variability in CT acquisition and reconstruct ion parameters is inherent in clinical practice. However, despite this, no corrections by cohort or scanner type were made in this study illustrating t he translational aspect of our results that generalized across institutions. Hence, we expect that the performance of r adiomics will further im- prove, as imaging data are becom ing more standardized. In fact, multiple studies have already documented the robustness of radiomic feature extractio ns in terms of reproduci- bility and in test/re-test settings 2015a; Aerts et al . , 2 0 1 4 ; G r o v e e t a l . , 2 0 1 5 ) . Another limitation of this study is that the current cohorts ma inly focused on early stage (I - III) tumors, hence generalization of radiomic-genomic associa tions to late stage tumors should be drawn with precaution only. However, most radiomic ap plications do focus on early stage tumors as the current radiomic approach requires se gmentation of tumors which for late stage tumors remains to be of particular complex ity. Furthermore, although our study provides multiple facets of validation, immunohistoch emical validation was re- stricted to considerably smaller sample sizes as compared to ou r statistical validations due to limited availability of froze n tissue. Prospective protocols can ensure availability of suf- ficient tissue for additional validation. Biological material investigated in this study has been acquire d by single-needle biopsies, thus the interpretation of our genomic data is limite d due to heterogeneity of lung cancer tumors. However, as our results validated in indepe ndent data and because known drivers of tumorigenesis were among the main pathways fou nd to be associated with radiomic features, this suggests that these associations h ave been established in an early evolutionary step in tumorigenesis and are therefore reas onable representatives of the overall tumor. Prospective studies with defined spatial mat chings of biopsies and/or single cell analyses could provi de deeper insight into whether the strengths of these asso- ciations can be further increased. Prospective studies will als o be required to assess clini- cal utility of combining radiomic, genomic, and c linical data i nto prognostic models. In conclusion, this study presented novel and consistent associ ations between radiomics, molecular pathways, a nd clinical factors. We applied an independent discovery Chapter 2 46 and validation design on large patient cohorts from different c ontinents with enough vari- ability that allowed confidence in the generalization of our re sults. Furthermore, we per- formed biological validation and demonstrated that radiomics pr edicts molecular pathway status and thus improves the prog nostic performances of clinica l and gene signatures. The clinical impact of our results is illustrated by the fact that it advances the molecular knowledge of automated radiomic characterization of tumors, inf ormation currently not used clinically. This ma y provide opportunit ies to improve deci sion-support at low addi- tional cost as imaging is routin ely used in clinical practice a s standard of care. MATERIALS AND METHODS Discovery and validation data Data underlying this study is made publically available with th is article. We analyzed two cohorts of patients with non-sma ll cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Da taset1 and computed to mography (CT) scans, gene expression profiles, and clinical data. While the larger cohort Dataset1 ( North American) is novel and served as a discovery cohort, Dataset2 (European) has been prev iously published with CT scans and gene expression data (Aerts et al., 2014), and was us ed for independent valida- tion of our findings. Patients in Dataset1 were treated in the Thoracic Oncology Program at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA; we in cluded patients with diag- nosed primary tumors who underwent surgical resection and colle cted contrast-enhanced CT scans obtained within 60 days of the diagnosis between years 2006 and 2009. Patients in Dataset2 were treated at MAASTRO clinical, Maastricht, NL; w e included patients with confirmed primary tumors who received surgery. Further details of Dataset2 are given by Aerts et al. (2014). The majo rity of CT scans were recorded to be contrast-enhancing (89%% and 71% of patients in Data set1 and Dataset2, respectivel y). For analyses involving CT scans and gene expression data, 262 a nd 89 patients were available for Dataset1 and Dataset2, respectively. In addi tion, clinical data were available for 224 and 87 patient s, respectively. Clinical outco mes investigated were overall survival (OS), pathologic TNM st age (combined T, N, and M stage s, according to the latest version 7 of the IASLC guideline for lung cancer [Mirsadraee et al., 2012]), and patholog- ic histology (grouped into adenoca rcinoma, squamous carcinoma, and others). Clini- cal stage and histology were use d when pathologic information w as not available. Tumors in these cohorts were mainly ear ly stage; in Dataset1 among the 224 clinically annotated cases 26 were stage IIIB or IV and in Dataset2 among the 87 cli nically annotated cases 3 cases were stage IV. These late stages have been grouped into ' other' for analysis. Further clinical cohort characterist ics are given in Table 1. The underlying biology of radiomics 47 For tumors in both cohorts, expr ession of 60,607 probes was mea sured tom Rosetta/Merck Affymetrix 2.0 microarray chipset (HuRSTA_2a5 2 0 7 0 9 . C D F , G E O a c - cession number GPL15048) by the Moffitt Cancer Center. Gene exp ression of Dataset2 is available also at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) through accessi on number GSE58661. Gene expression values were normalized with the robust multi-ar ray average (RMA) algo- rithm (Irizarry et al., 2003) implemented in the 'affy' Biocond uctor package (Gautier et al., 2 0 0 4 ) . P r o b e s h a v e b e e n c u r a t e d b y c h o o s i n g t h e m o s t v a r i a n t r e presentative among probes mapping to the same gene identifier (Entrez Gene) result ing in a total of 21,766 unique genes. Radiomic features We extracted 636 features grouped into I) tumor intensity (voxe l statistics), II) shape, III) texture, IV) wavelet, and V) Laplace of Gaussian features. Grou p I-IV features have been defined as specified by Aerts et al. (2014). In addition, we ad ded new features to Group III (see GLSZM below). Group I features are first-order statist ics (e.g. mean, skewness) of a ll voxel intensity values in the tumor volume mask. Group II features describe the shape and s i z e o f a t u m o r ( e . g . c o m p a c t n e s s ) . Group III features quantify texture in tumor images describing clustering of voxels with similar appearance by mean s of a gray-level co- occurrence matrix (GLCM), a how frequent voxels of same gray-level are adja- cent to each other (GLCM), how many voxels of the same gray-lev el appear in a consecu- t i v e r u n ( R L G L ) , o r t h e s i z e s o f f l a t z o n e s , a r e a s o f s a m e g r a y -level in all directions (GLSZM). Group IV features are Group I-III features (except GLSZM) assessed afte r a wave- let decomposition of the image, which highlights sharp transiti ons in the intensity fre- quency spectrum. Group V consists of Group I features that have been calculated after applying a Laplace of Gaussian transformation to the image, whi ch highlights edge struc- tures. Detailed description and analytical definitions of the f eatures added to the Aerts et al. (2014) feature set (n = 440) are given in Supplementary fil e 1. Features were calculated in 3D. For normalization, slice thicknesses of all scans were i nterpolated to a voxel sizes of 1 \u00d7 1\u00d71 mm 3. Chapter 2 48 Pathway analysis To test if a radiomic feature was associated with a molecular p athway, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rho was calculated for the expression of every gene across all pa- tients and weighted by -log10( p), where p is the p-value of rho. The resulting gene rank was input to a preranked gene s et enrichment analysis (GSEA) al gorithm (Subramanian et al., 2005) version 2.0.14 on the C2 collection version 4 of the Molecular Signature Data- base (MSigDB) (Liberzon et al., 2011). This collection contains the expert-curated set of pathways from the Reactome database (Joshi-Tope et al., 2005). Those 511 out of 674 pathways were considered that contained at least 15 and at most 5 0 0 g e n e s . G S E A r e - ports normalized enrichment scor es (NESs) for ev ery pathway, wh ich we further analyzed. Radiomic-pathway a ssociation modules To identify coherently expressed expressed features and pathway s, a matrix holding an N E S s f o r e v e r y p a i r o f r a d i o m i c f e a t u r e a n d R e a c t o m e p a t h w a y w a s biclustered with the Iterative Signature Algorith m (ISA) using the 'isa2' and 'e isa' packages R and Biocon- ductor (Bergmann et al., 2003; Cs\u00e1rdi et al., 2010). As a resul t, each bicluster contains a set of coherently expressed features and pathways and is referr ed to as module. Potential module redundancy was limited using the 'isa.unique' function i n the 'isa2' package with a maximum correlation threshold of 0.3. To avoid parameter sensit ivity with ISA, row and column clustering seed thresholds were set to a liberal sequenc e of 1.5 to 2.5 by 0.5 to include all potential signals. This procedure yielded 20 putati ve modules. To validate these modules, we developed and applied a correlation based statistic r:=mean (C X)+mean (CY), where CX and C Y are the Spearman rank correlations of all pairs of features an d pathways in a module, respectively. The true r was calculated for every module in Dataset1 and vali- dated on Dataset2 with random permutation tests (N = 1000). Aft er correcting for multi- ple-hypothesis testing with the false-discovery-rate (FDR) (Ben j a m i n i a n d H o c h b e r g , 1995), the validation resulted i n 13 significantly enriched mod ules (FDR < 0.05). In total, the modules captured the associa tions between 210 radiomic feat ures and 206 pathways. Module size was defined as n/N + m/M , where n and m are the number of fea- tures and pathways in a module, respectively, and N = 636 and M = 511 are the total numbers of features and pathways across all modules, respective ly. Overlap of two mod- ules was defined by the Jaccard index (Theodoridis and Koutroum bas, 2008), which is the size of union of features divided by the size of intersection o f features of two module. Hereby, same feature names under different transformations were considered equivalent. The underlying biology of radiomics 49 Pathway predictions To test radiomic pathway predictors, we used gene set variation analysis (GSVA) in Bio- conductor (H\u00e4nzelmann et al., 2013) to calculate pathway enrich ment scores per patient. Next, we fitted univariate log istic regression models of every feature to predict the NES sign of pathways (which corresponded to activation or deletion) in Dataset1. We assessed the concordance between the predicted probabilities of the path w a y s i g n a n d t h e t r u e sign with the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operat or characteristic (ROC) (Bradley, 1997). The strongest predictor of each module accordi ng to the AUCs in Dataset1 was evaluated on Dataset2 for va lidation; significance of AUCs was calculated according to Noether for binary outcomes (Pencina and D'Agostino, 2004). Associations to cl inical factors Associations to OS were assessed by calculating the mean concor dance-index (Harrell et al., 1982) of all features in a module univariately using the ' survcomp' package in Biocon- ductor (Schr\u00f6der et al., 2011), and by validating this statisti c with repeated random per- mutation tests (N = 1000). Similarly, associations to stage and histology were assessed by the mean of Kruskal-Wallis chi square statistics and permutatio n tests. As clinical infor- mation was not part of the module identification process, a met a-analysis of the results in Dataset1 and Dataset2 was conducted to account for sample size differences and other dataset specific variations. For this, a Fisher Z-transformatio n (Whitlock, 2005) of the in- dependent p-values in both datasets was employed for every modu le with weights equal to the respective sample sizes in Dataset1 and Dataset2. We tested additive prognostic e ffects of integrating radiomic, gene expression, and clinical data by combining in a Cox proportional-hazards mo del the predictions of (I) a clinical Cox model with stage an d h i s t o l o g y, ( I I ) a n N S C L C OS g ene signature, and (III) an NSCLC OS radiomic signature. We tested five published gene sign atures (Hou et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2009) w ithout inclusion of clinical and radiomic data and retained the strongest performing signature b y H o u e t a l . ( 2 0 1 0 ) t o challenge potential performance increases. To test for generali zability of radiomics, we tested a published radiomic signa ture by Aerts et al. (2014) an d a novel signature devel- oped in the current study. We developed this novel radiomic sig n a t u r e u s i n g a s u p e r - vised feature selection algorithm followed by a stepwise Cox re gression approach on rithm implemented in the 'mRMRe' R package (De Jay et al., 2013 ) on all radiomic features w i t h r e s p e c t t o O S t o s e l e c t a n o n - r e d u n d a n t , h i g h l y i n f o r m a t i v e ranked set of comple- mentary features. Next, we trained Cox models incrementally, ad ding features starting by the highest ranked feature. We performed repeated random cross- validation (N = 1,000) to measure the performance of each model, and retained the mode l w i t h t h e h i g h e s t mean CI. Finally, these fitted m odels were tested on Dataset2 f or validation. Chapter 2 50 All statistical analyses were ca rried out using the R software (R Development Core Team, 2013) version 3.1.0 on a L inux operating system. Details of version numbers of uti- lized packages are availabl e in Supplementary file 2. Immunohistochemical staining for CD3 We selected 25 cases each that were predicted to have high and low immune response by using the value of the radiomic feature in the prognostic modul es M2, M9, and M12 that showed the highest absolute correlation to the mean expression o f g e n e s i n t h e C T L A 4 inhibitory pathway that is supported to be associated with immu ne activity (Postow et al., 2015; Pardoll, 2012; Wolchok and Saenger, 2008). In total, 22 c ases were available with enough tumor tissue and sufficien t staining quality. Tumor cros s section slides were stained using a Ventana Discovery XT automated system (Ventana Medical Systems, Tuc- son, AZ) as per manufacturer's protocol with recommended reagen ts. Briefly, slides were deparaffinized with EZ Prep solution (Ventana) and a heat-induc e d a n t i g e n r e t r i e v a l method was used under mild cell conditioning using CC1 antigen retrieval buffer (Ven- tana). A rabbit primary antibody for CD3, (790-4341, Ventana) w as used at supplied con- centration and incubated for 16 min. Next a Ventana OmniMap Ant i-Rabbit Secondary Antibody was applied to the samples for 16 min and the Ventana ChromoMap kit was used as the detection system. Slides were then counterstained w ith Hematoxylin and de- hydrated. Finally, the slides w ere cover slipped as per normal laboratory protocol. Immunohistochemical staining for RelA We selected 25 cases each that were predicted to have high and low NFkB activity. The same procedure as for the CD3 staining was applied, with the ex ception that a standard cell conditioning was used with CC2 antigen retrieval buffer (V entana). Furthermore, a rabbit polyclonal primary antibody for RelA (NFkB p65), (Spring Biosciences E2750) was used at 1:600 dilution* and incubated for 32 min. In total, 24 cases were available with enough tumor tissue and suffi cient staining quality. Evaluation a immunostained slide The lymphocytes are highlighted by brown nuclear staining of CD 3. The staining pattern was analyzed by a board-certified pathologist (MB) and scored i nto low and high enrich- ment. The percentage and intensity (weak 1+, moderate 2+ and in tense 3+) of staining were recorded as well as the number and size of clustering of C D3 positive cells. The pathologist also chose the appropr iate area from each sample fo r image analysis. We ob- served that the tissue section that has a complete cross sectio n of the tumor with a com- plete rim of adjacent benign lung parenchyma is most ideal for image analysis. This is be- cause the lymphocytic infiltrati on is commonly present at the p eriphery of the tumor.

Aerts *These authors contribut ed equally to this work Chapter 3 58 ABSTRACT Background Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors exhibit strong phenotypic differences that can be quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the underlying biol ogical drivers of these imaging phenotypes remain largel y unknown. An Imaging-Genomics analysis was per- formed to reveal the mechanistic associations between MRI deriv ed quantitative volumet- ric tumor phenotype features and molecular pathways. Materials and methods One hundred fourty one patients with presurgery MRI and surviva l data were included in our analysis. Volumetric features were defined, including the n ecrotic core (NE), contrast- enhancement (CE), abnormal tumor volume assessed by post-contra st T1w (tumor bulk or TB), tumor-associated edema based on T2-FLAIR (ED), and total t umor volume (TV), as well as ratios of these tumor components. Based on gene express ion where available (n=91), pathway associations were assessed using a preranked ge ne set enrichment anal- ysis. These results were put into context of molecular subtypes in GBM and prognostica- tion. Results Volumetric features were significantly associated with diverse sets of biological processes (FDR<0.05). While NE and TB were enriched for immune response pathways and apopto- sis, CE was associated with signa l transduction and protein fol ding processes. ED was mainly enriched for homeostasis and cell cycling pathways. ED w as also the strongest pre- dictor of molecular GBM subtypes (AUC=0.61). CE Noether test, p=4x10 4. Conclusions GBM volumetric features extracted from MRI are significantly en riched for information about the biological state of a tumor that impacts patient outc omes. Clinical decision- support systems could exploit this information to develop perso nalized treatment strate- gies on the basis of n oninvasive imaging.

Despite aggressive sur gical therapy, radiation therapy, and temozolomide administration the 2-year survival ra te remains around 27 % [2]. As a result, recent investigations have focused on capital izing on the high molecular heterogeneity of gliomas to devel op personalized treatment stra tegies One promising avenue of these inve stigations involves quantitat ive analyses of radiographic data, where imaging modalities are used to quantif y tumor phenotype non- invasively. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), GBM tumors ibit strong phenotypic features such as Necrosis, Edema , Contrast Enhancement, and Tum or Bulk (Fig. 1). These properties can be captured without and with intravenous adminis tration of gadolinium- based contrast agents including T1-weighted or FLuid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) (Fig. 2) . In this way, visible tum or phenotype features can be systematically quanti- fied. Fig. 1 Examples of volumetric tumor GBM) tumors show strong differ- ences, which can be objectively quantified with volumetrics. Th is figure shows examples of GBM tumors exhibiting high (top) and low (bottom) volumetric feature values for Necro sis, Contrast Enhancement, Edema, and Tumor Bulk (columns) as they appear on T1 weighted (columns 1,2, and 4) or T2-FLAIR (column 3) magnetic resonance images for different patients. Chapter 3 60 Fig. 2 Volumetric phenotype features within the same tumor. Detailed e xample of a glioblastoma tumor in a patient. (a,b) On T1-weighted post-Gadolinium contrast (T1C) images, a centr al area of Necrosis is typically surrounded by a Contrast Enhancing ring, both of which can be derived from da rk and light regions, respectively. Tumor Bulk represents the addition of these tumor features. ( c) The Total Tumor Volume is represented by hyperintensity extracted from T2-FLAIR images. Edema is the difference of Tumo r Bulk from Tota l Tumor Volume. As the underlying drivers of these phenotypes are biological in nature, recent ef- forts have been conducted indicating underlying genetic charact eristics of imaging fea- tures. For example, tumor \"Ring Enhancement\" was found to be si gnificantly associated with unmethylated MGMT promoter status [4, 5], which is known t o be a biomarker for response to temozolomide and sur vival. Similarly, \"Contrast Enh ancement\" and \"Mass Effect\" imaging features were found to be strongly correlated w ith expression of groups of genes involved in hypoxia and proliferation, respectively [6]. However, a systematic classi- fication of tumor phenotype features in terms of their underlyi ng cell biological processes o n a g e n o m e - w i d e s c a l e i n G B M r e mains absent, although clinical applicability of these image features will depend on knowledge about how these feature s are driven by tumor biological processes that det ermine disease progression. In this study, we present an Ima ging-Genomics analysis to inves tigate the associa- tions of a large set of biologic al processes and presurgical di agnostic MRI derived reveals driving pathways 61 tive volumetric tumor phenotype features, such as Necrosis or E dema, focusing on the publicly available GBM dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TC GA). These analyses were tied to molecular subtypes in GBM and prognostics. Image b ased volumetric features phenotype information complementary t o genomic technolo- gies and clinical information, po tentially allowing advances in patient stratification and clinical decision-making. METHODS Magnetic resonance imaging The DICOM formatted files of presurgical T1 and T2 sequence mag netic resonance images (MRIs) were accessed and downloaded in November 2014 from TCIA (https://wiki.cancer- imagingarchive.net/ display/Public/TCGA-GBM), a large archive o f medical images of cancer patients who have matched molecular data at The Cancer Genome A tlas (TCGA). Cases that had both T1 and T2-FLAIR images available, were of reasonable q uality to perform tumor segmentation, and had presurgica l negative status were included . As the presurgical status of an image is not explicitly included in the TCIA data, presurgic al status was verified to the best of our ability by a trained neuroradiologist (CH, 17 years of e xperience) by examining the skull surrounding the tumor for signs of surgeries. The patients in o ur study were originally imaged at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and Henry Ford Hospital . I m a g e s o f s u f f i c i e n t q u a l i t y w e r e n e x t a n a l y z e d f o r v o l u m e t r i c features. Briefly, 2D masks which were annotated using FSLView, a module in the FM RIB Software Library 5.0 (FSL [7]), were applied surrounding the tumor regions on th e post gadolinium (GD) contrast T1-weighted images and T2-weighted images. For the T1 images, a single contour was segmented including both the d a r k ( N e c r o t i c o r N E ) a n d b r i g ht (Contrast Enhance- ment or CE) areas, and the entire volume was referred to as Tum or Bulk (TB). The pixels contained in these masks were then clustered into dark (NE) and bright (CE) areas by K- means clustering using the FSL FE AT (fMRI Expert Analysis Tool, Version 5.0). The area vol- ume contained within the mask of the T2 FLAIR image set encompa sses the Edema (ED) envelope, including regions of hyperintense signal and inclusiv e o f a n y o t h e r a b n o r m a l signal in the region previously identified on the T1 (i.e., TB) , and was referred to as Total Abnormal Tumor Volume (TV). Afterwards, all masks were visually c h e ck e d b y a t r a i n e d radiologist (CH). We did not attempt to discriminate between pe ritumoral edema and non-enhancing tumor, as both appear hyperintense on FLAIR. In a ddition to the raw volu- metric features, we calculated t he following feature ratios as investigated in previous studies [8, 9, 10] mainly of the tumor volumes analyzed are displayed in Fig. 2. Chapter 3 62 Gene expression Matching GBM gene expression (mRN A) data for the TCIA patient c ohort was obtained from TCGA using the CBioPortal [11] with the 'cgdsr' R package version 1.1.33. The profile identifier 'gbm_tcga_pub_mrna_median_Zscores' was used together with the case identi- fier 'gbm_tcga_pub_mrna' to download the expression values of 1 8,055 genes given as median Z-scores across the and Affyme trix Exon platforms. Ex- pression data were downloaded on April 3, 2015, for 91 patients for which also imaging data was available. Based on expression of 1740 genes, Verhaak et al. [12] classified TCGA- GBM the proneural, ural, classical, and mes- functionally annotated by presence of onco genic events. To test predictive power for subtypes, w e downloaded the classification results on TCGA patients by Verhaak et al. from https://tc ga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publi cations/gbm_exp/TCGA_ unified_CORE_ClaNC840.txt and calculated the multiclass area un der curves (AUCs) of the receiver operator characteristic [13] of the volumetric feature s. Imaging and subtype data were available for 79 patients. Pathway analysis To quantify the association of a volumetric features with biolo gical processes, preranked Gene [14] (GSEA) version 2.2.0 was perf ormed; gene ranks were calculated for every feature according to -log10( p) r, where r is the Spearman rank correla- tion coefficient, and p its p-value. GSEA was performed on the C5-BP collection version 5.0 from the Molecular Signature Database [15] (MSigDB), which cont ains the expert-curated Gene Ontology [16] (GO) gene sets for biological processes. Tho se 583 gene sets contain- ing at least 15 and at most 500 genes were analyzed. We investi gated gene sets that were significantly enriched under a false-discovery-rate (FDR)<0.0 5 a s s p e c i f i e d b y G S E A t o account for multiple hy pothesis-testing [17]. Survival analysis Overall survival data was available for 141 patients with imagi ng data, and was download- ed from CBioPortal on April 3, 2015. Prognostic associations of volumetric features were assessed with the concordance index (CI) using the 'survcomp' p ackage in Bioconductor [18]. All statistical analyses we re carried out using R version 3.1.0 [19] on a Linux operating system. Imaging-genomics reveals driving pathways 63 RESULTS To investigate which biological processes drive volumetric tumo r phenotype features in GBM, we performed a pathway analysis based on gene expression p rofiles using a pre- ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analy sis [14]. We compared these res ults to molecular sub- types in GBM and evaluated the prognostic value. Volumetric tumor phenotype features in GBM Based on MRI, we quantified the following volumetric features i n GBM: Necrosis (NE), Contrast Enhancement (CE), Edema (ED), Tumor Bulk (TB), and Tot al Tumor Volume (TV). In addition, we calculated the fo llowing ratios mainly The area s of the tumor that these features correspond to are highlighted in Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c. In general, we found that these features were not or only moderately correlated (mean Spe arman rho 0.48 and - 0.41 for positive and negative correlation, respectively), howe ver a number of features were highly positively correlated (e.g., NE and TB, rho=0.96) and a number of features ratios were highly anti-correlate d (e.g., NE/CE and CE/TB, rho =-0.98) as shown in Fig. 3. Biological processes underlying volumetric features In total, 64 biological processes were significantly associated in at least one of the volu- metric features or their ratios (FDR<0.05, Fig. 4). Table 1 s ummarizes the biological themes associated with each volumetric feature. These features were generally negatively (anti-correlated) enriched for biological processes unless stat ed otherwise. NE and TB were mainly enriched for pathways involved in immune response a nd apoptosis, whereas CE was enriched for signal transduction and protein folding pro cesses. ED was enriched for cell cycling, proliferation, and replication mechanisms, but al so positively enriched for homeostasis. TV was associated w ith synaptogenesis, biogenesis, and excretion. Volumetric feature ratios were associated with a larger number of biological processes than the original features. Signal transduction was associated with all of the ratios we computed; processes involved in immune system were found for al l ratios except for CE/TV. CE/TV, TB/TV, and ED/TV were enriched for protein comple x assembly. In addition, ED/TV showed positive enrichment for defense response, cytokine production, and Nf-kB. Nf-kB was also found in NE/TV and TB/TV, as well as in NE/CE an d CE/TB. Notably, NE/CE and CE/TB were also inversely enriched for inflammation, immune system response path- ways, and anti-apoptosis.

[12], patients from the TCGA -GBM cohort were classi- fied to belong to either one of the four following molecular su btypes: proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. Compa red to TV, ED had the largest median size across sub- types (Fig. 5a); ED was larger i n classical GBM and smaller in proneural (Fig. 5b). Other volumetric features were compara bly similar in terms of median values across subtypes. Fig. 5 Size distribution of volumetric tumor features across molecular subtypes of GBM. ( a) Compared to the Total Vol- ume, Edema had the largest median size across all molecular GBM subtypes. ( b) Classical and neural tumors showed larger Edema areas than mesenchymal and proneural tumors . Size variation of volumetric feature areas other than Edema was generally low across subtypes. We tested predictive value for GBM subtypes of all volumetric f eatures by calcu- lating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic. We found that most features performed rel atively low (Table 2). ED and T V were the strongest pre- dictors of subtypes (AUCs=0.61). Ratios of features generally were poor predictors of sub- type.

Importantly , NE, CE, and TB per- formed t-test, p<0.05). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier and Log-Rank analyses revealed significant assessments of low a nd high risk survival groups by NE, CE, and TB (Additional file 1: Figure S1). DISCUSSION We The translation of quantitative imaging data into defined clini cal settings requires knowledge of how volumetric tumor phenotype features are driven by biological process- es that determine the outcome of a patient. This study presents an Imaging-Genomics analysis of presurgical diagnosti c MRI derived volumetric featu res in GBM to evaluate if tumor phenotype features are associated with underlying tumor b iology. We found differ- ent features to be enriched for different sets of biological pr ocesses. Molecular subtypes of GBM were difficult to be predicte d by v olumetric feat ures. H owever, four out of five features showed significant prognostic value. Chapter 3 68 Fig. 6 P r o g n o s t i c v a l u e o f v o l u m e t r i c t u m o r f e a t u r e s . N e c r o s i s , C o n t r a st Enhancement, Tumor Bulk, and Total Tumor Volume were significantly (asterisk) prognostic (p<0.05). The Contrast Enhancement feature showed the highest prognostic performance as measured by the C-index. As correlations among our volume tric features were low to moder ate in general, this suggests that quantifying each of those areas individually yields complementary in- formation about the tumor phenot ype beyond the Total Tumor Volu me (TV). Interestingly, we found most of the biological processes to be anti-correlated to pathway expression. The most prevalent pathways were apoptosis, immune system, and signaling pathways, which were observed mainly for Necrosis (NE), Contrast Enhancem ent (CE), and Tumor Bulk (TB); features th at were also significantly prognostic. As those pathways are known drivers of survival outcome [21, 22, 23], this hence explains w h y N E , C E , a n d T B w e r e found to be prognostic as well. Importantly, all of these featu res performed significantly better than TV, which highlights that quantification of individ ual imaging features should be preferred over calculating only the total tumor volume. Our finding that NE is anti- correlated with immune response and prognostic is in line with Gevaert et al. [24], who also correlated quantitative imaging features of GBM areas to m olecular data and who found significant imaging associations to approximately 20 path ways. This analysis, how- ever, differs from our analysis in that Gevaert et al. investig ated a single slice of a tumor (in axial view), whereas we perf ormed quantification using the 3D tumor volumes. Edema (ED) was the only feature that was correlated with homeos tasis, cell cy- cling, and proliferation pathways . Surprisingly, ED was not pro gnostic in our analysis, alt- hough cell cycling and proliferation are known to be involved i n carcinogenesis [25]. How- ever, using the publicly availabl e MRI scheme VASARI (h ttps://wiki.nci.nih.gov/ display/CIP/VASARI), Gutman et al. [26] found ordinal ED assess ment to be not prognostic as well. Interestingly, in a related study by Diehn et al. [6], binary assessment of ED result- Imaging-genomics reveals driving pathways 69 ed in significant survival predic tions. Similarly, a recent stu dy indicated that an ED volume cutoff of 85'000 mm3 is a significant prognostic fa ctor using Kaplan-Meier analysis [ 8 ] ; however, the rationale for this cutoff was not given. Prognosti c performance of quantita- t i v e ED f e a t u r e s co u l d i n cr e a s e i n co h o r t s o f e x t e n d e d s a m p l e s izes, as ED has been re- p o r t e d t o b e a u n i v a r i a t e p r e d i c t o r o f s u r v i v a l i n a l a r g e p a t i ent cohort previously [27]. Furthermore, our analysis sugges ts that CE and NE are prognosti c. This is partially in line with Gutman et al. [26], according to whom CE is prognostic, bu t NE is not. The contradic- tions between our results and th e studies by Diehn et al. and G utman et al. could be due to the nature of the ED and NE assessments, which in our analys is were continuous, but binary and ordinal in Diehn et al. and Gutman et al., respectiv ely. Likewise, our methodol- ogy could be compared to a study by Jamshidi et al. [28], but c omparison remains chal- lenging as their analysis focused on binary imaging traits on a relatively small cohort of patients and a subset of oncogenic pathways only. Although ED was the only feature that was not prognostic in our analysis, it was the highest predictor of molecular subtypes in GBM instead. Thi s is likely because ED was the only feature that expressed a different volumetric size dis tribution across molecular subtypes. Similar indications have been given by Gevaert et al. [24], who found three out of four features that correlated with molecular subtypes to be quantitative Edema fea- tures. In general, we found volumetric features to be only mode rate predictors of sub- types suggesting that subtypes do not generally alter the size composition of tumor areas in GBM. Furthermore, we could not confirm that the proneural su btype has lower propor- tions of CE Poor predictabi lity of Verhaak molecular subtypes by relative cerebral blood volume using T2-weighted MR I has been also de- scribed by Jain et al. [29]. In our analysis, ratios of volumetric features were not signifi cantly prognostic or predictive of GBM subtypes. Gene rally, many more biological pro cesses were significantly associated with the feature rati os, usually showing a trend tow ards a mix of pathways asso- ciated with the individual featur es that the ratios were compos ed of (e.g., NE/TV were en- riched for signal transduction and biogenesis). While our study associated MRI volumetric features with biological processes, molecular subtypes, and sur vival outcome using ge- nome-wide data and aimed at expla ining the rationale for why MR I derived volumetric fea- tures are associated with survival on a pathway level, other st udies have focused on reveal- ing specific genetic variations between MRI features and surviv al [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Our analysis was limited to a retrospective dataset. To establi sh volumetric bi- omarkers in clinical applications, prospective evaluation of ou r results will be required. Biological significance could be further validated by analyses of complementary molecular data such as mutational or epigenetic data. Such analyses could provide further insight into why separate quantification of distinct volumetric tumor p henotype features yield different biological and prognostic information. We acknowledge that the prognostic and predictive performances of the volumetric features in the TCGA- GBM dataset were mod- erate. Heterogeneity of GBM tumors [35] could be an explanation for this, which limits the Chapter 3 70 definition of a single molecular subtype especially on the basi s of single-needle biopsy [36, 37]. As imaging approaches target the entire visible tumor , we however expect in fu- ture studies that prognostic per formances will drastically incr ease when Imaging-Genomic cohorts with even larger numbers of samples and standardized im age processing become available for GBM. While our study focused on volumetric phenotype features, alter native defini- tions of imaging phenotypes are available. This may, for exampl e, include tumor location as this determines the extent of possible resection and hence i s a prognostic factor in G B M [ 3 8 ] . I n a d d i t i o n t o s u c h s e m a n t i c p h e n o t y p e s , a g n o s t i c p h e notyping approaches such as radiomics could be added [39]. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, quantitative imaging biomarkers hold great poten tial, as, unlike traditional biopsies, medical imaging is noninvasive and captures the entir e tumor volume. As we have shown, a relationship exists between individual volumetric phenotype features de- scribing local, clinically relev ant subareas of GBM tumors and global expression of genes. Knowledge about how these specific tumor areas are related to u nderlying biological cell processes may allow for advanced patient stratification and tre atment decision on the basis of standard medical imaging, but efforts in optimization of prognostic and predictive performances need to continue.

Chapter 4 76 ABSTRACT Introduction MR imaging can noninvasively alize tumor phenotype Here, we investiga ted whether somatic mutations a re associated with and can be predicted by MRI-derived tumor imaging features of gliob lastoma (GBM). Materials and methods Seventy-six GBM patients were identified from The Cancer Imagin g Archive for whom pre- operative T1-contrast (T1C) and T2-FLAIR MR images were availab le. For each tumor, a set of volumetric imaging features and their ratios were measured, including necrosis, con- trast enhancing, and edema volumes. Imaging genomics analysis a ssessed the association of these features with mutation status of nine genes frequently altered in adult GBM. Fi- nally, area under the curve (AUC) analysis was conducted to eva luate the predictive per- formance of imaging features for mutational status. Results Our results demonstrate that MR imaging features are strongly a ssociated with mutation status. For example, TP53-mutated tumors had significantly smal ler contrast enhancing and necrosis volumes ( p = 0 . 0 1 2 a n d 0 . 0 1 7 , r e s p e c t i v e l y ) a n d R B 1 - m u t a t e d t u m o r s h a d significantly smaller edema volumes ( p=0.015) compared to wild -type tumors. MRI volu- metric features were also found to significantly predict mutati o n a l s t a t u s . F o r e x a m p l e , AUC analysis results indicated th at TP53, RB1, NF1, EGFR, and P DGFRA mutations could each be significantly predicted by at least one imaging feature . Conclusion MRI-derived volumetric features are significantly associated wi th and predictive of several cancer-relevant, drug-targetable DNA mutations in glioblastoma. These results may shed insight into unique growth characteristics of individual tumors at the macroscopic level resulting from molecular events as well as increase the use of noninvasive imaging in per- sonalized medicine.

Somatic mutations 77 INTRODUCTION Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most c ommon and most aggressive form of brain cancer with a m e d i a n s u r v i v a l o f l e s s t h a n 1 5 m o n t h s a n d a 5 - y e a r s u r v i v a l r a te of less than 10 % [1]. While factors ranging from younge r age at diagnosis, cerebellar location, better cognitive performance, and more extensive tumor resection have been assoc iated with more favor- able outcome, the current standard of care treatment involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy ultimately fails, in part due to the proliferative and diffusely infiltrative na- ture of the tumor [2]. Recent molecular analyses have demonstra ted significant diversity in histologically similar tumors that drive proliferation and c ompetitive propagation [3]. In addition, integrated analyses using gene expression, copy numbe r, methylation, and so- matic mutation patterns have identified distinct GBM subtypes, some of which associated with distinct responses to treatment [4]. Methods such as magnetic resonan ce imaging (MRI) that can nonin vasively char- acterize the tumor at a macroscopic scale can be of potential v alue, as they can provide complementary information to the tumor's molecular characteriza tion [5]. Historically, only very basic parameters have been derived from imaging data, such as measurements of tumor size based on \"representative\" cross sections on a sin gle radiology image [6, 7, 8]. While such measures are easy to perform and serve as the basis for assessing treatment response [9, 10], there is a rich set of additional v isual characteristics of the tumor that can also be assessed. One effort to catalog these ch aracteristics is the VASARI Research Project, which seeks to develop a controlled vocabular y describing the varied morphology of glioblastoma (http ://cabig.cancer.gov/action/coll aborations/vasari/). The VASARI feature set was developed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TC GA) radiology working group and uses a standard lexicon with the goal of reproducibly assessing 26 imaging de- scriptors based on T1-weighted and T2-weighted FLAIR MRI modali ties. For example, vari- ables such as major axis length, tumor location, proportion enh ancing, thickness of en- hancing margin, and proportion of edema are all measured by tra ined radiologists in this protocol. Data obtained from this protocol has led to a number of findings demonstrating the value of adding imaging data to models predicting survival [11, 12] and molecular pro- file [13] in glioblastoma. Our current work expands upon these results by using a semi-aut omated digital quantification technique, which recent work has shown to be mor e objective and lead to more robust findings than qualitative staging methods used in t he past [14]. Indeed, fea- ture measurements based on manual estimations have been shown t o be subject to sub- stantial inter- and intra-observ er meas- urements subvolumes, or imaging features, such as cont rast-enhancing tumor, necrosis, and tumor-associated edema, have been associated with response to treatment and overall prognosis [16, 17, 18]. Associations of tumor subvo lume data and somatic mu- tations would be of clinical imp ortance, as it would improve ou r understanding and mac- roscopic implications of these he avily researched molecular eve nts [19, 20]. Chapter 4 78 In this study, we investigated whether somatic mutations in gen es consistently implicated in glioblastoma are a ssociated with and can be predi cted by digitally derived volumetric features from tumor MR images, including contrast en hancing, necrosis, and T2 FLAIR hyperintensity volumes, as well as combination and rat ios of these features. We chose to focus on somatic mutations due to the strong literatur e presence and clinical rel- evance. We limited our analysis to an a priori selected gene se t as described by Verhaak et al. [4], as well as showing mutations in at least five patients included in our cohort, result- i n g i n t h e f o l l o w i n g : T P 5 3 , P T E N , N F 1 , E G F R , I D H 1 , P I K 3 R 1 , R B 1 , P I K 3 C A , a n d P D G F R A . Many of these genes are drug-targetable, raising the possibilit y of treating cancer based on noninvasively derived imaging biomarkers. In particular, sev eral potential therapies to target mutant EGFR such as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, or small molecule inhibitors are currently being actively investigated [21]. In addition, so me PTEN nonsense mutations have shown to be targeted by drugs that inhibit PKC (byrostatin ) and Raf (AZ628) [22], and IDH1 mutations have been shown to be targeted by small molecule inhibitors such as AGI- 120 [23]. Noninvasive methods that can predict mutation status would thus be of great clinical importance and could gu ide clinical treatment decision -making, especially in situa- tions where molecular testing or surgical biopsy is not feasibl e or appropriate. MATERIAL AND METHODS Imaging and mu tation data All Presurgical T1-weighted post-Gd contrast (T1C) and T2-weigh ted FLAIR sequence MR im- ages were downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archine (TCIA) (ht tp://thecancerimaging- archive.net) in September of 2014. TCIA is an NCI-sponsored ima ging sharing resource that houses more than three million images from 31 different institu tions [24, 25]. This resource is particularly valuable because it stores a wide variety of pu blically available longitudinal data with associated genomic data, which is not readily obtaina ble at a single institution l e v e l . A s t h e p a t i e n t s h a d b e e n p r e v i o u s l y d e - i d e n t i f i e d b y T C G A and were available for public download, no Institutional Review Board approval was req uired. Since presurgical status of an image was not explicitly included in the TCIA data , presurgical status was veri- fied by a trained neurologist (CH, 17 years of experience). Som atic mutation status from whole exome sequencing and clinical data were downloaded from T CGA using cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/public -portal/) queried with the \"cg [26]. The latest cBioPortal GBM dataset (version \"provisio nal\") was downloaded on September 25, 2014. Within TCIA, there were 185 GBM patients wi th both T1C and T2- weighted FLAIR images available before surgery. Of these, 76 pa tients had mutation data available within TCGA and were included in this analysis. Somatic mutations 79 Volumetric image analysis For T1C images, 2D masks were drawn on each MRI slice over the visible tumor using FSLView, a module in the FMRIB Software Library 5.0 (FSL [27]). For these image sets, a single contour encaps ulating both the dark (necrosis) and brigh t (contrast enhancing) are- as was segmented, becoming the basis of what will be referred t o as tumor bulk volume. Similarly, for the T2-weighted FLAIR image sets, a single conto ur was drawn on each slice over the visible tumor which enc ompassed both the region previo usly identified on the T1C (i.e., tumor bulk) as well as surrounding hyperintense sign al including the edema en- velope. To note, this markup does not attempt to differentiate between nonenhancing tumor and true edema, as they both appear hyperintense on the F LAIR image. Following segmentation, the origi nal mask containing the tumor region on the T 1 C i m a g e s u n d e r w e n t K - m e a n s c l u stering using the FSL FAST tool ( F M R I B ' s A u t o m a t e d Segmentation Tool) [28] to differentiate dark (necrosis) and br ight (contrast enhancing) areas from one another. A subset of 5-10 machine-generated segm entations were re- v i e w e d b y t r a i n e d e x p e r t s ( C H , D G ) t o v e r i f y p r o p e r s e g m e n t a t i o n ; w e d e t e r m i n e d t h a t the FAST algorithm module produced robust segmentations without extensive parameter optimization. This algorithm has been used routinely for more t han 10 years to segment white and gray matter, and we found robust segmentation results when we applied the algorithm to segmenting \"bright\" versus \"dark\" pixels for contr ast enhancement and ne- crosis. Based on the annotations on the T1C images, contrast enhancing, necrosis, and tumor bulk volumes could be calculated (Fig. 1). In addition, i ncorporation of the T2- weighted FLAIR series allowed quantification of the total tumor volume and T2-FLAIR hy- perintensity volume (total tumor volume-tumor bulk volume). For the purposes of our analyses, several derivative ratios were also calculated: necro sis/contrast enhancing, con- trast enhancing/tumor rosis/total tumor, hyperintensity/total tumor, and tumor bulk/total tumor vo lumes. Individual imaging feature volumes were computed by computing the total number of voxels within the re- spective region and multiplying by the voxel size; these calcul ations were performed using FSL's fslstats module. Imaging-genomic analysis For each of the 11 volumes or ratios defined above, the mean va lues corresponding to patients with mutated genes were compared to those of the wild- type cohort. Significant differences between groups with and without mutations were test ed with a two-sided Student's t test. Significance was defined by p value <0.05. Normal assumption of volumes was confirmed by p value <0.05 under a Shapiro-Wilk test across all patients. Thi s analysis was limited to genes from the a p riori selected gene set discus sed above.

Tumor bulk is defined as the total abnormal tumor area on the T1C images: combination of contrast enhancing and n ecrosis volumes. Total tumor volume is defined as the combination of the tumor bulk and T2-FLAIR hyperintensit y volumes. Predictive power of volumes to p redict mutation status was asse ssed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic ( ROC) [29]. To make perfor- mance evaluation comparable, the absolute AUC def ined as 0.5+abs( x0.5), where x is an AUC value. All statistic al analysis was carried out by t he R statistical software version 3. 0.2 on a Linux platform [30]. RESULTS To investigate whether somatic mutations were associated with M RI imaging features, the GBM patients analyzed in our ana lysis were limited to those wit h mutation data available from TCGA and image data from TCIA ( N=76). The genes analyzed in our study were lim- Somatic mutations 81 ited to an a priori selected gene set as described by Verhaak e t al. [4], as well as showing mutations in at least five patients included in our cohort. Thi s resulted in a total of nine genes included in our analysis: T P53, erived GBM tumor volumes An initial visual inspection of segmented images demonstrated a wide variety of measured features across patients that could be capitalized upon in imag ing genomic analyses (Fig. 2).

The pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients of these 11 analy zed imaging features are shown in Fig. 3. These results demonstrated the relative indepe ndence of many of these volumetric features and ratios. While some higher correlations were noted (e.g., contrast Chapter 4 82 enhancement and necrosis, r=0.91, or T2-FLAIR hyperin tensity and total tumor vol- ume, r=0.87), several features also showed low correlations, indica ting independence (e.g., necrosis and T2-F LAIR hyperintensity, r=0.07).

Note the high correlation between several features (e.g., T2-FLAIR hyper intensity and total tumor volume), as well as the low correlation between other features (e.g., necrosis and T2-FLAIR hyperintensity). C orrelations were assessed using Pearson correla tion coefficient. In a final exploratory analysis, patients were clustered into t wo groups based on imaging volumes. Importantly, chi-squared tests did not indicat e any significant differ- e n c e s o f g e n d e r , d i s e a s e - f r e e s t a t u s , K a r n o f s k y p e r f o r m a n c e s c o re, and age between Somatic mutations 83 these groups, suggesting that the measured imaging volumes meas ured are relatively in- dependent of these clinical variables (Fig. 4).

Gray bars indicate clinical parameters that were not available for a patient. Association of MRI volumetric features with somatic mutations In comparing the volumetric averages for the 11 measures betwee n mutant versus wild-type tumors to investigate the associations between mutation status and volumetric features, sev- eral significant results were observed (Table 1). TP53-mutated tumors had four subvolumes that were significantly differen t from wild-type tumors (Fig. 5 a). For example, contrast en- hancing and necrosis volumes were significantly smaller for mut ated tumors (8588.1 mm3 average nificantly higher necrosis/cont rast enhancing ratio (p=0.05) and a significantly lower contrast enhancing/tumor bul k ratio ( p=0.008) (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, showed -FLAIR hyperintensity (26,354.4 difference, (34,467.2 mm3 average difference, p=0.020) (Fig. 5c). For the other mutations, the volumetric fe atures did not signif- icantly differ between mutated and wild-type tumors (Table 1, S upplemental Digita l Content).

AUC values were calculated by quantifying the p erformance of distinguish- ing between a mutated and wild-type tumor on the basis of each of the 11 imaging fea- tures (Fig. 6, Table 2, Table 2 Supplemental Digital Content). In general, we found a tendency for volumetric features to pred ict mutation sta- tus of one gene specifically. For example TP53 could be signifi cantly predicted by contrast enhancing (AUC=0.6 8, p=0.001), necrosis (AUC=0.67, p=0. 039), as well as total tumor volumes (AUC=0.646, p=0.010). Of note, these three volumes were all highly correlated with each other as demonstrated in Fig. 3. Additionally, NF1 mu tation status could be pre- dicted by contrast enhancing volume (AUC=0.68, p=0.023) and tumor bulk volume (AUC=0.67, p=0.032). EGFR mutations could be predicted by t he necrosis/contrast en- hancing (AUC=0.68, p=0.001) ratio and contrast enhancing/tu mor bulk (AUC=0.68, mutations could by T2-FLAIR hyperintensity (AUC=0.66, Somatic 85 tumor volume (AUC=0.7 All sig nificant results are summa- rized in Table 2.

For each plot, the left y-axis corresponds to the mean volume of the left features and the right y-axis corresponds to the volume ratio of the features on the right. The bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Note TP53-mutated tumors were found to have significantly smaller contrast enhancing, necrosi s, and tumor bulk volumes compared to wild type. EGFR-mutated tumors have a significantly larger necrosis/contra st enhancing ratio, as well as a significantly smaller contrast enhancing/tumor bulk ratio. RB1-mutated tumors have significantly larger T2-FLAIR hyperinten- sity and total tumor volumes, compared to wild-type tumors. Chapter 4 86 DISCUSSION Medical imaging has strong poten tial to stratify patients, as i t is uniquely situated to non- invasively provide a macroscopic evaluation of the entire tumor volume. We quantified GBM MRI phenotypes by defining vo lumetric features, such as con trast enhancing, necro- sis, and T2-FLAIR hyperintensity volumes, and ratios thereof. I n this work, we investigated whether quantitative assessments of tumor features are signific antly associated with or predictive of somatic mutation status in GBM. We found strong associations of MRI characteristics with underl ying somatic mu- tation patterns, such as tumor bulk and total tumor volume with TP53 and RB1 mutations. Importantly, these features were able to significantly predict mutations, such as TP53, EGFR, RB1, NF1, [4, 31]. Although the predictive capability of the volumetric features for mutati onal status was not perfect (i.e., AUC=1), performance is much higher and significantly d ifferent compared to chance (i.e., AUC=0.50, p value0.05), demonstrating the strong as sociation of the imaging fea- ture with the underlying driving biology. Our results showed that contrast enhancing volume and necrosis volume are sig- nificantly smaller for TP53 mutants, a finding likely driven by the fact that these tumors, in previous work using the categori cally defined VASARI imaging fe atures, have been shown to be characterized by smaller volumes in general [13]. We conf irmed this qualitative as- defin ed quantitative volumetric ap proach, and additionally showed that both the tumor bulk (on the T1C images) and total t umor volume (on the T2- weighted FLAIR images), were sig nificantly smaller for TP53 mut ants. Our results also show that the n ecrosis/contrast enhancing rati o was significantly higher in EGFR mutants. These results indicate that although th e total tumor volume is similar, EGFR mutants have larger necrosis volumes and smaller contrast enhancing vol- u m e s , c o m p a r e d t o w i l d - t y p e t u m o r s . A l t h o u g h t h e t u m o r v o l u m e w as higher for EGFR mutants in our quantitative anal ysis, the differences were not significant, as previous work had demonstrated [13]. Somatic mutations 87 Table 2 Gene mutation/volumetric imaging feature correlations for subse t containing significant results. For each gene and imaging feature, area under the curve (AUC) values, corresp onding pvalue, and 95 % confidence interval are provided. For complete set of correlations, see Table 2 Supplemental Digital noted to have smaller T2-FLAIR hyperi ntensity and to- tal tumor volumes but similar contrast enhancing and necrosis v olumes compared to wild- type tumors, demonstrating the effect of RB1 on tumor-associate d T2-FLAIR hyperintensi- ty. One interpretation of these findings is that these mutation s drive different growth pat- terns within individual tumors t hat are reflected in drastic di fferences in the imaged tumor phenotype (for example, highly ne crosis/low CE vs. high CE/low necrosis). Correlations between our imaging features demonstrated that in general, the 11 features originally derived from MRI volumes are rel atively independent measures of brain tumors charac- teristics that many have the pot ential to offer unique insight into tumor behavior (Fig. 3). This was also demonstrated by showing that different features p redicted different muta- tions. Several automatic and semi-automatic volumetric algorithms have been pro- posed to segment GBM tumors in relevant subvolumes [32]. For th is work, we attempted a novel hybrid approach where we used a trained rater to mask t he gross abnormal signal on the T1C and T2-weighted FLAIR image. The gross tumor volume on T1C is then strati- fied automatically into contrast enhancing and necrosis subvolu mes (bright/dark pixels), using the FAST algorithm [33], improving the robustness of the segmentation process. We should note, however, that the segmentations were subsequently manually reviewed at various stages to ensu re quality control. Previous studies have investigated whether different biological s u b t y p e s c o n f e r different macroscopic properties to the images themselves and s ignificant correlations between genetic expression and ma croscopic imagin g properties h ave been established [34, 35, 36]. Imaging genomics seeks to close the gap between g enomics and neuroradiol- ogy to provide a comprehensive quantification of the tumor phen otype by applying a large number of automated image characterization algorithms [14, 20, 37]. In this paper, we applied a relatively low-dimensional feature extraction (focusi ng on three key volumes and derivatives for eleven features total). Future studies will expand these features and investigate the value of imaging genomics for the prediction of additional mutational pat- terns. Going forward, the development of noninvasive imaging biomarker s will provide valuable insight to the clinicians to help in treatment selecti on and prognosis. As these biomarkers assess the entire tumor volume, they alleviate some of the concerns related to most tissue-based assessments that involve sampling only a smal l region of the tumor. Given the marked heterogeneity observed within tumor samples ta ken from even the same patient [38], a noninvasive technique that allows serial i maging (e.g., MRI) can pro- vide valuable insight. Indeed, a limitation to our study is tha t in our patient set, TCGA tis- sue sampling was not performed under image guidance and therefo r e e x a c t l o c a t i o n o f biopsy is not known. Future studies will investigate the associ of intratumor muta- tional heterogeneity and M RI volumetric features. In addition, it is important to note that since the TCIA imagin g data used in our study was collected through a consortium of several institution s around the country, the Somatic mutations 89 specific MR parameters (field st rength, slice thickness, voxel size, slice gap) may not al- ways be perfectly standardized across patients. However, our re sults should be relatively unaffected by issues of slice thic kness, image quality, and vox el size, since we decided to analyze a set of volumetric features rather than measurements t hat would be more direct- ly influenced by these subtle differences. Since the majority o f the tumors were relatively large, and orders of magnitude larger than the size of an indiv idual voxel (even accounting for voxel variability), similar to other papers published using this dataset, we therefore believe our conclusions are not largely influence by such facto rs. We should also note that there is no clear association between contributing site, and at least within a site the scan- ner(s) used were much more consistent than b etween contributing sites. In conclusion, our results show that GBM mutations drive observ able phenotypes that are quantifiable with MRI imaging. We demonstrate that som atic mutations are asso- ciated with macroscopic characteristics and that these clinical ly important mutations can be significantly predicted with high performance. These results may impact personalized medicine, as imaging is noninvasive and already applied routine ly in clinical practice throughout a course of treatment . Finally, our results may shed insights into unique be- havioral and macroscopically visible growth characteristics of individual tumors as a result of tumor mutational differences. REFERENCES 1.

Reardon, Lawrence H. Schwartz, Patrick Y. Wen, Brian M. Alexander, Raymo nd Huang, and Hugo J.W.L. Aerts Chapter 5 96 ABSTRACT Background Anti-angiogenic therapy with bev acizumab is the most widely use d treatment option for recurrent glioblastoma, but therapeutic response varies substan tially and effective bi- omarkers for patient selection are not available. To this end, we determine whether novel quantitative radiomic strategies on the basis of MRI have the p otential to noninvasively stratify survival and progression in this patient population. Methods In an initial cohort of 126 pati ents, we identified a distinct set of features representative of the radiographic phenotype on baseline (pretreatment) MRI. Thes e selected features were evaluated on a second cohort of 165 patients from the multicent er BRAIN trial with pro- spectively acquired clinical and imaging data. Features were ev aluated in terms of prog- nostic value for overall al (OS), progression-free surviv al (PFS), and progression with- in 3, 6, and 9 months using base line imaging and first follow-u p imaging at 6 weeks post- treatment initiation. Results Multivariable analysis of features derived at baseline imaging resulted in significant strati- fication of OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.5; = 0.001) and PFS (HR = 4.5; log-rank P = 2.1 \u00d7 10 5) in validation data. These stratifications were stronger compa red with clinical or volumetric covariates on test false discovery of a ation correlation) derived from postcontrast T1-weighted im aging revealed significantly hi gher scores for patients who progressed within 3 months (Wilcoxon test P = 8 . 8 \u00d7 1 08). Generally, features de- rived from postcontrast T1-weigh ted imaging yielded higher prog power compared with precontrast enhancing T2-weighted imaging. Conclusion Radiomics provides prognostic value for survival and progressio n in patients with recur- rent glioblastoma receiving bevacizumab treatment. These result s could lead to the devel- opment of quantitative pretreatment biomarkers to predict benef it from bevacizumab using standard of care imaging. Keywords Bevacizumab - recurrent glioblastoma - radiomics - survival Quantitative imaging biomarkers 97 IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary malignan t brain tumor and re- currence is almost inevitable. At recurrence, patients are face d with poor prognosis due to limited treatment options. One widely used treatment for recurr ent glioblastoma in the United States is anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab. Howe ver, treatment response varies substantially and effective biomarkers for stratificatio n are absent. To this end, we propose an emerging approach, ra diomics, that translates standa rd radiographic images into quantitative data for in-de pth analysis of radiographic tu mor phenotypes. We applied radiomics to prospective clinical and imaging data from the mul ticenter BRAIN trial. Our analysis indicates that this appr oach yields significant progno stic value for OS and PFS at both baseline and follow-up imaging. These results prompt furth er prospective validation to develop a noninvasive pretreatment biomarker from standard o f care medical images for the purpose of objectively predicting treatment response in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab. INTRODUCTION Glioblastoma remains the most ag gressive primary malignant brai n tumor, with a median survival time of 15 months and a 5-year survival of ~5% after i nitial diagnosis.1-3 Despite standard of care therapy, including maximal safe surgical resec tion, radiotherapy, and te- mozolomide,4 nearly all patients relapse.5 One commonly used treatment option at recurrence in the US is b evacizumab, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor developed The randomized phase Genentech) for tre atment of recurrent glio- blastoma in 2009. Despite its current US approval for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, phase II and III clinical trials for patients with recurrent gl ioblastoma,9,10 as well as 2 recent phase III randomized clinical trials for patients with newly di agnosed glioblasto- ma,11,12 found no improvement in overall survival (OS) with the additio n of bevacizumab to standard therapy. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that there may be a pa tient population w i t h a m e a n i n g f u l c l i n i c a l b e n e f i t , g i v e n t h a t t h e d e m o n s t r a t e d activity of bevacizumab evidenced by impact on imaging-based endpoints13-15 and the development of novel bi- omarkers will be critical to ident ifying such patients. Imaging biomarkers that could pre- dict response to therapy, have significant prognostic value, or can identify patients unlike- ly to respond to any therapy would be an extremely valuable too l in this regard. Chapter 5 98 Radiomics is an emerging field th at translates medical images i nto quantitative data by applying a large set of feature extraction algorithms t o characterize tumor pheno- type.16-18 T w o a d v a n t a g e s o f r a d i o m i c s a r e i t s n o n i n v a s i v e a p p r o a c h a n d t he ability to evaluate the entire visible tumor and any intratumoral heteroge neity of glioblastoma.18- 20 Previous studies have employed a radiomic approach to glioblas toma21-24 reporting prognostic and predictive value of quantitative imaging feature s; moreover, associations of radiomics with underlying molecular profiles have been sugge sted.25,26 In this study, we present a radiomic analysis of patients with recurrent glioblas- toma treated with bevacizumab. In an independent selection coho rt, we identified a set of distinct quantitative imaging fe atures from MRI defining radiog raphic tumor phenotype. We evaluated these features on p rospectively acquired clinical and imaging data from the BRAIN trial, to determine whethe r there was an association with posttherapy survival and progression at baseline (pretreatment) and at follow-up at week 6 (posttreatment initia- tion). Hereby, we aimed at assessing whether such a radiomic ap proach can be valuable for the development of noninvasive biomarkers for risk stratifi cation in this patient popu- lation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study cohorts The current study was covered by 13-055 Partners institutional review board (Aerts). Selection cohort To independently determine the set of radiomic features that de fine the radiographic phenotype of a tumor and to avoid false discoveries due to a hi gh-dimensional radiomic feature space, we leveraged a retrospectively collected cohort of 126 nonconsecutive pa- tients at our institution for unsupervised feature selection bl inded from clinical data. Pa- tients had pathologically confirmed glioblastoma of at least on e recurrence and received bevacizumab either alone or with irinotecan between December 20 06 and August 2014 after standard of care treatment, including surgical resection followed by radiotherapy as well as concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Further baseline characteristics are de- tailed in Table 1. BRAIN trial Features selected on the selection cohort were retrospectively analyzed on prospectively a c q u i r e d d a t a f r o m t h e p h a s e I I , m u l t i c e n t e r , o p e n - l a b e l , r a n d o mized, noncomparative BRAIN trial (AVF3708g).7 The trial randomized 167 patients to receive either bevacizuma b alone ( n = 85) or in combination with irinotecan ( n = 82) at one of 10 treatment sites. Pa-Quantitative imaging biomarkers 99 tients were enrolled between July 2006 and September 2007, were at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed con trast-enhancing glioblastoma i n first or second relapse, and had failed first-line standard therapy including concurrent radiotherapy and te- mozolomide. There were at least 8 weeks between completion of r adiotherapy and study enrollment. Baseline Karnofsky performance status (KPS) at star t of trial was 70. Treat- m e n t l e n g t h o f t h e t r i a l w a s 1 0 4 w e e k s o r u n t i l p r o g r e s s i o n , d e ath, or discontinuation. Two patients in the BRAIN cohort were treated at our institute and were therefore includ- ed in the selection cohort. Further baseline characteristics ar e detailed in Table 1. Data acquisition was compliant with th e Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and had received approval of the respective local institutional rev iew boards. Before trial par- ticipation, patients provide d written informed consent. Table 1 Patient baseline characteristics.

For further data normalization, voxel values were discretized with a binwidth of 25 and voxels included in feature extraction were constrained to an intensity value range of 3 standard deviations from the mean. From the total BRAIN cohort, MRIs were available for 165 patients. Specif- ically, postcontrast T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging was availabl e at baseline for 160 and 152 patients, respectively, and at follow-up for 117 and 133 pa tients. Radiomics For both study cohorts, we extracted 65 quantitative imaging fe atures each from T1 and FLAIR scans at baseline (pretreatment) and follow-up after 6 we eks (posttreatment initia- tion) using our radiomics pipeline (Fig. 1). These features can be grouped into 3 types: (i) Chapter 5 100 first-order statistics of the voxel intensity histogram, (ii) t umor shape, and (iii) tumor tex- ture. Feature definitions are detailed in Supplementary File S1 , Supplementary Table S1, and Supplementary Table S2. In addition to baseline and follow- up, we calculated the per- centage difference (delta) of feature values by delta = 100 * ( F-B) / B, where B and F are the values at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Fig. 1 Study design. (A) Patients underwent MRI at baseline (pretreatm ent) and follow-up at 6 weeks after treatment initiation. Tumors were segmented in 3D on the basis of postcon trast T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging. (B) From each segmentation, the tumor imaging phenotype was defined with radiomics to quantify tumor intensity, shape, and texture features. (C) To avoid multiple-hypothesis testing, we identified a canonical set of representative features with unsupervised feature selection on the selection c o h o r t .

To reduce dimensionality, we leve raged the selection cohort to focus our analysis on a set of representative features. For this, we implemented a n unbiased unsupervised feature selection blinded from clinical information. We perform ed this selection on base- line features derived from postco ntrast T1-weighted and FLAIR i maging separately. First, Quantitative imaging biomarkers 101 we applied a principal componen t (PC) analysis and retained tho se PCs that accounted for 99% of the total variance in the data. Next, we selected the un iqu e set of feat ures t h at contributed to all PCs the most (0.9 rank correlation) using a factor analysis.29 Mean Spearman rank correlation of a particular feature with all othe r features was restricted to 0.9. From this remaining feature set, the 10 most variant feat ures were selected accord- i n g t o t h e c o e f f i c i e n t o f v a r i a t i o n . T o c o m p a r e r a d i o m i c s t o t r aditional radiological as- sessments, we calculated maximal axial diameter and total tumor volume automatically from the tumor segmentations and added these 2 volumetric size features to our feature set. In summary, we analyzed 12 features derived each from post contrast T1-weighted and FLAIR images. Statistical Analysis The features selected externally from the selection cohort were independently evaluated on the BRAIN cohort. All statistic al analyses were carried out with R30 version 3.1.0 on a Linux environment. Details of lib rary versions are given in Sup plementary File S2. Endpoints W e c o n s i d e r e d O S , p r o g r e s s i o n - f r e e s u r v i v a l ( P F S ) , a s w e l l a s p r o g r e s s i o n a t 3 , 6 , a n d 9 months as endpoints. OS was defined as time from treatment star t to death. 7 PFS was de- fined in the BRAIN trial as the time from treatment start to pr ogression or death, which- ever occurred first.7 Progression at 3, 6, and 9 months correspond to the 6-week sca n in- tervals of the BRAIN trial protocol. Median OS and PFS were 9.3 and 4.4 months, respec- tively. To cover a comprehensive analysis, prognostic value of our feature set was as- sessed each for postcontrast T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging at b aseline and follow-up, and delta while correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing as d escribed below. Univariable analysis We assessed the prognostic value of individual features for OS and PFS with the concord- ance index (CCI), 31,32 which takes time censoring into account. Prognostic value for binary progression at 3, 6, and 9 months was evaluated with the area u nder the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic.33 Significances of CCIs and AUCs u nder the null hypothesis that p redictor and out- come variable s are not asso ciated (ie, valu e of 0.5 ) were teste d 2-sided using Noether's procedure.34P-values for all features derived from postcontrast T1-weighted and FLAIR images were corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure according to Benjamini and Hochberg.35Features with corrected significant per- formance were also tested for direct distributional differences between patients who pro- gressed within 3 months with the 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test .36 To investigate stratification power of individual features, pat ients were assigned to lower and higher risk groups depending on whether their feat ure value was higher than Chapter 5 102 the median value across all patients or not. Hazard ratios (HRs ) and P-values were calcu- lated using univariable Cox proportional hazards models and one -sided Wald tests of Cox variables, respectively. Training and validation data For an unbiased assignment of pat ients into a training and vali dation set, we used the me- dian treatment date of the full BRAIN trial cohort. To mimic pr ospective validation as closely as possible, data from patients treated before the medi an treatment date were used for training and data from patients with later dates were used for validation. If no treatment date was available, patients were assigned to the tra ining set ( n = 4) for more power in fitting. This split resulted in n = 86 and n = 81 patients for train ing and validation, respectively. From the tra ining (validation) data, n t = 82 (n v = 78), n t = 59 (n v = 58), and n t = 57 (n v = 58) samples were available for postcontrast T1-weighted imag ing at baseline, fol- low-up, and delta, respectively; n t = 80 (n v = 72), n t = 71 (n v = 62), and n t = 69 (n v = 62) samples were available for FLAIR imaging at baseline, follow-up , and delta, respectively. Multivariable analysis The univariable analysis indicated strong prognostic value for features derived from post- contrast T1-weighted baseline imaging. To increase this prognos tic performance, we aimed at combining individual features in multivariable models. To not overfit our models and to subsequently compare with volumetric and clinical variab les, we selected comple- mentary radiomic features with supervised forward feature selec tion. First, we ranked all 10 radiomic features with the minimal redundancy maximal releva nce algorithm37 using the training baseline data. Next, those features were sequentia lly added into a growing Cox proportional hazards model for PFS or OS starting with the top ranked feature. After each iteration (ie, addition of a feature) the performance was assessed with the CCI and validated with repeated random cross-validation ( n = 1000 resamples and 80%/20% split o f t r a i n i n g d a t a ) . T h e f i n a l m o d e l f e a t u r e s e t w a s o b t a i n e d b y stopping addition of fea- tures when the cross-validated mean CCI did not further increas e (forward selection). This procedure was performed solely on the training set and selected 2 features for PFS (Gray- level co-occurrence matrix [GLCM] information correlation and G LCM correlation) and 1 feature for OS (GLCM information correlation). Selected features were used to fit a random-forest classifier ( n = 500 trees) on the training set to predict one-year OS, as well as progression at 3, 6, and 9 months. Pa- rameter optimization was done with repeated 5-fold cross-valida tion ( n = 10 repeats) choosing optimal decision tree splits with the one standard err or method according to Breiman et al38using accuracy as evaluation metric. Performance of the fitted models was evaluated with HRs and log-rank tests on the validation set. For comparison with clinical and volumetric models, the above p rocedure de- scribing random-forest model bu ilding was applied to create a m odel with age, sex, and KPS, and to create a model with maximal axial diameter and tota l tumor volume. Perfor-Quantitative imaging biomarkers 103 mance of radiomic models were compared with these clinical and volumetric models with repeated random permutation tests ( N = 1000 resamples) of the CCI differences; P-values were corrected with the FDR. RESULTS Identification of an Independent Radiomic Feature Set To determine the canonical set of features able to comprehend t he radiographic charac- teristics of recurrent glioblasto ma on MRI (Fig. 1A-B), we used unsupervised feature selec- tion on a selection cohort (Fig. 1C). This defined a subset of 10 radiomic features derived each from baseline postcontrast T1-weighted and FLAIR images. T hese features quantify a wider range of intensity, shape, and texture characteristics of a tumor (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) and were compared to two standard volumetric features (ie, maximal axial diameter and total tumor volume). This feature set was independently evaluated on the BRAIN trial cohort (Fig. 1D- E). Clustering analysis of radiomic features indicated differen ces between phenotypic im- aging profiles of patients (Fig. 2A). Identified clusters were independent of baseline KPS; mean Spearman rank correlation to KPS was = 0.06 and = 0.13 for postcontrast T1- weighted and FLAIR imaging, respectively. Furthermore, features had only low pairwise correlation (mean absolute Spearman's = 0.31), even when deri ved from the same imag- ing modality, suggesting that these features provide complement ary information (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1). Fig. 2 Independence of features. (A) Visualization of features derived from baseline postcontrast T1-weighted (top) and FLAIR imaging (bottom). Values are given as Z-scores and group patients based on hierarchical clustering. (B) Pairwise Spearman rank correlation between all features at base line imaging. Correlation among features was low, indicating interfeature independence (mean absolute Spearm an's = 0.31). Chapter 5 104 Verification of Prognostic Value of Individual Features We evaluated the prognostic value of our feature set for OS and PFS, as well as progres- sion within 3, 6, and 9 months for baseline and follow-up imagi ng and for the delta be- tween baseline and follow-up (Fig. 3). In general, more feature s derived from postcontrast T1-weighted than from FLAIR imag ing showed significant prognost i c v a l u e ( C C I , N o e t h e r FDR < 0.05). At baseline imaging, only those features derived f rom postcontrast T1- weighted imaging perfo rmed significantly. Moreover, distributions of progno stic features were significant ly different in pa- tients who progressed at different time points when derived fro m postcontrast T1- weighted imaging (Supplementary Figure S2). For example, the te xtural heterogeneity fea- ture information correlation had significantly greater scores f or patients who progressed within 3 months (Wilc oxon rank-sum test P = 8 . 8 \u00d7 1 08). This feature was significantly predictive of all tested endpoin ts under postcontrast T1-weight ed baseline imaging, but performed highest when predicting patients who progressed withi n 6 months from follow- up imaging (AUC = 0.68, Noether FDR = 0.0019). Furthermore, at baseline imaging this feature significantly stratified patients into high- and low-ri sk groups of OS (HR = 1.7, Wald test P = 0.0017) and PFS (HR = 1.7, Wald test P = 0.0029). All other features showed lower discrimination at baselin e and follow-up imaging. On the delta between baseline and follow-up imaging, the highes t performing feature was energy of the imaging texture for progression withi n 6 months (AUC = 0.65, Noether FDR = 0.04) with moderate risk stratification power (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = [0.36, 0.82], Wald test P = 0.0037). Further stratification results are detailed in Supp lementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S3. Baseline Models of Sur vival and Progression To develop pretreatment biomarkers for survival and progression , we assigned patients into a training and validation se t based on median treatment da te. First, we trained a model to predict one-year OS from baseline postcontrast T1-weig hted imaging. As shown in Fig. 4, this model significant ly stratified OS of patients f rom the validation set (HR = 2.5, 95% CI = [1.5, 4.4]; log-rank P = 0.001) after adjusting for age, sex, and KPS, and without adjusting (HR = 2.3, 95% CI = [1.4, 3.8]). We trained additional models to predict progression at 3, 6, an d 9 months using baseline postcontrast T1-weighted imaging (Fig. 5). These model s significantly stratified PFS of patients from the validation set (adjusted; 3 months pro gression: HR = 2.8, 95% CI = Quantitative imaging biomarkers 105 Fig. 3 Univariable performances. Prognostic value of features at treat ment baseline, 6-week follow-up, and the delta difference of 10 radiomic features for T1 and FLAIR, respective ly. Standard volumetric features are shown for comparison. Performances were evaluated with the CCI for OS and PFS, and with the AUC of the receiver operator characteristic for progression at 3, 6, and 9 months. Asterisks indicate significance (FDR < 0.05) after correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing according to Benjamini and Hoch berg. Generally, performance of features derived from postcontrast T1-weighted imaging tended to be higher than features derived from FLAIR imaging. [1.6, 4.8], log-rank P = 5.9 \u00d7 104; 6 months R = 3.8, 95% CI = [2.1, 6.7], log- rank P = 2.1 \u00d7 105; and 9 months progre ssion: HR = 4.5, 95% C I = [2.2, 9.2], log- rank P = 3.5 \u00d7 105). Sensitivity and specificity for the internal classification of one-year OS, as well as for the classification of 3, 6, and 9 months progres sion, are reported in Supple- mentary Table S4. Furthermore, no impact of treatment arm was o bserved on the perfor- mance of these models. Chapter 5 106 Fig. 4 Survival analysis of a multivariable radiomics model for OS. A biomarker with radiomic features was optimized to predict one-year OS. This marker showed significant pretreatmen t stratification power in discriminating patients at higher and lower risk in validation data held independent of training (HR = 2.5; W ald test P = 8.2 \u00d7 104; log- rank P = 0.0011) after adjusting for age, sex, and KPS at basel ine. All 4 radiomic models performed significantly better (HR permut ation test FDR < 0.05) than models of c linical covariates on ly (ie, age, sex, an d KPS) or volumetric features only (ie, maximal diameter and tu mor volume). The radiomic mode ls also performed bet- ter than models combining clinic al and volumetric covariates at slightly lower significance (FDR < 0.09). Stratification was not improved when combining vo lumetric and radiomic features or combining radiomic f eatures derived from postcontra st T1-weighted and FLAIR imaging (Supplementary Figure S4A and Supplementary Figure S4B, respectively). DISCUSSION We present a retrospective radio mic analysis of prospectively a cquired data from the BRAIN trial to develop noninvasiv e quantitative prognostic biom arkers for survival and progression on the basis of standard MRI for patients with recu rrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab. Our results su ggest that a radiomic approach provides prognostic in- sight about response of these patients, which could lead to fur ther investigation for pre- dictive biomarkers to meet the current need of stratifying pati ents, as bevacizumab has recently been suggested not to improve OS.11,12,39 Quantitative imaging biomarkers 107 Fig. 5 Survival analysis of multivariable radiomics models for PFS. Bi omarkers were optimized to predict progression at 3, 6, and 9 months. All models significantly stratified patient s in validation data; hazard ratios ranged from 2.8 to 4.5 (Wald test P 1.6 \u00d7 104; log-rank P 5.9 \u00d7 104) after adjusting for age, sex, and KPS at baseline. Our study provides baseline models for OS of patients, as well as baseline models for progression at 3, 6, and 9 months. On the basis of pretreat ment imaging, these models were able to identify patients in the validation set who had mo re than 4 times the risk to progress within 6 and 9 months throughout the course of treatme nt. With increasing time point, these models consistently performed better, suggesting t hat particularly patients who experience progression late can be identified. Furthermore, these models performed substantially better than individual features alone. Importantl y, radiomic features in these models were independent of volumetric features and age, sex, an d KPS, which were the clinical variables available to us and which are known clinical prognostic factors for glio- blastoma2; however, age and sex may be less prognostic for OS than KPS, as has only re- cently been suggested.40 Consequently, our results could lead to the development of a no ninvasive bi- o m a r k e r t h a t w o u l d i d e n t i f y p a t i e n t s w h o a r e m o r e l i k e l y t o b e n efit from bevacizumab even before treatment initiation. However, to determine whether any proposed radiomic biomarker also is predictive of positive treatment outcome, a p rospective control arm without anti-angiogenic therapy would be necessary. Alternative ly, failure of our model to predict similar endpoints in a non -bevacizumab containing cohor t would offer evidence to support a predictive hypothesis. Furthermore, prospective valid ation of our models in fol- low-up studies will be required. Our multivariable correlation, wh ich quantifies tex- only did this feature yield si gnificant prognostic baseline value across all tested endpoints , but it also showed higher sc ores for patients who pro- gressed early, suggesting that t extural-imaging heterogeneity i s a prognostic factor. Uni- variable analysis of our full feature set indicated further pro gnostic candidates; however, all features had significantly less performance compared with o ur fully trained models. Chapter 5 108 Both our univariable and multivariable analyses indicated that postcontrast T1-weighted imaging data provide more prognostic information than FLAIR ima ging, irrespective of in- vestigated time- and endpoints. It remains a difficulty to hypo thesize why FLAIR imaging is less prognostic; however, previous studies have documented that tumor volume was not prognostic under FLAIR in recurre nt glioblastoma and bevacizuma b treatment.41- 43 Overall, a general tendency towa rd higher predictability of PF S was observed, which could be explained by a more cle arly defined endpoint than OS, as patients who pro- gressed were discontinued from study treatment and observed for O S . D i f f e r e n c e s b e - tween treatment arms in the BRAIN cohort were not expected and hence data have been pooled, as published previously.8,44,45 Robustness of our results is increased, given that we leveraged 2 independent cohorts to select and evaluate, respectively, our feature set; this limits false discoveries in a high-dimensional approach such as radiomics. Importantly, we blinded the feature selec- tion from clinical data to avoid information leakage and hence increase validity even fur- ther. We chose to use our institutional cohort as the selection cohort, as the heterogene- ous nature of this retrospectiv e data implies less suitability for fitting models compared with the prospectively acquired BRAIN data. Conversely, our stu dy benefits from evalua- tion of radiomic features in pro spectively acquired clinical tr ial data of high quality, which includes predefined criteria for patient enrollment, treatment, and follow-up. As this was a multicenter trial with 10 sites , MRI protocols specifying ima ging acquisition parameters and equipment have varied across institutions, further highligh ting the potential generali- zability of our proposed models. Especially for texture-based f eatures we do not expect substantial variability, as those features are generally relati ve measurements. In these ways, our study advances the results of a recent study indicati ng prognostic value of radi- omics in a of patients with rec urrent glioblastoma receiv- ing bevacizumab,46 which was also demonstrated by the high performance of our val idat- ed models. In addition, we provide further insights into the re lationship of intratumoral h e t e r o g e n e i t y i n i m a g i n g a n d p a t ient survival, as well as compa rative analyses of com- monly used MRI modalities and measurements of tumor burden. Other approaches to develop imaging biomarkers were explored in comparable cohorts.8,13,15,47-49 For example, apparent diffusion coefficient histogram analysis has been previously conducted on a subset of the BRAIN cohort totaling 9 7 patients.48 As radiomics can be applied to standard imaging, complementary value with th ose approaches could be tested when these data become available. In addition, integrati on of imaging with biologi- cal assays could yield valuable insight into tumor progression50,51 and allow early identifi- cation of resistances.52,53 This could also contribute to u nraveling the mechanistic conne c- tions between radiomics, tumor b iology, and clinical outcomes. In conclusion, we demonstrated the strong prognostic value of r adiomics to pre- dict survival and progression of patients with recurrent gliobl astoma treated with bevaci- zumab in prospectively acquired data from the BRAIN trial. Our results could lead to fur- ther development of a noninvasive predictive biomarker based on standard of care pre-Quantitative imaging biomarkers 109 treatment imaging to identify a subpopulation of patients who w ould benefit from bevaci- zumab.

Aerts*, Patrick Tan, Geoffre R. Oxnard, Naiyer Rizvi, Lawrence H. Schwartz, and Binsheng Zhao Chapter 6 114 ABSTRACT Medical imaging plays a fundamen tal role in oncology and drug d evelopment, by providing a non-invasive method to visualize tumor phenotype. Radiomics c an quantify this pheno- type comprehensively by applying image-characterization algorit hms, and may provide important information beyond tumor size or burden. In this stud y, we investigated if radi- omics can early-stag e non-small cell lung can- cer before and after three weeks of therapy. On the baseline-sc an, radiomic-feature Laws- Energy was significantly predictive for EGFR-mutation status (A p=0.03), while volume (AUC=0.59, p=0.27) and diameter (AUC=0.56, p=0.46) were not. Although no features were predictive on the post-treatment scan ( p>0.08), the change in features be- tween the two scans was strongly predictive (significant featur e AUC-range=0.74-0.91). A technical validation revealed that the associated features were also highly stable for test- retest (mean\u00b1std: ICC=0.96\u00b10.06). This pilot study shows that radiomic data before treatment is able to predict mutation status and associated gef itinib response non- invasively, demonstrating the pot ential of radiomics-based phen o t y p i n g t o i m p r o v e t h e stratification and response assessment between tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sensitive and resistant patient populations. Radiomic response phenotype 115 INTRODUCTION The response of tumors as measur ed on imaging is historically o ne of the oldest bi- omarkers used in drug discovery and clinical practice. Response has been assessed by measuring tumor burden with a number of surrogates such as criteria1 nts as defined by the World Health Organization2. The purpose of these criteria as we ll as the modifications to the criteria are twofold; first, to enhance the ability of the biomarker to be prognostic or predictive and/or to improve the accuracy and reproducibility o f the biomarker. Tumor burden and change in tumor burden during therapy, as measured a t imaging, has been demonstrated to have value as a biomarker3. However, medical imaging can provide more information about the tumor phe- notype, beyond volumetric measurements; a process referred to a s image-based pheno- typing. Medical imaging is intuit ively very suitable as a bioma rker source to predict treat- ment response, as it is able to visualize and quantify time ser ies of disease processes in a non-invasive way in individual patients. The characterization o f quantitative imaging fea- tures which reflect tumor biology, physiology and tumor phenoty pe is increasingly being explored. Radiomics is the study of these quantitative features and their correlation with tumor phenotypes4,5,6. For example, recent studies have used CT-based radiomic sign a- tures to successfully predict ove rall survival, disease free su rvival, and distant metastases i n l u n g c a n c e r 4,7,8 . O t h e r e x a m p l e s h a v e d e m o n s t r a t e d t h a t a n i m a g i n g f e a t u r e w h i ch could be quantified, for example, the percentage of ground-glas s opacity (GGO) volume, is significantly higher in patients with the exon 21 missense muta tion t h an in tumors with other EGFR mutation status9. This is thought be related to the fact that exon 21 missense mutation was significantly more frequent in lepidic predominant adenocarcinomas10. While these quantitative imaging features are under investigati o n i n m a n y c a n c e r s f o r their correlation with tumor phenotype and mutational status th ere is preliminary evi- dence to suggest that there may be an association between these features and both clini- cal outcomes and the underlying genomic signatures in lung canc er4,8,11. In this pilot study, we look for t he first time at the value of quantitative radiomic imaging features, in addition to tumor burden which was previou sly studied, for predicting known sensitizing EGFR mutations associated with Gefitinib resp onse, to understand the relationship between imaging features and mutational status at baseline and especially with change in therapy in patients with and without the sensiti zing mutation. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a re-analysis of an existing dataset; imaging and tissu e data were obtained prospec- tively as an exploratory analysis within a phase II trial of ne oadjuvant Gefitinib in patients Chapter 6 116 with NSCLC12. Correlation results of early diameter and volume changes with EGFR muta- tion status was published previou sly3. As described previously3 , all experiments were per- formed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, and approved by the insti- tutional review board (IRB) at Columbia University College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. Also, informed consent was obtained from all subjects included in this study. Clinical data At time of resection, tumor tissue was snap frozen in liquid ni trogen and stored in a 80\u00b0C freezer. Representative areas of these specimens were pathologi cally reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and presence of tumor. Genomic DNA was analyzed f or the most common EGFR-sensitizing mutations (exons 19 and 21) using previously d escribed PCR-based methods13,14. EGFR wild-type (WT) tumors we re also tested for KRAS mutati ons, which were found in a non-overlapping subset of lung adenocarcinomas that have been found to be resistant to EGFR tyrosine ki nase inhibitor therapy15. If no EGFR mutations were found, then the remaining EGFR exons were assessed by stan dard dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Selected specimens that were found to be EGFR/KRAS WT were submitted for more detailed mutational tes ting using mass spectrometry. Tumor imaging and measurement Baseline computed tomography of each patient was done within 2 weeks before gefitinib initiation. A follow-up computed tomography scan was done using the same imaging ac- quisition technique about three weeks post therapy, before surg ery. Non-contrast en- hanced diagnostic chest computed tomographies were done with a LightSpeed 16 scanner (GE Medical Systems) during a breath hold. High-resolution imag es with 1.25-mm slice thickness and lung kernel were reconstructed3. Three patients w ere excluded because 1.25-mm slice thickness reconstruc tions were not collected as r equired by protocol (two patients) and delineation of lesion contour did not reach radio logists' consensus during the data review of this study (one patient), leaving 47 of 50 p atients remained in our anal- ysis. analysis In this work, we extracted 183 radiomic features from both base line and follow up scan images that were resampled down to 0.25mm resolution in all th ree directions. The defi- nitions of these features are provided in Supplemental 1. The D elta dataset was defined as the pre-treatment radiomic feature values minus the post-treatm ent values. On the Delta dataset, the 15 most variant features were selected using the c oefficient of variation. From this set, highly correlated features were removed who had a mean correlation of higher than 0.95. This procedure yielded 11 independent feature s; we added Volume and Radiomic response phenotype 117 maximum diameter for comparison, resulting in 13 features in to tal. A correlation matrix for these features was calculated using Spearman rank statistic . For every dataset, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteris tic (ROC)17 was calculated to assess predictive power of EG FR-sensitizing mutation. Since only 13 features were test- ed, correction for multiple testi ng was not considered. All sta tistical analysis was conduct- ed using the R statistical softwar e version 3.1.018 on a Linux operating system. Technical validation Technical validation of the features were conducted in a test-r etest setting on the RIDER dataset, which contains of 31 patients each two lung CT scans t aken approximately 15min. apart. The RIDER lung cancer dataset19 of the same-day repeat CT scans and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the stability of features for test- retest. The CT imaging protocol of the RIDER data set was ident ical to the one used in this study20. RESULTS To investigate if radiomic bioma rkers are associated with mutat ional status and response to Gefitinib treatment, we analyzed clinical data of 47 early s tage NSCLC patients whom were imaged before and after treatment. In Fig. 1 representativ e CT scans of an EGFR mu- tant and an EGFR wild-type tumor are shown before and after Gef itinib treatment, demonstrating clear phenotypic differences. To quantify these d ifferences, we performed a radiomic analysis (see Fig. 2). The analysis was restricted t o features with high and inde- pendence variance (Supplement I), resulting in eleven radiomic features and two volumet- ric features (volume and max diameter), that were included in o ur analysis (see Table 1). Using this strategy, we were able to identify a limited number of independent features, and only these features were assessed for performance to predic t mutational status and associated Gefitinib response. Baseline radiomics associations with mutational status We investigated the correlations between the image features eva luated in our analysis. In Fig. 3 the correlations between the features extracted from the before treatment CT scan are shown. Although the GLCM features showed high positive and negative correla- tions, overall the correlations between those features were low (mean\u00b1std: 0.16\u00b10.95), demonstrating independency of those features. Note the low corr elation of total tumor volume with the other features (mean\u00b1std: 0.01\u00b10.33).

Radiomic response phenotype 119 Figure 2 Patients included to the study were received Gefitinib treatmen t. CT scans at baseline and first follow-up were used to segment the tumor and to extract radiomic features. Bas eline, follow-up, and delta radiomics (differences between baseline and follow-up) were used to assess EGFR sensit izing mutation status.

Feature Description Volume Tumor volume is calculated by multiplying the number of tumor voxels by the image resolu- tions in x-, y- and z-directions. Gabor Energy feature class Gabor filters are linear filters designed for edge detection. This is an oriented Gaussian func- tion modulated by a sinusoidal wave. The Ga- bor Energy feature is defined as the sum of the square of density over all lesion pixels on the images pre-processed by Gabor filter. \u00b7 Gabor_Energy-dir135-w3: the Gabor Energy feature calculated on the images pre- processed using the Gabor filter built with an orientation of 135\u00b0 and a wavelength of 3 pix- els. \u00b7 Gabor_Energy-dir45-w9 : the Gabor Energy feature calculated on the images pre- processed using the Gabor filter built with an orientation of 45\u00b0 and a wavelength of 9 pixels. Sigmoid Function feature class To quantify lesion margins, Sigmoid curve is used to fit density change along a sampling line drawn orthogonal to the lesion surface. Each sampling line, going through one voxel on the lesion surface, has a certain length inside and outside the lesion. \u00b7 S i g m o i d - O f f e t - M e a n - d 5 : T h e a v e r a g e o f t h e densities between a lesion and lung paren- chyma on all lines.

T h e v a l u e o f e a c h S h a p e I n d e x ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the value, the greater the portion of the shape on the sur- face. \u00b7 Shape_SI6: Describes the saddle ridge shape.

A spherical shape has the smallest value of zero (0). GLCM feature class GLCM stands for grey-level co-occurrence ma- trix. This feature class characterizes image tex- tures by creating a new matrix, GLCM, which is b a s e d o n t h e f r e q u e n c y o f i m a g e p i x e l p a i r s having particular gray-level values in a particu- lar spatial arrangement (i.e., distance and di- rection). A number of statistical features can then be extracted from GLCM to characterize homogeneity, contrast, entropy and so on. In the following feature names, \"mean\" specifies average of feature values calculated at 13 di- rections. \"d1\" and \"d4\" indicate pixel pairs separated by 1-pixel distance and 4-pixel dis- tance. \u00b7 G L C M _ I M C 1 - m e a n - d 1 : T h e a v e r a g e o f i n f o r - m a t i o n a l m e a s u r e o f c o r r e l a t i o n 1 c a l c u l a t e d at pixel pairs separated by 1-pixel distance \u00b7 G L C M _ I M C 1 - m e a n - d 4 : T h e a v e r a g e o f i n f o r - m a t i o n a l m e a s u r e o f c o r r e l a t i o n 1 c a l c u l a t e d at pixel pairs separated by 4-pixel distance \u00b7 G L C M _ M C C - m e a n - d 1 : T h e a v e r a g e o f M a x i - mum Correlation Coefficient calculated at pixel pairs separated by 1-pixel distance. calculated at pixel pairs separated by 4-pixel distance. Laws Energy feature class Laws' Energy emphasizes edge, spot, ripple and wave patterns through Laws filters gener- ated by the following 5 basic raw vectors: Av- erage L5=(1, 4, 6, 4, 1), Edge E5=(1, 2, 0, 2, 1), Spot S5=(1, 0, 2, 0, 1), Ripple R5=(1, 4, 6 , 4 , 1 ) , a n d W a v e . B y m u l p l y i n g a n d c o m - bining the transpose of one basic vector and/or the vector itself, 14 standard Laws fil- ters can be built, each generating one feature.

Chapter 6 122 Figure 3 Correlations of Radiomics features. Correlation coefficient mat rix between the 13 imaging features evaluated in the analysis. Note the overall low correlation between radiomic features. Correlations were assessed using pear- son correlation coefficient. To assess the associations of radiomic features and EGFR mutati onal status, we evaluated the predictive power using the AUC of the ROC. Figure 4 shows the AUC values that were measured for imaging features extracted from the scan before treatment, after treatment, and the difference be tween both scans (delta). Inter estingly, Laws Energy 10 is the only radiomic feature that is significantly predictive for mutational status extracted from the pre-treatment scan (AUC=0.67, p=0.03). Note that p re-treatment tumor (AUC=0.59, maximum diameter (AUC=0.56, p =0.46) are not predic- tive of mutation status. No features are significantly predicti ve extracted from the image scan after treatment (highest AU C=0.64, p=0.08, Shape SI6). Also, the remaining volume after treatment is not predicti ve (AUC=0.54, p=0.63). Radiomic response phenotype 123 Response phenotyping by radiomics feature change to predict mut ational status To assess the difference in radiomic feature values between the two scans (delta), showed strong predictability for mutation status (Fig. 4C). The strong est predictors are delta vol- ume (AUC=0.91, p=1025) and delta maximum diameter (AUC=0.78, p=105). However, Figure 4 Value of radiomic features to predict mutational status extract ed from ( A) before treatment scan, ( B) post- treatment scan, and ( C) delta (difference between the scan before and after treatment ). Predictive value is as- sessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver ope rator characteristic (ROC). Asterisk denotes fea- tures that significantly predict mutation status better than ra ndom (p<0.05). Note, before treatment only the radiomic feature Laws_Energy was significant for predicting mut ation status, and conventional imaging markers showed no significant predictive power. After treatment no feat ures are predictive, however delta feature values between the pre and post-scan show strongest predictive value. Chapter 6 124 o n e r a d i o m i c f e a t u r e w a s a l s o s i g n i f i c a n t l y p r e d i c t i v e : d e l t a G abor Energy (dir135-w3), which is Gabor Energy calculated at the wavelength of 3 pixels and direction of 135 grade (AUC=0.74, p=3 \u00d7104). Although, this feature is predictive, the correlations with tumor volume ( r = 0 . 3 1 ) a n d m a x i m u m d i a m e t e r ( r=0.43) are low (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate the predictability o f radiomic features quantifying phenotypic characteristics other than volumetric features. Technical validatio n of radiomic features for stability As a technical validation, we a ssessed the stability of the fou r features that showed signifi- cantly predictive capabilities on either the pre, after, or del ta scans, i.e. (I) L aws Energy, (II) Gabor Energy, (III) tumor volume, and (IV) maximum diameter (Fi g. 4). For this purpose we used the independent RIDER lung cancer dataset consists of same -day repeated CT scans for 31 patients. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) w as used to assess the stability of each feature for test-retest. We found that all four signifi cantly associated features with mutation status were also for test-retest (mean\u00b1 std: ICC=0.96\u00b10.06). Fea- ture Laws_Energy_10, with mutational status ex- tracted from the pretreatment scan, had a high stability of ICC =0.87. The stability of the features significantly associated with mutational status betwee n the two time points, was also very high: Volume (ICC=0. 99), Gabo Energy (ICC=0.97), and maximum diameter (ICC=0.99). These results validate that features significantl y associated with mutation status are also stable for test-retest. DISCUSSION Biomarkers that are able to predict treatment response are cruc ial for clinical introduction of targeted therapies. Erlotinib and Gefitinib are examples of targeted therapies that were successfully introduced in practic e , l a r g e l y d u e t o a c c u r a t e p r edictive biomarkers (i.e. EGFR mutation status). Others have failed to become clinically approved, such as Cetuxi- mab in NSCLC, to a great extent because an accurate response bi omarker is lack- ing21,22,23,24. Medical imaging is intuitively very suitable for this purpo se, as it is able to visualize and quantify time seri es of disease processes in a no n-invasive way in individual patients. \"Radiomics\", the extraction and analysis of large amo unts of advanced imaging features, is able to quantify tumor phenotypic properties, ther eby potentially providing valuable diagnostic, prognostic or predictive information. Radi omic features have been associated with clinical outcomes4,8,25,26,27,28,29, however the predictive capability of radiomics for response to target ed therapies remains largely un known. Radiomic response phenotype 125 The goal of this study was to investigate if radiomic data coul d define a response phenotype for NSCLC patients treated with Gefitinib therapy. Ou r data show strong asso- ciations between radiomic features and tumors with and without sensitizing mutations. The radiomics feature Laws Energy extracted from the baseline, pretreatment CT scan showed the strongest performance to predict mutation status (AU C=0.67, p=0.03). In contrast, we found that tumor volume and maximum diameter were both not significantly predictive (p>0.27). These data show that radiomics analyses can reveal more phenotypic characteristics than standard im aging features, such as size an d volume, and have tre- mendous potential to be incorporated into precise response biom arkers. However, before clinical applicability, the predictive performance of these fea tures have to be evaluated in large independent cohorts across institutions. As expected, response of imaging phenotype was extremely differ ent for patients with and without sensitizing muta tions. We compared the radiomi c data extracted from the change in pre- and post-treatment scans. As expected, tumor volume and maximum diameter had the highest performance; however the radiomic feat ure Gabor Energy was also significantly predictive. The correlation of this feature with tumor volume and maxi- mum diameter was low. This could indicate the independent predi ctability for mutational status; however, future studies are needed to show if these fea tures have complementary value in multivariate models for response prediction or may be seen earlier in treatment response. Due to the limited sam ple size of this study, we were not able to identify and validate multivariate biomarkers. The analysis supports CT-base d response assessment as one effective tool for distinguishing sensitive and resistant t umor, but there may be other m e t r i cs t h a t a r e a d d i t i v e a n d w o u l d a l l o w a m o r e co m p r e h e n s i v e measure of response. The specific radiomic features m ay depend upon the specific mec hanism of action of the drug or class of therapy. Correlations between our selected radiomics features demonstrat ed that in gen- eral, the features originally derived from CT segmentation of t umors are indeed inde- pendent measures of phenotypic characteristics. Each feature ha s the potential to offer unique insight to the tumor behavior. This was demonstrated by the fact that different radiomic features predicted for tumors with and without EGFR mu tations, and confirmed b y t h e r e l a t i v e i n d e p e n d e n c e b e t w e e n m o s t o f t h e i m a g i n g f e a t u r es. However, future studies have to investigate how these patterns in the imaging d ata captured by these ra- diomic features, are associated with the underlying driving bio logy. As a technical validation we assessed if the four features sign ificantly associated with mutation status, identified by our analysis, could be stab ly extracted from CT scans. We evaluated this stability using another dataset with repeated test-retest CT scans for 31 patients (RIDER). All four features could be validated and had high stability for test-retest (ICC>0.87). Variability in CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters is inherent in clinical p r a c t i c e . I n t h i s s t u d y w e u s e d a p r o s p e c t i v e c o l l e c t e d d a t a s e t with high resolution CT scans with the same imaging protocol for all included patients. However, the optimal Chapter 6 126 scanning parameters still have to be defined and more domain sp ecific quantitative fea- tures are anticipated to be developed. The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) of the Na- tional Institute of Health, and others, play an important role in this process by performing phantom studies, radiomic feature definition standardizations, and segmentation chal- lenges30. Furthermore, they est ablishes open and standardized p rotocols for image acqui- sition, reconstruct ion, and analysis30,31,32. It is expected that these efforts will improve the predictive performance of ra diomic response biomarkers even further. As this was a pilot investigation our analysis had several limi tations. A main limi- tation was the limited sample siz e as we included only 47 patie nts in our analysis. As the data was acquired in a research study, with high quality imagin g data and imaging before and after gefinitib treatment, more data was not available. Als o, we limited our analysis to eleven independent radiomic features. A full radiomic analysis4 , evaluating hundreds of features, could potentially achieve higher performance radiomic biomarkers for gefitinib response, however requires large independent training and valid ation cohorts. Further- more, before clinical application imaging protocols have to be standardized and hence variability in CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters in clinical practice has to be reduced. The Quantitative Imagi ng Biomarker Alliance from the R adiological Society of North America (RSNA) and the QIN play an important role in this process by establishing standards for image acquisition a nd reconstruction , by conducti ng phantom studies, and by performing segmentation challenges. In addition, multiples s tudies have already docu- mented the robustness of radiomic feature extractions in terms of reproducibility and re- peatability in test/re-test settings4,19,27. However, before clinical utility, future studies have to evaluate radiomic biomarkers in independent and prospec tive validation cohorts with large sample sizes, and show improved performance compared to volumetric imaging features. In conclusion, we found that radiomics features are able to def ine a Gefitinib re- sponse phenotype non-invasively, that is able to distinguish be tween tumors with and without EGFR sensitizing mutations at baseline and a quantitati ve change in these radio- mic features at follow up. The use of radiomics based response assessment tools could improve the stratification between sensitive and resistant pati ent populations and the detection of response to treatment. This may provide an opportu nity to improve decision- support at low aditional cost, as imaging is routinely and repe atedly used in clinical prac- https://image s.nature.com/original/nature- assets/srep/2016/160920/srep33860/extref/srep33860-s1.pdf Radiomic response phenotype 127 REFERENCES 1.

Hig hly accurate and reliable machin e-learning approaches can drive the success of radiomic ap plications in clinical care. In this radiomic study, fourteen feature selection methods and twelve classification methods wer e examined in terms of their performance and stability for predicting overall survival . A total of 440 radiomic pre-treatment computed tomography (CT ) images of 464 lung cancer patients. To ensure the unbiased evaluation of different machine-learning meth- ods, publicly available implementa tions along with reported par ameter configurations were used. Furthermore, we used two independent radiomic cohort s for training (n=310 patients) and validation (n=154 patients). We identified that Wilcoxon test based feature selection method WLCX (stability =0.84\u00b10.05, AUC=0.65\u00b10. 02) and a classification method AUC=0.66\u00b10.03) agai nst data perturbation. Our var iability analysis indicated that the choice of classification method is the most dominant s ource of performance vari- ation (34.21% of total variance). Identification of optimal mac hine-learning methods for radiomic applications is a crucial step towards stable and clin ically relevant radiomic bi- omarkers, providing a non-invasive way of quantifying and monit oring tumor-phenotypic characteristics in c linical practice. Machine Learning for radiomics 135 INTRODUCTION 'Precision oncology' refers to the customization of cancer care , where practices and/or therapies are being tailored to individual patients. Such custo mization process can maxim- ize the success of preventive and therapeutic interventions wit h minimum side effects. Most of the precision oncology related research has centered on the molecular characteri- z a t i o n o f t u m o r s u s i n g g e n o m i c s b a s e d a p p r o a c h e s , w h i c h r e q u i r e tissue extraction by tumor biopsies. Although several genomics based approaches have successfully been ap- plied in clinical oncol ogy1, there are inherent limitations to biopsy based assays. Tumors are spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and repeated tumor biopsies, which increase the risk for a patient, are often required to capture the molec ular heterogeneity of tu- mors. These ethical and clinical challenges related to biopsy-b ased assays, can be ad- dressed by medical imaging, which is a routine practice for can cer diagnosis and staging in clinical oncology. Un like biopsies, medical imaging is non-inva sive and can provide infor- mation regarding the entire tumor phenotype, including the intr a-tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, recent advances in h igh-resolution image acquisiti on machines and compu- tational hardware allow the detailed and efficient quantificati on of tumor phenotypic characteristics. Therefore, medi cal imaging provides unpreceden ted opportunities for pre- cision oncology. \"Radiomics\", an emerging and pro mising field, hypothesizes that medical imaging provides crucial information regarding tumor physiology, which could be exploited to en- hance cancer diagnostics2. It provides a comprehensive quantifi cation of tumor pheno- types by extracting and mining large number of quantitative ima ging features3. Several studies have investigated various radiomic features in terms of their prognostic or predic- tive abilities and reliability across different clinical settin gs4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Different studies have shown the discriminating capabilities of radiomic features f o r t h e s t r a t i f i c a t i o n o f tumor histology6, tumor grades o r stages11, and clinical outcom es8,12,13. Moreover, some studies have reported the association between radiomic fea tures and the underlying gene expression patterns8,14,15. \"Machine-learning\" can be broadly defined as computational meth ods/models u s i n g e x p e r i e n c e ( d a t a ) t o i m p r o v e p e r f o r m a n c e o r m a k e a c c u r a t e predictions16. These programmable computational methods are capable of \"learning\" fr om data and hence can automate and improve the prediction process. Predictive and pro gnostic models with high accuracy, reliability, and effici ency are vital factors driving the success of radiomics. There- fore, it is essential to compare different machine-learning mod els for radiomics based clin- also underlies the curse of dimensionality17, which should be addressed by appropr i a t e f e a t u r e s e l e c t i o n strategies. Moreover, feature selection also helps in reducing overfitting of models (in- creasing the generalizability). Thus, in order to reduce the di mensionality of radiomic fea- ture space and enhance the performance of radiomics based predi ctive models, different feature selection methods18 shou ld be thoroughly investigated. However, as radiomics is Chapter 7 136 an emerging research field, most of the published studies have only assessed the predic- tive capabilities of radiomic feat ures without pu tting much emp hasis on the comparison of different feature selection and predictive modeling methods. On ly few recent studies have i n v e s t i g a t e d t h e e f f e c t o f d i f f e r e n t f e a t u r e s e l e c t i o n a n d m a c h ine learning classification methods on radiomics based clinical predictions19,20, but with limited sample sizes. Fur- thermore, these studies lacked independent validation of the re sults, which may restrict the generalizability of their conclusions. In this study, we inve s t i ga t e d a l a r ge p a n e l o f m a ch i n e - l e a r n i n g approaches for radiomics based survival prediction. We evaluated 14 feature se lection methods and 12 classification methods in terms of their predictive performance and stability against data perturbation. These methods were chosen because of their popula rity in literature. Fur- thermore, reporte d parameter configura- tions were used in the analysis, which ensured an unbiased eval uation of these methods. Two independent lung cancer cohorts were used for training and validation, with in total image and clinical outcome data of 464 patients. Feature select ion and predictive model- ing are considered as the import ant building blocks for high th roughput data driven radi- omics. Therefore, our investigat ion could help in the identific ation of optimal machine- learning approaches for radiomics based predictive studies, whi ch could enhance the ap- of radiomics in clin ical oncology. METHODS Radiomic Features A total of 440 radiomic features were used in the analysis. The se radiomic features quanti- fied tumor phenotypic characteristics on CT images and are divi ded into four feature groups: I) tumor intensity, II) shape, III) texture and IV) wav elet features. Tumor intensity based features estimated the first order statistics of the inte nsity histogram, whereas shape features described the 3D geometric properties of the tum or. Textural features, derived from the gray level co-occurrence (GLCM)21 and run leng th matrices (GLRLM)22, by their values over all th irteen directions. Wavelet feat u r e s a r e t h e t r a n s f o r m e d domain representations of the intensity and textural features. These features were com- puted on different wavelet decompositions of the original image u s i n g a co i f l e t w a v e l e t transformation. Matlab R2012b (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) was u sed for the image analysis. Radiomic features were automatically extracted by our in-house developed radi- omics image analysis software, wh ich uses an adapted version of CERR (Computational Environment for Radiotherapy Research)23 and Matlab for the pre processing of medical Machine Learning for radiomics 137 images. Mathematical definitions of all radiomic features, as w ell as the extraction meth- ods, were previously described8. Datasets In this study, we employed two NSCLC cohorts from the two diffe rent institutes of Nether- lands: (1) Lung1:422 NSCLC patients at MAASTRO Clinic n Maastricht. (2) Lung2:225 NSCLC patients treated at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen. CT- scans, manual delineations and c linical data were available for all included patients. More details on the included datasets are described in Supplementary -A. We dichotomized the censored continuous survival data using a cutoff time of 2 year s. The patients who lived beyond the cutoff time were labeled as 1, whereas the deceased ones were labeled as 0. The objective of the study was to stratify patients into these two labeled survival classes. Two-years is considered as a rele vant survival time for NSCLC p atients and several other studies have designed their predic tion models using a survival cutoff of 2 years24 ,25,26. We excluded the patients, which were followed for less than 2 y ears. It resulted in 310 patients in training cohort (Lung1) and 154 patients in validat ion cohort (Lung2). All the features were normalized using Z-score normalization. Feature Selection Methods Fourteen feature selection methods based on filter approaches w ere used in the analysis (Fisher score Mutua l information feature selection (MIFS), Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), Conditional infomax feature extraction (CIFE), Joint mutual information (JMI), Cond itional mutual information maximization (CMIM), Interaction capping (ICAP), Double input s ymmetric relevance (DISR)). In order to improve the readability of this manuscript , we have defined all the ac- ronyms related to feature selection methods in Table 1. We chos e these methods mainly because of their popularity in literature, simplicity and compu tational efficiency. Further- more, publicly available implementations were readily available for these methods27 ,28, which increases their reusability. Filter methods are feature-r anking methods, which rank the features using a scoring crit erion. All filter based featur e selection methods can be divided into two categories: univariate methods and multivariat e methods. In case of uni- variate methods, the scoring criterion only depends on the feat ure relevancy ignoring the feature redundancy, whereas multivariate methods investigate th e multivariate interac- tion within the features and the scoring criterion is a weighte d sum of feature relevancy and redundancy. Feature relevancy is a measure of feature's ass ociation with the tar- get/outcome variable, whereas feature redundancy is the amount of redundancy present in a particular feature with respect to the set of already sele cted features.

The training data consists of a set of exam- ples, where each example is represented as a pair of an input v ector (features) and a de- sired output value (target or category label). The classificati on algorithm (classifier) ana- lyzes the training data and infe rs a hypothesis (function), whi ch can be used for predicting the labels of unseen observation s. Many classifiers belonging t o different areas of com- puter science and statistics have been proposed in machine-lear ning literature29. In our study, we used 12 machine-learn ing classifiers arising from 12 classifier families (Bagging (BAG), Bayesian (BY), Boosting ( BST), Decision trees (DT), Disc riminant analysis (DA), Gen- eralized linear models (GLM), Multiple Nearest neigh- bors (NN), Neural networks component regres- sion (PLSR), Random forests (RF), and Support machines ( SVM)). The acronyms re- lated to classifiers are defined in Table 1. All classifiers we re implemented using R package caret30, which provides a nice interface to access many machine -learning algorithms in R. Furthermore, it also provides a user-friendly framework for tra ining different machine- learning models. Classifiers were trained using the repeated (3 repeat iterations) 10 fold cross validation of training cohort (Lung1) and their predictiv e performance was evaluated in the validation cohort (Lung2) using area under ROC curve (AU C). We used parameter configurations that were previously defined by Fernandez-Delgad o et al. 31 in a compre- hensive comparative study of 179 classifiers and 121 different datasets. We have listed the classification methods along with their parameters and corr esponding R packages in Supplementary-C online. ANALYSIS Predictive Performance of Featur e Selection and Classification Methods In order to investigate and compare different feature selection and classification methods, we created a three-dimensional parameter grid for the analysis. For each of the 14 feature selection methods, we incrementally selected features ranging f rom 5 up to 50, with an increment of 5 features (n=5, 10, 15, 20, ... , 50). These subs ets of selected features were then evaluated by using each of the 12 machine-learning classif iers and area under ROC curves (AUC). Chapter 7 140 Stability of Feature Selection and Classification Methods In order to assess the stability of feature selection methods, we used a stability measure proposed by Yu et al. 32 under the hard data perturbation settings33. We quantified t he stability of a method as the similarity between the results obt ained by the same feature selection method, when applied on the two non-overlapping parti tions (of size N/2) of the training cohort (Lung1). To compute similarity between the two resultant feature sets, a weighted complete bipartite graph was constructed, where the tw o node sets corre- sponded to the two sets of selected features. The edge weights were assigned as the ab- solute Spearman correlation coefficient between the features at the nodes. We then ap- plied the Hungarian algorithm34 to identify the maximum weighte d matching between the two node sets, and then similarity (stability) was quantifi ed as the final matching cost. For each feature selection metho d, we computed the stability 10 0 times using a bootstrap approach and reported the median\u00b1std values in the results. The empirical stability of a classifier was quantified using th e relative standard deviation (RSD %) and a bootstrap approach. We first selected 3 0 representative features using the Wilcoxon based feature selection method WLCX and used them to compute the classifier stability. For each classification method, we traine d the model on the subsam- p l e d t r a i n i n g c o h o r t ( s i z e N / 2 ) a n d v a l i d a t e d t h e p e r f o r m a n c e o n the validation cohort using AUC. Subsampling of the training cohort was done 100 time s using a bootstrap ap- proach. RSD is the absolute value of the coefficient of variati on and is often expressed in percentage. Here, it was defined as where and were the standard deviation and mean of the 100 AUC v a l u e s respectively. It should be noted that higher stability in the c ase of classifiers corresponds to lower RSD values. Stability and Predictive Performance In order to identify the highly reliable and accurate methods, we used the median values of AUC and stability as thresholds. We created two rank lists b ased on AUC & stability and cited the methods as highly accurate and reliable, which ranked in the top half of both the ranked lists. Feature selection methods having stability 0.735 (median stability of all fea- ture selection methods) and AUC0.615 (median AUC of all feat ure selection methods) are considered as highly reliable and accurate methods. Similar ly, classification methods having RSD5.97 (median RSD of all classifiers) and AUC0.6 1 (median AUC of all classi- fiers) are considered as highly reliable and accurate ones. Machine Learning for radiomics 141 Experimental Factors Affecting the Radiomics Based Survival Pre diction There are three main experimental factors, which can potentiall y affect the prediction of radiomics based survival prediction: feature selection method, classification method and the number of selected features. Multifactor ANOVA was used to quantify the variability in AUC scores contributed by these factors and their interactio ns. In order to compare the variability contributed by each f actor, the estimated variance components were divided by the total variance. All the analysis was done using R software (R Core Team, Vienna , Austria) version 3.1.2 and Matlab R2012b (The Mat hworks, Natick, MA) with Window s 7. RESULTS To investigate the machine-learn i n g a p p r o a c h e s f o r p r o g n o s t i c r adiomic biomarkers, a total of 440 radiomic features were extracted from the segmente d tumor regions of the pre-treatment CT images of two independent NSCLC cohorts. Featu re selection and classi- fication training was done using the training cohort Lung1 (n= 310 patients), whereas the validation cohort Lung2 (n=154 patients) was used to assess t he predictive performance [see Fig. 1]. Figure 1 A total of 440 radiomic features were extracted from the segme nted tumor regions of the pre-treatment CT im- ages of 464 NSCLC patients. Feature selection and classificatio n training was done using the training cohort Lung1 (n=310), whereas Lung2 (n=154) cohort was used as a validat ion cohort. Chapter 7 142 Predictive Performance of the Fe ature Selection and Classificat ion Methods Predictive performance of different feature selection and class ification methods was as- sessed using the area under receiver operator characteristic cu rve (AUC). Figure 2 depicts the performance of feature selec tion (in rows) and classificati on methods (in columns) using 30 selected features, which are the 30 top ranked feature s, resulted in feature selec- tion. For each classification method, there are 14 AUC values c orresponding to the 14 dif- ferent feature selection methods. We used a median of all 14 AU C values as a representa- tive AUC of a classifier. Similarly, for each feature selection method, a median of 12 AUCs (corresponding to 12 classification methods) is used as a repre sentative AUC. These repre- sentative AUC values for the classification and feature selecti on methods are given in Table 2. For classification me thods, random forest (RF) decision tr ee (DT) (AUC: 0.54\u00b10.04) showed the lowest predictive performance. As far as feature sel ection methods are con- cerned, the Wilcoxon test based method showed had the lowest median AUCs. We repeated the above experiment by varying the number of selected features (range 5-50). Results corresponding to 10, 20, 40 and 50 representa- tive (top ranked) features are reported in Supplementary Figure s S1, S2, S3 and S4 online. Furthermore, median AUC values over each of the experimental fa ctors (feature selection methods, classification methods and number of selected features ) are depicted by the heatmaps in Supplementary Figures S5, S6 and S7 online. Here as well, random forest (RF) (classifier) and Wilcoxon test based method WLCX (feature selec tion) showed highest me- dian AUCs in majority of cases. Stability of the Feature Selecti on and Classifica tion Methods We assessed the feature selection methods in terms of their sta bility against data resampling using the hard data pe rturbation settings33. We obse rved that low stability [Table 2]. Empirical stability of classification methods was quantified us ing the relative standard de- viation (RSD) and a bootstrap approach. We observed that BY was the most stable classifi- cation method ( 3 . 5 2 % ) . B S T h a d t h e h i g h e s t r e l a t i v e s t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n in AUC scores (RSD=8.23%) and hence the lowe st stability among the classifi cation methods. RSD (%) values corresponding to all 12 c lassifiers are reported in Tabl e 2.

It can be observed that RF, BAG and BY classification methods and feature selection methods WLCX, MRMR and MIFS shows relatively h igh predictive performance in m any cases.

It can be observed that feature be preferred as their stability and predictive performance was higher than the corresponding me dian values across all feature selection methods (stab ility=0.735, AUC=0.615). Sim ilarly for stability and predictive performance was higher than the corresponding median values (RSD=5.93%, AUC=0.61).

Machine Learning for radiomics 145 Experimental Factors Affecting the Radiomics Based Survival Pre diction To quantify the effects of the three experimental factors (feat ure selection methods, clas- sification methods and the number of selected features), we per formed multifactor analy- sis of variance (ANOVA) on AUC that all thr ee experimental parame- ters and their interactions are the significant factors affecti ng the prediction performance [Fig. 4]. Classification method was the most dominant source of variability as it explained 34.21% of the total variance in AU C scores. Feature selection a ccounted for the 6.25%, whereas interaction of classifier & feature selection explained 23.03% of the total varia- tion. Size of the selected (representative) feature subset only shared 1.65% of the total variance [Fig. 4]. Figure 4 Variation of AUC explained by the experimental factors and thei r interactions. It can be observed that classifica- tion method was the most dominant source of variability. Size o f the selected (representative) feature subset shared the least of the total variance. DISCUSSION Medical imaging is a routinely used and easily accessible sourc e of information in clinical oncology. It serves as a non-inv asive and cost-effective cancer diagnostic tool. Radiomics employs the medical imaging data for the customization of cance r care and hence adds a Chapter 7 146 new and promising dimension to precision oncology2,3,8 . M o r e o v e r , i t c a n a l s o c a p t u r e the intra-tumor heterogeneity, w hich is often considered as an important biomarker in oncology12,35,36,37. A number of studies have built radiomics based predictive m odels for various clinical factors (tu mor grades, survival outcomes, treatment response, etc.)12. For the successful realization of radiomics based predictive an alyses, it is required to eval- uate and compare different feature selection and predictive mod eling methods, which was the primary object ive of this study. Various feature selection methods have been employed for high-t hroughput data mining problems38. In general, feature selection methods are ca tegorized into three main categories: (1) filter methods (2) wrapper methods and (3) embe dded methods. In this study, we investigated 14 differe nt filter based approaches for r a d i o m i c s b a s e d s u r v i v a l prediction. We only used filter-based approaches because they a re computationally more efficient and less prone to overfitting than the wrapper and em bedded methods18,27. Furthermore, unlike wrapper and embedded methods, filter method s are classifier inde- pendent. Thus, they allow separation of the modeling and featur e selection component of the predictive analysis, which increases the generalizability o f each component and hence the overall analysis. We also investigated 12 machine-learning classification methods belonging to 12 different classifier families. Many classifiers have been propo sed in the machine-learning literature. Theoretically speaking, these classifiers belong to different fields (classifier families) of computer science and statistics. Therefore, it cou ld really be difficult to under- stand the underlying assumptions of each and every classifier a nd tune the parameters in an unbiased manner. The parameter tuning could be biased by use r's more (or lack of) expertise with some classifiers over the others. Usually, the s tudies, which propose a new classifier, only compare it to the reference classifiers of sam e family excluding the other classifier families. Even if classifiers belonging to different families are considered for comparison, these reference classifiers are usually implemented using simple tools and with limited parameter configura tions while carefully tuning th e proposed classifier. These could consequently bias the resu lts in favor of the proposed cl assifiers31. In our study, we are not proposing any new classifier and we have used the same implementation tool (R package caret) for all the classifiers. Furthermore, to ensure unbiased usage of classifiers, we used parameter configurations that were previously defined b y Fernandez-Delgado et al.31, in an exhaustive study of comparing 179 classifiers over 12 1 different datasets. These parameter configurations were selected from the literatur e and have been previ- ously validated on a large number (121) of datasets belonging t o different fields. Further- more, in our study, the parameters were tuned using the repeate d cross validation of training data only. Hence, our experimental design allowed us t o evaluate different classi- fication methods in an unbiased manner. Our results show that the Wilcoxon test based feature selection method WLCX yields the highest predictive performance with the majority of classifiers. Interestingly, WLCX is a simple univariate method based on ranks, which does n ot take into account the Machine Learning for radiomics 147 redundancy of selected features during feature ranking. The maj ority of feature selection methods gave highest predictive performance when used with the random forest (RF) classifier. One could argue that with different parameter confi gurations, the performance of classification methods may impr ove further. An exhaustive pa rameter tuning could be investigated for evaluating the improvement of prediction perfo rmance. However, the required computational resources and high time complexity can h inder the exhaustive search. We expect that future radiomic studies focusing on diff erent clinical outcomes and similar analysis framework could provide better understanding i n t h i s r e g a r d . A l i m i t e d number of methods, which are con sistently high performing acros s different radiomic studies, could be further assessed with an exhaustive parameter tuning. Nevertheless, It should be noted that random forests (RF) have displayed high pr edictive performance in several other biomedical and other domain applications as well3 1. These results indicate that choosing the WLCX feature selection method and/or RF class ification method in- creases predictive performance in radiomics. Results related to our stability analysis provide another dimen sion for choosing the feature selection and classif ication methods. Depending upo n the applications, one may give importance to the predictive performance or stability and accordingly opt for the required method. Results related to multifactor ANOVA indicated that the classification method is the most dominant source of variation in the predicti on performance (AUC) and hence should be chosen carefully. Size of the selected feature subset contributed the least in the total variation of AUC. Only few studies have investigated and compared different featu re selection and machine-learning modeling methods for radiomics based clinical predictions19,20. Recent- ly, Hawkins et al. 19 have compared four different feature selection and classific ation methods for CT based survival prediction of NSCLC patients. Thi s study, however, was lim- ited by the small cohort size as the final results were obtaine d on only 40 patients. Fur- thermore, it also lacked an independent validation of the resul t s . O n t h e c o n t r a r y , t w o independent radiomic cohorts of sizes 310 and 154 patients were used in our analysis and an independent validation of the results was reported. Our radiomic analysis is focused on the prediction of two-year patient survival in NSCLC patients. It provides an unbiased evaluation of different machine-learning methods of feature selection and classification. It could be considered as a reference for the future radiomics based predictive studies. Our results indicated that choosing Wilcoxon test based feature selection method WLCX and/or random forest (RF) c lassification method gives highest performance for radiomics based survival predicti on. Furthermore, these methods also turned out reasonably stable against data perturba t i o n a n d h e n c e t h e y could be preferred for radiomics based predictive studies. Thes e results should be further tested in other radiomics based predictive studies, with differ ent imaging modalities and in different cancer types. It has been previously shown that for NSCLC patients, statistic al models based on patient's tumor and treatment ch aracteristics provide significa ntly better predictions than Chapter 7 148 the human expert24. Moreover, several other studies have highli ghted the limitation of doctors' prognostic capability fo r terminally ill cancer patien ts39,40,41. The predictions of human experts can suffer from inter-observer variability. On th e contrary, statistical mod- els could make the prediction system more deterministic if the parameter configurations and the training framework are fixed. The potential clinical utility of radiomics based prognostic mo dels has been stat- ed in previous study8. With expanding radiomics cohorts and fea ture dimensions, we ex- pect higher prediction performance in future radiomic studies. Furthermore, the integra- tive studies like radiomics-genomics in combination with standa rd clinical covariates could also improvise the prediction performance and further validate the utility of these meth- ods in clinical practice. Overa ll, our analysis is a step forwa rd towards the enhancements of radiomics based clinical predictions.

In this study we assessed if pre-treatment radiomics d a t a a r e a b l e t o p r e d i c t p a t h o l o g i c a l r e s p o n s e a f t e r n e o a d j u v a n t chemoradiation in pa- tients with locally advanced non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . Materials and methods 127 NSCLC patients were included in this study. Fifteen radiomi c features selected based on stability and variance were evaluated for its power to predi ct pathological response. Predictive power was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) . Conventional imaging features (tumor volume and diameter) were used for comparison. Results Seven features were predictive for pathologic gross residual di sease (AUC > 0.6, p-value < 0.05), and one for pathologic complete response (AUC = 0.63, p- value = 0.01). No conven- tional imaging features were predictive (range AUC = 0.51-0.59, p-value > 0.05). Tumors that did not respond well to neoadjuvant chemoradiation were mo re likely to present rounder shape (spherical disproportionality, AUC = 0.63, p-valu e = 0.009) and heterogene- ous texture (LoG 5 mm 3D - GLCM entropy, AUC = 0.61, p-value = 0.03). Conclusions We identified predictive radiomic features for pathological res ponse, although no conven- tional features were significantly predictive. This study demon strates that radiomics can provide valuable clinical information, and performed better tha n conventional imaging features. Keywords Radiomics - pathological respons e - NSCLC - tative imaging Pathological response 153 INTRODUCTION Radiomics is an emerging field of quantitative imaging that aim s to describe tumors non- invasively using a large set of a dvanced imaging features [1-3] . These features can robust- ly create a unique phenotypic atlas for each tumor [4-6]. Assoc iating clinical information to this atlas has enabled the id entification of new, reproducib le, image-based biomarkers which has been prognostic for c ll survival [7-9] and dis- tant metastasis [10]. Association was found with lung cancer pa tients of histology and stage [11] as well. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide [12 ]. Stage IIIA non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be treated using trimodality therapy that includes neo- adjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery according to NCCN g uidelines [13]. Howev- er, trimodality therapy is controversial, given the observed la ck of survival benefit in add- ing surgery compared to definitive chemoradiation alone, [14,15 ] which underscores the importance of identifying patients who respond completely to ch emoradiation and do not require additional invasive local therapy. Pathological response is a direct measure of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation assessed at time of surgery. It has the potentia l to be used as a surrogate endpoint [16] for survival/local control and has been shown to be prognostic for survival in early [17] and advanced [18] stages for NSCLC patients. Predict ing pathological response at an early time point would allow modification of the treatmen t regimen (e.g. adding sur- gery versus intensifying chemora diation) based on how the tumor is likely to respond and this adaptive approach could i mprove patient outcomes. Currently, tumor response is c linically assessed using RECIST [ 19], which classifies changes in the sum of tumor and lymph nodes diameters on CT ima ges before and after therapy. However, the radiographi c response to chemoradiation f or NSCLC tumors may be slow [20], which may limit the utility of RECIST in predicting pathological response at the end of the neoadjuvant chemoradiation shortly before surgery, a nd hence allow very little margin for clinicians to adapt th e treatment regimen consequent ly. In this study we investigated the power of pre-treatment CT-bas ed radiomic We compared these results to conventional vo lumetric features such as tumor volume and diameter. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient selection Patients with stage II-III NSCLC treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between 2001 and 2013 who were treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemoth erapy (chemoradia- tion) prior to surgical resection were included in this study. Patients with distant metasta- sis at presentation or delay in surgery greater than 120 days a f t e r t h e c o m p l e t i o n o f Chapter 8 154 chemoradiation were excluded. For all patients, CT imaging at t he initiation of chemoradi- ation and prior to surgical rese ction was available. No exclusi on based on histology was applied. A subset of patients received adjuvant therapy and was also included in this anal- ysis. Finally, a total of 127 patients were included for this s tudy. Follow-up and endpoints The main endpoint for this study was pathological response asse ssed at time of surgery. The amount of residual tumor was classified based on surgical p athology reports as patho- logic complete response (pCR), microscopic residual disease (MR D) or gross residual dis- ease (GRD). Percent residual tumo r in the pathological sample w as not available for this study. Three other clinical endpoints were included for this st udy including overall survival (OS), distant metastasis (DM) and in-field local recurrence (LR ). The time associated with the endpoint was defined from treatment start date to date of f irst event. The last date of follow-up was used for patients with no events. Follow-up chest CT scans with contrast (unless the patient had a contraindication to contrast, e.g. renal dysfunct ion or allergy) were performed every three to six months after treatment for patients at our institution based on US nat ional guidelines [13] to as- sess tumor progression. CT Acquisition and Segmentation Planning CTs were acquired according to scanning protocol at ou r institution using GE \"lightspeed\" CT scanner (GE Medi cal System, Milwaukee, WI, USA) . Tumor segmentation was performed on radiation the rapy planning CTs using Eclipse ( Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The primary tumor site was retrospectively contoured guided by exist- ing treatment planning contours.

B) All images were sub- sequently resampled and from those contours the radiomic featur es describing tumor phenotype were extracted using three feature groups: Shape, Statistic and Textural featu res, with and without Wavelet and Laplacian of Gaussian filtering. C) Finally, association between radiomic fe atures and the clinical outcomes were investigated for image-based biomarkers discovery. Features Extraction and Selection Radiomic features describing tumor phenotype were extracted (m= 1603) from the prima- ry tumor site with an in-house M atlab 2013 (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States) toolbox and the software 3D Slicer 4.4.0 [21] and was 3\u00d73\u00d73mm3 prior to feature extraction to have standardized voxel spacing across the co- hort. A bin width of 25 Hounsfield units (HU) was used for text ural features. All features are described in the supplement of a previous study [10]. Fifteen Radiomic features were selected based on stability and variance for this study (features selection is described in Supplement I). Additi onally, we defined three conventional, pre-treatment, clin ically fe atures for comparison to ad- vanced phenotypic features prior chemoradiation. These features consisted of tumor vol- u m e , 2 D a x i a l m a x i m a l d i a m e t e r a n d 3 D m a x i m a l d i a m e t e r . 2 D a x i a l maximal diameter corresponds to the greatest diame ter in the axial plane. 3D max imal diameter refers to the greatest diameter in any direction.

Chapter 8 156 Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were done on R software [22] version 3 .1.3. Predictive performance of these remaining features were assessed using the \"survcomp\" package [23,24] version 1.16 from Bioconductor [25]. We computed receiver operating cha racteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for binary outcomes. Predictive power was reported as proportion- al or disproportionate to the risk of experiencing the response as the feature value is in- creasing. Difference for clinical categorie s was assessed using chi-squar e or two-sided Wil- coxon-test respectively for categorical or continuous variables . Noether test was used to consider AUC significance from 0 .5 (random). Survival and disea se-free probability curve were computed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A three year estimat e was reported for the analysis. Log-rank test was used to assess difference in probab ility curves between patho- logical response groups. A p-value below 0.05 was considered as significant. Features with an AUC above 0.60 and a p-value below 0.05 were considered pred ictive. Multivariate models were made u sing logistic regression for pat hological re- sponse using the same subgroup fo r the univariate analysis to c ompare their performance. Three models were created with 1) Conventional (volume and axia l/3D diameters), 2) Ra- diomics (predictive features for 3) Combined (Conventi onal + radiomics) fea- tures. We compare model validation AUC using the cross valida- tion (CV). The cohort was split, using 80% for training and 20% for validation for each CV (for each 100 iterations). Patients were randomized using a con servative random split us- ing the \"caret\" package [26]. Difference between the CV models performance was done using a permutation test. The outcome labels were randomly resa mpled (k=1000 times) and a new CV was computed for each random label combination.

Significant difference s were found between over- all stages (p-value= 0.02) and h istology (p-value < 0.001), lik ely driven by the fact that the distribution is skewed for hist ology and overall stage.

We fir st determined if radiomic features could identify tumors likely to respond poorl y (GRD) vs. tumors likely to respond well (pCR and MRD) to the chemoradiation (Figure 2.A). The fifteen selected ad- vanced imaging features had an AUC of 0.53 to 0.66 for GRD (des cribed in Table S2 in Sup- plement II). Seven features were significantly predictive (rang e AUC 0.61-0.66, p-value <0.05) for GRD. From those seven predictive features, two were risk proportionate as the feature value increases (GLCM entropy and stats root mean squar e) and intensity histogram, spheri cal disproportionality and two GLSZM large area emphasis) to experience GRD. No convention al volumetric imaging features were significant from random or above at the threshold of AUC > 0.6 (range 0.57 to 0.59, p-value >0.05) and all were disproportionate to the ri sk of GRD.

Features reported with a \"*\" are significant from ran dom (Noether test, p-value <0.05). Legend colors indicates feature group.

T h e A U C r a n g e o f radiomic features (Figure 2.B) was 0.52-0.63 and 0.51-0.55 for conventional featu res (described in Table S3 in Supplement II). The best performing radiomic feature, Wavele t HLL mean, was also the only significantly predictive feature (AUC = 0.63, p-value = 0. 01, Noether test) and was risk proportional. No conventional imaging features were predictive for pCR (range 0.51 to 0.55, all p-value>0.05). Multivariate models were created f o r e a c h s e t o f f e a t u r e s ( F i g u re 3), including conventional (3 features), radiomics (7 predictive features for GRD) and the resulting combined set (10 features). The median AUC values of the cross validation were 0.57, 0.65 and 0.65 for GRD and 0.60, 0.61 and 0.68 for pCR respectively f or conventional, radiomics and combined models. The combined and radiomics model for GRD p erformed significant- ly better on the cross validatio n compare to clinical features alone. For pCR, no significant difference was found between radiomics and conventional model p erformance. However, the combined model significantly outperformed both radiomics an d conventional features for predication of pCR.

Chapter 8 162 DISCUSSION Radiomics [1] is an emerging field of quantitative imaging that aims to extract phenotypic tumor information from clinical imaging data. In this study we demonstrate the predictive power of radiomic phenotypic features for pathological response in patients with NSCLC. Pathological response is a standard endpoint, assessed at time o f s u r g e r y f o r a d i r e c t measure of neoadjuvant chemotherapy effect. Pathologic response was significantly asso- ciated with clinical outcomes in our study (distant metastasis and local recurrence) show- ing the importance of predicting pathological outcome. Using da ta mining techniques, we selected fifteen radiomics featu res based on stability and vari ance. From those features, we identify seven features predictive of pathological gross res idual disease (GRD) and one feature predictive of pathological complete responders (pCR). I n contrast, no pre- treatment conventional clinically utilized features (volume or diameter) were predictive for pathological response. Lastly, the radiomics model also per formed significantly better on a cross validation than the conventional model for GRD. A co mbined model using con- ventional and radiomics outperformed for pCR. The seven significant predictive features for GRD enabled us to represent pheno- typic characteristics of a lung tumor that is less likely to re spond to neoadjuvant chemora- diation. Spherical disproportionality (a measure of the similar ity between the tumor and a sphere with an equivalent volume) of the primary tumor site was associated with patho- logical response (AUC above 0.6 for both GRD and pCR). Remarkab l y, more complex tu- mors are likely to be associated with pCR while more spherical tumors are more likely to be associated with GRD. In comparison, conventional radiographi c features such as vol- ume and diameter were not predictive for pathological response (neither pCR nor GRD), and may not capture sufficient shape information as advanced sh ape radiomic features. It is noteworthy that larger tumor dimension (both volume and diam eter) appeared to be associated with pCR. Tumor with large flat zones (area of conne cting voxels of similar in- tensity) were associated with pC R whereas tumor with rich compl ex patterns (heterogene- ities) were associated with GRD. Finally based on the common si gnificant predictor for both pCR and GRD (Wavelet HLL - mean) indicated that tumor with o v e r a l l l o w e r v o x e l intensity (darker) were associated with GRD after Wavelet HLL f complem entary information for pCR (significantly greater performance for the combined mod el) and outperformed conventional features alone for GRD. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating patholog ical response to ne- oadjuvant chemoradiation using ad vanced quantitative imaging fe atures from CT images. A previous study from Ravanelli et al. [28] investigated response of first line of chemo- t h e r a p y ( w i t h n o c o n c u r r e n t r a d i a t i o n t h e r a p y o r s u r g e r y ) f o r p atients with advanced NSCLC using two textural features (uniformity and grey-level) f rom contrast enhanced CT images. They found an AUC of 0.74 for their multivariate model (Leave one out cross vali- dation). Conventional features (tumor volume and diameters) hav e been identified as a Pathological response 163 prognostic factor in prior studies [29-31]. However patients in those reports did not re- ceive surgical resection as part of their therapy as did patien ts in our study. Conventional features may thus be more relevant as a prognostic factor in th e absence of surgical inter- vention. Additionally, we did not find any significant associat ion between radiomics and clinical outcomes, supporting the idea that surgical resection of the tumor undermines image-based features prediction for clinical outcomes. We belie ve that the underlying tu- mor phenotype may be more relevan t for identifying pathologic r esponse than either vol- ume or diameter, although these may remain valuable for assessi ng response to therapy. Other studies [32,33] investigated the association of conventio nal features (tumor vol- ume) but demonstrated lack of correlation between measured tumo r volume change and pathologic response in NSCLC, supporting the fact that none of our conventional features were significant. Limitations of this study includ e the cohort size (n=127). Due to a large number of available radiomic features and concern for multiple testing, d imension reduction was used with restrictive criteria to perform drastic selection, th erefore excluding potential predictive features for any clin ical outcomes. However despite this very restrictive data- driven approach selection (about 1% remaining after), we were a ble to find predictive fea- tures. Additionally, the incidence of pCR (n = 27) was much low er than GRD (n = 67), po- tentially explaining the differences in the predictive power fo r pathological complete re- sponse. Since the study period was conducted over 12 years, we recognize that there is heterogeneity in the treatments delivered to the patient cohort . However, we did not find any association between radiation dose, cycles of chemotherapy or other treatment char- acteristics and pathologic respo nse. Th e resul ts pres ented remai n valid despite treatment heterogeneity. A major limitation of radiomic s is the lack of standardi- zation in image acquisition that w ithout access to raw images i s difficult to control and hence standardize patient cohorts. Yet, despite the noise intro duced by variation in acqui- sition protocols, radiomic models have shown consistent and rep roducible association with outcomes in multiple independent datasets [7,8,9-11]. using [34] test / retest dataset and we resampled of imaging using a commo n pixel spacing (3\u00d73\u00d73mm3) to limit variability across patients. Finally, we ac knowledge the limitations of the clinical applicability of th is study. This study was initia ted to find potential patterns in tumor phenotype that could predi ct pathological response prior to the start of therapy. Although several features were significantly predictive for pat hological endpoints, we were unable to identify subgroups associated with overall survi val, local recurrence or dis- tant metastatis using radiomic features. Despite the need for f urther validation sets, this study provides a basis for additional research (e.g using PET-C T features) that could im- prove performance. We believe such radiomics based analyses can be used as a comple- mentary method of patient stratification for NSCLC prior to the initiation of therapy as is currently being investigated in other disease sites such as bre ast [35,36], colorectal cancer [37], and glioblastoma [38]. Chapter 8 164 In conclusion, we identified CT- based radiomic features predict ive for pathologi- cal response in patient with loc ally advanced NSCLC who previou sly received trimodality therapy. This study demonstrates that radiomics can provide add itional phenotypic infor- mation that may reflect underlying tumor sensitivity to chemora diation. Predicting patho- logical response prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemoradiat ion has significant potential clinical applications such as dev eloping adaptive therapy based on pre-treatment tumor phenotype. These radiomic features which can be captured from c linically-available imag- ing modalities performed better than conventionally reported me trics. HIGHLIGHTS Early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation is c rucial for improv- ing overall treatment and patient outcomes. This study demonstrated an associ ation between Radiomic feature s and patho- logical response for lung cancer patients.

Aerts *These authors contribut ed equally to this work Chapter 9 168 ABSTRACT Background and Purpose Radiomics provides opportunities to quantify the tumor phenotyp e non-invasively by ap- plying a large number of quantitative imaging features. This st udy evaluates computed- tomography (CT) radiomic features for their capability to predi ct distant metastasis (DM) for lung adenocarcinoma patients. Materials and Methods We included two datasets: 98 patients for discovery and 84 for validation. The phenotype of the primary tumor was quantified on pre-treatment CT-scans u sing 635 radiomic fea- the concordance index Thirty-five radiomic features were found to be prognostic (CI > 0.60, FDR < 5%) for DM and twelve for survival. It is noteworthy t hat t umor volume was onl y moderately prognostic for DM (CI=0.55, p-value=2.77 \u00d7 105) in the discovery cohort. A radiomic-signature had strong power for predicting DM in the independent validation da taset (CI=0.61, p- value=1.79 \u00d71017). Adding this radiomic-signature to a clinical model resulted in a signifi- cant improvement of predicting DM in the validation dataset (p- value=1.56 \u00d7 1011). Conclusions Although only basic metrics are routinely quantified, this stud y shows that radiomic fea- tures capturing detailed information of the tumor phenotype can be used as a prognostic biomarker for clinically-relevan t factors such as DM. Moreover, the radiomic-signature provided additional information to clinical data. Radiomics predicts distant metastasis 169 INTRODUCTION Lung cancer is the most deadly cancer worldwide for both men an d women[1]. Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer (85-90% of all lung can- cers) and adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype (about 40% of all lung cancers) of NSCLC. Patients with locally advanced (stage II-III) lung adeno carcinomas are typically treated with combined modality therapy including chemotherapy w ith local therapy in- cluding radiation therapy and/or surgery, but overall survival remains low due to a high risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis (DM) after trea t m e n t . D e s p i t e t h e u s e o f concurrent chemotherapy with local therapy, the incidence of DM after combined modali- ty therapy is as high as 30-40% in prospective trials [2-4]. Ho wever, large randomized tri- als studying consolidation chemotherapy after concurrent chemot herapy and radiation therapy have not shown improvement in overall survival with add itional chemothera- py[5, 6] likely because there wa s no selection of patients at t he highest risk of DM. There- fore, developing better biomarkers to predict patients at highe st risk for DM may help identify sub-groups who benefit f rom intensification of systemi c therapy and is crucial for improving outcomes. Due to recent technological advances in medical imaging it is p ossible to capture tumor phenotypic characteristics non-invasively. The most widel y used imaging modality is Computed-Tomography (CT), which can quantify tissue density. In lung cancer, CT imaging is routinely used for patient man agement, including diagnosis, radiation treatment plan- ning and surveillance. Tumor phenotypic differences (e.g. shapes irregularity, infiltr ation, heterogeneity or necrosis) can be images using radiomic feat ures. Radiomics [7-9] aims to provide a comprehensive quantification of the tumor phenotyp e by analyzing robustly [10-12] a large set of quantitative data characterization algor ithms . Biomarkers based on quantitative features have demonstrated strong prognostic perfo rmance across a range of cancer types and investigators have reported that these feature s are associated with clini- cal outcomes and underlying genom ic patterns [13-26]. Radiomics has significant clinical potential, as it can be applied to routinely acquired medical i maging data at low costs. In this manuscript we present a r adiomic analysis to identify b iomarkers of DM in patients treated with chemoradiation (chemoRT) for locally adva nced lung adenocarcino- ma. In a discovery dataset, we extracted 635 radiomics features t o i d e n t i f y t h e o p t i m a l features for predicting metasta sis. Only a limited number of fe atures with high perfor- mance for predicting DM were tested in the independent validati on dataset. We evaluat- ed the ability of radiomic features to predict DM or overall su rvival, and how these fea- tures compare with basic metrics (e.g. volume, diameter) as pro gnostic factors [27-30]. Chapter 9 170 MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient characteristics This study is an Institutional Review Board-approved analysis o f CT for treatment simula- tion from North-American NSCLC patients receiving chemoRT at ou r institution from 2001 to 2013. We limited the patient population to pathologically-co nfirmed lung adenocarci- noma with locally advanced disease (overall stage II-III)[30]. Patients with surgery or chemotherapy before the scheduled radiation therapy planning CT d a t e w e r e e x c l u d e d from the study. Patients treated before July 2009 were included in the discovery Dataset1 (n=98), and after July 2009 in an independent validation Datase t2 (n=84). In total 182 pa- tients were include d in our analysis. Clinical endpoints Patients were followed up every three to six months after treat ment, and surveillance chest CT scans with contrast (unless patient's contraindication , e . g. a l l e r gy o r r e n a l d ys - function) were performed to asse ss treatment response or tumor progression based on US national guidelines (NCCN). T he primary endpoint of this stu dy was distant metastasis (DM), which was defined as progr ession of disease to other orga ns as assessed in surveil- lance scans, and time to DM was defined as time from start of r adiation to date of DM or censoring (date of last scan). O verall survival was analyzed as a secondary endpoint, and was defined as the time between the start of radiation treatmen t and last day of follow up or date of death. Clinical variables The conventional clinical prognostic factors (CPFs) used for th is study included tumor grade (1-Well differentiated, 2-Moderately differentiated, 3-Po orly differentiated and 4- Not Oncology Group (ECOG) perfo rmance status (PS)[31], TNM stage per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) sta ging system (7 th edition)[30]; CT-based measurem ents commonly utilized in the c linic (e.g. tumor vol- ume and maximal tumor diameter measured on single axial slice), and treatment charac- teristics. Sub-group analyses of clinical variables were perfor med (e.g. overall stage II vs IIIA vs IIIB) and can be found i n Table S1 (Supplement II.1). CT acquisition and segmentation Planning CT was performed according to standard clinical scanni ng protocols at our insti- tution with a GE \"LightSpeed\" CT scanner (GE Medical System, Mi lwaukee, WI, USA). The most common pixel spacing was (0 .93mm, 0.93mm, 2.5mm) for CT. T he primary lung tu-Radiomics predicts distant metastasis 171 mor was delineated manually on Ec lipse (Varian Medical System, P a l o A l t o , C A , U S A ) . I t was first contoured in the abdomen window to identify the bound aries with the chest wall or other soft tissues, then in the lung window to capture the m aximum extent in the lung parenchyma. All contours were re viewed by an experienced radiat ion oncologist (R.H.M). Radiomic features extraction Radiomic features have the capacity to capture tumor phenotype differences by examin- ing a large set of quantitative features (Figure 1). The featur e extraction was performed in MATLAB 2013b (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) using an in-house dev eloped toolbox run- ning on the Computational Environment for Radiotherapy Research (CERR)[32]. DICOMs files (CT images + tumor contours) to e xtract the radiomic fea- tures. The radiomic features set included is described in detai l in the Supplement I. Figure 1 A) Differences between lung primary tumors with a same histology a re apparent on CT images (3D model on the right and CT contours on the left). CT images of primary tumors contain critical information that can be used to predict outcomes or assess the RT treatment response. B) To quantify this information, a large set of features (m=635) is used to capture the tumor phenotype. It includes 1| intensity, 2| shape and 3| texture based features. Also, A| Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and B| Wavelet filtered fe atures were investigated. C) The final step is to link radiomic information to clinical data. Chapter 9 172 Feature selection Feature selection for the radiomic signature was performed with the minimum redundan- cy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm implemented in the mRMRe[ package ver- in R. The mRMR algorithm is an entropy based feature selection method, which starts by calculating the mutual information (MI) between a set of features and an out- come variable. MRMR ranks the in put features by maximizing the MI with respect to out- come and minimizing the average MI of higher ranked features. H ere, survival objects as implemented in R with \"Survcomp\" package[34] were used as outco me to select comple- mentary features with respect to DM or survival. Among available clinical covariates, those with p < 0.1 on univ ariate analysis of DM using a Log-Rank test were included into a multivariate clin ical prognostic model. Data analysis Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for this st udy. All analysis were per- formed on Dataset1, leaving Data set2 as an independent validati on cohort for evaluating the radiomic signature. Statistical analysis was conducted using the survcomp[34] packa ge version 1.12 and rmeta[35] package version 2.16 in Bioconductor[36]. Prognos tic performances were evaluated by the concordance index[37] (CI), which is the proba bility that among two ran- domly drawn samples, the sample with the higher risk value has also the higher chance of experiencing an event (e.g. death or development of DM). CIs we re either directly com- puted for continuous variables or on the predictions of a univa riate Cox model with clinical categorical variables. Kaplan-Me ier and Log-Rank statistics wer e used to analyze the uni- variate discrimination of surviv al and DM groups by imaging fea tures and clinical covari- ates. To build the multivariate radiomic signature for DM, Cox regression models were trained on Dataset1 for selected prognostic variables and the p redictions by these models were validated on Dataset2. Features were incrementally added t o the model according to the relevance rank calculated by mRMR[33]. Intermediate models were tested by repeat- ed random sub-sampling cross valid a t i o n w i t h 1 , 0 0 0 i t e r a t i o n s o n Dataset1. Once the mean CI of t h e growin g mo del dro ppe d, t he c orrespon d ing fe ature set was retaine d se- lected as the final model. Only this selected model was and val idated on Dataset2. Signifi- cance of CIs was assessed by bootstrapping subsamples of size 1 00 with 100 repetitions for A) true survival data and B) random permutations of surviva l data, and comparing the empirical distributions of A) and B) by an one-sided Wilcoxon s igned rank test. The same procedure was used to assess if a CI was higher than another CI . To correct for multiple comparisons, we additionally adj usted P-values by the Benjamini and Hochberg[38]. All statistical a nalysis was performed using the R software[39] version 3.0.2. Radiomics predicts distant metastasis 173 RESULTS The majority of all patients were female (62.6%) and the median age at start of treatment was 64 years (range: 35-93 years). The median follow-up time wa s 23.7 months (range: 1.8-119.2 months) and the median survival time was 24.7 months (range: 1.8-119.2 months). The median time to dist ant metastasis (DM) was 13.4 mo nths (range: 0.3-117.5 months). Patient chara cteristics, clinical o utcomes are shown i n Table 1. Table 1 Patient characteristics and outcomes are reported for each data sets. For categorical variables, actual numbers are reported for each category (format A/B/C). Statistical comp arison between dataset 1 and 2 was computed using Chi Square (categorical variables) or Wilcoxon rank sum t est (continuous variables). Time to DM was similar between Dataset1 and Dataset2 (p-value < 0.36), as for the num- bers of (p-value < 0.45). However, survival (p-value < 0.005 ) and follow-up times (p- value < 0.007) were significa ntly different in Dataset1. We investigated the association of radiomics data with DM and o verall survival. In Figure 2 the association of the imaging features with DM and survival in the discovery Dataset1 is shown. Of the comple te radiomic features set (m=635 ), a total of 520 (81.88%) and 582 (91.65%) features were significant from random (FDR < 5 %) for DM and survival, respectively. A total of 445 radiomic features were significant for both DM and survival. A high linear relationship was observed ( R2 =0.92, p-value < 2.7 \u00d7 10243) , f o r t h e f e a t u r e s significant for both DM and survival. It is noteworthy that LoG features had the highest performance compared to th e other features groups. Among all features, thirty-five radiomics features were strongl y prognostic (CI > 0.60 and FDR < 5%) for DM (Table S2 in the Supplement II.3). Tw elve features were found prognostic for survival. Specific details on statistic values o f these features can be found in Table S3 in Supplement II.3. Between these two top performin g feature sets there were four common prognostic features for both DM and survival. All o f them were LoG based features (3 entropy and 1 standard deviation). We compared the top 15 features that had the highest CIs (Top15 ), with tumor volume and diameter (equivalent to basic metrics). The Top15 radiomic features had notably higher CIs compared to tumor vol ume and diameter (Figure 3.A). Chapter 9 174 Figure 2 Univariate performances of prognostic features for Distant Meta stasis (DM) and survival. Each point refers to the CI of a feature evaluating the power of feature to predict meta stasis, respectively, survival. Colors refer to the type of feature. Features whose CI estimation was not significa nt (FDR < 5%) for both DM and survival are shown in gray. Overall, 445 of these pairs of CIs are considered to b e significant estimates. Linear regression for all signif- icant pairs of CIs yielded an R-squared value of 0.92 (F-test, p-value < 2.7e-243). Figure 3 A) F o r e s t p l o t o f t h e 1 5 b e s t p e r f o rming radiomic features for n=98). Radiomics equivalent of basic metrics (di ameter and volume) was added for comparison. B) Forest plot of the clinical factors. The absolute C-indices and their 95% confidence interval are shown. Radiomics predicts distant metastasis 175 We also investigated the association of CPFs with DM in our dat a set. Three clini- cal parameters appeared to be significant univariate (CI=0.61, p-value < 2.35 \u00d7 1011). Clinical parameters, ranked by their CI are displayed in Figure 3.B. Overall stage and gender yielded a higher CI tha n the radiomic features, alt- hough their 95% confidence interval is wider compared to the ra diomic features. An mRMR based feature selection on all features on Dataset1 (n= 98) was per- formed to reduce redundancy and select a potential set of compl ementary and prognostic features. From this new ranking, the 15 highest mRMR-ranked fea tures were kept after feature selection to build the radiomic signature. A multivaria te Cox regression model to predict DM was developed. Features were iteratively added in or der of high to low mRMR rank on Dataset1, and Dataset2 was used for independent validat ion. The combination that yielded the maximum CI on the discovery Dataset1 before dr opping was defined as the optimal radiomic signature f or predicting DM. This signatur e consists of three fea- t u r e s : 1 ) W a v e l e t H H L - S k e w n e s s , 2 ) G r a y - L e v e l C o - o c c u r r e n c e M atrix - Cluster shade, and 3) LoG 5mm 2D - Skewness. Cluster shade is a textural featu re sensitive to tumor het- erogeneities. Skewness is a first-order feature that measures t he asymmetry of the histo- gram from the mean, which here is associated with two different filters LoG and Wavelet. As a final step, we compared the radiomic signature to a clinic al Cox regression model containing covariates that significantly discriminated be tween patients with and without DM in Dataset1 in univari ate analysis. The final model contained overall stage and tumor grade. This clinical model showed moderate prognostic pow er when applied to Da- t a s e t 2 w i t h c o e f f i c i e n t s t r a i n e d o n D a t a s e t 1 ( C I = 0 . 5 7 , p - v a l u e < 1.03 \u00d7 107). Combining the clinical and radiomic signat ure (trained on Dataset1) showe d a significantly (p-value < 1.56 \u00d7 1011) higher association with DM to Dataset2 (CI=0.60, p-value < 3.57 \u00d7 1016), compared to the clinical model. A median split of the patien t prediction scores from applying the combined model on Dataset2 yielded a signific ant difference (p-value = 0.049) for metastasis-free prob ability estimates (Figure 4). Chapter 9 176 Figure 4 Kaplan Meier curves according to the combined model predicting score to predict metastasis-free probability in an independent dataset. A significant survival difference appea rs between patients with a high or low risk of Dis- imaging gives valuable information for diagnostic, trea tment planning or surveil- lance of cancer patients. Routin ely, basic metrics are extracte d from these images to uti- lize as a prognostic factor [27-30], or to assess treatment res ponse. However, there is much more tumor phenotypic information captured in these images . Radiomics are able to quantify tumor phenotypical differences from medical images by using a large set of imaging features that can be lin ked to clinical factors of the tumors. In this study we ex- t r a c t e d 6 3 5 r a d i o m i c f e a t u r e s f r o m a t o t a l o f 1 8 2 l u n g c a n c e r p atients treated with chemoRT to assess the ability of r adiomic features as a prognos tic biomarker for distant metastasis (DM), and we validated a radiomic-based signature on an independent valida- tion dataset. Since DM remains a major cause of mortality in 30 -40% of patients with lo- cally advanced lung adenocarcinoma, early identification of pat ients at highest risk of de- veloping DM would allow clinicians to adapt treatment such as i ncorporating consolida- tion chemotherapy to improve outcomes. Moreover, the theoretica l benefit of consolida- tion chemotherapy has not been shown in large randomized studie s to date. It is likely because there was no selection of patients at the highest risk of distant metastases (i.e. p a t i e n t s w h o w e r e a t l o w r i s k o f d i s t a n t m e t a s t a s e s w e r e i n c l u d ed in these trials and would not need additional treatment). Future trial design to de monstrate benefits of con- Radiomics predicts distant metastasis 177 solidation chemotherapy will likely require stratification to i dentify those at the highest risk of distant metastases and m ay benefit most from additional treatment. We observed strong individual correlations between clinical out comes and quan- titative imaging features. A large number of features were sign ificant from random to pre- dict DM (91%) and survival (82%) in univariate analysis after c orrection for multiple test- ing. Moreover , a high linear correlation wa s found amon g those 445 features that were significant factors of both DM and survival ( R2 =0.92, p-value < 2.7 \u00d7 10243). This high line- ar correlation is expected as there is a high correlation betwe en DM and survival (DM greatly impact patient survival, see Table S4 in Supplement II. 4). Only a small number of features, 35 for DM and for 12 survival, were prognostic, as de fined by a CI > 0.6 and FDR < 5%. A l t h o u g h w e t e s t e d a l a r g e n u m b e r o f f e a t u r e s , t o m i n i m i z e a n y risk of over- fitting or bias, we performed a robust validation approach: all analysis steps, mRMR fea- ture selection, and model fittin g were performed on Dataset1 (n =98) and the results vali- dated on an independent validation Dataset2 (n=84). With this a pproach we found a mul- tivariate radiomic DM signature consisting of three features th at yielded a high prognostic performance for DM in Dataset1 ( CI=0.61). Combining the radiomi cs signature to clinical model predictors showed significant improvement (p-value < 1.56 \u00d7 1011), compared to the clinical predictors alone. A recent study from Fried et al .[22] investigated DM prediction for NSCLC pa- tients. They found a significant model DM (P-value=0.005) using both texture features and CPFs. The model used consisted of eight parameters (two CPFs an d six textures). In anoth- er study, Ganeshan et al .[15] applied textural analysis to find univariate prognostic f actors for survival. They focused on two imaging features (uniformity, associated with two LoG filter). In our analysis, these features were significant from random but lowly ranked by their CI value (184th and 146th CI-ranked features in Dataset1). However, major differences in studies design and implementa tion made it difficult to compa re them objectively. Fields et al .[22] used leave-one out cross validation to validate their mod el instead of an independent validation dataset. Ganeshan et al .[15] only used one CT image slice (pre- senting the largest cross sectio n) to calculate their features when we used the whole pri- mary tumor. Finally, both these studies have a smaller patient cohort, n=54[15] and n=91[22], and had mixed histolog y patients. Our analysis calcul ated the features from the complete 3D tumor volume, contained only a single histology of NSCLC (adenocarcinoma), and is based on larger cohorts (n=182) with an independent vali dation dataset for the ra- diomic signature. A complementary point of the study was to compare basic metrics [27-29] to ra- diomic features as prognostic factors for DM. The first observa tion made was that Shape- Maximum diameter (in every direction x/y/z) is a better univari ate prognostic factors than the maximal tumor diameter on an axial slice reported by a radi ologist. The advantage of the radiomic shape features is that they can be automatically a cquired, reproducible[10- 12], and take into account the whole tumor volume, whereas clin ically assessed tumor Chapter 9 178 diameters are manually drawn on a CT slice and are therefore li mited to one dimension of the tumor. Furthermore, shape or size-based features were not i n the top ranked features in our study. Total tumor volume, has been associated with surv ival in stage I-III NSCLC patients treated with radiation therapy in a study from Etiz et al .[28], and a prior study from our institution by Alexander et al .[29] also demonstrated an association between primary tumor volume and overal survival, but not risk of dista nt metastasis. In our study, volume was ranked only the 405th (CI=0.55) and 224th(CI=0.56) best univariate prognostic factor for DM and survival respectively in Dataset1. Thus, whil e basic metrics such as size and volume have historically bee n used as used in the clinical setting because such data are easily acquired, radiomic sh ape and size measurements can p rovide stronger prognos- tic factors. A short-coming of our study is the variability in CT acquisitio n and reconstruction parameters. Our dataset includes patients from 2001 to 2013. Du ring this time period, the standard of care for CT acquisition has evolved, differences ap peared between our cohorts for some factors (Table 1). Howe ver, despite this variability i n the imaging data (evolution of hardware, progress in informatics), radiomics was able to de tect a strong signal to pre- dict DM despite a temporal split . Additionally, clinical outcom es are provided by one cen- ter, which makes it hard to evaluate the generalizability of ou tcomes to other institutions. However, in comparison with a recent study[20] investigating cl inical outcomes from an- other center, patient character istics or outcomes were comparab le. Future work would therefore involve studying the DM signature in other histologie s and in independent vali- dation sets from other institu tions, assessing its generalizabi lity to all NSCLC. In conclusion, this study demons trated strong association betwe en radiomic fea- tures and DM for patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma; and presented an inde- pendently validated radiomics sig nature for DM. This signature would allow early identifi- cation of patients with locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma at r i s k o f d e v e l o p i n g D M , allowing clinicians to individualize treatment (such as intensi fication of chemotherapy) to reduce the risk of DM and improve survival. HIGHLIGHTS Early prediction of patients that will develop distant metastas is (DM) is crucial for improving overall treatmen t and patient outcomes. This study demonstrated an association between radiomic feature s and DM for lung cancer patients. A combined signature with clinical and radiomic features was ab le to predict DM in an independent validation dataset.

Chapter 9 Radiomics predicts distant metastasis PART 5 Discussion and Future Perspectives Chapter 9 185 CHAPTER General discussion and future perspectives Chapter 9 General discussion and future perspectives Chapter 10 186 GENERAL DISCUSSION Precision medicine is becoming the new paradigm in medical trea tment, particularly in oncology. This paradigm aims at tailoring therapies on the basi s of the individual markup of a patient to increase the pro bability of positive treatment outcome and reduce toxicity [1,2]. The fundamental backbone of precision medicine is the cl inical availabilities of accu- rate biomarkers to map a patient to an optimized treatment plan [3]. While molecular bi- omarkers stratify patients based on their genomic profiles or e xpression signatures of a set of genes [4,5], to date these markers can usually only be m easured when tumor tissue is obtained with invasive procedures, such as biopsies. In cont rast, standard medical imag- ing can provide the foundation f or non-invasive biomarkers [6]. Radiomics is a non-invasive charac- terize the radiographic phenotype of a tumor on the basis of qu antitative imaging features [7-9]. To achieve radiomic based tumor diagnostic and treatment response assessment, medical images (e.g., CT, MRT, or PET) are converted into quant itative data. Subsequently, these data are objectively mined for signaling patterns that in dicate a tumor subtype. As this process is usually conducted on the entire volumetric segm entation of a tumor, radi- omics allows a more comprehensiv e view as compared to tissue sa mpling. Although mul- tiple studies have documented predictive and prognostic value o f radiomics [10-13], clini- cal translation will require understanding of the underlying bi ological foundation of radi- omics. To this end, this thesis unraveled the mechanistic connections of radiomics and molecular biology of tumors and related those results to clinic al disease progression of patients. In particular, we focused on phenotype-genotype inter actions and on how these determine clinical factors of a tumor. Thereby, we achieved to develop a holistic view of cancerogenesis, which can be leve raged to inform clinical decis ions. Furthermore, this thesis embedded radiomics in a wider perspective as to how radi omics can effectively be integrated into a clinical workf low to augment cancer diagnosti cs and treatment monitor- ing. Finally, data and code were made publicly available where possible to ensure repro- ducibility of the presented resul ts and to support the growing radiomics community. The results of this thesis were structured in three ways. First , the most extensive part of this thesis was uncoverin g the underlying molecular bio logy that drives quantita- tive radiomic phenotypes. Second, we show how radiomics can be used to develop non- invasive imaging biomarkers for targeted drugs. Finally, we pre sented novel results on the impact of key machine learning methods on prognostic value of r adiomics Understanding the Biological Principles of Radiomics Imaging-genomics combines the fi elds of medical imaging and gen omics to gain better understanding of the relationships of imaging and underlying ge nome driven events. A key question in imaging-genomics is whether imaging phenotypes can be explained in terms of Discussion and future perspectives 187 these underlying molecular processes. Understanding the imaging -genomic relationship translates into understanding of phenotype-genotype interaction s in tumors and would allow using imaging as a surroga te for genomic interrogation in situations where biospec- imen derived diagnostics are not feasible, such as in monitorin g drug-targetable DNA mu- tations over time [6]. Different types of imaging-genomic studies can be conducted, de pending on which imaging and genomic modalit ies are included. For example, radiomic or volumetric imaging approaches can be utilized, and different types of biol ogical material can be inves- tigated such as the expression or mutation of genes by RNA or D NA sequencing, respec- tively. The core of this dissertation is the integrative analys is of the biological underpin- nings of advanced radiomic features and is presented in Chapter 2 [14]. In addition, we investigated how the underlying segmented tumor volumes behave as a function of mo- lecular events [15,16]. Therefore, we analyzed how biological p rocesses and somatic DNA mutations drive volumetric features and presented these results in Chapter 3 and 4, re- spectively. The biological basis of radiomics One common criticism of radiomics is that the underlying tumor biology is poorly under- stood, although biological reason ing of radiomic predictions is crucial for successful trans- l a t i o n a n d a p p r o v a l i n t o r e a l w orld clinical applications. Ther efore, in Chapter 2 we de- signed and carried out an integrated analysis published in the journal eLife [14]. With this analysis, we aimed at uncovering the mechanistic connections be tween radiomics, molec- ular biology, and clinical factors. We achieved this goal by in cluding 1) a large number of advanced radiomic features that cover a wide range of metrics, 2) validation in novel and independent cohorts with large sa mple sizes to increase statist i c a l p o w e r , 3 ) r o b u s t C T imaging of lung tumors, and 4) mu ltivariable analysis to unders tand complementary ef- fects of radiomic, genomic, and clinical data. To substantially increase the value of this study, we are also the first to validate key results of our ana lysis by immunohistochemical staining and to share data underlying the study, as well as the analysis source code, to the general scientific community. In our analysis, we implemented a novel bi-clustering strategy to associate radi- omic features with molecular pathways on the basis of global ge ne expression. Using this approach, we identified 13 modules each of which contained feat ures and pathways that yielded coherent expression patterns. We extended these radiomi c-pathway results to clinical factors by associating the radiomic features of all mo dules to tumor stage, histolo- gy, and overall survival. Striki ngly, these radiomic-clinical a ssociations robustly matched the radiomic-pathway results, closing the gaps between the comb ined connections of ra- diomics, biology, and clinical f actors. For example, in one mod ule textural entropy and dispersion features were prognostic and also associated with im mune response pathways Chapter 10 188 and cell proliferation; this confirms the radiomic-pathway-clin ical links as the prognostic implications of these pathways h ave been widely described [17-2 1]. Some of our findings have been previously indicated by prelimin ary studies of co- horts with limited scope. For example, a variety of our textura l features were associated w i t h s t a g e a n d h i s t o l o g y . I n d e e d , G a n e s h a n e t a l . [ 2 2 ] p r e v i o u s ly suggested textural CT features could predict whether a tumor was stage II or above; h owever, the features used in this study were derived from a single 2D image slice whereas our features were derived from the entire 3D tumor volume. Similarly, our results indicat ed that intensity features were associated with mitochondrial processing of oxygen, a key process in tumor hypoxia [23]. Indeed, Ganeshan et al. [24] also previously suggested th at CT pixels correlate with hypoxia markers, such as G lut-1 or pimonidazole. In addition to unraveling the re lationship between radiomics, t umor biology, and clinical factors, we also developed radiomic activity predictor s for specific pathways. For example, a tumor intensity based feature significantly predicte d the autodegration of E3 U b i q u i t i n l i g a s e C O P 1 ( a d i r e c t r e g u l a t o r o f p 5 3 ) w a s a l s o a p r ognostic factor. Similarly, tumor sphericity significantly predicted NFkB activation and wa s also a significant predic- tor of tumor stage and histology. These results further confirm the combined associations of radiomics, biology, and clinical factors. The clinical utili ty of such imaging based path- way predictors is still visionary, but could have its most effe ctiveness in areas where local response to targeted drugs administered over time has to be mon itored longitudinally. Finally, we addressed another key question of radiomics, which is whether radi- omics provides an added prognostic benefit to genomic and clini cal information. For this, we retrained and validated a pre viously published prognostic ra diomic signature [10]. By integrating this radiomic with a previously published prognosti c gene signature [25], we could demonstrate that the prognostic performance of the combin ed model exceeds the p e r f o r m a n c e o f t h e i n d i v i d u a l d a t a t y p e s a l o n e . M o r e o v e r , w e i n t e g r a t e d t h e r a d i o m i c and gene signature with clinical prognostic factors and convinc ingly observed the highest prognostic performance was achie ved only by combining all three types of data. To further increase confidence in the validity of these results, we swappe d the radiomic and gene signatures with other radiomic an d gene signatures and consiste ntly observed the same trend that the highest prognostic performance is yielded only b y models that combine all three types of data. It is important to note that our study benefits from multiple f acets of validation. First, we included a thorough st atistical design in which our p utative results were generat- ed on a discovery cohort and subsequently validated on an entir ely independent valida- tion cohort. Both cohorts were of large sample size and, import antly, these cohorts con- tained patients from two different continents (i.e., North Amer ica and Europe), which ad- ditionally suggests general applicability of our results. Secon d, we validated radiomic pre- dictors of key cancer pathways involved in immune response and inflammation with im- munohistochemical experiments. W hile reasonable statistical val idation is becoming more Discussion and future perspectives 189 widely adapted, validating comput ational results biologically i s still rather unique in radi- omics and should b e considered more frequently [6]. Although our study provides a considerable high standard of val idation and re- producibility following several international guidelines [6,26] , a few limitations can be noted as well. Primarily, the study cohorts were retrospectivel y collected. This implies that standardized protocols for imaging acquisition and registration were not available, alt- hough prognostic and predictive performances could benefit from s t a n d a r d i z e d i m a g e s [27]. Hence, further prospective studies will be required to as sess clinical utility of our re- sults and illustrate feasibility in clinical workflows. Further more, our cohorts focused on lower stage tumors and care has to be taken when generalizing t o later stage tumors or even metastasized areas. Also, biological material analyzed in our study was obtained via single-needle biopsies; as lung cancer is a heterogenous diseas e [28,29] interpretation of all derived associations is challenging. To mitigate this issue , conducting multiple steps of statistical and biological validat ion were of particular import ance for this study. In conclusion, the radiogenomic study presented in Chapter 2 si gnificantly ad- vances our preliminary understanding of how molecular biology d rives radiomic pheno- types and how these associations relate to clinical outcomes of patients; in particular, we show that radiomics contains complementary prognostic value com pared to genomic and clinical data. Our study provide s a rigorous classification of a broad set of radiomic fea- tures in terms of biological pat hways and is the first study to validate these results by im- munohistochemical staining and to release underlying data and a nalysis code to foster further translational radiomic re search. Understanding the biol ogical rationale of radi- omics will be critical to justifying the development of prognos tic and predictive imaging biomarkers, especially for targeted therapies. Imaging-genomics for MRI derived v olumetric features in gliobla stoma In the previous Chapter 2, we studied the combined relationship s between advanced radi- omic CT features in NSCLC, molecular pathways, and clinical par ameters [14]. We aimed at extending this work to understand the biological rationale of v olumetric image analysis in MRI. Therefore, in Chapter 3 and 4 we uncovered the connections between MRI derived volumetric GBM features, biologi cal processes, molecular subtyp es, and character- istics of patients [15,16]. The volumetric tumor phenotype feat u r e s f o r t h e s e s t u d i e s quantified necrosis, contrast e nhancing, and edema volumes in t umors, and were from images (FLAIR) seq uences. In Chapter 3 we investigated how these volumetric features are driven by biologi- cal processes based on global expression of genes, and how thes e associations can be in- terpreted in terms of molecular subtypes of GBM and overall sur vival of patients [15]. Generally, we wound that different volumetric features were rel ated to distinct sets of biological processes. Interestingly, these were mostly inversel y correlated. In particular, Chapter 10 190 necrosis, contrast-enhancement, a nd tumor bulk were highly enri ched for well established cancer processes, including apoptosis, immunological responses, and signaling pathways. These processes are also known to impact patient survival [30-3 3], which may explain why volumetric features associated with these processes were al so found to be prognostic in our analysis. Notably, these features were also significantl y stronger prognostic factors than just the entire tumor volume. Considering that all volumet ric features generally had only low to moderate correlation with each other, this highly s uggests that there is indeed a n a d d e d v a l u e t o q u a n t i f y i n g d i s t i n c t v o l u m e t r i c f e a t u r e s c o m p ared to quantifying just the tumor volume, as frequently proposed for prognostication [7 ]. In terms of volumetric associations with molecular subtypes of GBM, only edema was observed to be a volumetric predictor. Likely, this is beca use edema was the only fea- ture that had a different size distribution across molecular su btypes. Recently, Gevaert et al. [34] presented similar indications by demonstrating that th ree edema features corre- lated with molecular subtypes. Interestingly, edema was the onl y volumetric feature that was not a significant prognostic factor. This finding is in lin e with previously published re- sults that did not find significant prognostic value in edema a s well, using an alternative, manual MRI scoring scheme refe rred to as VASARI feature set ((https://wiki.nci.nih .gov/display/CIP/VASARI). Our study advan ces those preliminary stud- ies by analyzing tumors in 3D ra ther than in 2D, and by impleme nting automated quantifi- cation of those tumors. We extended the volumetric-pathway results presented in Chapter 3 to volumetric- mutation associations in Chapter 4. In particular, in Chapter 4 [16] we Investigated how t h e s e v o l u m e t r i c G B M f e a t u r e s a r e c o n n e c t e d t o s o m a t i c D N A m u t a tions of genes that have consistently been implicated featur es had very selective pre- dictive power for specific mutations. For example, the contrast enhancing feature was p r e d i ct i v e f o r T P 5 3 a n d N F 1 ( A U C > 0 . 6 7 , p < 0 . 0 4 ) , b u t n o t f o r a n y o t h e r o f t h e t e s t e d genes. Hereby, the mutated contrast enhancing volume was signif icantly smaller than the wild-type volume (p = 0.012). Si milarly, the edema region was p redictive only for RB1 (AUC = 0.66, p = 0.022) but no other tested gene, and was also signi ficantly smaller in the mu- tated tumors (p = 0.015). This selectivity points to different growth patterns induced by different mutations that lead to different imaging phenotypes. An analysis of clinical co- variates also revealed that the volumetric features were indepe ndent of gender, disease- free status, Karnofsky performance status, and age. The smaller volumes for tumors carrying a TP53 mutation was pre viously sug- gested by a manual, labour intens e imaging-genomic approach usi ng manually derived MRI features referred to as VASARI features [36]. Furthermore, our study suggested that EGFR mutants have larger necro sis volumes, but this difference was statistically not signif- icant, which is in line with a previously published study. Comp ared to the study in Chapter 2, the scope of the current analyses in Chapter 3 and 4 were mo re limited. First, only vol-Discussion and future perspectives 191 umetric measurements were consid ered rather than advanced first -order statistics, tumor shape, and textural properties o f the image; furthermore, the n umber of of only eleven volumetric measurements was relatively low. Second, validation in independent datasets was not feasible and the analyzed cohorts were of comparably li mited sample size, to some extent restricting generalizability. Third, it is reasonab le to assume that features based on MRI are less robust to perturbation than imaging featu res based on CT, as Hounsfield units used in CT imaging are an absolute and well-de fined measurement [37] . Fourth, due to co hort limitations, multiv ariable analysis could not be conducted. In conclusion, the studies presented in Chapter 3 and 4 reveale d a relationship between MRI derived volumetric fe atures of GBM phenotypes and b iological processes induced by global gene expressio n, molecular GBM subtypes, over all survival of patients, and somatic DNA mutations of well established oncodriver genes. We performed our analysis on publicly acquired imag ing and genomic data from two well established consor- tia, The Cancer Imagin g Archive (TCIA, The Cancer Genome The main advantage of these multi-center datasets is its public availability and hence that full reprodu cibility can be ensured by in- dependent groups. A limitation of this public dataset is the re latively small sample size of less than 100 patients with imaging for whom data on DNA mutati ons and gene expres- sion were available, as well as the relatively low number of el even investigated features. Furthermore, these features only quantified the volume of the s e gm e n t e d t u m o r a r e a s , hence no properties such as tumor shape, texture, or intensity have been investigated. In addition, validation in external d a t a s e t s c o u l d n o t b e c o n d u ct e d due to unavailability of comparable datasets; this also m ade multivariate analyses unfea sible. To overcome these limitations, we designed and carried out an integrated analysis of advanced radiomic fea- t u r e s i n l a r g e , n o v e l , a n d i n d e p e n d e n t d a t a s e t s c o n t a i n i n g s e v e ral layers of data of the same tumors. Radiomics for Targeted Therapies Targeted therapies are developed for very specific patient popu lations that share particu- lar properties of tumors that can be exploited [38]. Often, the se properties are defined as biological events, such as the existence of a genetic mutation that renders the tumor rela- tively more sensitive to a chemical, biological, or ionizing co mpound compared with tu- mors that do not contain this mutation. As a result, clinical t ranslation of targeted thera- pies inherently rely on the availability of accurate and robust biomarkers that indicate the existence of the biological property that should be targeted [3 9]. As the previous chapters demonstrated, radiomics has the poten tial to uncover underlying tumor biology [14-16]. Therefore, it is reasonable t o believe that radiomics can be a viable tool in developing predictive and prognostic biomar kers to effectively identify patients who would benefit from a specific targeted treatment. As such imaging bi- omarkers do not require an invasive procedure as traditional bi ological biomarkers, these Chapter 10 192 biomarkers can be utilized over time to consistently monitor tr eatment response. To this end, in Chapters 5 and 6 [40,41]we aimed at defining radiomic r esponse phenotypes in both brain and lung cancer treated with bevacizumab (AvastinTM) and gefitinib (IressaTM), respectively. Imaging biomarkers to stratify recurrent glioblastoma treated w ith bevacizumab One of t he fe w remaining t reatment o pti ons for p atien ts with to an- tagonize angiogenesis [42,43]. B evacizumab has been granted acc elerated approval by the FDA for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, following a semina l phase II clinical trial, the BRAIN trial (AVF3708g) [44]. Howe ver, recent studies, including large clinical phase III tri- als, suggested that bevacizumab does not improve OS of this pat ient population [45-47], but it is reasonable to hypothesize that this is due to absence of effective biomarkers that are capable of identifying those patients that do experience im proved OS. To this end, we developed prognostic radiomic imaging biomarker s to stratify survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma at different t imepoints [40], particularly before and after treatment initiation. We achieved this mainly by retrospectively analyzing prospectively collected data from the BRAIN trial. In particula r, we investigated utility of a radiomic approach for this patient population, focusing on mult iple clinical endpoints in- cluding overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PF S). Hereby, to limit false- discoveries we decoupled the sel ection of radiomic features and their analysis using two independent selection and evaluation cohorts, respectively. The results of this study have been published in the journal Neuro-Oncolo gy [40] and are prese nted in Chapter 5. Our study resulted in baseline (i.e., pretreatment) models tha t predicted disease progression within three, six, and nine months posttreatment in itiation. Interestingly, the performances of these predictions increased with time, suggesti ng that particularly pa- tients who experience progression later than others can be iden tified effectively. Hereby, multivariable models consistently outperformed individual radio mic features and were able to stratify patients in validation data that had 4 times h igher progression risk (i.e., hazard-ratio HR > 4). A model optimized to predict OS as endpoi nt, resulted in significant stratification in validation data with a hazard-ratio of 2.5 an d Log-Rank p-value of 1.1 x 10 - 3. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that those models were ind ependent of volumetric measurements, including total tumor volume and maximal tumor di ameter, and were also independent of clinical prognostic covariates, including Karnof sky performance status, age, and gender. Both our multivariable and univariable analyses suggested that radiomic features generally yield more prognostic value when derived from postcon trast enhanced T1- weighted images compared to features derived from FLAIR images. While it is difficult to interpret why this is the case, pr evious studies have documente d similar conclusions [48- 50]. These analyses also suggest that PFS can be predicted more accurately than OS, which Discussion and future perspectives 193 could be explained by the fact that PFS was a more clearly defi ned endpoint in the BRAIN trial as the trial protocol specified follow-up MR imaging ever y six weeks to identify pro- gression of the disease and discontinue those patients from the trial. The univariable anal- ysis of our models allowed us to gain understanding of which fe atures had the highest prognostic value. Accordingly, those are features that quantify textural heterogeneity; for example, the textural-heterogeneity features information-correl ation was significantly prognostic across all tested endpoints using baseline data and also had higher scores for patients with early progression. These results presented in Chapter 5 could lead to the developm ent of predictive imaging-based biomarkers for bevacizumab in patients with recur rent glioblastoma. To verify that the prognostic predictions are also predictive of t reatment outcome, a treat- ment-negative arm would be nece ssary. Alternatively, failure of our models in treatment- n e g a t i v e c o h o r t s c o u l d i n d i c a t e p r e d i c t i v e c h a r a c t e r o f o u r p r o posed radiomic imaging biomarkers [51]. As patients were treated with either bevacizum ab only or bevacizumab and irinotecan (i.e., chemothera py), differences in those treat ment arms could be sus- pected but have not been suggested by previous studies [52-54]. Hence, to increase sta- tistical power we followed the a pproach of those studies and po oled all samples. Robustness of our radiomic approach to imaging biomarkers in t his study is en- sured by the facts that we reduced the high-dimensional radiomi c space by unsupervised feature selection blinded from clinical data, we utilized two i ndependent cohorts to select and evaluate radiomic features, respectively, we developed our models from prospective- ly collected, multicenter trial data of high quality with stand ardized enrollment protocol, and we validated our proposed multivariable models in training- independent data. In this way, we aim at ensuring that the number of potential false-disc overies is drastically lim- ited. Validation in multiple external cohorts following the sam e treatment combination would add statistical validity, but availability of these datas ets is very limited as bevaci- zumab only has regulatory approval for recurrent glioblastoma i n a few countries including the United States. While our study focused on developing imaging biomarkers by ut ilizing radiomic approaches for standard MRI, combining MRI radiomics with other imaging modalities could be feasible. For example, r ecent studies have suggested t hat apparent diffusion co- efficient histogram analysis has prognostic value in a subset o f the BRAIN cohort [54,55]. S i m i l a r l y, F D G - P ET i m a gi n g c o u l d p r e d i ct s u r v i v a l i n h i gh - gr a d e gliomas treated with the s a m e c o m b i n a t i o n t h e r a p y a s i n t h e B R A I N t r i a l [ 5 6 ] . F u t u r e s t u dies need to determine whether these alternative imagin g modalities, which are widely used in cancer care, have additive value and can complement MRI radiomic predictions to i ncrease prognostic per- formances. If those studies cannot verify complementarity, appl ying to radiomics directly to T1-weighted MRI may ultimately benefit current clinical work flows as MRI is standard to care of patients with glioblastoma in modern cancer centers. Furthermore, integration with biological biomarkers could be considered; in particular, highly prognostic molecular Chapter 10 194 markers in glioblastoma such as methylation status of MGMT prom o t e r [ 5 7 ] o r o t h e r markers described in Chapter 4. In conclusion, our study presented in Chapter 5 presented inde pendently validat- ed prognostic pretreatment radiomic patients with recur- rent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab. These results could translate into the devel- opment of predictive radiomic biomarkers to specifically predic t response benefits of bevacizumab for this patient population. A radiomic response phenotype for gefitinib treatment in lung c ancer To investigate whether radiomic approaches could identify patie nts who are sensitive to gefinitib using CT imaging pre (baseline) or post (follow-up) a dministration, we analyzed data from a clinical phase II trial in Chapter 6 [41]. Gefitini b is a specific inhibitor of EGFR signaling [58], implying that ge fitinib will have high effectiv eness for patients whose tu- mors contain a EGFR sensitizing mutation and no effectiveness o therwise. Therefore, it is i m p e r a t i v e t o co r r e ct l y d e t e ct EG F R m u t a t i o n s f o r t h i s p a t i e n t population. Genetic tests are available to assess EGFR mutation status, but the vast majo rity of these tests rely on biopsy-based tissue and thus cannot be used to monitor mutation status over time [59]. To this end, we retrospectively applied radiomics to a prospect ively collected phase II clin- ical trial cohort [60] of patien ts with and without EGFR mutati on who all received treat- ment with gefitinib. Our results demonstrate that radiomics can predict EGFR mutatio n status from pre- and post-treatment images in patients with NSCLC treated w ith gefitinib. Predictabil- ity of EGFR via radiomics has also been suggested by related re search [61,62]. As EGFR is the explicit target of gefitinib , this leads to the conclusion that radiomics also predicts re- sponse to treatment with gefitin ib. In particular, energy\", ormance (AUC=0.67, p=0.03) at pre-treatment imaging. It is important to note that none of the traditional vol- umetric features (i.e., tumor volume and maximal diameter) were predictive at baseline imaging before treatment has been initiated ( p>0.27). This illustrate s that radiomics pro- vides predictive capabilities in cases where standard clinical measurements fail to indicate the presence of a drug target. Moreover, our analysis revealed that advanced radiomic features and standard volumetric features correlate only low, r einforcing our earlier find- ing from Chapter 5 that radiomic features and standard volumetr ic features may provide complementary, clinically relevan t information. It is reasonabl e to assume that individual radiomic features offer unique i nsight into tumor phenotypic ch aracteristic and hence are complementary to each other as well, as their pairwise correlat ion was low too. To esti- mate the degree of these complementarities, however, large pros pective, randomized, multi-center trials have to be conducted. Although the availability of biomarkers before treatment has be en initiated is re- quired to augment treatment dec isions, incorporating post-treat ment imaging into predic-Discussion and future perspectives 195 tive models allows monitoring. Thus, we compared our baseline r esults to follow-up imag- ing, in particular by assessing the delta of radiomic features between pre- and post-scans. As expected, we found that volum etric measurements had stronges t performance in pre- dicting EGFR mutations as geftinib should have the highest effe ct on tumor size (i.e., a sur- rogate of response) in patients that harbor the sensitizing EGF R mutation. However, we also found that the radiomic fea tures \"gabor\" energy had signif icant performance, as well. Here as well, these features had only low correlation with tumo r volume and diameter, indicating independent information. To rule out batch effects due to variability of imaging acquisi tion and reconstruc- tion parameters inherent in clin ical protocols, we conducted a technical validation. We assessed robustness of those radiomic features that significant l y p r e d i c t e d E G F R m u t a - tions, by evaluating feature sta bility in another, independent test/retest dataset. All radi- omic predictors could be validated with high stability (ICC > 0 .87). The optimal parame- ters, however, have to defined by independent consortia, such a s the QIN (Quantitative Imaging Network) and the QIBA (Quantitative Imaging Biomarker A lliance), that include multiple stakeholders. As the sample size of the cohort used to defined radiomic predic- tors was relatively low, further studies with more samples need to be conducted to con- firm predictive capabilities for EGFR. A negative control arm o f patients could additionally quantify how specific the predictive performance is to gefitini b, but ethical concerns may arise as conducting such as a study would require not treating patients that have a EGFR sensitizing mutation with gefiti nib although its effectiveness is known. In conclusion, the study present ed in Chapter 6 shows that radi omics can define a gefitinib response phenotype that indicates the presence of an EGFR sensitizing mutation. Similar to the results presented in Chapter 5, these results of Chapter 6 prompt for further translational research towards the development of predictive CT i m a g i n g b i o m a r k e r s t o assess response to gefitinib in patients with lung cancer. Machine Learning to Improve Prognostic Value of Radiomic Approa ches The previous chapters revealed the biological foundation of rad iomics (Chapters 2-4) and how these phenotype-genotype interactions could translate into imaging biomarkers for t a r g e t e d t h e r a p i e s ( C h a p t e r s 5 - 6 ) . H o w e v e r , t o e n a b l e a c c u r a t e and robust imaging bi- omarkers, advanced machine learning approaches are required. Th erefore, we presented additional research in Chapters 7-9 in which we for the first t ime described and applied an extensive range of machine learning algorithms that are applica ble to predicting overall survival of patients with non-sm all cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [6 3,64]. Furthermore, we used these algorithms to train both univariate and multivariate mode ls to predict the patholog- ical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [65] and to predict t he future development of distant metastases in patients with NSCLC [12]. In particular, we discovered novel radiomic signature that improved clinical prognostic models, results som e of which were also vali- dated in independent data. We thereby demonstrated that radiomi cs has to be regarded Chapter 10 196 as a data science, following str ingent statistical study design s, in order to fulfill its role as a clinical decision supp ort system [66,67]. Machine learning methods for radiomics Machine learning comprises a larg e panel of statistical algorit hms that aim at fitting coeffi- cients of classification models using training data in order to provide accurate predictions on novel data [68]. Machine lear ning is widely employed in biom edical sciences to develop predictive and prognostic biomark ers, especially in the field o f gene expression signatures [69] as a majority of machine learning methods require quantita tive data. This makes ma- chine learning particularly app licable to radiomics, where all imaging features are quanti- tative. In radiomics, machine le arning is mostly used to fit mo dels to predict survival of patients, as survival is considered the gold standard among cli nical endpoints for bi- omarkers [70]. However, most radiomic studies do not consider t he choice of a particular machine learning method as part of their statistical design, al though the final results are highly subjective to the choice of the training algorithm. Furt hermore, radiomics operates in high-dimensional the 'course of dimensionality' [71]. Ac- cording to the course of dimensionality, the required amount of data to obtain statistically sound results grows exponentially with the number of features; however, data volume and quality are usually the limit ing factor in clinical cohorts [72,73]. As a result of consider- ing too many features without sufficient data, 'overfitting' ca n occur in which classification models are fit to spurious signals in the training data and thu s do not generalize to novel data (i.e., the actual goal of predictive models) [74]. To miti gate this problem, feature se- lection methods can be used to identify an irredundant subset o f features that best repre- sents the information encoded in the entire data [75]. This als o allows quicker training of models and easier interpreta tion of model outputs. To support future radiomic studies employing machine learning m ethods in their analysis, we conducted a compreh ensive and comparative study of a large panel of 12 and 14 of the most popular and broadly used classification and feat ure selection methods, re- spectively, and present the results in Chapter 7 [63]. These cl assification methods [76] included generalized linear model (GLM), support vector machine (SVM), and random- forest (RF). The feature selection [77] methods the nimum maxi- mum relevance algorithm (MRMR), and Chi-Square. mutual informat ion maximization (MIM). We investigated the prognostic capabilities of the combi nations of these classifica- tion and feature selection methods in terms of predicting two-y ear overall survival, also against data perturbation. Importantly, parameters of all class ifiers were set to unbiased values proposed by a large and comprehensive study by Fern\u00e1ndez - D e l g a d o e t a l . , w h o compared classification algorithms across 121 datasets [78]. Th e study was conducted on two large and independent cohorts totalling 464 patients with N SCLC. The goal of our comparative study was to propose more suitable methods for radi omic prognostication to justify a particular choice of algorithms. Discussion and future perspectives 197 A Wilcoxon feature selection gen erally yielded the highest powe r when combined most classifiers. However, one influential proposal from our st udy is the suitability of mRMR for effective radiomic feature selection. MRMR selects the highest performing fea- tures that are also complementary to each other at the same tim e [79]. Various radiomic studies have been published that employ mRMR [12, 14,40,80,81]. Furthermore, with this study we propose random-forest classifiers as applicable choice for predictions of overall survival at two years. This is a reasonable finding, considerin g that random-forests have been widely used to achieve st ate-of-the art performances. One apparent limitation is that w e only investigated survival a t two years. Alt- hough this binary endpoint is considered a gold standard in lun g cancer research as in re- search of other cancer types [70], further investigation has to reveal whether the pro- posed methods are also feasible with ordinal or continuous endp oints. Furthermore, this study focused on overall survival of patients with NSCLC; hence , conclusions about utility of these methods for other cancer types is difficult to draw. H owever, in a follow-up study we achieved verification of these methods for patients with hea d & neck cancer [64]. Radiomics for pathological response To directly measure response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in NSC LC treated with trimo- dality (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation), pathologic al response is often assessed after surgical resection [82]. Previous research has suggested that pathological response is a prognostic factor [83,84] and could be used as surrogate endp oint for survival [85]. Pre- dicting pathological response pr ior to surgery would allow omit ting surgery and potential- ly intensify chemoradiation for patients who would otherwise no t benefit from added sur- gery. In Chapter 8, we investigated whether radiomics can be used to predict pathological re- sponse for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in NSCLC by developing an u nsupervised feature selection algorithm [65]. We applied this algorithm to a compre hensive radiomic feature set of 1,603 features to identify a canonical subset of feature s. In this way, the radiograph- ic phenotype of tumors was st ill represented but on a significa ntly smaller feature dimen- sion (n=15 in this case). Reduction of dimensionality is crucia l to data mining of radiomic data, as spurious results could otherwise be derived [86]. This especially holds for cases in which independent validation is no t part of the analysis. Unsup ervised feature selection techniques particularly avoid data leakage, as they do not take the classification target (i.e., clinical endpo ints) into account. Among the 15 unsupervised selected features in the study presen ted in Chapter 8, seven were significantly progn ostic and predicted gross resi dual disease (i.e., poor re- sponse); however, only one of th ose features also significantly predicted pathologic com- plete response (i.e., complete response). Interestingly, spheri cal disproportionality was one of the predictors and indicated that more spherical tumors are more likely to be asso- ciated with gross residual disease. It is important to note tha t conventional volumetric Chapter 10 198 features, in particular tumor volume and diameter, did not sign ificantly predict pathologi- cal response in this study; these results confirm prior results [87,88] and once again indi- cate that advanced radiomic features can provide disease inform ation beyond traditional imaging metrics. Multivariate analysis indicated that combining radiomic and volumetric features may outperform volumetric features alone. Interestingly, however, radiomic features in this study did not significantly predict overall survival, local recurrence, or d istant metastasis; an explanati on for this could be the rela- tively data collection period of 12 years which could influence these treatment outcomes. Further limitations of this study are the lack of independent v alidation of the results and the relatively low number of patients who experienced complete pathological response (27 out of 127). In this study presented in Chapter 8, however, we for the first time ap- plied unsupervised feature selection techniques on a vast numbe r of features and thereby demonstrated the utmost importance of dimensionality reduction in radiomic studies uti- lizing machine learning methods. Radiomics machine learning for distant metastases In current radiomic literature, machine learning methods are wi dely employed to predict overall survival of patients. As in many cancers, however, a ma jor reason for cancer- related death in NSCLC is the development of distant metastasis (DM). The incidence of DM is estimated to be as high as 40% [12]. despite combined tre atment modalities, includ- ing surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Id entifying patients at high- est risk of developing DM could help intensifying systemic ther apy and therefore poten- tially improve outcome. To this end, we applied the machine lea rning methodologies from Chapter 7 to develop a generalizable radiomic-based signature, which is presented in Chapter 9. I n t h e cu r r e n t C h a p t e r 9 , w e co n d u ct e d u n i v a r i a t e a n d m u l t i v a r i ate analyses of 635 radiomic features in two coh orts of a total of 182 patients with NSCLC, more specifi- cally locally advanced adenocarcinoma treated with chemo-radiat ion therapy [12]. As ex- pected, we found strong correlations between DM and overall sur vival; the linear Pearson correlation coefficient R between the C-indices for DM and overall survival of all featu res was R 2 = 0.92 ( p = 2.7x10-243). Univariately, we found that 15 features had strong prognos- tic power for DM (C-index > 0.60 and FDR < 0.05); in comparison, only 12 features met this criteria for overall survival. In a multivariate analysis, we leveraged the proposed supervise d mRMR algo- rithm from Chapter 7 to select a non-redundant yet complementar y set of features. We used this canonical set of three features to fit a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards re- gression model to calculate a risk score of developing DM. We a dded significantly per- forming clinical covariates (i.e., overall stage and tumor grad e) to this model, hereby demonstrating the added value of a radiomics model to a clinica l model alone, validated on independent data (C-index 0.60 vs C-index 0.57; difference b y bootstrapping p < 1.56 x Discussion and future perspectives 199 011). Furthermore, this model significantly stratified patients in to a high and low risk group (log-rank p < 0.049). In this study, our proposed model for DM substantially benefitt ed from the sophisticated feature selection algorithm, mRM R, we employed. This step contr ibuted in avoiding over- fitting when validating the predictions on the independent coho rt. Our careful design al- lowed to investigate both univariate and multivariate performan ces of features and clini- cal covariates. An important finding in our study is also that the volumetric maximal three- dimensional slice was a stronger prognostic factor than the con ventionally used two- dimensional maximal axial slice. At the time of publication, tw o other studies have been published that suggested prognost ic value in CT derived textura l features for DM. On the one hand, Fried et al. [89] suggested prognostic value for DM o f a model with CT texture and clinical covariates; however , the relatively small sample s ize of this study (n = 54) makes it difficult to conclude general validity. Similarly, Gan eshan et al. [90] investigated radiomic features extracted from two-dimensional imaging slides (i.e., the largest cross sections); here, comparison with our study cannot directly be d rawn as we considered the entire tumor volume. Future studies have to conclude whether th ree-dimensional anal- yses are superior to single-slice analyses. As we also discussed for other ch apters, the current study was limited by its ret- rospective nature. Patients incl uded in the analysis were treat ed between 2001 and 2013, during which CT imaging protoco ls and other acquisition paramet ers may have changed. However, training and validation data were temporally separated ; as our models validated against this temporal split, our results indicate generalizabil ity beyond temporal variabil- ity. Furthermore, generalizability across different cancer type s and institutes has to be investigated. In conclusion, with this Chapter 9 we for the first time showed t h a t m a c h i n e - learning based radiomic approaches are viable tools to develop prognostic imaging bi- omarkers for the prediction of DM, which is a highly complex mo lecular process. Hence, with this work we laid the groundwork to investigating how prog nostication via radiomics is justified biologically. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES This thesis aimed at closing tran slational gaps in understandin g how radiomics, tumor bi- ology, and clinical outcome of patients are linked to each othe r. We have shown that as- sociations between radiomic features and molecular pathways can guide towards prog- nostic biomarkers for targeted therapies using advanced machine learning algorithms. Ultimately, this body of doctoral research can be used to devel op predictive imaging bi- omarkers that would allow identification of patients who would benefit most (or worst) from a specific trea tment. To this end, several prerequisites m ust be accomplished. Chapter 10 200 Obviously, regulatory authorities require any proposed biomark er to be validated through prospectively executed c linical trials. Within those tr ials, however, standardized protocols for image acquisition and processing ca n also be dedu ced. These protocols should be adhered by future radiomic studies to ensure reproduc ible interpretation of the results across different research laboratories. Standardization will also be crucial in the definition of radiomic features. Currently, it is unclear which parameter settings, including image transformation and interpolation, yield optimal performan ces and thus variance in those parameters is high among current radiomic literature [91] . Standardization of fea- ture definitions will be of partic ular importance as automated feature definitions using deep learning techniques become more popular in medical image a nalysis [92]. Several organizations now aim at producing consensus guidelines for ima ge standardization, in- cluding the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) [93] from the U. S.National Cancer Insti- tute (NCI), the Quantitative Ima ging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA) [94], the European Organi- sation for Research Treatmen t of Cancer E uropean Society of Radi- and the Cancer Research UK (CRUK) [97]. These guidelines should also include recommendations about tumor delineation and segmentatio n software; to date, it is an open question how accurate tumor delineations have to be drawn. In addition to image standardization, other technical hurdles need to be over- come when planning to integrate a novel technology into existin g clinical workflows. To integrate radiomic applications i n future clinical cancer manag ement, robust and secure infrastructure has to be developed, allowing storage of massive amounts of sensitive pa- tient data, model development and validation, as well as transp arent data and method sharing to foster collaborative research [98]. To facilitate co llaborative research, novel concepts such as distributed and continuous learning could be v aluable tools [66,99,100]. In particular, innovative and open source software, such as PyR adiomics for radiomic fea- ture extraction (https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io), the suite for managing im- age data [101], and BraTumIA for automatic segmentation [102], can contribute in repro- ducing independent results in the growing radiomic research com munity. Besides tech- nical advancements, it could be advisable to offer additional t raining for clinicians to be- come more accustomed to data -driven diagnostics [103]. This thesis proposed a number of radiomic and radiogenomic bio markers. A novel concept for clinical trial validation could include blinded val idation. Therefore, future stud- ies would fix the parameters of the underlying models of such a biomarker and transfer this fixed signature to multiple independent groups for validat ion. This multi-center effort could also include additional biological validation or associat ion studies to emerging diag- nostic approaches such as liquid biopsies [104]. A meta-analysi s of the individual datasets could provide further confidence in the results [105]. Furtherm ore, while this thesis mainly f o c u s e d o n r a d i o m i c s d e r i v e d f r o m C T a n d M R i m a g i n g , f u r t h e r i m aging modalities and analyses could be explored for applicability in biomarker devel opment, including PET and proton imaging [106-109], as well as semantic and other qualita tive approaches to image Discussion and future perspectives 201 analysis [110-112]. Similarly, r adiomics can be applied to dise ase sites other than lung and brain [64,80,113-117] . In conclusion, this dissertation advances our understanding of the biological basis of radiomics and the implications for novel concepts to cancer diagnostics. On the basis of the non-invasive imaging and mach ine learning, future studies c ould build on these results to develop and validate radiomic biomarkers for targeted therap ies. Ultimately, this could routinely augment decision-making in daily clinical practice an d thus lead to improved pa- tient outcome. REFERENCES 1. Ashley EA. Towards precision medicine.

Discussion and future perspectives 207 Summary Summary Summary Summary 208 SUMMARY Radiomics is a promising field th at aims at leveraging existing medical imaging data with advanced computational methods to p r o v i d e n o v e l q u a n t i t a t i v e a n d actionable data for clinical decision support. Notab ly, radiomic approaches enable integration of these previ- ously untapped sources of information in a noninvasive, objecti ve, reproducible, and cost- effective way. Numerous studies have suggested prognostic and p redictive associtions of radiomics and clinical endpoints, including overall survival. H owever, the molecular biolo- gy underlying these associations were largely unknown. To this end, this dissertation con- tributed in unraveling the connections between radiomic, molecu lar, and clinical data. Furthermore, these results were put in context to radiomic pred ictions for targeted thera- pies, as well as in context of optimizing these predictions wit h advanced machine learning methods. This thesis was organized in five parts, where Part 1 introduc ed and outlined the objectives, Par ts 2 to 4 cont ained the main research results, a nd Part 5 discussed these results. We briefly summarize the content of the thesis below. Part 1: Introduction In Chapter 1 we introduced the concept of radiomics and explained the implic ations of radiomics for precision medicine i n cancer. In this chapter, we outlined the objectives of this thesis to uncover the underlying biology of radiomics and therefore reason how radi- omics can be used as imaging biomarkers for targeted therapies. We motivated these ob- jectives by the fact that radiomics has been suggested to conta in prognostic and predic- tive value, but that biological reasoning of this has not been achieved yet. Part 2: Radiomics and its Underlying Biology Chapter 2 presented a broad radiogenomic study that revealed mechanistic connections of a large set of radiomic CT features, molecular pathways, and clinical factors in lung can- cer. Importantly, all associations were validated in independen t data. Additionally, key associations were also validated biologically. Furthermore, we for the first time demon- strated that radiomics provides complementary prognostic value to traditional genetic and clinical predictors. In Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 we extended the results from Chapter 2 to associations be- tween volumetric phenotype features, molecular pathways, and so matic gene mutations in brain cancer. In this way, we complement Chapter 2 by sheding light on how imaging- genomic connections behave in an other aggressive cancer type as sessed by an alternative imaging modality, namely gliobl astoma and MRI, respectively. Summary 209 Part 3: Radiomics for Targeted Therapies Understanding genotype-phenotype interactions in tumors as aime d for in Chapters 2-4 allows reasoning about radiomic phenotype predictors for target ed therapies that exploit genetic properties of tumors. Therefore, in Chapters 5 and 6 we aimed at developing nov- el imaging biomarkers to identify patients who would respond be st to bevacizumab and gefitinib in brain and lung cancer, respectively. In both studi es, we leveraged prospectively acquired data of previously pub lished clinical phase II trials. Particularly, in Chapter 5 we achieved to develop (and validate) radiomic biomarkers for patients with recurrent glioblastoma that stratified overall su rvival, as well as progression- free survival, at multiple timepoints including pre-treatment a n d f o l l o w - u p a t s i x a n d twelve weeks post-treatment initiation of bevacizumab. This stu dy strongly suggests that radiomics can be used to develop predictive biomarkers for stra tifying this patient popula- tion prior to treatment decision, which could be crucial as rec ent phase III clinical studies failed to suggest improvement of overall survival due to absenc e of effective biomarkers. In Chapter 6 we explored radiomic predictors for gefitinib, an EGFR inhibit or, by assessing predictive value of radiomics for EGFR mutations. Similar to Ch apter 5, we investigated imaging data pre- and post-treatment, as well as the delta chan ge of features values be- tween those timepoints. While we observed predictive value of r adiomic features at base- line (i.e., before treatment), tr aditional volumetric features such as tumor volume and diameter showed no predictive value at baseline. Part 4: Prognostic Value of Radiomic Machine Learning As we have observed from the previous chapters, radiomics is mo ving towards a data sci- ence, critically dependent on efficient machine learning method s. Therefore, in our final research Chapters 7-9 we in vestigated a pp licability of a wide range of machine lear ni ng algorithms to optimize r adiomic predictions. In Chapter 7 we present a study that evaluated a host of potential machine l earning algo- rithms for radiomic prognostication. Specificially, we investig ated 14 feature selection and 12 classification methods, and com pared their performance in pr edicting overall survival at two years. With this study, we aimed at providing recommenda tions as to which popu- lar machine learning methods are the most promising ones for th e development of radio- mic prognostic biomarkers. Finally, wih Chapter 8-9 we used unsupervised feature selection to identify a canonical set of radiomic features that could potentially predict pathologica l response in lung cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiation. In Chapter 8 we used a similar methodology to Summary 210 derive features that predicted the development of distant metas tasis, while optimizing the predictive model with supervised feature selection. Part 5: Discussion and Future Perspectives This dissertation concluded with a discussion and outlook in Chapter 10 . Our research un- covered a large proportion of the molecular biology underlying radiomics, results that are necessary to justify translation of radiomics into clinical app lications. We now gained bet- ter understanding about the high prognostic potential of combin ing radiomics with ge- n o m i c s a n d c l i n i c a l r e c o r d s , a s w e l l a s t h e i m p l i c a t i o n s f o r t a rgeted therapies. Further- more, we propose advance machine learning algorithms to increas e prognostic and pre- dictive performance of radiomic models. In conclusion, our work demonstrates the signifi- cance of systematically analyzing routine medical images with r adiomics, as well as its in- tegration with molecular and clin ical data, to develop predicti ve tools for cancer diagnos- tics. 211 Valorization addendum Curriculum Vitae Curriculum Vitae Societal impact and valorization 212 VALORIZATION ADDENDUM The central objective of this dissertation was to enable biolog ical reasoning of radiomic prognostic models to facilitate th e development of imaging-base d biomarkers for clinical decision support. Such biomarkers will be crucial in the succes s of targeted therapies. As this thesis has shown, radiomics h as unprecedented potential to provide actionable data for noninvasive and cost-effective biomarker for specific cance r treatments. Furthermore, this thesis has also demonstrated that advanced machine learnin g algorithms are neces- sary to provide the level accurateness and robustness required for clinical applications. To translate research of this thesis into clinical tools, furth e r v a l i d a t i o n o f t h e p r o - posed models must be performed. To this end, transparacy in the processed data and methods used is critical. Theref ore, we made data and code publ icly available to the wider scientific community wherever possible. In particular, we relea sed radiomic, genomic, and clinical data, as well as open so urced our analysis code from C hapter 2 online (https://elifesciences.org/articl e s / 2 3 4 2 1 ) , w h i c h i s t h e c o r e o f our results that associate radiomic with biological data. In addition, results from Chapte r 2 were extended in Chap- ters 3 and 4, and data underlying Chapter 3 and 4 were collecte d through The Cancer Ge- nome Atlas (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) and The Cancer Imaging Archive are public reposit ories. Hence, reproduci- bility of those results can be assured, as well. Obviously, rel easing data is not possible for all studies due to intellectual property; for instance, this wa s the case for data underlying Chapters 5 and 6, which analyzed data from clinical trials. Sim ilar holds for the remaining Chapters 7-9. Hence, more effort s should be performed to achiev e global data sharing. One solution to facilitate data sharing could be distributed le arning, an emerging in- frastructural concept in which machine learning models are dist ributed to different sites (i.e., clients such as hospitals) to learn from data of each si t e . I n t h i s w a y , d a t a n e v e r leaves a site and hence only learned model coefficients are sha red across sites. Obiously, however, full transparency in underlying data can only be achie ved with access to raw da- ta. Regarding transparency in methods, three parts have to be c onsidered: 1) Segmenta- tion, 2) Feature extraction, and 3) Analysis. In this thesis, m ethods for segmenting tumors were already publicly available either commercially (e.g, Eclip seTM) or open source (e.g., 3D Slicer). Methods for feature extraction were recently shared through an open-sourced Python package at pyradiomics.re adthedocs.io. All algorithms us ed for the analyses in this thesis were implemented in 'R', a n open source pa ckage for stat istical analysis. General employment of open source methods can significantly sup port reproducibility analysis even in clinical studies , because reasons for deviatin g results can more easily be deduced. This can also have an impact on standardization of rad iomic methods, which also must be achieved to gain regulatory approval for clinical use. Currently, major internation- al consortia, such as QIN, QIBA, EORTC, and ESR, are developing guidelines for standardi- zation in image acquisition, r egistration, and analysis. Societal impact and valorization 213 Results of this dissertation can also be leveraged to improve e xisting biomarker ap- proaches, as our thesis also suggests complementary prognostic value of radiomics to vol- umetric, genomic, and clinical assessments. To achieve effectiv e combinations of radi- omics and traditional methods, one radiomic signature should be fixed first. This radiomic signature can then be combined with genomic or clinical signatu res that have been exten- sively described in recent literature to understand how this co mbination can be reproduc- ibly and robustly optimized for a predefined clinical endpoint. Ideally, training and valida- tion of such novel combinations should be performed by independ ent groups, ensuring absence of data leakage and thus generating overoptimistic resu lts. Should radiomic ap- proaches continue to show complementary value, combined biomark ers will lead to more accurate and cost-effective diag nostic strategies, and hence sa fer treatments. Inherently, more accurate biomarkers can also save considerable amount of f unds required to con- duct a clinical trial, as the target population can be identifi ed easier and thus less patients need to be recruited to gain statistical significance. Major parts of this dissertation have gained broad attention fo r its innovative ap- proaches. For example, parts of the study prestend in Chapter 2 were honored with the Best in Physics award at the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Phy sicists in Medicine (http://www.aapm.org/meetings/2015AM/PRAbs.asp?mid=99& aid=29354), and was also announced with an online press release about Hot Topic s (http://www.aapm.org/ meetings/2015AM/VirtualPressroom/N ewsReleases.asp#HotTopics). I n addition, the signif- icance of this work has also been suggested by a recent press r elease: https://www.sciencedaily.com/r eleases/2017/08/170 803135210.htm. Altogether this em- phasizes that radiomics will make in cli nical decision support. Finally, it should be noted that radiomic approaches have translational potential beyond oncology; as radiomic processes standard of care imaging techniques, any disease that can routinely be assessed by medical imaging can also be a potential applicat ion of radiomics, including cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and bone diseases.

My first thank you goes to my supervisor and co-promoter, Dr. Hugo Aerts; Hugo when I came to Boston for the first time in 2013 you inspired me with both your enthu siasm and eagerness for scienti fic discovery. Without you, I would have never learned about the \"business\" of academi c research and about the importance of connecting to people through networking, which no w is one of my favorite activities. My gratitude also goes to my promoter, Prof. Dr. Ph ilippe Lambin; Philippe, even though I conducted my research far from the actual university y ou always kept track of the progress of my research and continuously encouraged me to go fo r my promotion. It was an honor to have one of the dist inguished personalities who coi ned the term \"Radiomics\" supervise my dissertation. I wish both of you, Hugo and Philipp e, many successful academ- ic years and accomplishements. Clearly, however, there is one single person who deserves by f a r t h e b i g g e s t share of my most genuine gratefulness, appreciation, and acknow ledgments. Kathy, my Love, you are the most wonderful woman to me and I could not be any more thankful for your sincere patience and endurance in bearing with all the tim e we had to live a transat- lantic relationship. We knew upfront it would not always be eas y - but you made it the easiest possible, the liveliest p ossible, and the happiest poss ible. This PhD would mean nothing without you and you deserve half of the title; also meh r als Danke f\u00fcr Zeiten mit dir . A huge fraction of my thanks goes to my all the friends and co lleagues who I be- came friendly with during my time in the US. I am particularly thankful to the Boston- German community; I cannot count how many of you I have become close friends with over the entire period of four and a half years, but be certain that without you my stay in the US would have not been half as fun, inspiring, and motivati ng. Especially, I would like to (in alphabetical order) say thank you to Andi, the countless Ch ristians and Christina, Elena, Frederik, Friederike, Hendrik, Jens, Johanna, Kristin, L uzia, Martin, Michael, Nico, Robert, Steffi, Thomas, Timo, Uli. Furthermore, thanks to Celin e, Fred, Lulu, Manka, Orley, Rose and Kate, and Tarique. And very special thanks to you, Mat ty!! Having you as a room- ie was like living with a brother. Special thank you to my GAC fellows Greg, Fabian, Fabien, Tim, and Sonja; I am so proud having built this conference with you and am even more delighted to still being connecte d this well with you beyond ou r time abroad. You all were wonderful people to me and I would not give away any single mom ent we spent with each other. Frankly, the latter paragraph was not quite a ready exercise f or me to write as it is impossible to enumerate all the amazing people who accompani ed me throughout my time in the US. So please do not feel offended if I did not man age to include you in printed name - you very well know that I never forget to include you in my cherished memories. I could not write these Acknowledgments without mentioning the people at Da- na-Farber's PGA and PGSAO. It was such an awesome experience be ing part of fostering Acknowledgments 217 the Longwood and Boston graduate student and postdoc community! Particularly you, Jen Molina, I cannot imagine how my p ersonal DFCI experience would have looked like with- out you! Thank you also to Sonal Jhaveri and Lorraine Barnes fo r your open guidance to an expat. And thanks to Tim and Nadia who I had so much fun with! I would also like to take the chance and thank Dr. Paul Yu and his group for being such an inspiring research lab. Paul, your sincerity about scie nce, patients, industry and politics has been an unparalled role model; one can easily iden tify your mentor qualities. I will never forget our discussions and your helpful guidance wit h my PhD track. I do not want to forget to mention the endless fellow research ers and scientists from the radiomic community who I enjoyed so much collaborating with, discussing scien- t i f i c d i s c o v e r i e s , o r j u s t t a l k i n g a b o u t G o d a n d t h e w o r l d a n d complaining about how tough a PhD is . Specifically, I would like to say thank you to Chintan, Vivek , Emmanuel, and Thibaud - the first batch of awesome radiopoetric scientist s!! Moreover, thank you to Ralph and Wouter for helpi ng me finalize my thesis! Any Acknowledgment of mine would not be complete without disti nctly thanking those who have always been the c losest to me - my family. Papa, Mommsy, and Dini, your continuous support has not gone unnoticed by me and be sure tha t I value every welcom- ing thought of yours. This also holds for my \"extended\" family - Beate, Siggi, and Julian; ever since Kathy and I found each other I consider having found you, as well. Thank you equally for all your support throughout the course of my time i n the US and beyond. Very special thanks to Yali who designed this outstanding thesi s cover!!! Keep up with your talent and leverage it as much as you can. Thank you to everyone who was part of my Boston-Harvard PhD adv enture!

He grew up in proximity to Switzerland and France and attended school in Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany. After he obtained his Abitur w i t h a n a t u r a l s c i e n c e c o n s o l i d a t i o n a t t h e L i s t e - M e i t n e r -Gymnasium in 2008, Patrick moved to the city of Bielefeld, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany , to study Bioinformatics & Genome Research at the University of Bielefeld. During his Bachelor of Science program, he accomplished a research stay at ETH-Zurich in the group of Prof. Dr. Joerg Stelling fun ded by a PROMOS stipend and completed his stay in 2011 with a thesis entitled \"Sequence ana lysis of yeast integral membrane protein properties with respect to a potential species - s p e c i c c o r r e l a t i o n o f signale peptide and rst transmembrane domain\". He continued with Bioinformatics to obtain a Master of Science degree from the University of Bielefeld and wrote his Master thesis entitled \"S tochastic modeling of the impact of (super)drivers and the mutator phenotype on tumor pro gression\" in 2013, as an official Visiting Student at ETH-Z urich in the group of Prof. D r. Niko Beerenwinkel funded by ERASMUS. During his time at the University of Bielefeld, he worked as a graduate re- search assistant at the Computational Metagenomics group, where he developed meth- ods to analyze novel metagenomic and single cell datasets. He c omplemented his Master training with a research stay at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA, to conduct a meta-analysis of all >700 publish ed human breast cancer gene signatures with respect to prognostic value distributed among molecular subtypes. Motivated by this third external research stay, Patrick decided to return to Bos- ton in January of 2014 to conduct doctoral research in the Comp utational Imaging and Bioinformatics group headed by Associate Prof. Dr. Hugo J.W.L. Aerts at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School . His disser- tation was supervised by Prof. Dr. Phlippe Lambin at Maastricht Univer sity, The Net h er- lands, in co-supervision with Dr. Aerts and focused on integrat ed statistical methods ap- plied to medical imaging, genomi cs, and clinical records with t he goal of developing pre- dictive biomarkers that may allow selection of optimal strategi es in treatment of cancer. Patrick is Otto-Bayer alumni and was featured as \"pioneer of to morrow\" on the official fellowship site. His doctoral research about integrating radiom ics and genomics was awarded \"Best of Physics\" at the AAPM Annual Meeting 2015 and r eceived a press-release about current \"Hot Topics\". Patrick's volunteering activities i n Boston included Head of Innovation at the largest student -led, transatlantic conference , the German-American Conference at Harvard . He is now a fellow at the Coll\u00e8ge des Ingenieurs headquarted in Paris and consults The Linde Group in digital strategies using Predictive Maintenance in Munich. 222 Publications 223 List of publications Curriculum Vitae Curriculum Vitae Publications Publications 225 SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS 1.
