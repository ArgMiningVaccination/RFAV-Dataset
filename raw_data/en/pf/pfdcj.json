We aimed to clarify the concept of deprescribing as used in research and clinical practice. Methods: Deprescribing was examined using the eight-step Walker and Avant method of concept analysis that consisted of: (i) con- cept selection; (ii) determining the purpose of the analysis; (iii) identifying uses of the concept; (iv) determining the critical attributes; (v) identifying the model case; (vi) identifying borderline and contrary cases; (vii) identifying antecedents and consequences; and (viii) de ning empirical referents. A literature search was conducted on the word de?prescri *. Results: We identi ed seven critical attributes: withdrawing medications, de-escalation, intended outcomes, structured and iterative process, intervention, risk to bene t, and patient-centred care. Deprescribing antecedents were identi ed as changing health, chang- ing goals for health care, and polypharmacy. Deprescribing consequences identi ed were compliance, health outcomes, mortality and cost, and possibility for adverse drug withdrawal events to occur. We used the model case, borderline and contrary cases and empirical referents to illustrate the concept of deprescribing. Conclusions: Deprescribing is a term used with varying degrees of precision, and there is no accepted de nition. In this paper, we have analysed the concept of deprescribing and identi ed it as a patient-centred process of medication withdrawal intended to achieve improved health outcomes through discontinuation of one or more medications that are either potentially harmful or no longer required. Keywords : deprescribing, concept analysis, discontinuation, medication optimisation. INTRODUCTION Good pharmaceutical care includes prescribing new medications, adjusting doses of existing medications and ceasing medications that are no longer required. Efforts to improve the quality use of medications have often focused on the under-use of indicated medica- tions.1Once commenced, many medicines are dif cult to withdraw.2These factors contribute to polypharmacy as a prevalent issue where two out of three older people are exposed to polypharmacy.3The magnitude of polypharmacy continues to increase with older people today using an average of two medications more each day than their counterparts 10 years ago.4The increas- ing prevalence and extent of polypharmacy among olderpeople has led to an emerging eld of research to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is commonly used to mean the use of ve or more medications,5although de nitions of two to 10 medications have been used in the literature.6,7Discussions about reducing polypharmacy often suggest a distinction between appropriate and inappropriate polypharmacy,8,9 with some authors de ning polypharmacy as the use of more medications than clinically necessary.10Other work suggests that the number of medications is not the best indicator of prescribing quality in a clinical setting.11Epi- demiological research has correlated polypharmacy to a range of undesirable health outcomes, including nutri- tional de ciencies, falls, frailty, impaired cognition, increased hospital admissions and adverse drug reac- tions,5,6,12 -14although it remains unclear whether polypharmacy directly causes these negative outcomes or is a marker of multiple failing systems.15 Researchers have speculated that reducing the total number of regular medications by ceasing inappropriateAddress for correspondence: Amy Page, School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley 6009, Western Australia, Australia E-mail: amy.page@uwa.edu.au \u00a92018 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research (2018) 48,132-148 doi: 10.1002/jppr.1361Official Journal of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia medications might improve health outcomes in older people.16Inappropriate medications include those used without a valid indication, therapeutic duplication, inef-fective medications and those where the potential risksoutweigh the intended bene t. 9Interventions to reduce polypharmacy represent an emerging eld of research known as deprescribing.9 The word 'deprescribing 'rst appeared in the litera- ture in 2003,17although the concept of withdrawing medications was reported in the medical literature about30 years prior. Almost as soon as ef cacious medica- tions to control chronic conditions emerged, cliniciansbegan to question whether medications were indicated indenitely or if they could be withdrawn safely. 18-20 The ideal treatment duration and potential bene to f ongoing treatment were unclear then21-23and often remain unclear today.24 No speci cd enition exists for the word 'deprescrib- ing', and the term is used inconsistently.25-27Two recent papers proposed de nitions for deprescribing as a pro- cess to reduce medication use, although there is limited consensus on what does or does not constitute depre- scribing.9,26The inconsistent de nition and conceptuali- sation is increasingly problematic.26 The inconsistent application of the word 'deprescribing ' suggests that the concept may be unclear. A 'concept 'is an important theoretical component that communicates anabstract theoretical idea. 28A concept analysis is a process to examine the essential components of a concept.28This concept analysis was undertaken to clarify the concept of deprescribing as used in research and clinical practice. METHODS This concept analysis used the Walker and Avantmethod of the Wilsonian version of concept analysis that entails eight consecutive steps (Figure 1) to provide a structural framework that is intended to be pragmaticand procedural. 28 A concept analysis is built on a literature review. The concept analysis does not include a critical appraisal ofmethodological quality of the literature as it is an analy-sis of the concept rather than the evidence. 28 Selection Criteria This concept analysis uses all published peer-reviewedpapers in medical journals that included the base word'deprescribe 'or its derivatives (e.g. deprescription, deprescribing, deprescriber or deprescribed) in the title,abstract or keywords to ensure the paper focused ondeprescribing.Search Strategy This concept analysis considered all uses of 'deprescrib- ing'in peer-reviewed published papers. To identify the relevant papers, a text word search in the MEDLINE,EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL Plus databases was con-ducted using the text worddeprescri *or de-prescri *in the title, abstract and key- word elds. The inclusion criteria were that the full manuscript must be available in English. Data Collection One author independently scanned the title and abstractof every record retrieved. All available full-text articlesthat used deprescribing were retrieved and investigated.The articles were read with attention to the use of theconcept and to identify patterns in the literature. Thedenitions were imported into nVivo (nVivo 11 for Mac) where we undertook a word frequency analysis. 29 RESULTS Our search returned 558 results, which was reduced to191 results after removing duplicates. The full texts of138 peer-reviewed journal articles were available in Eng-lish and retrieved. Most ( n=81) were published in 2015 and 2016. Major ndings related to each of the steps in the Walker and Avant method are summarised (Fig-ure 1). Use and De nition of the Concept Deprescribing Deprescribing was rst introduced to the literature in 2003, and its use was becoming more common by 2014 when Alldred described it as a new word.17,30Early commentary by Iyer et al. and Alldred et al. focused on encouraging the use of the word deprescribing as ameans to link relevant research. 30,31The need for consis- tent nomenclature to link studies that research medica-tion withdrawal, to facilitate retrieval of relevantresearch was rst raised as an issue in Iyer et al. 's 2008 systematic review. 31It was highlighted again in three more recent systematic reviews.2,32,33 Deprescribing was de ned as 'medication withdrawal in older people 'in a 2008 systematic review of with- drawing individual medications.31Le Couteur et al. clar- ied that this was the 'cessation of long-term therapy supervised by a clinician '.34These concepts were com- bined in a 2015 publication that proposed a de nition as'the process of tapering or withdrawing drugs with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving \u00a92018 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research (2018) 48,132-148A concept analysis of deprescribing medications in older people 133deprescribing concept. Step One : Concept selection The purpose of the analysis was determined. The purpose of this concept analysis was an intention to clarify the concept behind the terminology.Step Two : Determine the purpose of the analysis The critical attributes are the words and phrases used commonly to describe the characteristics of the concept. The use of the term \"deprescribing analysed by extracting definitions from included recent papers published in 2015 and 2016. We limited the papers to those published in 2015 and 2016 to ensure we examined the contemporary usage. This selection of recent papers was due to the possibility that the concept has slipped as its use has become more common.Step Three: Identify all uses of the concept that can be discovered We identified the critical attributes of deprescribing from the literature. This step was undertaken by familiarisation with the literature by reading and re-reading the papers. Clinical judgment was used to identify the critical attributes from these papers. This was supported by a frequency count of words used to define deprescribing extracted in step three. We identified critical aspects that were central to the concept, as well as those aspects that are desirable, but not critical to the concept. We identified related attributes that can be confused with the concept. The identified attributes were labelled deprescribing be confused with deprescribing.Step Four: Determine the critical attributes We reported a model case that was illustrative of deprescribing. Step Five: Identify model case We reported a borderline case that described some but not all of the critical attributes of the concept. We reported a contrary case that does not represent deprescribing.Step Six: Identify borderline and contrary cases We identified the reasons for deprescribing as events or factors that were commonly reported to prompt a deprescribing intervention. The consequences that occur as a direct result of the concept were identified. Antecedents and consequences were identified from the literature, and the authors drew on clinical and research experience. The antecedents and consequences were reported and narratively described.Step Seven: Identify antecedents and consequences Examples of the actual phenomena can provide the clinician with clear and observable phenomena by which to These examples are known as empirical referents. The occurrence of the example of a commonly used medication was selected to illustrate the concept.Step Eight: Define empirical referents Figure 1 Concept analysis flow chart.

Of these articles, 12(15%) have used an original de nition of the word. The most common de nition ( n=10, 12%) was the one pro- posed by Scott et al. : 9'systematic process of identifying and reducing or discontinuing drugs in instances inwhich existing or potential harms outweigh existing or potential bene ts, taking into account the patient 's medi- cal status, current level of functioning, and values andpreference '. A similar number of papers ( n=8, 10%) referenced the de nition by Reeve et al. : 26'process of tapering or withdrawing drugs with the goal of manag-ing polypharmacy and improving outcomes '. Multiple papers ( n=4, 5%) referenced Woodward 's 17original paper to suggest that it was a process of medication withdrawal, although Woodward 's original paper did not propose a precise de nition. Attributes of deprescribing We identi ed seven critical attributes for deprescribing. The critical attributes we identi ed were: withdrawing medications, polypharmacy de-escalation, appropriate medication use, intended outcomes, patient-centred care, active intervention, and a structured and iterativeprocess. Withdrawing medications is the most common attribute associated with deprescribing. 9,16,17Deprescribing refers to the withdrawal of regular medications, rather thanstopping a medication that was only ever intended to beadministered short term or infrequently. 35Polypharmacy de-escalation can be a driver to depre- scribe as it can be an intervention undertaken to reduceor manage polypharmacy. Health professional motiva-tion to reduce polypharmacy is often related to a desireto reduce the perceived negative implications correlated to polypharmacy. Consumer drivers to de-escalate polypharmacy could be due to patient perception that they are taking manymedications, and this interferes with adherence orcauses distress. 36,37Polypharmacy is not a reliable indi- cator of consumer drivers to reduce and withdraw inap-propriate medications, as the consumer desire todeprescribe has been shown in both people who do and do not use polypharmacy. 38 Appropriate medication use is an attribute as it focuses on the reduction and withdrawal of inappropriate medi-cations. 9Medications targeted for deprescribing inter- ventions are those that are not underpinned by acurrent indication, are inappropriate, inconsistent withthe patient 's care goals, and those where actual side effects outweigh the potential bene ts. 39Further, some medications to prevent future serious events may have time to bene t that is longer than the person 's antici- pated prognosis.40 Deprescribing does not deny people potentially bene- cial treatment.9It is possible that by reducing overall medication use through deprescribing, the deprescribingintervention may improve the willingness of prescribersto prescribe indicated medications at a later date. Intended outcome of deprescribing is a critical attribute. Deprescribing is a purposeful activity. 9It is undertaken with the intent to improve health outcomes, managepolypharmacy or withdraw medications where actualside effects outweigh the potential bene t. 35The inten- tion to achieve a bene cial outcome distinguishes depre- scribing from acts such as the health professionalomitting an indicated medication or the consumer being non-compliant with a prescribed therapy. Patient-centred care is critical to deprescribing. Depre- scribing recognises that the appropriateness and useful-ness of any speci c medication can change as health and life goals change. Each particular individual needsto be involved in decisions about their care. 41Medico- legal concerns are an identi ed barrier to deprescrib- ing,42but this is less signi cant when undertaken as part of a shared-decision.41Deprescribing should be considered from both a patient-centred ethical perspec-tive as well as a clinical perspective. 43 Deprescribing is a variation from the status quo and is thus perceived as an active intervention .2,39This per- ception of deprescribing as an active intervention differ-entiates it from simply omitting a medication withoutcareful consideration. \u00a92018 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research (2018) 48,132-148A concept analysis of deprescribing medications in older people 135Table 1 Denitions of deprescribing published in 2015 De nitionDenition cited Ailabouni et al.77Original researchProcess of reducing or discontinuing medicines that are unnecessary or deemed harmful5,54 Ailabouni et al.78Original researchProcess of safely reducing/discontinuing unnecessary/harmful medicines, has the potential to reduce polypharmacy, inappropriate medicine use and greatly improve health outcomes26,54 Akinbolade et al.79Review Process of optimisation of medication regimens through cessation of potentially inappropriate or unnecessary medicationsNone Anderson et al.80Review Systematic process of identifying and discontinuing the use of medicines where the actual or potential harms outweigh the bene ts, giving due consideration to an individual patient 's care goals, current level of functioning, life expectancy, values and preferences9 Anderson et al.42Review Systematic process of identifying and discontinuing medicines where the actual or potential harms outweigh the bene ts, within the context of an individual patient 's care goals, current level of functioning, life expectancy, values and preferences9 Andreassen et al.81Review Process of withdrawal of an inappropriate medication, supervised by a healthcare professional with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcome26 Barras et al.82Review To help reduce unnecessary polypharmacy and reduce the potential for drug-related harm, particularly in the elderly population, who are at risk of adverse drug eventsNone Bemben83Review Systematic process of identifying and discontinuing drugs in instances in which existing or potential harms outweigh existing or potential bene ts within the context of an individual patient 's care goals, current level of functioning, life expectancy, values, and preferences9 Brandt84Review Process of identifying and discontinuing drugs that could potentially harm rather than benet a patientNone Conklin et al.85Review Stop or decrease doses of medications causing problems or that are no longer needed None Disalvo et al.86Systematic reviewProcess of tapering or withdrawing drugs with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes26 Farrell et al.87Review Planned and supervised process of dose reduction or stopping of medication(s) that may be causing harm or are no longer providing bene tNone Farrell et al.88Original researchAct of tapering, reducing a medication31,89,90 Galazzi et al.91Original researchProcess of optimisation of medication regimens through the supervised withdrawal of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs)5,17,26 Gupta and Cahill92Review Systematic process of identifying and reducing or discontinuing drugs in instances in which existing or potential harms outweigh existing or potential bene ts, taking into account the patient 's medical status, current level of functioning, and values and preference9 Jansen et al.41Review Medication withdrawal None Kalogianis et al.38Original researchSystematic process of ceasing medications, and it has been proposed as a way to approach the problem of inappropriate polypharmacy27 Linsky et al.93Original researchSystematic process of identifying and discontinuing drugs in instances in which existing or potential harms outweigh existing or potential bene ts within the context of an individual patient 's care goals, current level of functioning, life expectancy, values and preferences.

In 'Deprescribing: a guide for medication reviews ', we recently described the multi-step, co-opera- tive process to deprescribing (Steps One to Fivebelow). 44The BMJ recently published a review on the need for health professionals and consumers to discuss deprescribing as a shared decision-making process.41In this review, they outlined the steps A, B and C below,which are needed to discuss deprescribing with con-sumers to facilitate a shared decision. 41The combined steps from these papers detail the process. Step One: Identify people suitable for deprescribing Step Two: Take a medicine-focused history Step Three: Write a medicine withdrawal plan Step A: Creating awareness that options exist Step B: Discussing the options and their bene ts and harmsStep C: Exploring patient preferences for the dif-ferent options Step Four: Stop the medicines according to the plan Step Five: Monitoring and follow-up The CEASE acronym is a mnemonic for the steps involved in the deprescribing process. 45 Current medications: undertake a medication recon- ciliation Elevated risk: consider the potential risk from each medicationAssess: assess the potential bene t and harm from each medication, and the patient values and prefer-encesSort: prioritise medications for cessation Eliminate: implement cessation and monitor Desirable attributes of deprescribing Shared decision-making is a desirable aspect of deprescrib- ing as patient involvement is advisable and preferable,but not a mandatory attribute of deprescribing. 33The intervention needs to be undertaken under the supervi-sion of, and in conjunction with a health profes- sional. 26,41The involvement of a health professional and a patient making the decision together with the goal ofimproving health outcomes or managing polypharmacysets deprescribing apart from non-adherence. Related concepts that can be confused with deprescribing We identi edve attributes that are not related to deprescribing, which were therapeutic substitution,medication simpli cation, withholding medication, dose reduction and medication non-adherence. These attri-butes are detailed below. Therapeutic substitution involves withdrawing one medication to commence another. 46In medication sub- stitution, the intention is not to reduce medication use.47 The intention can be to change to a more appropriate medication, reduce side effects, cost savings, change toan alternative dose form that has different characteris-tics, or to accommodate patient preferences. 4,48 Medication simpli cation is an intervention to manage the complexity of medication regimens that can be asso-ciated with polypharmacy. 49Many older adults have complex medication regimens and can include multiple daily dosing and special instructions. They can experi-ence physical challenges in using the medication, withevidence showing that as many as one in four olderadults struggle to open the packaging. 50,51Simplifying is undertaken to reduce complexity without changingthe therapeutic intent of the regimen. 49This intention to maintain therapeutic intent contrasts simpli cation to deprescribing where there is an intent to change the therapy.52 Withholding medication intends for the period to be temporary. It is not a permanent withdrawal, and it isoften done due to a temporary change in circumstancesor an acute illness. 53The monitoring phase of the depre- scribing process can identify a need to reinstate a medi-cation because the original condition has returned. 9,54 This reinstatement due to a return of the original condi-tion contrasts deprescribing to withholding medications.The intent to reinstate the withheld medication after adened interval makes medication withholding distinct from deprescribing. 55 Dose reduction is related to deprescribing. Dose reduc- tion can improve medication safety.56For medications intended to provide present relief from symptoms but the symptoms are currently stable, the medication may be trialled for deprescribing.54The deprescribing process will often include the tapering of the medication toavoid rebound symptoms or the return of the underly-ing condition. Where the medication is not successfullywithdrawn, the tapering process may nd a lower effec- tive dose. 35This dose reduction is part of optimising the medication regimen, but it is not deprescribing.26 Medication non-adherence is not undertaken in conjunc- tion with a health professional, and it is not an interven-tion. 57In fact, non-adherence can often lead to poorer health outcomes.58,59Medication non-adherence can be related to forgetfulness or poor health literacy, but it hasalso been shown to result from a consumer 's intention to formulate their decisions with the information avail-able. 60In non-adherence the consumer unilaterally Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research (2018) 48,132-148 \u00a92018 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia138 A. Page et al.making the decision to stop medication without any input from a health professional.60 Illustrative Cases The model case (Table 2) illustrates a case where medi-cations have been withdrawn despite clinical guidelinesproviding no distinct stop date. The decision has beenmade to stop medications despite a valid indication stillexisting as the risks now outweigh the bene ts. The borderline case (Table 3) illustrates a case where medications have been withdrawn which suggested adeprescribing intervention, but in this case the with- drawals were achieved by adhering to the current guidelines. This intervention is regular care, and is con-sistent with current practice. The contrary case (Table 4) illustrated a case where the medication regimen was optimised. The medicationregimen was optimised through therapeutic substitutionand commencing indicated medications. Antecedents to Deprescribing Four antecedents to deprescribing were identi ed, namely health changes, changed goals for health care,polypharmacy and adverse effects. These attributes arediscussed below. Health changes over time, and as such the signs and symptoms of the disease and medication-related issues change and evolve. 9This change means that new condi- tions may be identi ed, and new signs or symptoms of the disease may occur.61,62It also means that signs and symptoms pass and no longer remain a current con-cern. 9These changing symptoms are an antecedent for deprescribing. Changing health that prompts deprescrib-ing is particularly prominent when the symptoms arepart of a prescribing cascade, and the causative medica- tion is withdrawn. 63 Changed goals for health care can be an antecedent . Medication that was appropriate for a person 20 yearsago may not still be suitable today as care goals andpriorities change. The goals for health care change asthe person progressively moves from a focus on pre-ventative health care to symptom management andpalliation. 64These changed goals of health care can be reflected in the medications used to prevent disease deterioration or to prevent a serious future event.24 The focus can slowly morph to symptom managementand relieving discomfort rather than preventativehealth care. It is less clear at what point the changingfocus should begin, and the consideration of the indi-vidual 's health goals may be one approach to guide this.The issue of time to bene t is similar. Medications can require a minimum treatment duration to be effec-tive, and in the context of a limited prognosis, it may bethat the person no longer has the necessary time to ben-et from the medication use. 40 Polypharmacy can be an antecedent to deprescribing, as a commonly identi ed goal of deprescribing is to manage polypharmacy and to reduce medication bur-den. A positive consequence of deprescribing is a reduc-tion in polypharmacy. It is challenging to reduce thetotal number of medications taken, but recent researchhas indicated it is feasible. 32,35 Adverse effects can prompt deprescribing.35Many peo- ple experience side effects of their medications that can range from mildly irritating to intolerable or life-threa-tening. 49The risk of side effects increases with the use of many medications, and with age. The presence ofactual side effects that outweigh the potential bene ts can be a rationale to deprescribe. 35Adverse effects do not consistently prompt deprescribing interventions asthis may leave a condition untreated. In the circum- stance where continued treatment is indicated, adverse effects may lead to therapeutic substitution rather thandeprescribing. Consequences of Deprescribing Consequences of deprescribing are the events that occurbecause of withdrawing medications, and these can be both positive and negative. Four potential consequences of deprescribing were identi ed, which were namely the effect on adherence, health outcomes, mortality and cost.Adverse drug withdrawal events were identi ed as a possible consequence, with two distinct sub-categoriesfor medications intended to manage symptoms com-pared to those intended to prevent disease progressionor a serious future event. Adherence may be improved by deprescribing. 54 Improved adherence may be related to fewer medica- tions to monitor, or a reduced personal cost for purchas-ing medications. Alternatively, it may be related to theshared decision-making the process of deprescribing sothat the consumer is prescribed only the medicationsthey perceive as important using a shared-decisionmodel. Cost may be altered by deprescribing, but a health economics analysis was not found for deprescribing.Reduced cost of medications to both the healthcare sys-tem and the individual is a potential bene t of depre- scribing. 65The effect on health service utilisation during and after deprescribing did not appear to be substan-tially altered, 35,66,67but studies to date included health service utilisation as a secondary outcome, and may not \u00a92018 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research (2018) 48,132-148A concept analysis of deprescribing medications in older people 139Table 2 A model case -deprescribing Mr Jones is 89 years old.

Page et al.have been adequately powered to detect changes. The true health economic rami cations of deprescribing are unknown, as it is not clear if health service utilisation isunchanged, increased or decreased because of depre-scribing. Health outcomes can potentially change because of deprescribing medications. These altered health out-comes can include mortality and adverse drug with-drawal events (as discussed below). Mortality has been correlated to polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use. It is not yet clear if depre-scribing can reverse this trend. Two recent reviews ofdeprescribing interventions found no signi cant reduc- tion in mortality overall, although they found a reductionin mortality in subgroup analyses. 67Johansson et al. found no effect on mortality in randomised studies (oddsratio (OR) 1.02, con dence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.23), which was similar to Page et al. (OR 0.82, CI 0.61 to 1.11). The discontinued medications are often indicated todelay mortality, so no change in mortality can be viewedas a positive nding in systematic reviews of this nature. Adverse drug withdrawal events (ADWEs) are a poten- tial risk of deprescribing. 68ADWEs are noxious, unin- tended and undesired effects as a result of medicationwithdrawal.69ADWEs are detected as clinically signi - cant signs or symptoms that occur because of medica- tion withdrawal.32ADWEs are an emergence or re- emergence of clinical signs or symptoms.69They may range from mild to serious and temporary to permanentreactions. 69Physiological withdrawal reactions include rebound symptoms where the body overcompensatesfor abrupt medication withdrawal. 69Many medications to provide symptom relief and to act on the cardiovas- cular or nervous system are now tapered to minimise the risk of rebound symptoms.68,70 Medications intended to provide symptom relief may continue to be used even after symptoms are no longerreported. It is often not possible to tell if the symptomshave resolved and that is why they are not current, or ifit is that the medication is continuing to provide symp-tom relief. 39,71These medications are trialled for depre- scribing, rather than decisively targeted. The medications are usually tapered, so that if symptoms re-emerge, then the medication can be promptly re-instated. These medications can be re-instated withoutany long-term consequences. On a population level, the bene ts of many medica- tions are understood. 72However, it may be challengingRecommence if blood pressure or heart rate above target levels on three consecutive readings Paracetamol 500 mgTwo tablets four times a dayContinue Current pain documented Macrogol One sachet nightly Decision deferredPossible cascade prescribing - defer decision until other medications deprescribedConstipation, monitor bowels Slow K 600 mg One tablet daily Cease Currently normal, ceasing frusemide, and one tablet daily is often inadequate Potassium levels to be monitoredAbrupt Monitor serum potassium levels Actions Rosuvastatin is ceased as the evidence for its use for primary prevention in a person of 89 years old is uncertain. Pantoprazole, calcium, vitamin D, frusemide, mirtazapine, amlodipine and potassium are ceased as there is no current indication for their use. These are withdrawn consecutively at monthly intervals to ensure that any change in clinical signs or symptoms can be attributed to just one medication. Candesartan may be able to be withdrawn depending on his blood pressure after withdrawing amlodipine and frusemide. The decision is deferred until after these are ceased. Constipation is a common side effect of potassium, calcium and amlodipine. This means his constipation may ameliorate once they are ceased. The decision on whether to continue laxative will be deferred until after they are withdrawn. What are the key features that makes this deprescribing? This is deprescribing as medications have been stopped despite clinical guidelines providing no distinct stop date. The decision has been made to stop medications despite a valid indication still existing as the risks now outweigh the bene ts.Table 2 (continued ) \u00a92018 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research (2018) 48,132-148A concept analysis of deprescribing medications in older people 141Table 3 Borderline case Mrs X is 79 years old.

This review identi ed 11 regular medications, and identi ed six that could be safely ceased according to current guidelines. It is borderline because although deprescribing has occurred in six out of 12 (half) of her medications, it is achieved by adhering to the current guidelines. This is regular care, and is consistent with current practice. Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research (2018) 48,132-148 \u00a92018 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia142 A. Page et al.to ascertain the likely bene t of medications intended to prevent future serious events for any one individual. Atthe individual level, it is not possible to determine whomay have had an event with or without the treatment.The possible consequences of deprescribing a medica- tion intended to prevent future decline or a serious event is that the person experiences: deteriorating healthoutcomes or premature mortality, no change in healthoutcomes or mortality but continues with a similarhealth outcome but reduced medication use, improvedhealth outcomes or mortality through reduced experi-ence of side effects and reduced risks associated withpolypharmacy. It is very challenging to know which of the three pos- sible outcomes any individual will experience because of deprescribing any particular medication. Those peo- ple at the highest absolute risk of a cardiovascular eventhave both the greatest potential to bene t from their medication and simultaneously the greatest potential toexperience harm from their medications. Consideration for a Particular Medication Statins were chosen as a medication class to illustrate theconcept as they are commonly prescribed for older peo-ple. 73They are indicated to reduce cholesterol with the intention to reduce premature mortality and to reducethe risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardialinfarction and stroke. 74For healthy older adults without established cardiovascular disease, use of statins for pri-mary prevention may reduce risk of myocardial infarc- tion or ischaemic stroke, but does not alter all-cause mortality. 75The contribution of the statin to polyphar- macy and the actual side effects experienced would needto be considered along with the anticipated prognosisand the person 's own goals and preferences. This uncer- tainty indicates that the health professional needs to con-sider patient preference and individual factors and thatdeprescribing could be a shared decision. Deprescribing statins for people who had limited life expectancy was studied and found no change in clinical outcomes. 76 DISCUSSION Some ambiguities associated with deprescribing havebeen addressed through this concept analysis. The con- cept of deprescribing is applied with varying degrees of precision, and there is no accepted de nition after 13 years of use. In this paper, we have developed theconcept of deprescribing by following the process forconcept analysis. We identi ed seven critical attributesthat illustrate the concept, namely withdrawing medica- tions, de-escalation, intended outcomes, structured anditerative process, intervention, the risk to bene t, and patient-centred care. The consequences of deprescribingidenti ed were namely the effect on adherence, health outcomes, mortality and cost, and possibly ADWEs. We provided the model case, borderline and contrary casesand empirical referents to illustrate the concept ofdeprescribing. Deprescribing is the concept that involves reducing medications to reduce the risks associated withpolypharmacy; it is an intrinsically individualised pro-cess with the intent to improve patient outcomes. It recognises that the appropriateness and usefulness of medication changes as health and life goals change.Deprescribing is applied with varying degrees of preci-sion, although it is recognisable in practice. The personwho withdraws a statin in a palliative care setting isdeprescribed, while the person who stops one antihy-pertensive to start another because of side effects is notdeprescribed. Despite the ambiguities, the de ning attri- butes of deprescribing such as patient-centred care, the intended outcomes, the process, and the appropriatemedication use, distinguish deprescribing as a concept. 9 The main strength of this paper is the use of the Walker and Avant method to provide a structure tomethodically analyse abstract concepts. We have eluci-dated the de ning elements of the concept and elements that are not related to the concept. Examples are pro- vided to guide a uni ed understanding of what the con- cept describes. The manuscript is an in-depth analysis ofwhat the word has been used to describe with clearboundaries set to guide future use. This paper has sev-eral weaknesses worth noting. The main weakness is thatthe approach to data extraction could be considered sub-jective. Further, the paper focuses on deprescribing inolder people, and it cannot be generalised that the con- cept would be applied consistently in other populations. Likewise, the inclusion criteria were peer-reviewedpapers that included the term deprescribing or its vari-ants in their title or abstract. The search strategy focusingsolely on the word itself may exclude papers that exem-plify the concept but did not use the word deprescribing.Similarly, the concept analysis did not include the usageof the word in consumer resources and grey literature. Limiting the concept analysis to peer-reviewed papers in older adults allowed us to analyse the concept in adened situation as applied by researchers and clinicians interested in medication use for older adults. Interventions to optimise medication use for older people are complex. Reviews on deprescribing interven-tions have repeatedly commented on the challenge toidentify relevant research due to the inconsistent use of \u00a92018 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research (2018) 48,132-148A concept analysis of deprescribing medications in older people 143Table 4 Contrary case Mr Jones is aged 76 years.

Why is it not deprescribing? It is optimising Amiodarone is ceased and a beta-blocker commenced after hypothyroidism is identi ed. The aspirin is ceased and warfarin is commenced as his risk factors have changed. Pantoprazole is commenced as an untreated symptom was identi ed. Vitamin D is commenced as an untreated condition was identi ed. The medications were not ceased to manage polypharmacy. Although two of his medicines have been deprescribed, this was done to opti- mise his regimen, not to deprescribed medications. He is on more medications overall, although the regimen is more appropriate.

Page et al.a common word.2,32,33,54As described earlier, the use of the word 'deprescribing 'is a suggested approach to link relevant research.30,31This challenge to search and retrieve relevant research is a barrier to research distri-bution. By clarifying the concept of deprescribing, this research could support the uptake of the word depre- scribing as applied to this research. The consistent useof the word deprescribing will enable researchers toretrieve relevant work on the topic. The implication forclinical practice is that a de ned concept can improve communication between healthcare professionals todevelop strategies to optimise medication use thatincludes deprescribing interventions. Clarication of deprescribing is fundamental to ensure that we have a shared concept for application in clinicalpractice and future research. This concept analysis hasidenti ed deprescribing as a patient-centred process to withdraw medications with the intention to achieveimproved health outcomes through discontinuation ofone or more medications that are potentially eitherharmful or no longer required. Deprescribing is a conse- quence of the changing health and care goals over time, as well as polypharmacy and adverse effects. Deprescrib-ing can have consequences on adherence, cost, adversedrug withdrawal effects and health outcomes.
