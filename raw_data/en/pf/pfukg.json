There were many thoughtful issues raised by this show but the most important theme was that we cannot go backwards. We cannot take back words spoken in anger, a thoughtless act, or even the lack of acting better when we could have. Many of us live with some regret: regret for what we said or did or should have. Physicians often wish they could go back in time and make the correct diagnosis sooner or say the right thing to their patient to comfort them. Unfortunately, we can only do the best we can at the time. Despite all of our education, training, and the fact that we always mean to be helpful and kind, we are far from perfect. A routine day for our dermatologists involves caring for many patients, answering phone calls from patients and referring doctors, and endless paperwork. This juggling act is not easy and depending on the day, can even be trying. Therefore I am asking you, our patients, to understand that we are trying our best all the time. Our only goal is to help you and make you better. When we are delayed and have kept you waiting, it is often because another patient required more time than was allotted. Our goal is to be timely and stay on schedule but we also must be attentive to emergencies and complex medical or surgical problems that arise. If we have failed to explain something to you in a way that you comprehend, tell us. We tend to think in dermatologic language and sometimes forget that some of the words we use are not familiar to you. Our relationship with you is very important to us and we want to be the best, kindest and most gentle dermatologists possible. I am lucky that I have this opportunity to share my thoughts with you which hopefully will allow me to live with less regret. We appreciate that you have chosen to come to UConn Dermatology and hope that your experience with us, in any of our offices, is positive and helpful. - Jane Grant-Kels, M.D.Hartford Psoriasis Network Meeti Ngs, 7PM February 13 and March 13 First Church of Christ, 12 S.

Letter from our Chairman Winter 2014 - News and information from the Department of Dermatology CALENDAR2 Clinical Trials We have several active clinical trials here in the Department of Dermatology. Presently all are for moderate to severe plaque Psoriasis and are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. If you have any questions about clinical research here, please contact Cheryl Martin, RN at 860-679-3475 or e-mail gloriaborders@adp.uchc.edu. A clinical trial, also known as clinical research or a research trial, is a research study in human volunteers in order to answer specific health questions. Clinical trials can take place in a variety of locations, including hospitals, universities, doctors' offices, freestanding research centers or community health clinics. All clinical trials are conducted according to strict scientific and ethical principles. Every clinical trial must have a protocol, or action plan that describes what will be done in the study, how it will be conducted, and why each part of the study is necessary. The protocol will have guidelines about who can participate in the research study. These guidelines are based on such factors as age, type of disease, medical history, and current medical condition. Some research studies seek volunteers with illnesses or conditions to be studied, while other trials need healthy volunteers. Clinical trials are sponsored by government agencies, private organizations, and individual researchers who are seeking ways to improve the health of people who may be living with diseases. Sponsors include: government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies individual researchers health care institutions such as academic medical centers and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Clinical trials are conducted in a series of steps, called phases - each phase is designed to answer a separate research question. Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. Phase II: The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety. Phase III: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. Phase IV: Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Y our participation in any clinical trial is voluntary. Before you volunteer to participate, you will receive an informed consent document that explains the details of the study, including the potential risks and benefits, as well as your rights and responsibilities. A member of the research team will discuss the study with you and answer your questions so you can make an informed decision about whether or not to participate. In addition, you have the right to ask questions throughout the course of the study and may withdraw consent (stop) at any time. This would not affect your regular care at the clinic or with your doctor. Since the decision to volunteer for a clinical trial is a personal one, you should decide by consulting with your health care provider, family members, and friends. Infantile Hemangiomas: New treatments for a common birthmark - Mary Wu Chang, MD Infantile hemangiomas (formerly known as \"strawberry\" or \"cavernous\" hemangio - mas), are red spots, plaques or tumors on the skin that grow in infancy and then eventually shrink. Deep hemangiomas (below the surface of the skin) appear as skin colored to slightly bluish, rounded, soft swellings of the skin. Hemangio - mas occur in about 5 in 100 babies, and can appear at birth or in the first few weeks of life. They are tumors, but they are benign growths. They proliferate rapidly in the first few months of life, and then reach their maximum size around the infant's first birthday. Subsequently, they slowly shrink and fade to skin color but this can take many years: only half will be finished involuting by age 5, 60% will be finished by age 6, 70% by age 7, and so forth. Ultimately, after involution, there can be almost nothing that is noticeable on the skin, or a slight texture change or wrinkling, or a fatty or saggy area of skin. Although the wait can be a long one, in most cases it is best to let nature take its course with periodic monitoring by your primary care physician or dermatologist. In about 20% of hemangiomas, however, treatment is needed to prevent or manage problems. For example, if the hemangioma is located near the eye (especially the upper eyelid), visual development is hindered due to obstruction of vision, or by distorting the lens. Additionally, hemangiomas on the lip or nose may need intervention, as these important structures are easily disfigured. Sometimes, the hemangioma can ulcerate (a common problem for hemangiomas in the diaper area) and this breakdown of skin can be painful, and can cause bleeding or infection. Referral to a pediatric dermatologist is important to evaluate worrisome hemangiomas as early as possible to determine whether treatment interventions are needed. Surprisingly, there are no FDA approved medications for infantile hemangiomas. For many decades, oral corticosteroids were the standard treatment for problematic hemangiomas. Currently the first line treatment for problematic hemangiomas is proprano - lol. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that has been used in adults and children for over forty years as a medication for high blood pressure, stage fright, arrhythmias and other cardiac problems. In 2008, the surprise discovery was made that propranolol shrank hemangiomas faster, safer, and more predictably than oral predni -sone. For hemangioma therapy, propranolol is given by mouth as a liquid three times a day. Usually initiation of therapy requires monitoring for the first few days to ensure stability of blood pressure, pulse and blood sugar, often in young infants this is done in an overnight stay in the hospital. After coming home, monitoring is not necessary but propranolol should always be given with a feeding. The medication is very safe when used properly. Infants with asthma or wheezing may not be able to receive propranolol therapy as it can worsen bronchospasm. Other treatments for hemangiomas include topical timolol (also \"off label,\" for hemangiomas, as it is FDA approved for glaucoma), and pulsed dye laser. Sometimes a combination of therapies is used. Surgery is usually reserved for hemangiomas that are mushroom-shaped (e.g. those that have a \"stalk\"). Propranolol therapy is usually given past the infant's first birthday, and when the hemangioma is appropri - ately involuted. After involution is complete, surgical removal of hemangioma remnants (leftover fatty or sagging skin after full involution) by a knowledgeable plastic or dermatologic surgeon can help kids look their best before kindergarten, but surprisingly, most children do not need surgery. Treatment must be customized on a case by case basis, with consideration given to the age of the infant (younger infant have more potential hemangioma growth ahead), the size and location of the heman - gioma, whether there is an ulceration, and other factors. Discuss these issues with your pediatrician, family practice doctor, or general dermatologist to see if a referral to pediatric dermatology is needed. Latest News... 3 Fighting the Winter Blues: Getting an Adequate Dose of Vitamin D this Winter through Diet - Nikita Lakdawala, MD, PGY 2 Vitamin D has many functions in the body. I t is essential to absorption of calcium and phosphorus necessary for maintaining bone health. Newer evidence also suggests vitamin D deficiency may play a role in development of certain diseases, including some cancers, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and neurocognitive disease, such as depression. 1 Vitamin D deficiency is recognized as a worldwide health problem and particularly common in northern latitudes during winter months. The preva - lence of vitamin D deficiency ranges from 20-80% and rises in the late winter/spring and decreases in the summer. Low vitamin D levels during winter correlates with development of seasonal affect disorder, a form of depression worsened in months when there is minimal sunlight exposure, and supplementation has been pro - posed as a treatment option. 2 How are stores estimated in the body? Stores in the body can be estimated with a blood test, 25-hydroxy vitamin D 25(0H)D, which is readily available. Deficiency is defined by serum levels less than 20 ng/mL. What are the ways to obtain vitamin D? Vitamin D can be obtained from dietary sources and exposure to sunlight. While relatively few foods (e.g. salmon, cod liver oil, tuna) naturally contain vitamin D, dairy products, including milk, yogurt and cheese, certain cereals and juices, are often fortified. 3 Vitamin supplements can also serve an excellent source of the vitamin. Exposure to ultraviolet light, from both outdoor (sun) and indoor (tanning beds) can also serve as a source of vitamin D. However, winter sunlight at latitudes above 35\u00b0, which includes New York City and Boston, lacks the UVB necessary for vitamin D3 synthesis. 1 Moreover, excess exposure to UV radiation increas - es the risk for both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers as well as premature aging of the skin. Therefore, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends a healthy diet to maintain adequate vitamin D stores. 4 How much vitamin D is needed? While there are differing opin - ions on how much vitamin D is needed, currently, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends dietary intake of: 400 IU (International Units) for infants/children 0-1 yr 600 IU for children, teenagers and adults 1-70 yr 800 IU for adults 71+ yr Since sun exposure is variable and overexposure can be dangerous, this recommended daily allowance (RDA) is based on individuals receiving minimal or no sun exposure. 5 In cases of deficiency, higher doses may initially be required. Are there different forms of vitamin D supplements? Yes, two forms biologically inert forms, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), which is plant-derived and vitamin D3, (cholecalciferol), which is obtained through UV exposure and the diet, exist. Both are converted into an active form (1,25 hydroxy-vitamin D). Though some contro - versy exists on whether there are differences in absorption of the two agents, both forms are currently considered equivalent. 6 Given the impact on health and seasonal variation of levels, it is important that individuals be conscious of their intake of vitamin D this winter season.
