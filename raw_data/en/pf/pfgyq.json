Vaccines were used to completely eradicate smallpox, and have greatly decreased the prevalence of many other dangerous diseases. Recently, the safety of vaccines has come under fire for the potentially dangerous effects they may have on young children. Some vaccines have been known to cause [allergic reactions](http://www.flownaturalhealthcare.com/services/naturopathy/allergies/) in certain individuals, and questionable studies have linked vaccines to autism. For these reasons, more and more people are refusing to vaccinate their children. At [Flow Natural Health Care](http://www.flownaturalhealthcare.com/) we believe strongly in the benefits of vaccinations; however, we also believe that the CDC's rigid vaccine schedule for children may not work for every child. The CDC recommends that children receive 25 vaccinations before the age of two. We don't agree with the one-size-fits-all approach to vaccinating children, which is why we offer vaccination consultations. We will thoroughly evaluate your child's specific immune system development and lifestyle to determine which vaccines are necessary and which may not be. We will also use the most current scientifically proven facts about vaccines to educate parents so that they can make informed decisions. We will also look at different ways to bolster your child's immune system and overall health so that they can increase their chances for disease prevention. Every child has specific health needs and their own unique immune system, which is why we believe that the static vaccine schedule that the CDC uses is outdated. We take into account the individual health and risk factors of all of our patients so that we can determine which vaccines to safely give your child, as well as the safest and most effective time to administer those vaccines.
