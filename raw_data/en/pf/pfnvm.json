Optimum immune health heavily relies on foods that provide the necessary vitamins and minerals to enhance the immune function. By Gene Bruno Jul 9, 2021 The \"rainbow ones.\" Yes, you read that correctly. According to Osteopathic Physician and Functional Medicine Practitioner Lisa Ballehr, one must consume \"red apples, potatoes, cherries or grapes; orange sweet potatoes, pumpkin, mango, yams or tangerines; green kiwi, broccoli, olives, limes or grapes; yellow apples, pears, bananas, or pineapple; blueberries, cabbage, kale, grapes or raisins; and tan cauliflower, dates, coconut, nuts or sauerkraut.\" Let's take a look at a few foods that build up the immune system. Enriched with antioxidants, minerals (such as selenium and zinc), and vitamins (like C, A, D and E), fruits boost the immune system, lower inflammation, and enhance nutrient absorption. In short, they are a powerhouse of energy that actively support the immune function, helping to keep us from being affected and falling sick by every other virus that comes our way. With a rich array of fresh fruits available in the market, here are a few you can indulge in: Containing high amounts of vitamin C, these fruits are the strongest immunity boosters. Incorporating these fruits in the daily diet may help combat the common cold, flu, and other infections, viruses, and viral symptoms that otherwise affect the body so easily. The minimum recommended intake amount of vitamin C in men is 90 mg and in women is 75 mg. These also promote the formation of collagen levels in the skin which is important since the skin acts as the first line of defense against pathogens. Oranges - they are one of the world's most popular fruits, packed with several vitamins and minerals like C, B9, B1, copper, and potassium that increase white blood cells and attack free radicals. One big orange or a glass of orange juice consumed daily is ideal for keeping your immunity up. Lemons - Drinking warm lemon water daily is one of the oldest practices to detoxify the body, improve digestion and liver function, and maintain the PH balance in the body. Just like oranges, they are an excellent source of vitamin C and flavonoids, which are antioxidants to boost the immune system. Grapefruits - Another tremendous source of vitamin C is the grapefruit. They are low in calories as they are made up of 88% water and contain a significant amount of fiber and vitamin A that strongly support the immune system. Berries, like citrus fruits, are a great source of vitamin C, flavonoids, and polyphenol. They are known to enhance the immune system, reduce inflammation, and counter cell damage. A berry smoothie, juice, or a simple bowlful mix of different berries daily, such as blueberries, cranberries, and elderberries, can give your body the necessary boost it requires. Elderberry - Lab studies suggest that extract from this berry blocks and fights cold, influenza, and other viruses. Known for its anti-viral, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties, they are power-packed with nutrients, including minerals like iron, potassium, phosphorous, copper, and vitamins, such as A, B, and C, as well as proteins and dietary fibers. Acai berry - Acai berry also stimulates the immune system with anthocyanin, an antioxidant that strengthens defense against stress and various other diseases. Found in some areas of South America, Brazil, and Trinidad, these are being studied as a potential treatment for all kinds of health conditions. There are various other fruits that help the immune system, such as watermelons, kiwis, papayas, apples, pineapples, bananas, pomegranates, etc. When incorporated into a daily diet, these enhance the health and immune system and play a vital role in keeping us fit and active. \"Finish your vegetables.
