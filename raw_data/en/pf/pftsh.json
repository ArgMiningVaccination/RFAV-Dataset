Various vaccines were launched to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the adverse effects of first and second doses of the Sinopharm vaccine among vaccinated medical and dental students and healthcare workers. A well-established questionnaire was distributed online, and 414 medical and dental students and healthcare workers (HCW) comprising 355 females (85.7%) and 59 males (14.3%) participated; all were vaccinated with two doses of Sinopharm. The most common side effect was pain at the injection site after dose one in 253 respondents (61.3%) and after dose two in 161 respondents (38.9%). Other symptoms included general lethargy in 168 (40.6%), myalgia/body pain in 99 (23.9%), low-grade fever in 93 (22.4%), and headache in 87 (21%) respondents. Common side effects reported after the second dose of the vaccine following pain at the injection site included general lethargy in 21.3% (88), headache in 10.4% (43), myalgia/body pain in 9.9% (41), and low-grade fever in 6.1% (25) of the respondents. In conclusion, common adverse effects of the Sinopharm vaccine were pain at the injection site, general lethargy, myalgia, body pain, low-grade fever, and headache. These adverse effects were mild in intensity for both doses but slightly more frequent and severe for the first dose than the second dose.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Adverse Effects of Sinopharm COVID-19 Vaccine among Vaccinated Medical Students and Health Care Workers [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11010105](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11010105) 2022, the disease infected 651,918,402 people and caused 6,656,601 deaths with a case fatality rate of 1.02% [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00105)]. Worldwide, most countries have witnessed about four waves of the deadly pandemic, and the disease caused various clinical manifestations in the general population [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00105), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00105), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00105)]. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious disease and spreads with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00105), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00105)]. The vaccination is highly beneficial to reduce the risk of the infection, severity, and mortality of the disease and is considered a long-term solution to eradicating SARS-CoV-2 [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00105), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00105), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00105)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00105)]. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 new variants threatens global prevention efforts [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00105)] and the impact of mass vaccination campaigns against the COVID-19 pandemic. [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00105)]. This behavior is seen in various ages and professions, including healthcare workers [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00105), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00105)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00105)]. Global climate change, natural resources depletion, and wars are some of the great global challenges of this time in which SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, and that can influence vaccine strategies [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00105)]. Achieving global COVID-19 vaccination targets needs urgent action across regional, national, and global levels to improve the supply of COVID-19 vaccines to low- and middle-income countries [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00105)]. [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00105), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00105)]. Two doses of Sinopharm have an efficacy of 79% [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00105)]. Similar to every other drug or vaccine that promises cure and prevention, it can have adverse effects. The fact is that limited research literature exists on the Sinopharm vaccine and its side effects, despite it being a commonly used vaccine in some countries. This study aims to investigate the adverse effects of the Sinopharm vaccine among medical and dental students and healthcare workers. 2. Subjects and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Settings 2.2. Study Participants 2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 2.4. Sample Size Calculation [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00105)] and using the \"Raosoft\" power calculator [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00105)]. In the metropolitan cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan, regional authorities aim to vaccinate 70% of the population, approximately 35,000 individuals, and a sample size of 380 participants was sufficient to achieve 95% confidence with a 5% margin of error. However, in the present study, 414 medical and dental students and healthcare workers participated. 2.5. Study Questionnaire Development [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00105)]. The final versions of the questionnaire were reviewed by three different faculty members to check the face and content validity. The questionnaire was circulated via a link survey to different platforms on social media and other mailing platforms, such as email and WhatsApp [ [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00105), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00105)]. It was initially distributed to a pilot sample consisting of 10 faculty members to countercheck the validity of the questionnaire and for any technical concerns. We attempted to make the survey as brief and to the point as possible. We explained that the information provided would be only utilized for research purposes because the participants were not identified and had the right to withdraw at any stage. The survey consisted of an initial page for informed consent, and all contributors were allowed to freely choose whether or not to participate. No reward or incentive whatsoever was given to the participants, and the information was kept entirely confidential. The validated, self-administered, electronic questionnaire was then distributed via email, WhatsApp, and social media groups. 2.6. Ethical Statement 2.7. Statistical Analysis 3. Vaccination protects individuals and communities by reducing the spread of diseases within a population, and vaccines are the world's safest tools to protect people from life-threatening diseases. During the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination played a vital role in minimizing COVID-19 cases and deaths [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00105)]. However, worldwide, people have some safety concerns about vaccinations. The fact is that to date, extremely limited research literature exists on the Sinopharm vaccine and its side effects despite it being the most widely administered COVID-19 vaccine in some countries. Once such studies are published from various countries, it will be possible to provide more accurate fact-based conclusions, and it will be much easier to establish future guidelines [ [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00105)]. The present study showed that the most common adverse effects after both dose one and dose two were pain at the injection site, general lethargy, myalgia, body pain, low-grade fever, and headache. The participants experienced symptoms with greater severity and greater frequency of side effects following dose one than dose two. The onset of symptoms postvaccination with dose one and dose two was observed by most participants within 1-4 h and persisted most commonly for 1-2 days. [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00105)]. Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in certain susceptible members of the population at a substantial risk for morbidity or mortality are significant risks, and the treatment options for some of these people are limited. Widespread vaccination programs to prevent infection, while associated with some minimal postvaccination symptoms, serve as a valuable tool in efforts to control the pandemic [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00105)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00105)]. It showed that for the first dose, the most common side effects among the participants were pain at the site of vaccination (42.2%), fatigue (12.2%), and headache (9.6%). There were no side effects for 24.4% of the participants. For the second dose, the most common side effects were pain at the vaccination site (32.6%), fatigue (16.3%), and lethargy (13.7%). No side effects were reported by 14% of the participants [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00105)]. A difference noticed in this study compared to our present study is that our results revealed that headache was not among the top three side effects after the first dose, unlike in their study. [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00105)]. Approximately 88% of healthcare workers reported a sore arm or pain at the injection site as their primary localized side effect followed by localized swelling at the injection site (5.5%), itching (5.4%), lymphadenopathy (axillary or regional) (3.4%), and skin rashes 20 (2.49%). For the participants who received a Pfizer vaccination, swelling at the site of injection was the second most common symptom that occurred, which was not seen in our study as one of the common side effects. No such adverse effects were noted in our study with Sinopharm. Similarly, a study conducted on Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinopharm in Iraq [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00105)] showed the following results regarding the Sinopharm vaccine's side effects: injection site reaction myalgia (36.3%), and headache (33.3%). [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00105)] conducted a study in Thailand and assessed the vaccine safety among participants who were vaccinated. The participants experienced pain at the injection site and tenderness (37.93%), fatigue (37.89%), myalgia (33.56%), and headache (26.76%) as the most common clinical adverse effects. The authors further reported that two doses of the BBIBP-CorV caused mild-to-moderate side effects in adolescents in Thailand. Similarly, Zahid, 2021 [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00105)] conducted a study and investigated the side effects resulting from the first and second doses of different vaccines used in Bahrain. The author observed that recipients of the Sinopharm vaccine reported the mildest side effects among all four vaccines. [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00105)] conducted a study in Jordan and Saudi Arabia and reported that the most frequently administered vaccines were \"Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca\" vaccines. The participants reported the adverse effects, which were mainly \"fatigue, menstrual disturbances, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness, and headache.\" There was no statistically significant association between age, gender, or medical history with adverse events. The collective symptoms of \"fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness, and headache\" were significantly associated with the Sinopharm vaccine. All these studies conducted in different countries highlighted various adverse events of COVID-19 vaccination. Similarly, the present study findings showed more or less the same adverse effects of pain at the injection site, general lethargy, myalgia, low-grade fever, and headaches as the most common side effects of the Sinopharm vaccine. 5.
