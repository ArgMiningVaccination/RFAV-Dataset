A very unpleasant experience if you haven't experienced it yourself. Have had no stones since and take only 2 capsules every morning. I'd swear that the medical profession won't tell you about this stuff because it would put them out of business. \"I have not had stones in over 2 years!\" I started taking Kidney COP, over 2 years ago. I used to get stones about once every year to year and 1/2. I initially spoke to my urologist about this, he po poed it. Since I've been taking I have not had a stone. If I do not have to see my urologist again, it is well worth it Thomas Powell | February 2023 \"After 24 months...no growth of existing stones and no new stones!\" I am very pleased with Kidney C.O.P. After suffering a kidney stone attack that required hospitalization in the beginning of 2020, I decided to start taking this supplement. The surgery took care of the \"big one\", but I still did have two small stones, one in each kidney. After two years along with a recent visit to my urologist, these stones have not increased in size and there were no other ones detected. What's funny is that I even own a health food company and prefer to use this product instead the other supplements/herbs that I normally sell in our retail stores...that's how much I believe in this product (hoping to carry this soon in our stores!). I am very thankful that Mr. Hayer developed this formula. It's not very often that a supplement comes along and changes your life for the better. Not worrying about when the next kidney stone attack may come has been very life altering. Thank you again for the great customer service and the ingenuity! \"Kidney Cop works\" I have been taking kidney cop for 5 years now and not had another stone since. Normally I had them at least every 2 years. I HAVE HAD KIDNEY STONES 15 TIMES since my early 30's and I should have 15 children to show for the pain. (It feels a lot like labor pain) just to give the guys somewhat of an example. Kidney Cop works ! It works! Amazon Shopper | June 19, 2022 \"Kidney Cop is a literal life saver\" First let me say that Kidney Cop is a literal life saver for me. I started taking it last year when I found out I had a 17mm stone that was causing me huge pain. What I did not know at the time was that I also had kidney cancer. I had to have the kidney removed and the doctor was worried about my remaining kidney because I'm prone to stones. By the time I had the kidney removed, I had been taking Kidney Cop for about 3 months. The pathology report showed a very rare type of cancer that has a 10% survival rate but because the stone caused me so much pain... Cassandra Villianos | June 9 2022 \"Best treatment option out there for calcium oxalate stones!\" Brace yourselves; a long and detailed review is coming. Let me start by saying I am a 33 year old female of all of 104 pounds and have been dealing with SERIOUS oxalate issues since my early 20s (for reasons, modern medicine of course, just \"can't figure out\"....what's new there?) and by serious I don't mean I get a kidney stone or 2 a year or have had 1 or 2 lithotripsies or even that I have experienced the joy of having a stone LODGED in my ureter. Visit the Reviews page for the unbelievable full story Erica Yaworski | November 19, 2021 \"I will take it till I die! Thank you so much! Changed my life\" I've produced kidney stones for 40 years. Last June I became aware of more stones and an X-ray showed a 6mm & a 4 mm in the right kidney and multiple smaller 1-2 mm in the left. I began taking Kidney COP and my MRI in August showed the 6 had become a 5mm and the 4mm was now a 3mm. A couple months later I passed... Leslie B. Glesmann | January 19, 2021 \"I'm not having any kidney stone pain\" I started a job in 2015 where my desk was about 20 feet away from a drink machine. The machine had Fuze strawberry iced tea. It taste really great, and I drank about four bottles per day while at work. Within five months the oxalates in the tea coated my kidneys interior so badly that I urinated blood and a CAT scan showed I had 22... Tom Sawyer | January 16, 2021 \"NO Stones!\" I've been taking these about a year now and can say I believe they are helping. I had X-rays done about 14 months ago with a 6 mm stone in my right kidney. 3 months ago had another X-ray and they can no longer see that stone. I was seeing my urologist every 6 months now he says once a year should be good. I was... \"It really works for me!\" Prior to finding Kidney C.O.P. I was having Kidney Stone attacks 4 to 5 times a year. Approximately 18 months ago I started taking Kidney C.O.P. and I haven't had an attack since! I don't have to tell you I don't miss the pain, nausea and sweats that came with each attack. I highly recommend it. James T. Casey | October 5, 2020 \"This stuff WORKS!\" This stuff works. Eliminated 17 stones in 12 months. Verified with an ultrasound. My doctor could not believe it. \"Really Works for calcium oxalate kidney stones!\" I am a 68 year old retired chiropractor who has always been into nutrition and supplements. My kidneys have been making calcium oxalate stones since 1990. My 29 year old son also has the same problem and we both agree, this formula really works! Keep your meat protein low and your water intake high and your stones will... \"Feeling great. I asked my urologist about this product.\" This is a life saver! This will keep the kidney stones away. I had my attack on Nov 29,2017. After difficult surgery and stent removal, now finally feeling great thanks to Kidney COP. I asked my urologist about this product and showed her the bottle and she said \"looks great, includes supplements I would have suggested to include... Tami Stickney | March 14, 2018 \"I am a doctor and highly recommend this product.\" I suffer from kidney stones periodically. I am a physician so as such did a lot of research before taking the plunge into preventative treatments. This product is one I highly recommend. It uses safe and naturally-found active ingredients that have been proven and has the studies to back it. It's the real deal. Product is made in... Dr Huebner | December 27, 2017 \"I have not had stones in over 2 years!\" I had my first kidney stones about 12 years ago. I was having lithotripsy on both kidneys about every 9 to 12 months. It was a nightmare! I found these on Amazon and after reading the reviews I decided I had nothing to lose. I have not had stones in over 2 years. I will keep taking ! I highly recommend. \"MAGICAL PILLS! AMAZING PREVENTATIVE APPROACH\" I cannot even begin to explain how MAGICAL these pills are! Unfortunately, I have congenital MSK (medullary sponge kidney), a condition that makes me more prone to forming an insane amount of calcium oxalate kidney stones. I first had 14 kidney stones bilaterally when I was about 18 years old. I'd be in and out of the ER for... \"Works as advertised.\" I had seven (7) large kidney stones about 7 years ago that required two (2) lithotripsy procedures to break up. Six months ago I started having that familiar kidney pain and have five (5) more small stone. I was basically told by to just tough it out and wait till they pass by two different urologists. Living on pain pills to dull... Patrick | December 1, 2018 \"Since taking Kidney COP, I have not had kidney stones!\" After experiencing regular bouts with kidney stones, and on the advice of a doctor friend, I started taking Kidney COP a couple of months ago. Since taking Kidney COP, I have not had kidney stones! It is an amazing product and I highly recommend it. \"Kidney Stone relief.\" My third bottle of the Kidney COP and so far I haven't had any recurring of kidney stones. After four episodes and surgeries of kidney stones I had to do something and a friend told me about the KIDNEY COP and so far it's working great, I will stay on it forever and it's not expensive at all and worth every penny. Julianna Shaffer | December 22, 2017 \"IT WORKS !!! Chanca Piedra did NOT!\" Tried the Chianca Piedra prior to this for two months and did nothing. Doctor told me I had 3 kidney stones and may require surgery since one was more than 6 mm. Bought Kidney COP and within a week, one (of the three) kidney stones I had came out and looked smoothed out (I usually get the spikey or thorny stones). After two... J. Port | November 5, 2018 \"Amazing product!\" I didn't buy this for kidney stones, I bought it to minimize calcium oxalate which is a suspected culprit in aggravating interstitial cystitis and vulvodynia. I had a severe flare-up of these conditions a few weeks ago and took to the internet to find out if there were new developments in treating it. One theory is that calcium oxalate... \"Medullary Sponge Cystic Kidneys (MSK) or Oxilate Stones Must Try - Updated 2019\" Much Thanks to this product!!

It's a good preventive measure for kidney stones. My doctor has told me and I have also read that if one gets a kidney stone, chances are they will get another one. I have changed my diet as that may be a partial reason, as well as taking Kidney Cop. It's been a year since I had a kidney... airplaneguy53 | April 18, 2019 \"Actually works to reduce the occurrence of renal calculi.\" This product is easy to take II PO Q12h (orally every 12 hours). No recognizable side effect. I've tried everything advertised on the internet and prescribed by Urologists. This is the only thing that has actually worked to reduce the occurrence of renal calculi.
