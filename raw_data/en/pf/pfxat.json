He loves kids and babies. I love how he listens to all my questions and answers them. His staff is very respectful and I am normally in the exam room within 5 min. of my appointment time. They are willing to let me delay vaccinations, but not choose to have no vaccinations. I also found him pushy after my kids became teenagers. He wanted me to leave the room during the exam and was upset when I refused. I have Dr. Cormier for my teenage daughters. They wanted a female pediatrician who was down to earth.\" \"Our pediatrician is Chris Smeltzer at Old Harding Pediatrics. I recommend him for several reasons: He listens to what I have to say; is good at talking/distracting with my 3 year old (who freaks out whenever we go to the doctor's office; won't even let the nurses put him on the scale without a fight); doesn't make things seem like a big deal, but competent; when I talk to him he sounds like he is keeping up with the current research in medicine; and he's never talked down to me or made me feel like an idiot because I was worried about something that turned out to be nothing.\" Laura C.
