References-1 INDEX ........................................................................................ Index-1 PREFACE Purpose This publication serves as a guide and a reference for trained members of the Armed Forces Medical Services and other medically qualified personnel on the recognition and treatment of biological warfareviiFM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C (BW) agent casualties. Information contained in this publication may also be relevant for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with naturally acquired diseases or illnesses due to pathogens with BW potential. Scope a.This publication\u0097 (1) Classifies and describes potential BW agents. (2) Provides procedures for collecting, handling and labeling, shipping, and identifying potential BW agents. (3) Describes procedures for medical diagnosing, treating, and management of BW casualties.(4) Describes medical management and treatment in BW operations. b.The material in this publication is applicable to both the conventional battlefield and the integrated environment of the battlefield. (For the purpose of this publication, the \u0093integrated environment\u0094is intended to mean warfare and/or contingency operations where nuclear, biological, and chemical [NBC]weapons/agents are being employed or have a high probability of being employed in addition to conventionalweapons.) c.The treatment modalities contained in this manual differ from standard textbooks in that they apply to BW agent exposures. The method of exposure for most BW agents is by inhalation; whereas, theendemic disease exposure (if applicable) is by other means. Some are by ingestion, some by arthropodbites, and others by dermal contact with the agent. This does not preclude service members becoming BWcasualties by these means. d.The use of the term \u0093level of care\u0094 in this publication is synonymous with \u0093echelon of care\u0094 and \u0093role of care.\u0094 The term \u0093echelon of care\u0094 is the old North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) term.The term \u0093role of care\u0094 is the new NATO and American, British, Canadian, and Australian (ABCA) term. Standardization Agreements This manual is in consonance with the following NATO Standardization Agreements (STANAGs) and ABCA Quadripartite Standardization Agreements (QSTAGs): NATO TITLE STANAG QSTAG Warning Signs for the Marking of Contaminated or Dangerous Land Areas, Complete Equipments Supplied and Stores 2002 Reporting Nuclear Detonations, Biological and Chemical Attacks, and Predicting and Warning of Associated Hazards and Hazard Areas 2103 187 First Aid and Hygiene Training in NBC Operations 2358viiiFM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C User Comments Users of this publication are encouraged to submit recommendations to improve the publication.

Gender StatementUnless this publication states otherwise, masculine nouns and pronouns do not refer exclusively to men.Use of Trade Names/TrademarksUse of trade names/trademarks in this publication is for illustrative purposes only. Their use does not constitute endorsement by the Department of Defense (DOD). ReferencesReferences listed should be consulted for details beyond the scope collected? Who has maintained custody of the sample/specimen? What has been done with the sample/specimen at each change of custody? CAUTION Each change of custody must be recorded with date and time of change. b.The samples/specimens must be appropriately packaged, labeled, and evacuated to the designated laboratory for confirmation of a BW attack. The standard chain of custody for sample/specimenevacuation is as follows: Sampling unit. Unit S2 (Intelligence Officer [US Army]), medical operations officer, or other designated person. Technical escort unit or other command-designated escort personnel. In-theater supporting medical laboratory, if in operation. Continental US laboratory. 1-12. Identification Methods for Biological Warfare AgentsThe following are identification methods for BW agents: Isolation of the etiologic agent by culture (possible in one to two days for some agents). Detection of agents by enzyme immunoassay, mass spectrometry, animal inoculation, or other methods. Antibody detection (specific immunoglobulin [IgM] may appear within 3 days). Genome detection by PCR. Detection of metabolic products of the infectious or toxic agent in Endemic Disease versus Biological Agent. Specific therapies are discussed for each agent. Most of these are based on standard treatment guidelines. However, some of the prophylaxis regimens and therapies recommended in this manual vary from those found in standard references and may include off-label indications. This is because\u2014 A BW exposure (aerosol) may produce a disease with clinical features different from the naturally occurring disease. For example, inhalation (BW) versus cutaneous (endemic) anthrax. Cases ofendemic disease due to inhalation of some of these agents are rare and clinical experience is limited. Humanchallenge studies can be done with only a limited number of agents for obvious ethical and safety reasons.Accordingly, some of the prophylactic and treatment regimens have been developed from in vitro studies,animal models, and limited human data. An adversary may develop a BW agent resistant to the standard antibiotic therapy. b. Endemic Disease Therapy. For endemic and epidemic disease therapies, see FM 8-33 and the civilian textbooks listed in the references. 1-14. Case Reporting and Epidemiological Assessment It is imperative that clinicians report cases of suspected BW-related illnesses to the appropriate line and medical chains of command. Prompt epidemiological investigations must begin and preventive measuresimplemented to control the disease or reduce the number of cases. \u0090 1-15. Prevention Most morbidity and mortality preventable . Immunizations, pre-exposure chemo-prophylaxes, and protective clothing available to provide protection.Personnel must have all required immunizations administered prior to entering an AO where BW agentemployment is a threat. All immunizations should be administered in sufficient time to provide the initialprotection before troops are deployed to the AO; when administration prior to deployment is impossible,troops must receive the immunizations as soon as the mission permits in the AO. Some immunizations areused in conjunction with pre-exposure provideprotection. The assist commanders in determining whichspecific immunizations and chemoprophylaxes are required for the AO. The corps/division/wing/equivalentservice/joint task force commander will decide whether to begin, continue, or discontinue the administrationof chemoprophylaxes based on the BW threat. The intelligence officer, chemical officer, and surgeon advisethe commander on appropriate courses of action. For those BW agents that a specific immunization is notavailable, the use of protective equipment combined with chemoprophylaxes may be employed to provideprotection. a. Active Immunization . As of January 1999, vaccines are available for the following potential standard precautions as outlined in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals will be followed. If plague, smallpox, and viral hemorrhagic fevers(VHF) can be reasonably excluded on the basis of analysis of clinical specimens and environmentalsamples, patients may be evacuated using Standard Precautions and the disease-specific precautions discussedfor each suspect BW agent in the following chapters. (3) Biological warfare attacks may occur with multiple agents with short and prolonged incubation times (botulinum toxin, 12 to 36 hours and smallpox, 7 to 17 days). Multiple agents can lead tothe presence of coinfection-acute illness with short incubation and incubating smallpox (which may declareitself after patients have been evacuated for evaluation/treatment of the short incubating disease). Therefore,consideration should be given to quarantining patients for 17 days after AE from the BW area if plague orsmallpox cannot be excluded. Reevaluate patients carefully for recurrent fever or other changes in clinicalstatus. If clinical or laboratory findings suggest prodromal or syndromic smallpox, plague, or VHFs,institute appropriate isolation until the diagnosis is clarified. Specific control measures must be applied aspresented for the following diseases/BW agent casualties: (a)Plague. Plague is an internationally quarantinable disease (IQD). Do not evacuate across international borders unless authorized by the theater surgeon. Evacuate in cohorts of plaguepatients only on dedicated AE aircraft; treat in theater. Pneumonic plague is highly transmissible person-to-person. Droplet precautions are added to standard precautions for patients with pneumonic plague untilsputum cultures are negative. (b)Smallpox. Currently eradicated and no longer listed as IQD. Immediately notify the line and medical chain of command upon diagnosis. Do not evacuate across international borders unlessauthorized by the theater surgeon. Evacuate in cohorts of smallpox patients only on dedicated AE aircraft;treat in theater. Smallpox is transmissible person-to-person. Strict quarantine is required. Standard,contact, and airborne isolation precautions are to be observed. All contacts should be vaccinated andquarantined/grouped together for at least 17 days following the most recent exposure. (c)Viral hemorrhagic fevers. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not require quarantine for hemorrhagic fevers, with the exception of yellow fever. However, due to internationalconcerns, do not evacuate hemorrhagic fever patients across international borders unless authorized by thetheater surgeon. Evacuate in cohorts of hemorrhagic fever patients only on dedicated AE aircraft. Medicalevacuation may result in increased morbidity and mortality for patients with hemorrhagic fever; treatment ata local facility is preferred. Person-to-person transmission is possible for the duration of illness. Ifnecessary, patients may be evacuated using standard, contact, plus respiratory droplet isolation precautions. (d)Infectious disease of unknown etiology. Evaluate patient evacuation risk based on the patients' signs/symptoms complex and theater threat list. Assume infection with the agent requiring themost stringent infection control procedures (based on the possible threats in the theater and the clinicalpicture). Ensure that appropriate patient care is performed while providing the crew and aircraft with thehighest level of protection. (e)Summary. In summary, many BW agent casualties may be safely evacuated using basic infection control guidelines. Plague, smallpox, and the hemorrhagic fevers pose 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C These patient movements will require approval of the destination country, over-flight privileges, and approval of any country where the aircraft will land for servicing or where patients will remain overnight.Countries from which approval is sought are bound by Article 37 of the Geneva Conventions for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949 to ensure humanitarian treatment to wounded and sick. That should include approval under most circumstancesof transit of those injured by exposure to biological agents. Additionally, some countries, notably Germany,have already developed procedures for expedited approval of transit of dangerous/hazardous goods in their airspace. That information is contained in the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide. Coordination between the theateror USTRANSCOM commander/surgeon and the Department of State is required for such movements. 1-22. Aeromedical Isolation Team The USAMRIID maintains an aeromedical isolation team (AIT). The AIT is a rapid response team with worldwide airlift capability. The AIT is designed to safely evacuate and manage patients with potentiallylethal communicable diseases under high-level containment. Indications for deployment include cases of ahighly contagious, lethal, or unidentified disease, including cases from a suspect BW attack. Diagnosis andmedical care will be provided at USAMRIID. The AIT can only transport a limited number of patients.The AIT CANNOT provide for mass casualty evacuation. Such evacuation can enhance early identification of a BW agent; thus, enabling early development of treatment recommendations for medical providers in theTO. The AIT also offers a portable containment laboratory, limited environmental decontamination, andspecialized consultative expertise. \u00901-23. Investigational New Drugs and Off-Label Indications a.On 30 September 1999, the President of the United States issued Executive Order (EO) 13139, Improving Health Protection of Military Personnel Participating in Particular Military Operations, whichoutlines the conditions under which investigational new drugs (IND) and off-label pharmaceuticals could beadministered to US service members. This publication discusses numerous pharmaceutical products, someof which are IND. In certain other cases, licensed pharmaceuticals are discussed for use in a manner or fora condition other than that for which they are licensed (Example: An off-label indication). b.Executive Order 13139 does not intend to alter the traditional physician-patient relationship or individual physician prescribing practices. Health care providers remain free to exercise clinical judgmentand prescribe licensed pharmaceutical products as they deem appropriate for the optimal care of theirpatients. This policy does, however, potentially influence recommendations that might be made by USgovernment agencies and that might be applied to large numbers of service members outside of theindividual physician-patient relationship. Key summary points from EO 13139 include: The EO describes the Secretary of Defense responsibilities regarding the use of IND products or off-label use of products as antidotes to chemical, biological, or radiological weapons. The EO stipulates that the US Government will administer only FDA-approved products for their labeled uses. (However, off-label indications and IND usage rules may apply as discussed belowand in other areas of this publication.)1-19C1, P-5042)/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C The details IND product use parameters and controls. The EO requires individual service member informed consent before IND administration. However, only the President may waive this informed consent requirement upon request of the Secretary ofDefense if\u2014 Service member informed consent is not feasible. Informed consent is contrary to the best interest of the service member. Obtaining informed consent is not in the best interest of national security.2-1C1, FM 8-284/NTRP 4-02.23 (NAVMED P-5042)/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C CHAPTER 2 BACTERIAL AGENTS Section I. INTRODUCTION 2-1. General Bacterial organisms comprise the greatest number of pathogens in the list of potential BW agents. They include the etiologic agents of anthrax, brucellosis, cholera, glanders, melioidosis, plague, Q fever, andtularemia. Of these, anthrax is the most likely BW threat that troops will encounter in an AO. SeeAppendix B for guidance on medical management of BW agent casualties. Section II. ANTHRAX 2-2. General a. Etiologic The spores of Bacillus anthracis , an encapsulated gram-positive bacillus. Sporulation occurs under adverse environmental conditions and when vegetative bacteria are exposed to air;the spores are extremely hardy and can survive extremes of temperature, dryness, and flooding. Whenconditions improve, the spores germinate to produce vegetative bacteria. b. Reservoir. The soil, with worldwide distribution. c. Transmission. The stage in the bacterial life cycle, which poses a health hazard, is the spore. Grazing animals contract spores from the vegetation. Humans contract spores via contact with infectedanimals, their hides, wool, or other products; from ingesting contaminated meat; or from inhaling sporesduring the processing of wool for textiles. Biting flies in sub-Saharan Africa may also transmit anthrax tohumans. Humans usually do not contract anthrax directly from the soil, unless they work with fertilizers(bonemeal) prepared from infected animals. Also, humans can contract spores from inhalation of aerosolizedspores released during a BW attack. d. Endemic Disease. Endemic infectious disease is contracted by inhalation, cutaneous exposure, oropharyngeal exposure, and ingestion. (1) Cutaneous anthrax accounts for more than 90 percent of all anthrax cases worldwide. Disease results when Bacillus anthracis spores are introduced into the skin via inoculation of small cuts/ abrasions or inapparent skin lesions. It may possibly be introduced by biting flies. Cutaneous anthraxfeatures a painless necrotic ulcer with a black eschar and local edema. The case fatality rate for untreatedcutaneous anthrax is up to 20 percent, but with early, effective therapy is reduced to less than 5 percent. (2) Oropharyngeal and GI diseases occur following the ingestion of anthrax spores, usually from consuming meat from infected animals. The clinical features of oropharyngeal and GI anthrax arediscussed below in 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C (3) Inhalation anthrax occurs when individuals working with animal hides, wool, or bonemeal inhale the spores. Also, inhalation anthrax may occur from inhalation of aerosolized spores released during a BW attack. The clinical features of inhalation anthrax are discussed below in paragraph 2-6. 2-3. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery Aerosolized spores may be delivered by missiles, bomblets, artillery fires, point release, or airborne line release. Contamination of food and water may also be used. 2-4. Environmental Detection Nuclear, biological, and chemical teams or other bioenvironmental engineering (BEE) personnel operating similar detection equipment accomplish detection. Preventive medicine/PHS/BEE personnel performdetection in water supplies. Detection in food supplies may be performed by veterinary, PVNTMED, orPHS personnel. Detection in animals may be performed by veterinary personnel. 2-5. Prevention a. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. Prevention may be accomplished by immunization plus chemoprophylaxis. (1)Immunization . Anthrax vaccine is given in six doses at 0, 2, and 4 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months, with annual boosting. A minimum of three doses administered within 6 months prior to the exposure may confer protective immunity. \u0090 (2)Chemoprophylaxis . While the FDA has not approved the use of pre-exposure antibiotics, empiric evidence indicates their use may significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. Therefore, they should be considered for use on a case-by-case basis and used as indicated for post-exposure preventivemeasures. Such use would require application of IND protocols (see paragraph 1-23). b. Post-exposure Prophylaxis. Use immunization with chemoprophylaxis to prevent the clinical manifestation of the disease. (1)Anthrax vaccine . For personnel who have completed the six-dose series and are up to date on boosters, or who have received at least three initial doses within 6 months prior to exposure, no additional doses are indicated, except to complete the series as previously scheduled. For personnel whohave not received any immunizations, begin series and give a minimum of three doses; complete the six-dose series, if possible. Use of anthrax vaccine post-exposure requires application of an IND protocol. \u0090 (2)Chemoprophylaxis . Chemoprophylaxis is recommended as an adjunct to immunization for post-exposure prophylaxis. All personnel exposed to aerosolized anthrax should be administered Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride tablets (500 mg) orally every 12 hours for 60 days. When Ciprofloxacin2-3C1, FM 8-284/NTRP 4-02.23 (NAVMED P-5042)/AFMAN are not available, doxycycline hyclate tablets (100 mg) should be taken orally every 12 hours for 60 days. The duration of chemoprophylaxis administration for individuals without receipt ofany vaccine should be extended until they receive at least three doses of vaccine. Chemoprophylaxis shouldbe withdrawn under careful observation and with access to an MTF with intensive care and consultativeassets. If fever develops following the withdrawal of chemoprophylaxis, empiric therapy for anthrax isindicated pending etiologic diagnosis. 2-6. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation Period. The incubation for anthrax is hours to 7 days. Most cases present within 48 hours post-exposure. b. Signs and Symptoms. (1)Inhalation anthrax . Inhalation anthrax will begin with nonspecific symptoms of fever, malaise, and fatigue. A nonproductive cough and vague chest discomfort may be present. These initial symptoms may be followed by a short period of symptomatic improvement, hours to 3 days in duration.This will be followed by an acute phase, including the abrupt onset of severe respiratory distress withdyspnea, stridor, diaphoresis, and cyanosis. Bacteremia and toxemia, septic shock, metastatic infection (meningitis in approximately 50 percent of the cases), and death usually occurs within 24 to 36 hours from the onset of the acute phase. (2)Oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal anthrax . Oropharyngeal or GI anthrax can occur following ingestion of food contaminated with anthrax spores. (a) Oropharyngeal anthrax will present with initial symptoms of fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. The disease may progress to an acute phase with symptoms including a necroticulcer or eschar involving the hard palate, tonsils, or posterior oropharyngeal wall, edema of cervical tissues(possibly resulting in upper airway obstruction), and cervical lymphadenopathy. Most acute cases progressto septic shock and death. (b) Gastrointestinal anthrax begins with vague initial symptoms featuring fever, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Abdominal pain, bloody vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and possibly massive abdominalswelling (ascites) may follow these symptoms. Also, septic shock and death may follow these symptoms. 2-7. Diagnosis During the incubation period, nasal swabs and specimens of respiratory secretions sent for PCR are the most important diagnostic specimens. During the early disease, blood and respiratory secretions may besent for rapid identification by genetic typing (PCR). A rapid diagnostic test is available that detects toxinantigens in the blood during the acute phase. Chest x-ray may be normal or show hilar adenopathy early inthe illness and may show a widened mediastinum and pleural during a. Categories . Patients presenting with initial signs of inhalation anthrax should be placed in the Immediate category, as early aggressive treatment is lifesaving. Depending on the numbers of cases and available resources, patients presenting in the acute phase of inhalation anthrax should be placed in theImmediate or Expectant categories. b. Medical Management . (1) Supportive care includes maintaining the airway, providing resuscitative fluids, and providing vasopressors as indicated for shock. (2) Specific therapy includes the administration of ciprofloxacin (400 mg intravenous [IV] every 12 hours) or doxycycline (200 mg IV loading dose, followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours). Specifictherapy may also include administration of penicillin (4 million units IV) every 4 hours, if isolate is sensitiveto penicillin. (3) A tracheostomy is indicated for upper airway obstruction due to oropharyngeal anthrax. Surgical debridement of cutaneous lesions is contraindicated. Surgical drainage of the mediastinum forinhalation anthrax is not recommended. c. Prognosis . The number of cases of inhalation anthrax occurring during the antibiotic era is too small to establish case fatality rates and efficacy of treatment. Almost all inhalation anthrax cases inwhich treatment was begun after onset of significantly severe symptoms have been fatal, regardless oftreatment. Despite medical therapy, most patients with inhalation anthrax die within 24 hours of the onsetof the acute phase of the illness. However, in nonhuman primate trials, animals have responded to aggressivetherapy. The prognosis for oropharyngeal and GI anthrax is poor, with case fatality rates 50 to 100 percent,even with aggressive therapy. 2-9. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Report all cases to line and medical chains of command. Employ Standard Precautions for handling, treating, and moving all active cases. Use sporicidal agents, such as disinfectant strength iodophors, in MTFs for general area disinfection. Antiseptic strength iodophors are not sporicidal. Hypochlorite solutions may be attenuated by organic matter, but will provide a disinfectant capability when used in a 5-percent solution. The hypochloritesolution should be replaced frequently. Autoclaving, steam sterilizing, or burning is required for completeeradication of spores. 2-10. Medical Evacuation Patients with anthrax may be evacuated with other categories of patients. Anthrax is not transmissible person to person. Standard Precautions should be observed during evacuation.2-5FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) nonmotile bacteria consisting of short, gram-negative coccoid bacillus. There are four members of the genus Brucella that are human Reservoir . The following are reservoirs in nature for the disease: \u0095Brucella melitensis . Primarily sheep, goats, and camels. It may also be found in bison, elk, caribou, and some species of deer. \u0095Brucella abortus . Cattle. \u0095Brucella suis . Swine. \u0095Brucella canis. Dogs and coyotes. The organisms may be produced in a laboratory for BW purposes, using a single cell or a small amount of the organism from a natural source. c. Transmission. The disease is transmitted to humans by\u0097 \u0095 Inhalation of aerosols or dusts that contain organisms. \u0095 Ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products and contaminated meat.\u0095 Inoculation of abraded skin or mucosal surfaces. d. Endemic Disease. (1)Pathogenesis . Following introduction into the body, Brucella organisms are phagocytized by polymorphonuclear or mononuclear cells and are transported to regional lymph nodes. However,Brucella organisms can survive intracellularly. This results in the release of bacteria from lysed cells, resulting in hematogenous metastasis to other organs, particularly organs high in reticuloendothelial content(notably the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and possibly, the lungs). (2)Acute disease . Onset may be sudden or insidious (in approximately one half of all cases) with nonspecific symptoms of fever, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and depression. Illnesspersists as a systemic illness, with or without localizing signs and symptoms. Fever can be intermittent.Physical examinations may be unrevealing or may disclose fever, mild lymphadenopathy, andhepatosplenomegaly. Disease localization can occur, usually in tissues content.2-6FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C (3)Osteoarticular . Bone and joint disease is the most common localizing complications, occurring in up to 40 percent of cases. These include bursitis, sacroiliitis, spondylitis, peripheral in cordcompression, and psoas abscess. In addition to developing pyogenic septic osteoarticular infection, patientsmay also develop reactive arthropathies. Diagnostic studies can include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),computed tomography (CT), and technetium bone scans; plain radiographs may be insensitive early in disease. (4)Pulmonary infection . Although the respiratory tract is a portal of entry for brucellosis, pulmonary disease is rare, under 15 percent. Complications may include hilar and paratracheal adenopathy,interstitial pneumonia, or epididymo-orchitis are the most common genitourinary (GU) complications, usually in the absence of systemic symptoms or signs. Intrapartuminfection is rare, but can result in abortion although there is no convincing evidence that the risk is higherthan that of other bacteremic infections. Early diagnosis and therapy will prevent an adverse outcome.Chronic pyelonephritis has been reported as a rare complication. (6)Cardiovascular. Endocarditis occurs in less than 2 percent of the cases, but accounts for most deaths from brucellosis. Other cardiovascular complications may include pericarditis, myocarditis,and mycotic aneurysms. (7)Neurologic. Acute or chronic meningitis occurs in less than 2 percent of the cases. Depression, fatigue, and headache occurring in most cases represent nonspecific features of systemic disease. 2-12. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is by aerosol release. A foodborne brucellosis attack is unlikely, but could be executed. 2-13. Environmental Detection Currently, detection is primarily by laboratory analysis of specimens from patients presenting with the illness or by laboratory testing of foods for the organism. Veterinary/PVNTMED/ PHS/BEE personnelshould collect samples from dairy products and other food items suspected of being contaminated with theorganism. Field NBC reconnaissance teams may collect the agent from an aerosol cloud, but must rely onthe supporting medical laboratory for identification. 2-14. Prevention a. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. Vaccines are not currently available for human use; attenuated vaccines for veterinary use have caused brucellosis following accidental percutaneous or mucous membrane exposures.Chemoprophylaxis has not been proven to be effective and may delay or mask the onset of the disease.2-7FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 3- to 6-week course of therapy is advised following high-risk exposures to attenuated vaccines for veterinary use, which have been associated with human disease.Accordingly, a full course of therapy (see paragraph 2-17) is advised for exposed personnel following aproven brucellosis BW attack. Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is generally not advised following possiblenatural exposures to endemic disease. Personnel must avoid consuming unpasteurized dairy products oruncooked foods containing the dairy products and avoid contact with suspect infected animals. 2-15. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. Incubation varies from 5 days to 8 weeks, usually 2 to 8 weeks. b. Signs and Symptoms. See endemic disease above. 2-16. Diagnosis A definitive diagnosis is made by culturing the organism from blood, bone marrow, or other clinical specimens. The laboratory should be advised to maintain cultures for at least 4 weeks, as Brucella species grow slowly in vitro. The sensitivity of cultures varies with clinical specimens; 15 to 70 percent for blood,greater than 90 percent for bone marrow. Isolates may be misidentified as Moraxella or Haemophilus species in automated bacterial identification systems that lack specific profiles for Brucella species. Submit specimens for ELISA testing and PCR. Serologic tests are valuable for diagnosis. Most patients withbrucellosis will have serum-agglutinating titers (SAT) of 1:160 or greater; lower titers must be analyzedwithin the patient\u0092s clinical context. The SAT will not detect antibodies to Brucella canis; a specific test is required. False negative tests may occur because of blocking antibodies; dilution to 1:320 or a Coomb\u0092stest is indicated for suspected cases with negative titers. 2-17. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary with conditions and available resources. Given the subacute nature of brucellosis, most patients are candidates for the Delayed treatment category. b. Medical Management . (1)Undifferentiated febrile illness . Antibiotic therapy requires a combination of two medications. Administer\u0097 \u0095 Doxycycline, 200 mg, daily for 6 weeks and rifampin, 600 mg, daily for 6 weeks or\u0095 Doxycycline, 200 mg, daily for 6 weeks and streptomycin, 1 gm intramuscularly (IM), daily for 2 weeks. (2)Osteoarticular disease . Treat as indicated in (1) above, but extend therapy to 12 weeks.2-8FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C (3)Endocarditis . Administer antibiotic therapy as indicated in (1) above. Optimal duration of therapy is undefined; however, treatment is often continued for 6 to 9 months. Surgical heart valvereplacement is usually necessary for total cure and should be strongly considered. (4)Central nervous system (CNS) disease . Administer antibiotic therapy as indicated in (1) above, but extend therapy for 6 to 9 months. (5)Abscesses . In addition to treatment in (1) above, drainage of abscesses should be done as surgically indicated. c. Prognosis. The case fatality rate for untreated brucellosis has historically been less than 2 percent. Most fatalities in untreated cases result from endocarditis due to Brucella melitensis . Untreated brucellosis may result in severe morbidity for months, and occasionally years. 2-18. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions for disease control. The disease is not communicable from person to person. 2-19. Medical Evacuation Patients with brucellosis are evacuated with other patients. Apply Standard Precautions for disease control. Section IV. MELIOIDOSIS 2-20. General gram-negative aerobic bacillus. b. Reservoir . Soil and water throughout the world between 20 degrees north and south latitudes. Several animals, including sheep, goats, horses, swine, monkeys, and rodents, serve as reservoirs.However, there is no evidence that animals are important reservoirs, except that they spread the agent tonew foci (soil and water). c. Transmission . Inoculation of gross or inapparent skin lesions from contact with contaminated soil or water, aspiration or ingestion of contaminated water, or inhalation of contaminated dust. d. Endemic Disease. Acute pulmonary disease is the most common form of the endemic disease. Acute local suppurative disease can complicate inoculation of the skin, resulting in a nodular lesion at theportal of entry, with lymphangitis and regional lymphadenopathy. Acute septicemic disease and chronicsuppurative 4-11.1C 2-21. Biological The primary threat is aerosol release. 2-22. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance team collects samples from aerosol clouds; PVNTMED/PHS/BEE personnel collect samples from soil and water sources; and veterinary/PVNTMED/PHS personnel collect samplesfrom food supplies/sources. The supporting medical laboratory processes the samples and provides thecommand with initial identification of the organism. 2-23. Prevention Currently, no pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis is available. 2-24. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. 10 to 14 days following inhalation. b. Signs and Symptoms. (1) Following an aerosol attack, melioidosis will most likely present as an acute pulmonary infection. Infection can vary from a mild bronchitis to a severe necrotizing pneumonia. The illness maybegin abruptly, or with a vague prodrome featuring headache, anorexia, and myalgia. Fever, often inexcess of 102\u00b0 Fahrenheit (F), is common. Localizing symptoms may include pleuritic or dull aching chestpain, and a cough (which may be either productive or nonproductive of purulent or bloody sputum).Physical findings may be minimal but can feature pulmonary rales. Acute pulmonary disease can progressand result in bacteremia and acute septicemic disease. (2) The acute septicemic disease may follow a terminal course with death occurring in 7 to 10 days. Case fatality rate for acute septicemic disease exceeds 90 percent. Symptoms may include severedyspnea, headache, pharyngitis, diarrhea, and a pustular rash. Physical findings may include high fever,tachypnea, hypotension, flushing of the skin, cyanosis, and rash (the rash may begin as a generalizedpapular rash that may progress to a pustular exanthem). Chest findings are variable; palpablehepatosplenomegaly may be present. (3) Pulmonary infection can result in chronic disease, with clinical and radiographic features similar to those of tuberculosis. Chronic suppurative disease can complicate metastatic infection to otherorgans including the brain, myocardium, liver, bone, spleen, lymph nodes, and eyes. 2-25. Diagnosis Microscopic evaluation of exudate will feature poorly staining gram-negative bacilli; methylene blue or Wright\u0092s stain will disclose bipolar appearance. culture 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C identify pseudomallei . Diagnosis can also be confirmed by serologic tests, with the limitations that single low titers are nondiagnostic and negative serology does not exclude the diagnosis. Given the possiblepresentation of an acute pneumonia and the above findings on sputum studies, the most important item in adifferential diagnosis, especially in a BW context, would be plague (see paragraph 2-38). Chest x-rays maydisclose infiltrates involving the upper lobes, with and effusions andpleural-based masses are unusual radiographic findings. Leukocyte vary from normal to 20,000white blood cells/cubic millimeter. 2-26. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary based upon the stage and severity of illness and available resources. Patients with signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary disease are classified as Immediateor Delayed category, depending on severity of presentation. Those presenting in septic shock are classifiedas Immediate or Expectant category, depending on available resources. b. Medical Management . In medical management, therapy will vary with the type and severity of the clinical presentation. (1) For localized disease, administer one of the following for a duration of 60 to 150 days: \u0095 Amoxicillin/clavulanate, 60 mg/kilograms (kg)/day in 3 divided oral 40 mg/kg/day in 3 divided oral doses.\u0095 Trimethoprim/sulfa (TMP, 4 mg per kg per day/sulfa, 20 mg per kg per day in divided oral doses). (2) For localized disease with mild toxicity, administer antibiotics as follows: Combine two of the above oral regimens for a duration of 30 days, followed by monotherapy with either amoxicillin/clavulanate or TMP/sulfa for 60 to 150 days. For extrapulmonary suppurative disease, the antibiotictherapy should be administered for 6 to 12 months. Surgical drainage of abscesses is indicated. (3) For severe and/or septicemic disease, administer antibiotics as follows: Ceftazidime, 120 mg/kg/day in three divided doses, combined with TMP/sulfa (TMP, 8 mg per kg per day/sulfa, 40 mgper kg per day in four divided doses). Initially, administer parenteral therapy for 2 weeks, followed by oraltherapy for 6 months. (4) The addition of streptomycin is indicated if presentation (acute pneumonia) and sputum studies suggests plague (see paragraph 2-38). c. Prognosis. The extent of infection will vary with inoculum, individual\u0092s underlying state of health, availability of protective mask or other respiratory protective devices, and other factors. Lateactivation or recrudescence can result years or decades later.2-11FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C 2-27. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions in management of patients and contacts. Melioidosis, glanders, and smallpox may present with diffuse pustular rashes; strict isolation and quarantine would be indicated until smallpoxcan be excluded. Contact precautions are indicated while caring for patients with skin involvement.Melioidosis, glanders, and smallpox may present as acute pulmonary disease with purulent sputum.Respiratory isolation pending exclusion of plague is prudent if sputum studies disclose gram-negative bacilliwith bipolar \u0093safety pin\u0094 when using Wright\u0092s or methylene blue stains. 2-28. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated following the exclusion of smallpox and plague. Contact precautions are indicated for patients with skin involvement. Section V. GLANDERS 2-29. General gram-negative bacillus. b. Reservoir . Horses, mules, and donkeys serve as reservoirs. c. Transmission . By the organism invading the nasal, oral, and conjunctival mucous membranes, by inhalation into the lungs, and by abraded or lacerated skin. Inhalation of aerosols from culturesby laboratory workers has occurred. d. Endemic Disease. The disease is not widespread. The cases have been among veterinarians, horse and donkey caretakers, abattoir workers, and laboratory personnel. 2-30. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is aerosol release. 2-31. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance team collects samples from aerosol clouds; veterinary personnel collects specimens from animals. 2-32. Prevention no pre-exposure Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation Period. 10 to 14 days after inhalation. b. Signs and Symptoms. Fever, rigors, sweating, myalgia, headache, pleuritis, chest pain, cervical adenopathy, splenomegaly, and eruptions. 2-34. Diagnosis Methylene blue stain of exudates may reveal scant small bacilli. Chest x-ray may show miliary lesions, small multiple lung abscesses, or bronchopneumonia. B. mallei can be cultured from infected secretions using meat nutrients. 2-35. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary based upon the stage and severity of illness and available resources. Patients with signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary disease are classified as Immediateor Delayed category, depending on severity of presentation. Those presenting in septic shock are classifiedas Immediate or Expectant category, depending on available resources. b. Medical Management . In medical management, therapy will vary with the type and severity of the clinical presentation. (1) For localized disease, administer one of the following for a duration of 60 to 150 days: \u0095 Amoxicillin/clavulanate, 60 mg/kg/day in 3 divided oral mg/kg/day in 3 divided oral doses.\u0095 Trimethoprim/sulfa (TMP, 4 mg per kg per day/sulfa, 20 mg per kg per day in divided oral doses). (2) For localized disease with mild toxicity, administer antibiotics as follows: Combine two of the above oral regimens for a duration of 30 days, followed by monotherapy with either amoxicillin/clavulanate or TMP/sulfa for 60 to 150 days. (3) For extrapulmonary suppurative disease, the antibiotic therapy should be administered for 6 to 12 months. Surgical drainage of abscesses is indicated. (4) For severe and/or septicemic disease, administer antibiotics as follows: Ceftazidime, 120 mg/kg/day in three divided doses, combined with TMP/sulfa (TMP, 8 mg per kg per day/sulfa, 40 mgper kg per day in four divided doses). Initially, administer parenteral therapy for 2 weeks, followed by oraltherapy for FM 8-284/NTRP 4-02.23 4-11.1C (5) The addition of streptomycin is indicated if presentation (acute pneumonia) and sputum studies suggests plague. c. Prognosis. The extent of infection will vary with inoculum, individual's underlying state of health, availability of protective mask or other respiratory protective devices, and other factors. Late activation or recrudescence can result years or decades later. 2-36. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions in management of patients and contacts. Glanders, melioidosis, and smallpox may present with diffuse pustular rashes; strict isolation and quarantine would be indicated until smallpoxcan be excluded. Contact precautions are indicated while caring for patients with skin involvement.Glanders, melioidosis, and smallpox may present as acute pulmonary disease with purulent sputum.Respiratory isolation pending exclusion of plague is prudent if sputum studies disclose gram-negative bacilliwith bipolar \"safety pin\" appearance when using Wright's or methylene blue stains. 2-37. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated using Standard Precautions following the exclusion of plague. Section VI. PLAGUE 2-38. General a. Etiologic Agent . Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis ) is a gram-negative bacillus of the family Enterobacteriaceae . b. Reservoir . The primary reservoir is rodents. Domestic cats and wild carnivores can also transmit plague to humans. c. Transmission . In endemic or epidemic plague, the disease is transmitted via infected fleas from rodent to human, dog or cat to human, or person to person. Respiratory droplet transmission can occur person to person or cat to person. Respiratory transmission is enhanced in humid climates. Plaguemay also be transmitted via cat bites or scratches. d. Endemic Disease. (1) Bubonic plague features the acute onset of fever and prostration in association with acute, painful lymphadenitis in the lymph node group draining the site of the fleabite. A skin lesion at theportal of entry (site of fleabite) is seen in less than 25 percent of cases; clinically apparent lymphangitis doesnot occur. The disease progresses with bacteremia, resulting in infection, septic in digital gangrene. Pneumonia due to hematogenous metastasis occurs in approximately 25 percent of cases. The case fatality rate for untreated bubonic plague isapproximately 60 percent, but is less than 5 percent with prompt, effective therapy. (2) Primary pneumonic plague occurs after inhalation of organisms, which may occur via aerosol transmission from a person or animal with secondary or primary pneumonic plague. (3) Septicemic plague may evolve from any form of plague. It features the acute onset of bacteremia, septic shock, and thrombosis with or without antecedent lymphadenitis. Prognosis forpneumonic and septicemic pneumonic plague is poor; the fatality rate is 100 percent for untreated cases. 2-39. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is by aerosol release or by contamination of food and water. 2-40. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams may collect the agent from an aerosol cloud. Preventive medicine/PHS/ BEE personnel may collect suspect soil or water samples. Veterinary/PVNTMED/PHS personnel may collect samples from suspect contaminated food. A plague BW attack may result in simultaneous onset of disease in humans, rodent reservoirs, and possibly domestic and wild animals not usually associated with plague. 2-41. Prevention a. Repellents . Use of insect repellents, approved for human use, will provide a level of protection from bites by infected fleas. b. Immunization . The currently available inactivated whole cell vaccine is not recommended for protection from the BW agent; it does not protect laboratory animals from aerosolized plague. However, the vaccine is effective in preventing bubonic plague among troops deployed in endemic/epidemic areas (seeendemic disease, above). \u0090 c. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis . While the FDA has not approved the use of pre-exposure antibiotics, empiric evidence indicates their use may significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. Therefore, they should be considered for use on a case-by-case basis and used as indicated for post-exposure preventivemeasures. Such use would require application of IND protocols (see paragraph 1-23). d. Post-exposure Prophylaxis . Administer doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 hours for one week or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally every 12 hours for one week. 2-42. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. 2 to 10 days.2-15FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C b. Signs and Symptoms. Following an aerosol release of the organisms, unprotected individuals will present with acute pneumonic plague featuring high fever, systemic toxicity, productive cough, andhemoptysis. Chest x-ray findings are discussed in paragraph 2-43. Patients may present with disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIC) with resultant thrombosis and digital gangrene. However, hemorrhagiccomplications of DIC in plague are rare. Further, an aerosol attack of plague could result in an epidemic ofbubonic plague if rodent hosts and flea vectors are present in the vicinity of the attack. 2-43. Diagnosis Gram stain of expectorated sputum may disclose gram-negative Giemsa or Van disclose blue-staining bacilli with a bipolar \u0093safety pin\u0094 appearance. Organisms may be visualized onperipheral blood smears during bacteremia. Cultures of blood and respiratory secretions are indicated.Findings on a chest x-ray may infiltrates, cavitation, consolidation, hilaradenopathy, and pleural include leukocytosis (at times severe leukemoidreaction) and abnormal coagulation studies consistent with DIC. Differential diagnosis should include othercauses of acute pneumonia. 2-44. Treatment a. Triage Categories . The triage category varies with conditions and available resources. Plague pneumonia is curable if treatment is begun early; therefore, these patients are classified as Immediate.Patients presenting after 24 hours following the onset of respiratory symptoms are less likely to survive;they are classified as Expectant. b. Medical Management . (1)Supportive care . Supportive care should include IV hydration, supplemental oxygen, and respiratory support as indicated. (2)Specific therapy . Administer one of the following: \u0095 Streptomycin, 15 mg/kg lean body mass IM every 12 hours for 10 to 14 days.\u0095 Gentamicin, 5 mg/kg lean body mass IV every 24 hours for 10 to 14 days.\u0095 Gentamicin, 1.75 mg/kg lean body mass IV every 8 hours for 10 to 14 days.\u0095 Ciprofloxacin, 400 mg IV every 12 hours. Oral therapy may be given (750 mg orally every 12 hours) after the patient is clinically improved, for completion of a 10- to 14-day course of therapy. \u0095 Doxycycline, 200 mg IV loading dose followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours. Oral therapy may be given (100 mg orally every 12 hours) after the patient is clinically improved, for completionof a 10- to 14-day IV loading dose, followed by 15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours. Oral therapy may be given after the patient is clinically improved, forcompletion of a 10- to 14-day course of therapy. c. Prognosis. Pneumonic plague is invariably fatal if antibiotic therapy is delayed more than 1 day after the onset of symptoms. 2-45. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Pneumonic plague is a very contagious disease; control of patients, contacts, and treatment areas is critical in preventing spread of the disease. The following must be applied for all cases: \u0095 Report case(s) to line and medical chains of command. \u0095 Employ Standard Precautions for disease control. For suspected pneumonic plague (BW presentation), apply respiratory droplet isolation for a minimum of the first 48 hours of therapy. If plaguepneumonia is confirmed, continue respiratory droplet isolation until sputum cultures are negative. \u0095 Employ measures to minimize personnel contact with rodents (proper food storage, trash disposal, and elimination of rodent nests); enforce the use of topical insect repellents and the use ofinsecticides in and around troop encampments to kill fleas, thus decreasing the risk of secondarytransmission. Eliminate fleas from patients and their personal effects. \u0095 Administer post-exposure prophylaxis to immediate contacts as described paragraph 2-41 above. \u0095 Conduct terminal disinfection of all items used in the care of patients. The standard disinfectants available at MTFs will inactivate Y. pestis. 2-46. Medical Evacuation Quarantine patients. Evacuate only with other plague cases. Employ respiratory droplet precautions in addition to Standard Precautions for patients with pneumonic plague until sputum cultures are negative. Donot evacuate across international borders unless authorized by senior medical leadership (see paragraph1-21 for additional information). Section VII. Q FEVER 2-47. General a. Etiologic Agent . Coxiella (C.) burnetii is a rickettsial organism that is highly resistant to heat and desiccation. The organism is highly communicable via aerosol. A single viable organism is enough tocause infection in humans.2-17FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C b. Reservoir . The reservoir is sheep, goats, cattle, dogs, cats, some wild mammals, birds, and ticks. Infected animals usually do not develop the disease, but shed large numbers of organisms (109 organisms per gram) in placental tissues and body fluids. c. Transmission . The organisms are usually transmitted via aerosols containing dust from areas contaminated by placentas, amniotic fluid, excreta from infected animals, aerosols generated by processingproducts of infected animals, direct contact with infected animals, and/or ingestion of unpasturized milk.Q fever has also been transmitted by inhaling aerosols generated from manure, straw, contaminated laundry,and vehicles. The role of ticks as vectors of human disease is unclear, but they may transmit the disease tohumans by dropping organisms on the body at the site of their bite. d. Endemic Disease . Acute Q fever can present as an undifferentiated febrile illness, as an atypical pneumonia, or as a rapidly progressive pneumonia. (1) The \u0093atypical pneumonia\u0094 presentation features fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, and myalgia. Approximately 75 percent of patients will complain of severe headache. There is a relativeabsence of respiratory symptoms; coughing occurs in approximately 25 percent of patients with radiographyconfirmed pneumonia. Physical examination of the chest is usually normal; inspiratory rales may bepresent. Patients with the rapidly progressive pneumonic presentation may feature auscultatory findingsconsistent with consolidation. Q fever pneumonia can result in development of hyponatremia due to thesyndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). (2) Neurologic complications of Q fever include aseptic meningitis or encephalitis in approximately 1 percent of cases. Other complications have included cranial nerve palsies, behavioraldisturbances, cerebellar and extrapyramidal disease, and Miller Fisher syndrome. Other rare extrapulmonarycomplications have included hemolytic anemia and glomerulonephritis. (3) Approximately 33 percent of Q fever cases will develop acute hepatitis (Q fever hepatitis). The acute hepatitis can present with fever and abnormal liver function tests with the absence of pulmonarysymptoms, signs, or radiographic abnormalities. A liver biopsy may disclose granulomatous hepatitis witha highly suggestive histologic appearance. The granuloma will present as a dense fibrin ring surrounded bya central lipid vacuole (doughnut granuloma). (4) Endocarditis is usually a manifestation of chronic Q fever. Patients with valvulopathies or other anatomic abnormalities of the vascular tree are at increased risk. Routine blood cultures will benegative. Fever may be absent. Typical findings include clubbing of the fingernails, hepatosplenomegalyin approximately 50 percent of cases, arterial embolic phenomena in 33 percent of cases, and purpura dueto leukocytoclastic vasculitis in approximately 20 percent of cases. 2-48. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is by aerosol or through contamination of food.2-18FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C 2-49. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect aerosol samples for supporting laboratory analysis and confirmation. Medical personnel collect medical specimens for supporting laboratory analysis and confirmation.Veterinary/PVNTMED/PHS personnel collect suspect contaminated food samples for supporting laboratoryanalysis and confirmation. 2-50. Prevention a.Miscellaneous . The military protective mask provides protection from aerosols. Only consume pasteurized dairy products and heat all foods sufficiently to destroy the organisms. b. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis . A formalin-inactivated whole cell vaccine is available under IND status. A single dose of vaccine provides protection for at least five years. The vaccine is highlyreactogenic in immune individuals, and can result in induration, sterile abscesses, and necrosis at theinjection site. Sterile abscesses may spontaneously drain or require surgical drainage. Immunologicscreening (skin testing and antibody measurements) must precede administration of the immunization.However, personnel with reaction to the screening must not be given the vaccine unless approved by aphysician. Vaccine is contraindicated for individuals with positive skin tests and/or antibody titers. NOTE A new vaccine prepared by chloroform-methanol extraction is being evaluated. This vaccine is safe, immunogenic in nonsensitized humanvolunteers, and is not Post-exposure Chemoprophylaxis . Chemoprophylaxis (tetracycline 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5 days, or doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 hours for 5 days) is effective if begun 8 to 12 dayspost-exposure. NOTE Chemoprophylaxis is not effective if given immediately (1 to 7 days) post-exposure; it merely delays the onset of disease. 2-51. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. 2 to 14 days (usually 7 days). b. Signs and Symptoms. See endemic disease, above.2-19FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C 2-52. Diagnosis accomplished by serologic testing for antibody titers. Acute Q fever results in high titers to Phase II antigen and lower antibody titers to Phase I antigen, while the antibodytiters to Phase I antigen is higher during chronic Q fever. An ELISA test for IgM antibody is available atthe USAMRIID and is more sensitive than the standard complement fixation test. A single high titer may bediagnostic as early as 10 to 14 days into the illness. A four-fold rise in titer in paired acute/convalescentsera is diagnostic of acute Q fever. Chronic Q fever is confirmed by complement fixation titer of 1:200 orgreater to Phase I antigen. Cultures for C. burnetii are technically difficult, hazardous, and generally not done. C. burnetii can be identified on biopsy specimens (tissue) by immunofluorescent stain or electron microscopy. Nonspecific laboratory findings may include leukocytosis in one third of the patients. Mildelevations of transaminase levels (2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal) are typical. Bilirubin is usually normal. b.Chest x-ray findings are abnormal in approximately one half of symptomatic cases and may include pleural effusions in up to 35 percent of cases, nonsegmental and segmented pleural based opacities,increased interstitial markings, and hilar adenopathy. c.Differential diagnosis should include the diverse causes of either rapidly progressive or atypical pneumonia. 2-53. Decontamination A 0.5 percent chlorine solution should be used for personnel and patient decontamination; the M291 skin decontaminating kit will not neutralize the organisms. Q fever has been transmitted from heavilycontaminated unwashed laundry; therefore the laundry must be marked and managed as infectious material.Sputum and urine from patients should be autoclaved before disposal. 2-54. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary with the severity of the disease and available resources. Most patients with Q fever are placed in the Delayed category. b. Medical Management. (1)Acute Q fever. While acute Q fever may run a brief, self-limited course without therapy, suspected cases of acute Q fever should be treated to reduce the risk of development of chronic disease.Therapeutics for acute Q fever are to\u0097 \u0095 Administer doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 hours for at least 2 days after the patient is afebrile. \u0095 Administer tetracycline 500 mg every 6 hours for at least 2 days after the patient is afebrile.2-20FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C \u0095 Consider treating to take tetracycline with ciprofloxacin and other quinolones, which are active in vitro. The duration of therapy is usually 5 to 7 days, at least 2 days after thepatient is afebrile. Quinolones are not recommended for the treatment of children. (2)Chronic Q fever. Therapy for Q fever endocarditis and other forms of chronic Q fever is complex, controversial, and beyond the scope of this manual. However, recommended regimens haveincluded doxycycline combined with rifampin, ofloxacin, or TMP/sulfa and continued for at least 2 years.Antibody titers should be monitored every 6 months during therapy. Monitoring should be continued every3 months for the first 2 years after therapy. Valve replacement is often necessary to cure Q feverendocarditis; however, this procedure should be reserved for hemodynamic indications or emboliccomplications. c. Prognosis. Q fever usually results in a self-limited febrile illness of 2 to 14 days in duration. Previously healthy individuals would be expected to make a complete recovery. Fulminant pneumonia andchronic Q fever (including endocarditis and neurologic sequelae) are uncommon. 2-55. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Q fever is not communicable person to person. Observe Standard Precautions when handling patients. Unlike most other potential biological weapons, heavy environmental contamination with C. burnetti could pose a long-term risk due to environmental persistence. Dusts generated from the contaminated environmentmay continue to transmit the disease. Exposed clothing and equipment should be decontaminated. 2-56. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated with other classes of patients. Section VIII. TULAREMIA negative coccobacillus. b. Reservoir. F. tularensis is maintained in numerous and diverse mammalian (rabbits, hares, rodents,) and tick reservoirs. F. tularensis is limited to the northern hemisphere. Type A (the predominant strain in North America) is more virulent than Type B (the predominant strain in Northern Europe). c. Transmission. Transmission is by arthropod vectors (ticks and deerflies; also mosquitoes in Sweden, Finland, and the former Soviet Union), direct contact with infected animals, aerosols generated byskinning/processing infected animals, and ingestion of contaminated food or water. The organisms mayalso be transmitted by aerosol as Endemic Disease. (1) Clinical syndromes vary with portal of entry, inoculum, strain virulence, and the host's underlying state of health. Infection may be subclinical or fulminant. With the exception of typhoidal tularemia, the clinical syndromes are characterized by the combination of focal processes featuring ulcerationat the portal of entry, and regional adenopathy involving the node groups draining the portal of entry.Following aerosol exposure, an undifferentiated febrile illness (typhoidal tularemia) or acute pneumoniafeaturing fever, coughing, substernal chest tightness, and pleuritic chest pain may present. Usually,coughing is nonproductive; hemoptysis is rare. Physical findings may vary. Examination may be normal,or disclose rales, friction rubs, or findings consistent with consolidation or effusions. (2) Pharyngeal tularemia presents as an acute pharyngitis following ingestion of contaminated food or water. The chief complaint is a severe sore throat. Physical findings include fever, exudativepharyngitis and/or tonsillitis, and possibly pharyngeal ulcers. Also, findings may include a pharyngealmembrane similar to that seen in diphtheria. Regional adenopathy may present in cervical, preauricular,and retropharyngeal node groups with occasional abscess formation. (3) Oculoglandular disease presents following inoculation of the conjunctivae via aerosol, splashes, or direct contact (contaminated fingers). This disease presents as an acute conjunctivitis and mayfeature small conjunctival ulcers or papules. Complications may include corneal ulceration anddacryocystitis, but visual loss is rare. Regional adenopathy is a conspicuous feature of this illness, withpreauricular or preparotid adenopathy. Severe cases of adenopathy may mimic parotiditis. Differentialdiagnosis should include other causes of oculoglandular syndrome, adenovirus infection,cat scratch disease, syphilis, and pyogenic bacterial infection. 2-58. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is by aerosol release, or by contamination of food or water supplies. 2-59. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect aerosol samples for supporting laboratory analysis and confirmation. Medical personnel collect medical specimens for supporting laboratory analysis and confirmation.Veterinary/PVNTMED/PHS personnel collect suspect contaminated food samples for supporting laboratoryanalysis and confirmation. Preventive medicine/PHS/BEE personnel collect suspect contaminated watersamples for supporting laboratory analysis and confirmation. 2-60. Prevention a. Miscellaneous . The military protective mask provides protection of the respiratory tract from exposure to aerosol organisms. All food must be thoroughly heated before consumption to kill any organisms. Water must be thoroughly disinfected before consumption.2-22C1, live attenuated vaccine is available as an IND. It is given by scarification. The vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing laboratory-acquired tularemia and experimental infection in volunteers. \u0090 The use of ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as a pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis may confer protection against tularemia, based on in vitro susceptibilities. See paragraph 1-23 for off-label indications and IND following a BW attack include\u2014 Administer doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 weeks; or tetracycline 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 weeks; or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 weeks. Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended following potential natural exposures (tick bite, rabbit or other animal exposures). 2-61. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. 1 to 21 days (usually 3 to 5 days). b. Signs and Symptoms. The BW agent presentations of tularemia will be the pneumonic and typhoidal forms as discussed in paragraph 2-57 above. Oculoglandular disease could possibly occur following inoculation of the conjunctivae. 2-62. Diagnosis a.Serologic testing is the preferred procedure for laboratory confirmation. Confirmation of diagnosis requires a four-fold increase in titer; serologies may need to be repeated at 7 to 10 day intervals. Agglutination tests and ELISA are also available. A gram stain of expectorated sputum is usuallyunrewarding; generally, the organism is not visualized on stains of clinical specimens. Cultures are notadvised for diagnostic purposes. The organism does not grow on standard bacteriologic growth media. F. tularensis can be cultured on special supportive media containing cystine or another sulfhydryl source. However, cultures of the organism pose a significant occupational hazard to laboratory personnel. Whencultures for F. tularensis are submitted, laboratory personnel must be alerted, as these cultures must be processed at Biosafety Level 3. Blood specimens may be submitted for mouse/egg inoculation. b.Radiographic findings are nonspecific and Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary according to the severity of the illness, available resources, and personnel. Patients presenting during the early stages of tularemia pneumonia are2-23FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C classified as either Delayed or Immediate depending on the severity of illness and the requirement for respiratory support. b. Medical Management. Supportive care may include respiratory support and hydration. Open lesions should be covered and topical antibiotics applied. Antibiotic therapy may be one of the following: \u0095 Administer streptomycin 7.5 to 10 mg/kg IM every 12 hours for 10 to 14 days.\u0095 Administer gentamicin 3 to 5 mg/kg IV daily for 10 to 14 days.\u0095 Administer ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours, switch to oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) after the patient is clinically improved; continue for completion of a 10- to 14-daycourse of therapy. \u0095 Administer ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 to 14 days. c. Prognosis. Inhalation tularemia can lead to fulminant pneumonia with case fatality of 30 to 60 percent without treatment. 2-64. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions. Tularemia is not communicable person to person. 2-65. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated. Observe Standard Precautions during evacuation.3-1FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C CHAPTER 3 VIRAL AGENTS Section I. INTRODUCTION 3-1. General Viruses are the simplest type of microorganism and consist of a nucleocapsid protein coat containing genetic material, either ribonucleic acid (RNA) or DNA. Potential viral BW agents include smallpox, VEE, and VHF. Section II. SMALLPOX 3-2. General a. Etiologic Agent. Variola is a member of the poxvirus family and is very contagious to humans. In addition, some animal poxviruses are virulent to humans (for example, monkeypox).Theoretically, recombinant poxviruses could be developed from animal poxviruses or vaccinia, and used asbiological weapons. b. Reservoir. Humans were the only natural reservoir of variola. Variola was eradicated as an endemic human pathogen, but known laboratory cultures of variola are maintained under security at the CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, Koltsovo, Russia. c. Transmission. Usually occurred by respiratory droplet transmission, following close face-to- face contact. Smallpox was also transmitted by direct contact with skin lesions or drainage, or withcontaminated objects. Although uncommon, airborne transmission (long distance) also occurred. d. Endemic Disease. Smallpox has been eradicated as an endemic disease. The last naturally acquired reported cases occurred in October 1977, in Somalia. However, if variola is delivered as a BW agent, it could result in the reemergence of smallpox. Once reestablished as an endemic disease, it couldagain be spread by respiratory droplet or droplet nuclei, or by contact with scabs, lesion drainage, andcontaminated objects. 3-3. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is delivery by aerosol release. 3-4. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams or other bioengineering personnel operating similar detection equipment accomplish detection.3-2FM 8-284/NAVMED There are no routine immunizations of US forces for smallpox. When the threat indicates, senior leadership may direct vaccination of personnel with vaccinia. NOTE Contraindications to pre-exposure prophylaxis include pregnancy, impaired immunity, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,eczema, severe burns, psoriasis, other chronic dermatoses, andindividuals with household or other close contacts with the aboveconditions. b. Post-exposure Prophylaxis . (1) All individuals exposed to or suspected of being exposed to smallpox BW agents should have active or passive immunization. Contacts that are not immunized or those immunized more than 3years prior to exposure should be given vaccinia as soon as possible (within 1 to 7 days) followingexposure. Limited data obtained during the era of endemic smallpox suggested that vaccinia combined withvaccinia immunoglobulin (VIG) was slightly more effective than vaccinia alone for post-exposureimmunoprophylaxis. The combination of vaccinia and VIG is very rational if post-exposurechemoprophylaxis cannot be given within 7 days of exposure. (2) With the exception of significant immunodeficiency, there are no contraindications to vaccinia following smallpox exposure. For contacts with pregnancy or eczema at increased risk forvaccinia side effects, the combination of vaccinia and VIG 0.6 ml/kg is advised. Vaccinia immunoglobulinwas administered in divided doses at multiple locations over 24 to 36 hours. Patients with HIV infection orother immunodeficiencies would be candidates for VIG alone. (3) Possible side effects of vaccinia (vaccinia is a live virus) are the potential to cause disease in vaccinees and their contacts, especially those with conditions outlined above. Inadvertent inoculation toskin due to touching or scratching a vaccine lesion and then other areas of skin, and inadvertent inoculationof the eyes (ocular vaccinia) resulting in andcorneal ulceration treat herpetic ocular infections(idoxuridine, vidarabine); these agents are active in vitro versus vaccinia. (4) Generalized vaccinia is a rare idiosyncratic reaction featuring mild constitutional symptoms and a generalized vesicular rash. Vaccinia cannot be cultured from the vesicles or from the serum of patientswith this condition. Pathogenesis is unknown, but is possibly due to an immunopathologic mechanism.Usually, this is a self-limited reaction and no therapy is indicated, but VIG may be indicated for severe cases. (5) Idiosyncratic reactions of varying severity were seen that require supportive care. These included generalized urticarial exanthems, such Encephalitis occurs in approximately two individuals per million receiving the vaccine. This complication produced a case fatality rate of 10 to 30 percent and neurologic sequelae in survivors.The pathogenesis is unknown but is probably due to an immunopathologic mechanism because vacciniacannot be cultured from CSF or brain tissue of patients. Treatment is supportive. (7) Eczema vaccinatum is a severe dermatitis featuring replication of vaccinia at sites of eczema, psoriasis, burns, or other chronic or severe cutaneous lesions. Therapy is the administration of VIG 0.6 ml/kgevery 2 to 3 days IM in divided doses at multiple sites over a 24 to 36 hour period until no new lesions appear. (8) Vaccinia necrosum occurred in immunocompromised vaccinees. This condition featured an intense local reaction at the site of the vaccination, progressing to local necrosis. The lesion can progressby local extension and metastasize to distant sites on the skin; it is potentially fatal. Therapy is theadministration of VIG 0.6 ml/kg every 2 to 3 days IM in divided doses at multiple sites over a 24 to 36 hourperiod until definite clinical improvement is apparent. (9) Fetal vaccinia may result from giving vaccinia to females during pregnancy. The prognosis for the fetus is poor, resulting in stillbirth. 3-6. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation Period. The incubation period is 7 to 17 days, commonly 10 to 12 days. b. Signs and symptoms. (1) Smallpox begins as a febrile prodrome of 2 to 4 days duration, featuring the acute onset of fever, rigors, malaise, headache, backache, and vomiting. Other features of the prodrome includeddelirium and a transient erythematous macular rash, each occurring in approximately 15 percent of patients.The characteristic exanthematous phase begins with an acute papular dermatitis on the face, hands, andforearms, then spreading to the lower extremities and the trunk. Distribution of the rash is centrifugal, withface and distal extremities involved earlier and to a greater extent than proximal extremities or trunk. Thelesions progress in a synchronous manner from papule to vesicle to pustule. Scabs form in 8 to 14 days andslough off in 14 to 28 days after the onset of the rash. The sloughing leaves depressed depigmented scars.Enanthems involving the upper aerodigestive tract may also occur. (2) Variants include flat-type smallpox, featuring severe systemic toxicity and large flat maculopapular lesions with a soft, velvety, nonindurated texture. The most severe form of smallpox is thehemorrhagic variant, featuring severe systemic toxicity, and diffuse ecchymosis and purpura. This variantis associated with a high-titer viremia and absent or negligible antibody responses; patients usually diedbefore the characteristic papules or vesicles appeared. A relatively mild form of smallpox ( variola minor, alastrim) featured little systemic toxicity and a milder exanthem and was seen in parts of southern Africa,Europe, and Latin America. It was due to a less virulent strain of variola . (3) Complications of smallpox include encephalitis in 1 per 500 cases, with high rates of mortality and neurologic sequelae among survivors. Keratitis with 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C occurred in 1 percent of cases. Pulmonary edema could complicate the course of hemorrhagic and flat- type variants. 3-7. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis of a vesicular include other and so forth). Cytologic examination of the basesof unroofed vesicles may disclose eosinophilic inclusions (Guarnieri sites of viralreplication in the cytoplasm. Poxviruses may also be identified by electron microscopy of specimensobtained from skin lesions; however, these methods will not differentiate poxviruses. Clinical specimens(serum, respiratory secretions, specimens obtained from skin lesions or crusts) may be sent to the laboratoryfor culture. The virus may also be cultured from the blood during the prodrome. Poxviruses may beidentified by differential growth characteristics in tissue culture. The use of genetic typing methods willlead to a specific diagnosis. 3-8. Treatment a. Triage Category . The triage category varies with conditions and available resources; given the prolonged incubation, prodrome, clinical course, and lack of specific therapy, most patients should becategorized as Delayed. Contacts should be vaccinated or receive booster vaccinations as soon as possible,optimally within 24 hours. b. Medical Management. Provide supportive care. There is no specific antiviral therapy available for smallpox. c. Prognosis . Case fatality rate for smallpox ( variola major) was historically 20 to 40 percent and higher during pregnancy or the neonatal period. Case fatality for the flat-type variant was approximately95 percent in the unimmunized and 66 percent in previously immunized patients. The hemorrhagic variantwas nearly always fatal. Case fatality for variola minor (alastrim) was 5 percent. 3-9. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas a. Patients. Strict (standard, contact, and airborne) isolation and quarantine of all patients must be maintained until scabs have separated. The virus can be spread by air currents and can be carried outsidethe hospital by various materials contaminated by the patient, especially clothing and linens. Deposit alloral and nasal discharges in a paper container and burn. Sterilize (autoclave or boil) all bedclothes andother fabrics that are exposed to the patient. Spray or mop all floors, walls, and other hard surfaces in thepatient isolation area with a disinfectant solution (phenolic and quaternary ammonium compounds, formalin,or a 5 percent chlorine solution). Allow the disinfectant to remain on the surfaces for at least 4 hours. b. Patient Contacts .3-5FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C (1) The reappearance of a single case of smallpox would be a global emergency. Immediately report all occurrences to Military Public Health. (2) Quarantine all direct contacts with any case and maintain daily surveillance for 17 days after last known contact with a case. Vaccinate all contacts, including health care workers, if they have notbeen immunized or received a booster within 3 years (see post-exposure prophylaxis paragraph 3-5 b above). c. At Risk Personnel. Conduct an epidemiological investigation to identify all potentially exposed personnel. Quarantine identified personnel for the remainder of the incubation period; usually 7 to 12 daysfollowing the appearance of index cases. Give post-exposure prophylaxis as discussed in paragraph 3-5 b above. 3-10. Medical Evacuation Smallpox is an IQD. Apply strict quarantine measures. Isolate and evacuate all smallpox patients in cohorts of smallpox patients only. Do not evacuate smallpox patients across national boundaries unlessapproved by major command authority (see paragraph 1-21). Section III. VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS 3-11. General a. Etiologic Agent. The an arthorpodborne alphavirus. b. Reservoir. Enzootic serotypes are maintained in a rodent-mosquito cycle. Enzootic strains are frequently transmitted to humans living in endemic disease areas via mosquito bites. However, enzooticstrains are not virulent for horses. Epizootic serotypes are thought to arise from enzootic strains bymutation. In contrast to enzootic strains, epizootic strains are highly virulent for Equidae (horses, mules,donkeys). Horses serve as amplifying hosts of epizootic (but not enzootic) strains, providing a source ofvirus for mosquitoes, which transmit virus to humans. The VEE virus occurs in northern South America,Central America, and Trinidad. c. Transmission. The endemic disease is transmitted by mosquitoes. Aerosol transmission has occurred in laboratory settings, but is not known to occur naturally. d. Endemic Disease. The epizootic VEE virus has an incubation period of 1 to 15 days. The usual presentation is an undifferentiated febrile illness with fever, malaise, and headache. Other symptomsthat may appear include myalgia (72 percent), vomiting (50 percent), drowsiness (40 percent), chills (20percent), sore throat (20 percent), and diarrhea (20 percent). Fever can remit but recur the following day.Patients may be incapacitated by malaise and fatigue for 1 to 2 weeks. Less than 1 percent of adults willdevelop severe encephalitis featuring meningismus, ataxia, seizures, and coma; paralysis and neurologicsequelae may result in survivors. The case fatality rate in adults is approximately 1 percent of all cases, butmay reach 10 percent with CNS 4-11.1C 3-12. Biological The primary threat is delivery by aerosol release. 3-13. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect aerosol samples for submission to the supporting medical laboratory for analysis and field confirmation. Medical personnel will collect specimens from patients presenting atMTFs with signs and symptoms of the VEE virus (outside of its natural geographic range, it would suggesta possible BW attack or importation of infected horses or mosquito vectors) for supporting laboratoryanalysis and confirmation. Veterinary personnel collect samples from equines within the AO for laboratoryanalysis and confirmation. A natural epidemic would usually be preceded by equine disease. A BW attackwill most likely result in human disease as a primary event, or the simultaneous onset of disease in humans andequines. A BW attack in an area with equines and mosquito vectors may also initiate an epizootic/epidemic. 3-14. Prevention a. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis . Live attenuated vaccine (TC-83) is available as an IND. However, 20 percent of vaccinees do not respond and another 20 percent develop severe reactions. An inactivatedvaccine (C-84) is available as an IND for TC-83 nonresponders. The C-84 vaccine has the typicaldisadvantages of inactivated vaccines (multiple doses and boosters are required to confer and maintainimmunity). In addition, C-84 vaccine does not protect rodents against experimental aerosol challenge;human data is not available. b. Post-exposure Prophylaxis . There are no post-exposure prophylaxes available. 3-15. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation Period. Incubation period is 1 to 6 days; onset is sudden. b. Signs and Symptoms. See endemic disease above. 3-16. Diagnosis Perform serologic tests to measure antibody titers. A single high titer IgM value 5 to 7 days after the onset of illness is supportive; a four-fold rise in antibody titer in paired acute and convalescent sera is diagnostic.Identification of the virus in clinical specimens (serum, CSF) by PCR is under investigation. Viral culturesmay confirm the diagnosis if serum is sent early during the illness (a low titer viremia is present during thefirst 24 to 72 hours of illness); however, cultures will be negative later in the clinical course and in thosewho have progressed to encephalitis. Nonspecific laboratory findings are usually and a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis may be present. 3-17. Treatment a. Triage Categories . The triage categories vary according to severity of the disease and available resources. Most patients are placed in the Delayed category, given the usual clinical course and a lack ofspecific therapy. Patients with seizures are placed in the Immediate category for anticonvulsive therapy,airway management, and other supportive care measures. b. Medical Management . There is no specific antiviral therapy. Administer anticonvulsive therapy for patients with seizures and other supportive care measures as indicated. c. Prognosis . The VEE virus is an incapacitating agent. While acute morbidity is severe, most patients recover. However, animal studies demonstrate that aerosol exposure leads to viralattachment to olfactory nerve endings and direct invasion of the CNS via the olfactory nerve, resulting ina high incidence of CNS disease. This suggests that in contrast to the mosquito-borne disease, VEEresulting from a BW attack would be more likely to cause CNS involvement and could be associated withhigher morbidity and mortality. 3-18. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas a. Patient Management . Apply Standard Precautions for infection control. b. Management of Patient Contacts . Observe Standard Precautions. Control mosquito vectors and vaccinate horses in the vicinity. The VEE virus is not communicable person to person. 3-19. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated with all other classes of patients. Section IV. VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS 3-20. General a. Etiologic Agent. The VHF viruses belong to four families of lipid-enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes. The taxonomy, ecology, and epidemiology of these viruses are summarizedbelow. Transmission of VHFs varies with the specific virus. However, all of the VHFs, with the exceptionof dengue, are potentially transmitted via aerosol, underscoring their possible role as BW agents.

Viral hemorrhagic fever is a clinical syndrome featuring fever, myalgia, malaise, and hemorrhage, and in some cases, hypotension, shock, and death. Viral pathogenesis is complex, incompletely understood, and varies among specific viruses. Some infections result in immune complexdeposition which activates complement and other inflammatory cascades. This process damages vascularendothelium, results in capillary leak, and deregulates vascular smooth muscle tone. These lead tohypotension, shock, and end-organ failures. Some of these diseases activate coagulation cascades and resultin DIC. Hemorrhage can also be enhanced by specific end-organ failures. For example, yellow fever cancause massive hepatic necrosis resulting in a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The uremia3-9FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C complicating the acute renal failure of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) leads to platelet dysfunction, further promoting hemorrhage. The final common pathway of hemorrhagic fever is damage tothe vascular endothelium. 3-21. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is delivery by aerosol release. 3-22. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect environmental samples for submission to the supporting medical laboratory for analysis. Preventive medicine/PHS/BEE personnel collect water samples for laboratory analysis.Veterinary personnel collect blood samples from animals for laboratory analysis. Medical personnel collect blood and other specimens from patients presenting with signs and symptoms for laboratory analysis. 3-23. Prevention a. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. For pre-exposure prophylaxis, ensure all service members have received their yellow fever vaccinations. Investigational vaccines are available as INDs. Argentinehemorrhagic fever (AHF) attenuated vaccine has been safely used and has proven effective in preventingAHF in more than 150,000 agricultural workers in endemic areas; animal studies suggest that this vaccinealso provides protection against Bolivian VHF. Two Rift Valley hemorrhagic fever vaccines (an inactivatedvaccine and a live attenuated vaccine) are in development. b. Post-exposure Chemoprophylaxis. As a post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, administer ribavirin, 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 7 days, for Crimean-Congo VHF (CCVHF) and Lassa fever. Ribavirin(intravenous and oral) is available under IND status and available through human use protocol only. 3-24. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation Period. The incubation period can be days to months. b. Signs and Symptoms . Initial clinical features may include flushing, conjunctival injection, possible periorbital edema, petechiae, and hypotension. Illness then progresses with prostration, fatigue,and hemorrhage. The most dreaded complications are shock, multiple organ system failure, and death. 3-25. Diagnosis Serologic methods include IgM antibody capture and ELISA techniques to detect the antigen. Tissue can be submitted for immunohistochemical staining, electron microscopy, or for genetic typing. Serum and otherclinical specimens should be forwarded for viral culture under maximum containment (Biosafety Level 4).3-10FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C Laboratory findings are nonspecific and variable. In general, these result in thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Elevated liver function tests and other nonspecific laboratory findings may be present. Theblood urea nitrogen (BUN) will be related to the circulatory status with the exception of HFRS in which thekidneys are target organs of the Hantaviruses. Differential diagnosis include diseases such as typhoid vasculitic the diverse etiologies of DIC. 3-26. Treatment a. Triage Categories . The triage categories vary according to the severity of disease and available resources. Patients who are acutely ill with AHF, Bolivian VHF, Brazilian VHF, Venezuelan VHF, Lassafever, CCVHF, or HFRS may be candidates for the Immediate category if ribavirin is available, as ribavirinmay improve outcome. If ribavirin is not available, these patients are placed in the Delayed category.Other patients with hemorrhagic fevers may be classified as Delayed or Expectant categories. b.Medical Management. (1) Treatment is primarily supportive with special attention to fluid and electrolyte balance. Patients require treatment for shock, blood loss, renal failure, seizures, and coma. Treatment may includeintensive care and specific interventions such as mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and neurological support.Heparin therapy may provide benefit for DIC. However, its role is controversial and should be reserved forpatients with clinically significant hemorrhage and laboratory evidence of DIC. Aspirin and othermedications that impair platelet function are contraindicated; as are IM injections. The use of intravasculardevices must be carefully considered in the context of potential benefit versus the risk of hemorrhage.Surgical interventions should not be withheld if indicated. (2) Specific antiviral therapy is limited. Clinical studies support the use of IV ribavirin for the treatment of Lassa fever and HFRS (Hantaan virus). The role of ribavirin therapy for CCVHF issupported by in vitro studies, although there is no clinical experience. Ribavirin (IV and oral) is availableunder IND status and is available through human use protocol only. For Lassa fever and CCVHF, administera loading dose of ribavirin 30 mg/kg IV, followed by 16 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 4 days; then 8 mg/kg IVevery 8 hrs for 6 days to complete a 10-day course of therapy. For HFRS, therapy may benefit patients who havebeen febrile for 6 days or less. Administer a loading dose of ribavirin 33 mg/kg IV, followed by 16 mg/kg IVevery 6 hours for 4 days, then 8 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 3 days, to complete a 7 day course of therapy. c. Prognosis . Prognosis varies from agent to agent; case fatality rates range from less than 10 percent (HFRS) to as high as 90 percent (Ebola). Survivors may be left with long-term sequelae (such asblindness, neurosensory hearing loss, and other neurologic, retinal, and ocular involvement). 3-27. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas a. Report . Report suspected cases of VHFs outside the US to PVNTMED/PHS personnel immediately. Yellow fever is an IQD.3-11FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C b. Isolation . The following recommendations apply to patients with suspected or proven arenavirus, filovirus, or CCVHF virus infections: these patients should be isolated in private rooms orisolation tents; if private rooms are not available, only other patients with the same disease should be in thesame room; a negative air flow room should be used, if possible, if the patient has significant cough,hemorrhage, or diarrhea. Limit exposure to caregivers only; other staff members and visitors should notbe allowed in the room to avoid injuries/nosocomial exposures. Caregivers should be the most skilled/experienced staff. c. Caregiver Protection . The following recommendations apply to patients with suspected or proven arenavirus, filovirus, or CCVHF virus infections: all caregivers must wear gloves and gowns;anyone coming within 3 feet of the patient should also wear face shields or surgical masks and eyeprotection (for example, goggles or eyeglasses with side shields). When caring for patients with prominentcough, vomiting, diarrhea, or hemorrhage, caregivers should wear a HEPA filter air purifying respirator, abattery powered, air-purifying respirator, or a positive pressure supplied air respirator. d. Infectious Material Handling . Sewage, bulk blood, suctioned fluids, secretions, and excretions should be autoclaved, processed in a chemical toilet, or treated with a 5 percent chlorine solution for at least5 minutes in bedpan or commode prior to flushing. e. Contacts . (1)Casual contacts . There is no known risk of transmission to casual contacts, such as travelers in the same airplane. (2)Close contacts . Close contacts, such as household members, physicians, nursing care, and individuals handling laboratory specimens, increase the possibility of contracting the disease. Closecontacts should have their temperature recorded twice daily for 3 weeks post-exposure. Close contactsshould receive post-exposure chemoprophylaxis/evaluation/treatment if fever (above 101\u00b0F) or othersystemic symptoms present within 3 weeks of exposure. (3)High-risk contacts . High-risk contacts include anyone who has mucous membrane or percutaneous exposures. High-risk contacts with mucous membrane exposure should copiously irrigatewith water or eyewash solution for at least 15 minutes. For percutaneous exposure, individuals shouldfrequently wash affected skin surfaces with soap and water; an antiseptic solution or handwashing agentmay also be considered to provide better removal of any contamination on the exposed surfaces. High-riskcontacts with exposure to Lassa fever and CCVHF should\u0097 \u0095 Receive post-exposure chemoprophylaxis (ribavirin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 7 days). \u0095 Have their temperature recorded twice daily for 3 weeks post-exposure.\u0095 Receive further evaluation/treatment if fever (greater than 101\u00b0F) or other systemic symptoms present within 3 weeks of exposure.3-12FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C 3-28. Medical Evacuation Evacuation may result in increased morbidity and mortality for patients with VHFs; therefore, treatment at a local facility is preferred. Strict isolation as outlined in paragraph 3-27 above must be used for all patientsevacuated. Obtain approval from the senior medical authority before evacuation; paragraph 1-21 I. INTRODUCTION 4-1. General Toxins are poisonous byproducts of living organisms. They are very stable and produce severe illness when ingested, inhaled, or introduced into the body by any other means. Some toxins are susceptible to heat,while others are heat stable. Their effects on the human body range from minor illness to death. Section II. CLOSTRIDIUM BOTULINUM TOXIN 4-2. General a. Etiologic Agent. Botulinum toxins are a group of seven toxins produced by Clostridium (C.) botulinum . The spores are ubiquitous; they germinate to give rise to vegetative bacteria that produce toxins during anaerobic incubation. Industrial-scale fermentation can produce large quantities of toxin for use as aBW agent. There are three forms of naturally occurring botulism\u0097foodborne, infantile, and wound.Botulinum toxin is the most potent neurotoxin known; paradoxically it has been used therapeutically to treatspastic conditions (strabismus, blepharospasm, torticollis, and tetanus). Botulinum toxin consists of twopolypeptide subunits (A and B chains). The B subunit binds to a receptor on the axons of motor neurons.The toxin is taken into the axon, where the A chain exerts its cytotoxic effect; it transmission (pre-synaptic inhibition). Recoveryfollows only after the neuron develops a new axon, which can take months. The presynaptic inhibitionaffects both autonomic (muscarinic) and motor (nicotinic) receptors. b. Reservoir. The reservoir is soil, animals, and fish. The organisms can be recovered from honey and other agricultural products. High-risk foods are primarily improperly canned foods and driedmeat or fish. c. Transmission. Consumption of food contaminated with the C. botulinum toxin. d. Endemic Disease. (1)Foodborne. Foodborne botulism is due to ingestion of food contaminated with botulinum toxins. Inadequately heating vegetables and fruits during canning, then inadequate heating before serving isthe primary mode of transmission in the US. In some foreign countries, smoked sausage, salmon, andfermented salmon eggs are the source of intoxication. In Asian countries, seafood is the primary source ofintoxication. (2)Infantile . Germination of spores leading to colonization and toxin production may occur in the infantile GI tract due to anatomic, physiologic, and microbiologic factors present during the P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C of life. Clostridium botulinum spores survive transit through the stomach in infants, relative to achlorhydria; spores can then germinate and colonize the intestinal tract in the absence of well-established GI tractmicroflora. Parents are advised not to feed infants honey, molasses, and other foods potentially high in C. botulinum spore content to prevent this disease. This form of botulism is a rare disease of adults, but may occur in cases of underlying anatomic or physiologic abnormalities of the GI, or alteration of the normal GItract flora (such as after antibiotic exposure). (3)Wound . Wound botulism is due to the germination of C. botulinum spores and in-situ toxin production in traumatic wounds. The spores may be introduced by organisms entering duringwounding, by drug abusers through subcutaneous injection sites, and by cocaine abusers inhaling the sporesinto ischemic nasal ulcers and sinuses. feature milder presentations limited to cranial nerve palsies and mild GI symptoms related to autonomic dysfunction. Botulism should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presentingwith symptoms of cranial nerve neuropathies, especially if numerous patients present simultaneously. 4-3. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is delivery by aerosol release. Inhalation challenge does not occur naturally, but can be used in a BW attack. Aerosol dispersion has delivered lethal intoxication to experimental animals. The BWagent may also be delivered through contaminated food or water. 4-4. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect aerosol samples. Veterinary/PHS/PVNTMED personnel collect food samples for laboratory analysis. Veterinary personnel collect animal specimens for laboratory testing.Preventive medicine/PHS/BEE personnel collect water samples for laboratory testing. Patient care personnelcollect medical specimens for laboratory testing. 4-5. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. The incubation period for foodborne botulism is usually 24 to 36 hours. The incubation period for infantile botulism is unknown. The incubation period for wound botulism is usually 3 or more days. b. Signs and Symptoms. (1) The autonomic features of botulism are typical anticholinergic signs and symptoms: dry mouth, ileus, constipation, and urinary retention. Nausea and vomiting may occur as nonspecific sequeli ofileus. Dilated pupils (mydriasis) occur in approximately 50 percent of cases. (2) The motor complications of botulism feature a descending paralysis, usually beginning with cranial nerve palsies leading to blurred vision, diplopia, dysphonia, the upper4-3FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C airway may occur due to weakness of the oropharyngeal musculature. As the descending motor weakness involves the diaphragm and accessory muscles of respiration, respiratory failure may occur. (3) Sensory symptoms usually do not occur. Botulinum toxins do not cross the blood/brain barrier and do not cause CNS disease. However, the psychological sequelae of botulism may be severe andrequire specific intervention. (4) Symptoms usually begin 12 to 36 hours following intoxication; time can vary according to the amount of toxin absorbed and could be reduced to hours following a BW attack. 4-6. Prevention a. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. A pentavalent (types A, B, C, D, and E) toxoid vaccine has been developed as a pre-exposure prophylaxis. This vaccine is safe and effective in animal studies, and has beendemonstrated to be safe in human volunteers. The vaccine remains under an IND status since it is notfeasible to test for efficacy in humans. Vaccine is given by deep subcutaneous injection at 0, 2, and 12weeks, with a booster 1 year after the initial dose. b. Post-exposure Prophylaxis. Currently, post-exposure prophylaxis is not available. Animal experiments demonstrate that botulinum antitoxin is effective; however, human data or practice guidelinesare not available. Botulinum antitoxin should be considered in extraordinary circumstances. 4-7. Diagnosis Botulism is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Laboratory confirmation may be obtained by the use of an ELISA test to detect toxin antigen. The assay may be used to test specimens of implicated food or water, orsamples obtained from the environment. Clinical specimens submitted for study may include serum, gastricaspirates, stool, and respiratory secretions. A simple bioassay (mouse confirms the diagnosisif an aliquot of the patient\u0092s serum produces descending paralysis when injected into a laboratory mouse.Nerve conduction studies and single-fiber electromyography (EMG) can confirm the diagnosis, althoughthese modalities may not be readily available in a tactical setting. Edrophonium test results can be positivein botulism as well as in myasthenia gravis; therefore, this test may not be useful due to the lack ofspecificity. Antibody tests are not useful for botulism, as the amount of antigen required to stimulate anantibody response exceeds the lethal dose. 4-8. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary according to situation and available resources. Given that up to 95 percent of patients will survive with supportive care, prompt respiratory support andmedical evacuation for further supportive care can be lifesaving. Patients with upper airway compromisecould be placed in the Immediate category. Patients with mild or gradually progressive symptoms could be4-4FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C placed in the Delayed category. Patients with respiratory failure due to neuromuscular involvement may be placed in the Immediate category if endotracheal intubation and respiratory support are available, or in theExpectant category if these are not available. The implications of a mass casualty situation create a demandfor limited respiratory support resources that are ominous. b. Medical Management . Supportive care includes respiratory support, hydration, bowel, bladder and skin care, nasogastric suctioning for ileus, physical therapy, and psychological support. Long-rangeissues include meticulous attention to the details of daily care; specifically, the prevention of decubitusulcers, nosocomial infections, and deep venous thrombosis. (1) Specific therapy for inhalation or foodborne/waterborne botulism consists of giving botulinum antitoxin to neutralize the circulating toxin in patients with progressive symptoms, or who havenot progressed to a stable state. The standard product is a trivalent (types A, B, E) equine antiserum. Theserum is available through CDC. Since this is a horse-derived product, potential complications includeacute (anaphylaxis) and delayed (serum sickness) hypersensitivity reactions. A despeciated equineheptavalent antitoxin (types A, B, C, D, E, F, G) has been prepared by cleaving the Fc fragments, leavingF(ab)2 fragments. This product is available through USAMRIID as an IND. The despeciated product hasbeen effective in animal studies. However, 4 percent of horse antigens are retained; there is still a risk ofhypersensitivity reactions. Administration of either product must be given in an MTF where personnel andequipment are available to treat possible anaphylaxis. Before administrating the antitoxin, perform asensitivity skin test by intradermally injecting 0.1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of antitoxin and monitoring thepatient for 20 minutes. If the injection site becomes hyperemic (greater than 0.5 centimeters [cm] indiameter), or if the patient develops fever, chills, hypotension, rash, respiratory difficulties, nausea,vomiting, or generalized pruritus, the test is considered positive. If no allergic symptoms are observed,administer the antitoxin by IV (10 cubic centimeters [cc] over 20 minutes). Repeat this dose until there is nomore improvement. For patients with positive skin tests, attempt desensitization by subcutaneouslyadministering 0.01 to 0.1 ml of antitoxin, gradually increase the dose every 20 minutes until 2.0 cc can besustained without a marked reaction. Preferably, desensitization should be performed by an experiencedallergist. Medical personnel attempting to give the antitoxin should be prepared to treat a possibleanaphylactic reaction; intubation equipment, epinephrine, and IV access must be immediately available. (2) Therapy for wound and sinusitis consists of debridement and administration of antibiotics. NOTE Aminoglycosides and clindamycin may further impair neuromuscular transmission and may lead to clinical deterioration if used for patientswith botulism. c. Prognosis . Botulism can result in severe morbidity. Complications include descending paralysis, with possible respiratory failure. Case fatality is approximately 60 percent without respiratoryintensive care. However, with respiratory supportive care, prognosis is favorable, with case fatality rates atapproximately 5 percent. Recovery may be prolonged, requiring up to three months for signs of initial4-5FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C improvement and up to one year for complete symptomatic recovery. Psychological sequelae may be severe and require specific interventions. 4-9. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas The patient can be evacuated. Employ Standard Precautions; botulism is not communicable person to person. 4-10. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated with other classes of patients. Observe Standard Precautions for evacuation. Section III. CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS TOXINS 4-11. common anaerobic bacillus that produces at least 12 toxins. Spores survive cooking and then germinate and multiply at storage at ambient temperature, slow cooling, or inadequate rewarming. A high inoculum (greater than 100,000 colony-forming units [CFU]/gmof food) is usually required to produce disease. b. Reservoir. The reservoir is soil and the GI tract of healthy persons and animals. c. Transmission. Gas gangrene results from wound contamination with soil containing spores of C. perfringens . Clostridial food poisoning follows ingestion of foods contaminated with soil or feces and then stored under conditions that allow replication of the organism. d. Endemic Disease. The diseases produced by these toxins depend upon the site of C. perfringens colonization or infection and toxin production. For example, wound infection results in gas gangrene,while ingesting contaminated food results in clostridial food poisoning, or in susceptible hosts, enteritisnecroticans. Clostridial food poisoning is usually a brief, self-limited disease, featuring the abrupt onset ofnausea, abdominal colic, and diarrhea; vomiting and fever are rare. Individuals can develop gas gangreneby having wounds contaminated with soil containing bacterial spores. The spores germinate, resulting inbacterial toxin production. Gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis) features necrosis of skeletal muscle andoverlying soft tissue and constitutes a surgical emergency. 4-12. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is delivery of C. perfringens alpha toxin as an aerosol to the respiratory tract. This would result in pulmonary disease, vastly different from the naturally occurring diseases associated with C. perfringens. The toxin may also be delivered in combination with other toxins to produce a variety of clinical effects.4-6FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C 4-13. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect environmental samples for submission to the supporting medical laboratory for analysis. Medical personnel collect pulmonary secretions from patients presenting with signsand symptoms for laboratory analysis. 4-14. Prevention There is no pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for C. perfringens. 4-15. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. The incubation period is 1 to 6 hours. b. Signs and Symptoms. Aerosol challenges of C. perfringens alpha toxin produce lethal pulmonary disease in laboratory animals. The C. perfringens alpha toxin is a highly toxic phospholipase, which will result in severe injury to the exposed respiratory tract. An aerosol delivery can produce a severepulmonary capillary leak, resulting in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.Absorbed toxin can lead to intravascular hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and liver damage. 4-16. Diagnosis Acute serum and tissue specimens should be collected and transported to the designated reference laboratory for toxin immunoassay. Clinical laboratory findings could include anemia, thrombocytopenia, abnormalliver function tests, and hypoxia. The differential diagnosis should include other causes of ARDS includingchemical warfare (CW) agent (phosgene or mustard) to ricin orstaphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and other diverse etiologies ofARDS. Pulmonary disease due to SEB will be less severe; also hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, or liverdamage should not occur. 4-17. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary according to severity and stage of illness and available resources. b. Medical Management . Medical management consist of supportive care. Patients may require assisted ventilation to relieve the respiratory effects. There are no specific antitoxins or antidotes available c. Prognosis . Prognosis is poor. 4-18. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions in patient care. The C. perfringens toxin is not communicable person to person.4-7FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C 4-19. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated. Apply Standard Precautions during evacuation. Section IV. RICIN 4-20. General a. Etiologic Agent. Ricin is a potent cytotoxin derived from the beans of the castor plant ( Ricinus communis ). Over one million tons of castor beans are processed annually in the production of castor oil, which is used for medicinal and industrial purposes including the production of aircraft and marine enginelubricants, dyes, and paints. The waste mash from this process is approximately 5 percent ricin by weight.Consequently, large quantities of ricin are easily and inexpensively produced. Ricin consists of twohemagglutinins and two toxins. These toxins are dimers consisting of cytotoxic A chains and B chainswhich serve as transport peptides and bind to cellular membrane receptors. Ricin toxins are potentinhibitors of DNA replication and protein synthesis. The toxin can be transmitted through contaminatedfood and water, percutaneously via small pellets/projectiles designed to carry toxins, or as a BW aerosol. b. Reservoir. Castor beans. c. Transmission. Transmission has been by inhalation of organism during industrial operations. Also, transmitted through ingestion of castor bean meal. d. Endemic Disease. There is no endemic disease; however, there have been exposures in industrial operations. Clinical features vary according to the route of intoxication and toxin dose. Accidentalsublethal aerosol exposures occurred during the 1940\u0092s. Patients presented with acute onset of fever, chesttightness, cough, dyspnea, nausea, and arthralgias 4 to 8 hours after exposure. The onset of profusesweating several hours later was the sign of termination of most of the symptoms. Lethal aerosol exposuresin humans have not been reported; however, large aerosol exposures in experimental animals result innecrosis of upper and lower respiratory epithelium, and perivascular and alveolar edema. Respiratory tractexposure to a large dose will produce necrosis of the entire exposed respiratory tract; pulmonary capillaryleaks result in extravasation of protein-rich fluid into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema, ARDS, andrespiratory failure. Ingestion results in necrosis of the GI epithelium, local hemorrhage, and hepatic,splenic, and renal necrosis. Intramuscular injection results in severe local muscle necrosis and visceralorgan involvement. 4-21. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is delivery of the BW agent by aerosol release. Ricin is less toxic than botulinum. A larger quantity is required to cover a significant area on a battlefield. This feature may limit the use of ricinas a tactical weapon; however, it can be used for small-scale operations. The agent may also be deliveredthrough contamination of and water supplies.4-8FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C 4-22. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect aerosol samples for supporting laboratory identification. Preventive medicine/PHS/BEE personnel collect suspect contaminated water samples for laboratory identification.Veterinary/PVNTMED/PHS personnel collect suspect contaminated food samples. Veterinary personnelcollect specimens from government-owned animals for supporting laboratory identification. Medicaltreatment personnel collect specimens from patients presenting with signs and symptoms for laboratoryidentification. The supporting laboratory performs an antigen detection (ELISA) test to identify the presenceof toxins in samples or specimens. 4-23. Prevention a.Pre-exposure prophylaxis is not available; however, candidate vaccines are under development. b.Post-exposure prophylaxis is not available. 4-24. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation Period. The incubation period is 18 to 24 hours. b. Signs and Symptoms. See endemic disease, paragraph 4-20. 4-25. Diagnosis Serum and respiratory secretions may be submitted for antigen detection (ELISA). Immunohistochemical stains of tissue may also be available. Paired acute and convalescent sera for antibody studies can besubmitted from survivors. Nonspecific laboratory and radiographic findings may include neutrophilicleukocytosis, bilateral interstitial infiltrates compatible with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. include phosgene exposure, SEB, Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome,atypical pneumonias including Q fever and tularemia, and diverse causes of ARDS. 4-26. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary according to severity of illness and available resources. Respiratory distress would result in placement of the patient in the Immediate category ifrespiratory support was available, or Expectant if respiratory support was not available. Patients withmilder presentations would be candidates for the Delayed category. b. Medical Management . (1) Supportive care including intensive care measures, such as supplemental oxygen, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure, and hemodynamicmonitoring, may be required for respiratory disease.4-9FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C (2) Gastrointestinal intoxication is managed by vigorous gastric decontamination with lavage and superactivated charcoal, followed by use of cathartics such as magnesium citrate. Volumereplacement of GI tract fluid loss is important. (3) In percutaneous exposures, treatment would be primarily supportive, managing specific organ system failures. (4) Specific therapeutic drugs are not currently available. c. Prognosis . Prognosis depends on the route and intensity of exposure. Due to a lack of data, specific prognosis outcomes cannot be stated. 4-27. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions in patient care. Ricin is not communicable person to person. 4-28. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated. Section V. SAXITOXIN 4-29. General a. Etiologic Agent. Saxitoxin is the parent compound of a group of related neurotoxins produced by marine dinoflagellates of the genus Gonyaulax. b. Reservoir. Shellfish. c. Transmission. Saxitoxin is transmitted to humans by ingesting bivalve mollusks, which accumulate dinoflagellates during filter feeding. d. Endemic Disease. Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a severe, life-threatening neuromuscular condition. Saxitoxin is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract following ingestion ofcontaminated shellfish. Saxitoxin binds to the sodium channels of nerve and muscle tissue, preventingpropagation of action potentials in excitable cells. This leads to neuromuscular dysfunction, and in severecases, death due to respiratory paralysis and respiratory failure. In contrast to botulism, sensory and CNSsymptoms are present in addition to motor symptoms. Symptoms begin as early as 10 minutes to severalhours after ingestion, depending on the ingested dose and host factors. Initial symptoms include numbnessand tingling of the lips, tongue, and fingertips; followed by numbness of the neck and extremities and motor4-10FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C incoordination. Cranial nerve involvement can result in diplopia, speech, and swallowing difficulties. Other symptoms may include light-headedness, dizziness, weakness, confusion, memory loss, and headache.Flaccid paralysis and respiratory failure are life-threatening complications, and occur within 2 to 12 hoursafter ingestion. The toxin is rapidly cleared by renal excretion; however, complete neurologic recoverymay require 7 to 14 days. 4-30. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is delivery by aerosol release. Saxitoxin may also be delivered by projectiles or by contamination of food and water. Contamination of food and water supplies would be on a very limitedbasis. 4-31. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect aerosol samples for supporting laboratory identification. Preventive medicine/PHS/BEE personnel collect suspect contaminated water samples for laboratory identification.Veterinary/PVNTMED/PHS personnel collect suspect contaminated food samples. Veterinary personnelcollect specimens from government-owned animals for supporting laboratory identification. Medicaltreatment personnel collect specimens from patients presenting with signs and symptoms for laboratoryidentification. 4-32. Prevention a. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. There is no pre-exposure prophylaxis available. Avoidance of potentially contaminated food and water will protect individuals from the effects of ingested toxins. b. Post-exposure Prophylaxis. There is no post-exposure prophylaxis available. 4-33. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. Minutes to hours. b. Signs and Symptoms. Clinical features would be similar to those discussed above for endemic disease; animal experiments using aerosol challenges suggest that the clinical course following inhalation isaccelerated and that death occurs within minutes following exposure. 4-34. Diagnosis Diagnosis is confirmed by antigen (toxin) detection by ELISA test or mouse bioassay. Clinical specimens which may be submitted for toxin assay include stomach contents, serum, and in identified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Routine clinical laboratory findings are not specific for saxitoxin poisoning. Cardiac conduction disturbances may develop;however, these electrocardiographic findings are nonspecific. The differential diagnosis of saxitoxinpoisoning includes ciguatoxin (ciguatera) and tetrodotoxin ingestion. Ciguatoxin occurs following ingestionof large finned reef fish, and in contrast to saxitoxin, will result in more severe GI symptoms (nausea,vomiting, diarrhea), and in a peculiar reversal of temperature sensation\u0097hot feels cold, cold feels hot. 4-35. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories vary according to the severity of the disease and availability of resources. Following aerosol delivery or toxic projectile, patients may be consideredcandidates for the Immediate category for airway and ventilatory support, if available; or candidates for theExpectant category in remote, isolated locations. b. Medical Management . Supportive care is essential. Airway management and mechanical respiratory support is required for severe intoxication. Standard management of poison ingestion, includingsuperactivated charcoal, should be used following oral ingestion. c. Prognosis . Prognosis following an aerosol challenge is poor. 4-36. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions in patient care. Saxitoxin is not transmitted person to person. 4-37. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated. Apply Standard Precautions during evacuation. Section VI. STAPHYLOCOCCAL ENTEROTOXIN B 4-38. General a. Etiologic Agent. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is one of numerous exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus (S.) aureus . Up to one-half of all clinical isolates of S. aureus produce exotoxins; related toxins include toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and exfoliative toxins. The SEB toxin is heat-stableand is the second most common source of outbreaks of food poisoning. b. Reservoir. The reservoir of S. aureus is humans (especially, food handlers with infected cuts on their hands, abscesses, acne eruptions, nasal discharges, or on occasion, from normal appearing skin)and contaminated milk or milk products. The SEB is usually produced in foods contaminated with S. aureus .4-12FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C c. Transmission. Ingestion of food, milk, or milk products containing preformed toxin . d. Endemic Disease. Staphylococcal food poisoning features the acute onset of fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within hours of intoxication. The toxin increases intestinal peristalsis; severe nauseaand vomiting may be due to stimulation of the CNS. The staphylococcal enterotoxins belong to a class ofpotent immune stimulants known as bacterial superantigens. Superantigens bind to monocytes at majorhistocompatibility complex type II receptors rather than the usual antigen binding receptors. This leads tothe direct stimulation of large populations of T-helper cells while bypassing the usual antigen processing andpresentation. This results in a brisk cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of otherimmune effector cells, and a relatively deficient activation of counter-regulatory negative feedback loops.This results in an intense inflammatory response that can injure host tissues. 4-39. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The primary threat is SEB aerosol release. The SEB may also be employed by sabotage contamination of food and/or water supplies. 4-40. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect aerosol samples for supporting laboratory identification. Preventive medicine/PHS/BEE personnel collect suspect contaminated water samples for laboratory identification.Veterinary/PVNTMED/PHS personnel collect suspect contaminated food samples. Veterinary personnelcollect specimens from government-owned animals for supporting laboratory identification. Medicaltreatment personnel collect specimens from patients presenting with signs and symptoms for laboratoryidentification. The supporting laboratory performs toxin assay of epidemiologically implicated food orwater. The laboratory can also perform toxin assay of environmental samples following an aerosol attack. 4-41. Prevention a. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. Currently, there is no pre-exposure prophylaxis available. Protecting food and water supplies from contamination and avoiding potentially contaminated food andwater will protect individuals from the effects of ingested toxins. Post-exposure Prophylaxis . however, passive immunization (immunoglobulin) can attenuate experimental disease in experimental animals if givenwithin 4 to 8 hours post-exposure. There are no human data or practice guidelines. 4-42. Biological Warfare Clinical Presentation a. Incubation. Variable. 4 to 10 hours for GI illness.4-13FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C b. Signs and Symptoms. Illness due to poisoning of food or water supplies will present as acute GI illness (see endemic disease, paragraph 4-38). Illness due to inhalation will result in respiratory tractdisease not encountered in the endemic disease. This is due to the activation of pro-inflammatorycytochylema cascades in the lungs, leading to pulmonary capillary leak and pulmonary edema. Symptomsinclude fever, headache, myalgia, nonproductive cough, and in severe cases, dyspnea. Gastrointestinalsymptoms may also occur due to inadvertent swallowing of SEB delivered via aerosol and deposited in theupper aero-digestive tract, or coughed following mucociliary clearance. Severe cases may result in acutepulmonary edema and respiratory failure. 4-43. Diagnosis Diagnosis includes performing toxin assay (antigen detection) of implicated food or water and on environmental samples collected following a suspect BW attack. Clinical specimens that could be sent fortoxin assay include serum and respiratory secretions. However, the toxin may not be detectable before theonset of symptoms. Acute and convalescent sera for antibody tests will confirm the diagnosis. Nonspecificfindings may include leukocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate, and in severe cases, chest x-ray abnormalitiesfeaturing pulmonary edema. Differential diagnosis include pneumonia injury (mustard, phosgene), and in severe cases, other diverse causes of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and ARDS. 4-44. Treatment a. Triage Categories . Triage categories will vary with conditions and available resources. Patients with acute respiratory distress should be placed in the Immediate category to obtain respiratorysupport. Patients without respiratory distress should be placed in the Delayed category. b. Medical Management . Medical management is primarily supportive care; symptomatic relief may be provided by the use of acetaminophen and cough suppressants. Severe cases will require intensivecare including respiratory support, hemodynamic monitoring, and possibly diuretics and vasopressors. c. Prognosis . Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is considered an incapacitating agent; most patients may be expected to make a full recovery, although most patients will be unfit for duty for 1 to 2 weeks.Patients with pulmonary edema and respiratory failure will be at risk for mortality. 4-45. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions in patient care. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is not communicable person to person. 4-46. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated. Observe Standard Precautions in patient movement.4-14FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) (T2) mycotoxins are a diverse group of over 40 compounds produced by molds of the genus Fusarium . These toxins inhibit protein and DNA synthesis, mitochondrial respiration, and alter cell membrane structure and function. Naturally occurring mycotoxicosis occurs inlivestock following ingestion of grains contaminated with molds. b. Reservoir. Moldy grain. c. Transmission. Ingestion of moldy grains. d. Endemic Disease . While there have been no laboratory-confirmed cases of human disease due to T2 mycotoxins, these toxins are thought to have caused an epidemic of foodborne illness (alimentarytoxic aleukia) in Russia during World War II due to the ingestion of foods prepared from moldy grain. 4-48. Biological Warfare Agent Delivery The toxin may be delivered by aerosol release or through contamination of food and water supplies. These toxins are the agents allegedly delivered via aerosol during the \u0093Yellow Rain\u0094 attacks in Afghanistan andSoutheast Asia during the 1970s and 1980s. The T2 mycotoxins are the only potential BW agents that canharm and be absorbed through intact skin. 4-49. Environmental Detection The NBC reconnaissance teams collect aerosol samples for supporting laboratory identification. Preventive medicine/PHS/BEE personnel collect suspect contaminated water samples for laboratory identification.Veterinary/PVNTMED/PHS personnel collect suspect contaminated food samples. Veterinary personnelcollect specimens from government-owned animals for supporting laboratory identification. Medicaltreatment personnel collect specimens from patients presenting with signs and symptoms for laboratoryidentification. The supporting laboratory performs toxin assay of epidemiologically implicated food orwater. The laboratory can also perform gas-liquid and high-pressure liquid chromatography ofenvironmental a pre-exposure prophylaxis, the use of topical antivesicant cream or ointment may provide limited protection of skin surfaces. Food and water contaminated withmycotoxins must not be consumed. b. Post-exposure Prophylaxis. Presentation a. Incubation. The incubation period is minutes after exposure. b. Signs and Symptoms. The BW disease presentation will vary according to the portal of entry and delivered dose. Mycotoxins are highly cytotoxic and may be viewed as \u0093radiomimetic\u0094 agents, orhaving effects similar to vesicants, especially mustard agents. Delivery to the skin may cause a burning skinpain, redness, tenderness, blistering, and progression to skin necrosis with eschar formation and sloughing.Respiratory exposure may result in nasal itching with pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing, epistaxis, dyspnea,wheezing, and cough. Exposure of the conjunctivae and other mucosal surfaces may result in local burningpain and redness, followed by necrosis. Gastrointestinal exposure would be expected to result in nausea,vomiting, crampy abdominal pain, and watery or bloody diarrhea. Systemic absorption may followdelivery via any route and would result in late toxicity of decreased blood cell counts, predisposing tobleeding and sepsis. 4-52. Diagnosis Serum and urine should be sent for antigen detection. The parent toxin and metabolites (50 to 75 percent) are eliminated in urine and feces within 24 hours; however, metabolites can be detected as late as 28 daysafter exposure. 4-53. Treatment a. Triage Categories . The triage category varies with the stage and severity of illness and available resources. b. Medical Management . Following oral ingestion, standard therapy for poison ingestion including the use of superactivated charcoal is indicated. Other measures of supportive care depend uponthe organ system involved (for examples, respiratory support for respiratory involvement and standard burncare for cutaneous involvement). All medical interventions are supportive; there are no antidotes or otherspecific therapies available. c. Prognosis . Prognosis following the development of symptoms is poor. 4-54. Control of Patients, Contacts, and Treatment Areas Apply Standard Precautions in patient care. Mycotoxins are not transmitted person to person. 4-55. Medical Evacuation Patients may be evacuated. Observe Standard Precautions during evacuation.A-1FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C APPENDIX A RECOGNITION OF A BIOLOGICAL WARFARE AGENT CASUALTY A-1. General a.Medical personnel must be familiar with the signs and symptoms of BW agent casualties. With current technology, it is likely that a BW attack will be completed before the local commander, or hismedical advisor, is aware that it has taken place. The medical officer must attempt to distinguish betweenan epidemic of natural origin and a BW attack. b.Medical and tactical intelligence channels should communicate with each other as early as possible. Threat information on potential enemy force use of BW weapons/agents is important for planningand executing HSS operations. Once BW agents have been used, identification of agents will be importantto medical intelligence channels for operational purposes. c.Medical units should rely on information not only from detectors and intelligence sources, but also from the casualties themselves. This applies particularly to BW weapons/agents since at present thereare no rapid methods of detection or identification. Some of the problems in the recognition and diagnosisof casualties suffering from the effects of BW operations are discussed here. Medical personnel mustremember that the signs and symptoms of most BW agents are identical to or similar to those of endemicand epidemic diseases. The nature and timing of symptoms will vary with the route of exposure. Althoughmost BW agents require days to manifest, some agents produce their effects in minutes to a few hours. It isimportant that the fullest and earliest information be given to medical units when the enemy has used BWweapons/agents. This information is used to facilitate the diagnosis of individual cases, to initiate immediatetreatment, and to permit the arrangement for the reception of casualties. A-2. Types of Casualties On the BW battlefield, the following types of casualties may be seen: a. Conventional Casualties. (1) Conventional casualties with no BW injury and with no contamination of their clothing and equipment. (2) Conventional casualties with no BW injury but with contamination of their clothing and equipment. b. Direct Biological Warfare Casualties. (1) Biological warfare agent casualties with no other injury.(2) Mixed casualties with conventional and BW injuries. Since BW munitions often include burst charges, such injuries may occur as part of a BW agent attack. They may also be present when theA-2FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C BW injury and conventional injury occur at different times. Other types of mixed casualties may be from nuclear or chemical weapons used as well as the biological weapons. Also, mixed casualties may resultwhen biological injuries are combined with natural illnesses (infectious disease still accounts for the majorityof casualties in conventional warfare). c. Indirect Biological Warfare Casualties. (1) Casualties suffering combat stress reaction occur often in warfare, but may be more frequent where NBC threats exist. The service member will have the additional stress of isolation fromwearing the chemical protective ensemble; additional fatigue when wearing the protective garments; andfear of NBC agents. See FM 8-51, FM 22-51, and MCRP 6-11c for additional information on combatstress control. (2) Some BW agent treatments can have undesirable side effects when taken inappropriately, or in large enough quantities. Antibiotics kill desirable bacteria in the digestive tract, causing abdominalpain and frequent bowel movements. Medical personnel must be alert for their appearance. (3) Wearing the protective ensemble makes dissipation of excess body heat more difficult. Wearing the mask also makes water intake difficult. Both will increase the probability of heat injury (heatexhaustion or heat stroke). (4) Indirect BW casualties will most likely be the largest group requiring treatment. A-3. Recognize Biological Casualties a.It is unlikely that BW agents will produce single casualties under field conditions. Also, a BW attack should be suspected with any sudden increase in the numbers of unexplained casualties presentingwith the same signs and symptoms. If BW operations are unlikely, and if relatively few service membersare affected, an endemic or epidemic disease may be more probable (for example, Salmonella food poisoning). If the number of cases continue to present over an extended period, as opposed to a largenumber presenting in one or two days, a naturally occurring epidemic is suspected. b.Under operational conditions, the psychological effects may complicate the medical situation. To determine if a BW agent has caused the casualty, the medical officer should ask questions along thefollowing lines: \u0095 Was the casualty wearing full MOPP at the time of the exposure? \u0095 Was there any aircraft or artillery bombardment in the area at the time of the attack? \u0095 Was there anyone in the area dispersing a suspicious spray or vapor from portable or vehicle-mounted devices? \u0095 Were there any suspicious persons around the unit water supply or in the unit food service area?A-3FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C \u0095 Was there any evidence of spray, liquid droplets, or suspicious persons in the area? \u0095 Was anyone else affected and if so, what effects? c.To recognize a BW attack, the identity of the agent must be determined. (1) The medical officer should consider the following: \u0095 Groups of patients from a specific unit/area presenting with the same illness signs and symptoms in a short period of time (hours to days). \u0095 Signs and symptoms not associated with any known endemic diseases in the AO. (2) Also, question the patient about the delay or rapidity of the onset of symptoms. Was there any delay between exposure or contamination and the onset of effects? If so, how long was the delay? \u0095 Did the effects persist after adjustment of the protective mask?\u0095 Has the casualty used any self-injection device or did anyone else use any injection devices on the casualty? If so, did the symptoms improve or deteriorate? \u0095 Is the casualty\u0092s behavior normal? d.To assess the dose of the agent received by the patient, determine the following: \u0095 Was the casualty exercising or at rest?\u0095 Was the casualty in the open or under cover?\u0095 How long was the suspect BW agent inhaled?\u0095 How long was the interval between and decontamination?B-1FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C APPENDIX B MEDICAL MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT IN BIOLOGICAL WARFARE OPERATIONS Section I. US ARMY MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES B-1. General All US Army MTFs must be prepared to receive mass casualties caused by exposure to BW agents. A mass casualty situation exists when the number and type of casualties exceed the local medical support capabilitiesfor their care. If the unit follows conventional operational standing operating procedures, an overwhelmingbacklog of work will rapidly accumulate. Such backlogs can result in unnecessary loss of life and limb withsuffering. Therefore, all HSS planners must prepare plans for mass casualty situations and all units must betrained and equipped for these plans. The unit must be ready to operate with minimal confusion. Medicalunits must provide medical treatment to these casualties and supervise their decontamination. Normally,individual service members are responsible for their own decontamination. For casualties who are injuredand unable to decontaminate themselves, this process has to be performed by buddy aid, by unit personnelat a decontamination site, or at an MTF by nonmedical personnel from the supported units. a.At US Army Levels I and II (unit, division, and nondivisional) units, the supported unit commander must provide at least 8 nonmedical personnel to perform patient decontamination. At US ArmyLevels III and IV (corps and echelons above corps) hospitals, a 20-man patient decontamination augmentationteam or 20 nonmedical personnel must be provided to perform patient decontamination. The base clustercommander or units within the geographical area of the hospital must provide the 20 nonmedical personnel. b.Medical personnel must supervise patient decontamination personnel to ensure patient conditions are not aggravated by decontamination process. Supervising medical personnel must make thefinal determination on the completeness of patient decontamination. c.If the supported units do not have the necessary resources to provide nonmedical personnel, the units (not the medical services) must address this issue with higher headquarters. B-2. Objectives of Health Service Support in Biological Warfare Operations The objectives of HSS in BW operations are to\u0097 a.Return to duty the maximum number of personnel as soon as possible. b.Manage casualties so that BW agent injuries are minimized and any other injuries or illnesses are not aggravated. c.Protect persons handling contaminated casualties or working in contaminated areas. d.Avoid spreading contamination in ambulances, other evacuation vehicles and aircraft, MTFs, and adjoining areas.B-2FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C e.Continue the MTF\u0092s operations to maintain normal services unrelated to the medical treatment of BW agent illnesses and injuries. B-3. Planning for the Management and Treatment of Biologically Contaminated Casualties The initial management and treatment of casualties contaminated with a BW agent will vary with the tactical situation and the nature of the contaminant. Therefore, each MTF must have a plan and put it into effectimmediately, then modify it to meet each specific situation. Patient decontamination sites are collocatedwith an MTF. This ensures that medical supervision of patient decontamination is available. Specifics onmanagement of BW-contaminated patients at the MTF are found in FM 8-10-7. Each MTF has identicalmedical equipment sets (MES) for chemical agent patient decontamination and treatment. The numbers ofeach type of MES vary, depending on the level of care. For example, the battalion aid station (BAS) hasone chemical agent patient decontamination MES and two chemical agent patient treatment MES. Thepatient decontamination MES provides sufficient supplies to decontaminate 60 patients. Each chemicalagent patient treatment MES provides sufficient medical supplies to treat 30 patients. The chemical agentpatient treatment MES contains the patient protective wraps (PPWs) that are needed to transportdecontaminated litter patients to the next level MTF. Each MTF must be prepared to treat\u0097 \u0095 Biological warfare agent casualties generated within the geographical area of the MTF.\u0095 Patients received from a forward and, in some cases, a lateral MTF.\u0095 Patients suffering from a combination of injuries/illnesses (such as BW and conventional, BW and chemical agent, and BW and endemic disease.) \u0095 Patient suffering from battle injuries and DNBIs that have not been exposed to any NBC agents.\u0095 Enemy prisoners of war, detained persons, and noncombatants, when directed. B-4. Emergency Medical Treatment of Biologically Contaminated Casualties a.Biological warfare agent casualties received at an MTF may also have traumatic wounds or illnesses due to other causes. Management of these patients must minimize the BW agent injuries withoutaggravating their traumatic wounds or illnesses. b.Triage of arriving casualties is extremely important. A decision is made whether EMT or decontamination of the casualty requires priority. Airway management and/or control of hemorrhage maybe equal to or more urgent than treatment for BW agent poisoning. Therefore, EMT measures may have tobe performed in rapid sequence with decontamination or by simultaneous team actions. c.For contaminated casualties who have traumatic injuries or other illnesses, decontamination should be accomplished as soon as the situation permits. Lifesaving measures for a traumatic injury orsome illnesses must be given priority over immediate decontamination, although the delay may increase theBW 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C d.When a contaminated casualty has another injury or illness resulting in respiratory difficulty, hemorrhage, or shock, the order of priority for emergency action is as follows: (1) Control respiratory failure (provide assisted ventilation) and/or massive hemorrhage.(2) Decontaminate the casualty. (3) Administer additional EMT for shock, wounds, and illnesses so severe that delay may be life or limb threatening. (4) Evacuate the casualty as soon as possible, if necessary. B-5. Patient Decontamination Methods a.Patient decontamination serves two purposes\u0097 (1) It prevents the patient\u0092s system from absorbing additional contaminants. (2) It also protects medical personnel treating the patient and other patients from contamination. Accumulated contamination in the MTF is a serious threat to medical personnel andpatients. Accumulated contamination may also impose a serious medical logistical burden on the unit. Theeffectiveness of decontamination is strongly influenced by the time lapse between initial contamination anddecontamination. In many cases, the patient may have absorbed dangerous quantities of a contaminantbefore arriving at the MTF. b.Each service member is trained in immediate decontamination procedures and is equipped to do so. However, any patient arriving at an MTF from a BW-contaminated area is considered contaminated,unless there is positive proof to the contrary. c.A decontamination area is established on the downwind side of the MTF. It is provided with overhead protection such as plastic sheeting, trailer covers, ponchos, tarpaulins, or tents. Only thosepatients requiring treatment at a forward MTF will have their protective overgarments and other clothingremoved. Needless removal of protective clothing only increases the patient\u0092s vulnerability to liquid agentexposure which results in increased injury. Also, forward MTFs do not have replacement protectiveovergarments. Any ambulatory patient decontaminated by clothing removal becomes a litter patient; hemust be placed in a PPW for protection from BW agents during evacuation. Patients not requiringtreatment at a forward MTF, but requiring evacuation to the next level MTF must have their MOPP gearand equipment spot decontaminated. Spot decontamination will remove gross contamination, reducing thehazard to the casualty and evacuation personnel. d.Every person entering the decontamination area (including patients) must be wearing a protective mask or have other respiratory tract protection in place. Most contaminants are removed bycarefully removing all clothing.B-4FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C WARNING Do not remove the patient\u0092s protective mask. Remove the mask hood, overgarments, booties and boots, the BDU, andundergarments. performingpatient decontamination, see FM 8-10-7. e.After patients have been decontaminated, exercise rigid control to prevent exposing their unprotected skin to a liquid BW agent. After treatment in the clean treatment area or collective protectionshelter (CPS), the patient is placed in a PPW (to protect them during evacuation) and taken to the evacuationpoint to await evacuation. Medical personnel must monitor patients at the evacuation point to ensure thattheir condition remains stable; if their condition changes, additional treatment may have to be providedbefore evacuation. f.Ambulatory patients may be able to decontaminate themselves and assist with the decontamination of other ambulatory patients. Their overgarments are not removed unless they must enterthe clean treatment area or CPS for treatment. For patients not entering the clean treatment area or CPS,spot decontaminate the overgarment to remove gross contamination. When possible, have them proceed asgroups of two or three to facilitate control. Ambulatory patients require constant observation and periodicassistance during the decontamination process. The aidman at the decontamination point removes allbandages from patients that will be treated at the MTF. Bandages are not replaced unless needed to controlbleeding. After decontamination, each patient goes through the shuffle pit to the clean treatment area wherewounds are treated and if possible, protective covering is restored. Restore protective covering by tapingholes or tears in the protective overgarment. Patients are then returned to duty or go to the evacuationpoint, as their medical conditions dictate. Ambulatory patients with injuries that do not require immediateattention but require treatment at a higher level MTF are evacuated in their MOPP ensemble. For example,a patient with a broken arm has a stabilizing splint on. This individual does not require treatment at theBAS; however, his MOPP gear must be spot decontaminated to remove gross contamination beforeevacuation to the Level II MTF. NOTE At forward MTFs (Levels I and II), only patients that cannot survive evacuation to the next level MTF will be completely decontaminated(have their clothing removed) and treated at the lower level of carefacility. Patients that are stable but require evacuation to a higherlevel MTF should have their overgarments spot decontaminated beforeevacuation. The patients must be completely decontaminated at theMTF where essential medical care is provided.B-5FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C B-6. Logistics a.Provisions must be made to ensure that medical personnel are supplied and equipped to manage and treat contaminated casualties. Also, supplies and equipment must be provided for the protectionof personnel manning the contaminated areas. Medical supplies are stored or stocked in a manner thatreduces potential loss from BW contamination. b.Patient protective wraps must be available for casualties whose injuries require decontamination (clothing removal) for treatment in the clean treatment area. After treatment, decontaminated patients mustbe placed in PPWs before they are moved to the evacuation point (paragraph B-5 e above). B-7. Training Commanders must ensure that medical personnel and decontamination team members (provided by the supported unit) are trained to manage, decontaminate, and treat BW agent casualties. Personnel must betrained to protect themselves from BW agent injuries. In addition, provisions must be made for practiceexercises to enable them to accomplish their responsibilities with speed and accuracy. Example:Decontaminating a casualty with speed is achieved through practice. Training emphasis should be placed on\u0097 \u0095 Employing individual protection.\u0095 Practicing immediate decontamination procedures. \u0095 Providing EMT. \u0095 Performing casualty decontamination.\u0095 Evacuating decontaminated casualties. \u0095 Evacuating contaminated casualties. \u0095 Sorting and receiving contaminated casualties into a system designed for the treatment of both contaminated and uncontaminated casualties. \u0095 Techniques for patient lifting and litter transfer. \u0095 Using the chemical agent monitor (CAM) and chemical agent detection paper to monitor for and detect chemical agents, if employment in conjunction with BW agents is suspected. B-8. Casualty Evacuation a.Contaminated casualties should be decontaminated as close to the areas where they were contaminated as possible. Their MOPP gear and clothing should not be removed until they arrive at an MTF. Evacuation by ground ambulance must not be delayed for completion of decontamination. Upon arrival atthe MTF where treatment will be provided, all contaminated clothing and equipment (except the protectiveB-6FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C mask) are removed and the skin and protective mask are decontaminated; spot decontaminate the skin. Decontaminated patients continue to be a hazard to persons handling, treating, or transporting them.Therefore, appropriate precautions for the suspected disease must be applied. After decontamination at thefield MTF, the patient is placed in the clean holding area to await admission into the CPS or clean treatmentarea. They must be protected from recontamination. Patients will keep their protective mask on until theyare in the clean treatment area (away from the hotline) or are in the air lock of the CPS (see FM 8-10-7). (1) Once treated, the patient is placed in a PPW before movement to the evacuation pickup point. The PPW protects the individual from further contamination. Individuals inside the PPW no longerhave to wear the protective mask and are evacuated as clean. A plastic window in the PPW permits patientobservation. A patient in a PPW and left in a sunny area is subject to heat build up. The protective maskremains with the patient during evacuation even though it may not be worn. (2) If a BW attack occurs, medical units in the evacuation system can expect to receive contaminated casualties because of the need for hasty evacuation. Therefore, extreme care must be taken toavoid spreading the contamination. b.Before contaminated casualties are evacuated by Army aircraft or landing craft, they should be decontaminated. Otherwise, the BW agent may endanger the crew and other personnel, as ventilation ispoor in aircraft compartments and other enclosed spaces. If casualties cannot be decontaminated beforeevacuation, they should be evacuated by ground ambulance. These casualties should wear their protectivemasks. The hazards of the BW agent to other persons can be further minimized by\u0097 \u0095 Preparing each litter by placing an impermeable cover over it and an open blanket on top of the cover. \u0095 Placing the casualties on the prepared litters and folding the sides of the blankets over them. Although this measure helps protect other persons, it increases the casualties\u0092 exposure to thecontaminant and increases the possibility of heat injuries. \u0095 Providing as much ventilation during transport as the weather and other conditions permit.\u0095 Removing the impermeable covers and blankets with the casualties when they are removed from the vehicles. Litters that have not been protected with impermeable covers must be handledas contaminated. c.Patients being evacuated by USAF AE aircraft should be decontaminated prior to evacuation. See FM 8-10-6 and FM 8-10-7 for procedures on patient evacuation by USAF aircraft. Section II. US AIR FORCE MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES B-9. General a.The USAF recognizes five levels of care.B-7FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN (I) 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C (1) Level I includes self-aid and buddy care, examination and emergency lifesaving measures such as maintenance of airway, control of bleeding, prevention and control of shock, and prevention offurther injury. Medical treatment is administered by independent duty medical personnel. (2) Level II care is administered at the Air Transportable Clinic which assumes AE availability. Patients are stabilized for AE. There is limited outpatient clinical services, initial traumaresponse, and no patient holding capability. (3) Level III care is provided by the Air Transportable Hospital (ATH). There are 10-bed, 25-bed, and 50-bed ATH packages. Normally, individual service members who were exposed to a BWagent and are in need of medical care are assisted by the WMDT in the decontamination process. Forcasualties who are injured and unable to decontaminate themselves, this process has to be performed by theWMDT. (Public health technicians on the WMDTs also have a secondary mission to provide technicalguidance on food decontamination.) (4) Level IV care provides definitive therapy for patients in the recovery phase. If rehabili- tation cannot be accomplished within a pre-determined holding period, patients are evacuated to Level V. (5) Level V care is convalescent, restorative, and rehabilitative. Level V care is normally provided by military, Department of Veterans Affairs, or civilian hospitals in CONUS. b.Military personnel exposed to sufficient BW agents without personal protective equipment and without immunity or prophylaxis will become medical casualties when 75 percent incapacitated.Commanders must be aware that military personnel who become BW medical casualties will requiremedical treatment for more than 7 days and it is unlikely that they will be recovered to 75 percent capacityto permit return to duty until after a lengthy convalescent period. In-theater commanders must makearrangements for medical evacuation of BW casualties and arrangement for replacement personnel.Continental US commanders must prepare for at least a 10-day forecast of patient loads from theatercommanders and identify resources for treatment and recovery of BW patients. Special resources andtransportation requirements will be required for casualties exposed to IQDs; see paragraph 1-21. B-10. Detection of Biological Agents a.For information on the employment, physical properties, infectivity, detection, and control of biological agents, see AFJMAN 32-4009 and AFVA 32-4011. Basically, protection consists of denyingaccess of the agent to the respiratory and digestive systems and immunization of individuals. Skin andwound contamination is of secondary importance. b.If a real-time field detection/identification capability is not present, recognition of BW agents must be based on epidemiology and symptoms. Once illness begins to appear, the presence of an airborneBW agent should be relatively obvious because of the large numbers of casualties and the absence of acommon exposure source such as food or water. However, food and/or water may also serve as a vehicleof transmission. If the situation is not readily apparent, the attack will not have been effective. Someindications of an attack are\u0097B-8FM 8-284/NAVMED P-5042/AFMAN Point-source epidemiology with a record number of sick and dying patients presenting within a short period of time (within 12 to 48 hours). \u0095 Very high attack rates (60 to 90 percent of personnel are affected/symptomatic).\u0095 A high incidence of pulmonary involvement signaling an aerosol route of infection. This would apply to such agents as plague, tularemia, anthrax, and Q fever where the usual form of infection isnot pulmonary. \u0095 \u0093Impossible epidemiology.\u0094 If CCVHF occurred in Alaska or New York, or VEE in England, a man-made epidemic would be extremely likely. \u0095 Record fatality rates would be expected for many agents, since a large number of victims would receive doses of organisms far beyond what could possibly occur in nature. This is especially true ofan aerosol attack. \u0095 Localized areas of disease epidemics might occur in an area or sector downwind from the point of attack. \u0095 Multiple infections at a single site with unusual pathogens. \u0095 Increased numbers of dead animals of all species, such as rats for plague, or horses with equine encephalitis viruses. \u0095 Protection of those working in indoor environments or environments with filtered air at the time of the attack. \u0095 The near simultaneous outbreak of similar or different epidemics at the same site or at different sites in a TO or at military installations around the world. \u0095 Direct evidence of an attack, such as finding an unexploded munitions or a contaminated exploded munitions; admission by hostile forces or terrorists that BW weapons are being used; witnessingan attack; or intelligence information reporting use of BW agents by hostile forces from covert agentsworking within those hostile forces. B-11. Identification The MTF should attempt to identify the agent using whatever laboratory resources are available. The MTF should collect and transport appropriate environmental samples and biological specimens to more capablemedical laboratory facilities, such as the Forward Naval Laboratory or the Area Medical Laboratory. B-12. Decontamination Normally, only life-saving medical treatment can be provided prior to decontamination, as described in AFJMAN 44-149. Decontamination of casualties is done equipment package UTC FFGLA. Decontamination is performed prior to the delivery of definitive care in MTFs. Supplies are sufficient to perform complete body skindecontamination of 500 casualties, but should be reviewed and modified to support local wartime taskingand types of decontamination (DECON) facilities. For example the DECON facility can be connected tothe chemically hardened ATH via air locks at one end of the emergency room/triage area. Decontaminationis performed to arrest the action of the contaminant on the patient and prevent further contamination ofpatients, medical personnel (who may work without protective equipment to maintain full patient carecapabilities) and medical assets. Decontamination does not imply absolute removal of contaminants. Theouter layer of clothing is removed and contaminated skin is washed with germicidal soap or 0.5 percenthypochlorite and warm water. The clothing removal step in the decontamination process offers the greatestopportunity for contaminant removal. Removal of the BDO normally decontaminates approximately 90 to94 percent of the BW agent. If removal of the BDO adequately decontaminates the patient, the rest of theclothing is not removed. Masks are not removed from patients until they have been transferred out of theliquid and vapor hazard areas. Exception: The mask can be removed from the patient for emergencyairway management or resuscitation by the EMT trained personnel assigned to the WMDT. The resuscitationdevice, individual chemical (RDIC) must be used to prevent exposing the patient to secondary aerosolizationhazards. (See FM 8-10-7 and USAF WMDT CONOPS for complete details on patient decontamination.) Section III. US NAVY MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES B-13. General For purposes of this publication, US Navy Level I MTFs include battle dressing stations and medical departments of US naval vessels, and BASs in support of the Fleet Marine Forces, regardless of thepresence of a physician. Where this manual differs from Navy and Marine Corps doctrine, such doctrineshall have precedence. a. Although the decontamination of naval personnel is considered a nonmedical function, it is accepted that the potential scenario exists in which contaminated personnel might arrive at an MTF.Therefore, all arriving casualties should be considered contaminated until proven otherwise, and all levelsshould be prepared to receive such casualties. b. Because of the variation in supported units, readers are referred to unit and higher level medical policy in determining assignment of necessary decontamination personnel. c. No casualty will be denied medical treatment to the degree necessary, given overall medical condition, local resources, other casualty demands, availability of evacuation, and proximity to higherlevels of care, solely due to casualty contamination. This is not to be construed, however, as to precludetriaging a contaminated patient to the Expectant category. Such Expectant category patients should still beprovided minimal care, comfort, pain relief, and other \u0090\u0090\u0090\u0090\u0090EO Executive Order F.Francisella FFahrenheit FDA Food and Drug Administration FM field manual GIgastrointestinal gm gram(s) GU genitourinary HEPA high efficiency particulate air HFRS hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome HIV human immunodeficiency virus HSS health service support IATA International Air Transportation Association IgG immunoglobulin class G IgM immunoglobulin class M IM intramuscular(ly) IND investigational new drug IQD internationally quarantinable disease IVintravenous JBPDS Joint Biological Point Detection System JPO-BIO Joint Program Office for Biological Defense JSLIST Joint service lightweight integrated suit technology kgkilogram(s)Glossary-4C1, Standoff Detection System MCRP Marine Corps Reference Publication MES medical equipment sets mg milligram(s) mlmilliliter(s) MOPP mission-oriented protective posture MRI magnetic resonance imaging MTF medical treatment facility NATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization NAVMED P US Navy Medical Publication NBC nuclear, biological, and chemical PCR polymerase chain reaction PHS public health service PPW patient protective wrap PSP paralytic shellfish poisoning PVNTMED preventive medicine Q fever Query fever QSTAG Quadripartite Standardization Agreement RDIC resuscitation device, individual A disease that is only present in an animal population for limited periods, but has a high morbidity rate. etiologic Cause of the disease/illness. inoculum The amount of microorganisms introduced into a host. \u0090\u0090\u0090\u0090\u0090off-label indication The use of licensed medications for purposes that are not approved by the FDA.
