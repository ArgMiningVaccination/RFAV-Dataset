Three kinds of vaccine used in this study were prepared from formalin-killed pasteurella piscicida cells by the following methods: vaccine I, cells suspended in FREUND'S complete acjuvant; vaccine II, cells suspended in saline; and vaccine III, cells mixed with minced meat of sand launce, Ammodytes personatus, and CMC. These vaccines were administered by different methods and the respective experimental groups of each method on fish were established as follows: Injection method, fish were immunized with vaccine I by intraperitoneal injection one time (group A). Spray method, fish were sprayed with vaccine II for 5-7 s by a sand blasting gun (group B). Immersion methods, a) fish were immersed in vaccine II for 3 min (group C) and b) fish were immersed in the hypertonic solution for 2 min then in vaccine II for 3 min (group D). Oral methods, fish were fed with a) vaccine III (group E) and b) vaccine III mixed with 1.5% NaHCO8 (group F). Both methods were administered daily for a week. The artifical challenge with virulent P. piscicida was carried out three weeks after vaccination. Survival rations for a week after challenge are: 100% for group A and B, 95% (group F), 88% (group E), 73% (group D), and 60% (group C) in comparison with 0% survival in the control. All vaccinations were highly effective. Agglutinating antibody titer in serum determined 3 weeks after vaccination in group A was 1:32-1:128, in group B and F were 1:16, in group C, D and E were 1:4 and in the control was 1:4>. That of the skin mucus in group B, C and D were 1:32, in group F was 1:4 and in group A, E and the control were 1:4>. This suggests that agglutinating antibody is produced at the tissue stimulated with antigen or transferred to the tissue, or both. "}
