Brody, a science reporter for The New York Times, is the author of ''Jane Brody's Nutrition Book,'' which will be published this week. By Jane E. Brody was waiting for a drink at an office water fountain while a young man swallowed not one, not two, but six different pills and capsules. Concerned, I asked if he was all right. ''Sure,'' he replied brightly. ''These are ...'' and he rattled off an alphabet soup of vitamins and minerals, as well as other swallowable items that don't appear on any official list of vital nutrients. ''They're good for you,'' he added in response to my now-skeptical look. ''I take them three times a day.'' Vitamins and minerals -the essential micronutrients in the human diet - are macro items in today's marketplace. Never before has something we need so little of sold so big - some $1.3 billion big, at last count. According to Dr. John Vanderveen, head of the division of nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, ''Vitamin consumption is now increasing at an extremely rapid rate. In the last two years, sales have climbed steeply, almost in a straight line upward.'' Megadoses of micronutrients in every conceivable combination and permutation are now sold in drugstores and supermarkets, as well as in health-food stores, where shelves of unpretentious-looking pills and capsules are often placed next to racks of books and magazines that extol the sometimes questionable, miraculous abilities of micronutrients to promote health and longevity. Yet those who sell these pills and potions rarely explain that hazards can lurk in those bottles innocently labeled ''dietary supplements.'' And self-dosers rarely realize that almost any substance - including water - can have harmful, indeed fatal, side effects if consumed in great enough quantities. Vitamins and minerals have become rallying cries in the consumer revolt against orthodox medicine. Megadose mania is a symptom of the self-help movement that swept the country in the 1970's and promises to grow even bigger during the coming decade. Other factors enhancing the current boom in micronutrients include the advocacy by famous people, like Nobel-Prize winner Linus Pauling, of certain megadoses; the enormous profits derived from the sale and manufacture of micronutrients (health-food store markups can be as high as 1,000 percent over manufacturing costs); a loss of confidence in the nutrient content of the nation's highly processed food supply, and the prevailing philosophy of if-a-little-is-good, moremust-be-better. For nearly every misfortune that might befall the human body or spirit, someone now has a micronutrient solution to offer. The megadose mythology has more than 75 million Americans excreting the most expensive urine in the world, since most of the vitamins and minerals consumed in excess of what the body truely needs are rapidly eliminated. In their unflagging search for health, people looking for cures take vitamin A to treat acne and prevent cancer; the B's to boost energy, ward off depression and conquer alcoholism and schizophrenia; C to combat cancer and the common cold; E to slow aging, spark sexuality and head off heart disease; calcium to calm the nerves and cure the aching back; potassium to counter fatigue and infant colic, and zinc to alleviate arthritis. Not to mention such highly controversial non-nutrients as ''B-17'' (laetrile), the alternative treatment for cancer. As Dr. Victor Herbert, author of ''Nutrition Cultism,'' points out, it is a list dominated by conditions for which medicine has yet to find sure-fire solutions. ''This has been a common theme throughout the history of nutrition quackery,'' says Dr. Herbert, a lawyer as well as a physician who directs the hematology and nutrition laboratory at the Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center and is currently president of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition. ''Sellers are selling fraudulent nutrition because it's lucrative; buyers are buying it because people want to believe in magic. They feel helpless or hopeless and want to be more in control of their own destiny.'' In addition to correcting dietary deficiencies, vitamins and minerals used in megadose quantities as drugs have, in fact, proved useful in combatting some medical disorders - though not nearly as many as the health-fad literature claims - and all of these are disorders that should be treated by a physician, not by self-medication. Preliminary studies by university researchers have suggested that vitamin E therapy can relieve the symptoms of fibrocystic breast disease; prevent breakdown of red blood cells in patients with an inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; protect premature babies from an eye disease called retrolental fibroplasia, and reduce the painful leg spasms of intermittent claudication. High levels of the B vitamin folacin (folic acid) may reverse precancerous abnormalities of the cervix. Large doses of vitamin B-6 may help a rare eye disorder called gyrate atrophy, and zinc supplements can help patients with an inherited disorder called acrodermatitis enteropathica, which can interfere with zinc absorption. Ongoing and future studies may FIRST JUMP pinpoint other benefits of vitamin or mineral megadosing in treating common as well as esoteric disorders. For the most part, however, the widely-acclaimed megadose miracles are a classic demonstration of the power of mind over body and poignant testimony to the importance of properly controlled clinical trials for examining the true effectiveness of a purported remedy or preventive. Modern medicine was not built on a pile of anecdotal incidents such as:''Three years ago, my Aunt Sadie was given three months to live, but her cancer disappeared after she took vitamin C''; or ''Four doctors recommended surgery, but my friend Bob cured his backaches with dolomite.'' While clinical observations, as medical researchers call these incidents, offer clues to what may deserve more thorough examination, no remedy is fully accepted by the medical community until tested under conditions that take into account the placebo, or sugar-pill, effect. This is the benefit derived from the patient's belief in the value of the treatment apart from any direct effect of the treatment itself. Most of the claims for megadoses that have been tested in ways that account for placebo reactions - including vitamin C's purported ability to prevent colds - have been found wanting. Though always essential to animal life,vitamins as such are a 20th-century phenomenon. The word ''vitamine'' was coined in 1911 by a Polish-American biochemist, Casimir Funk, and the first vitamin, A, was identified in 1913. Vitamins are organic substances that are required in the diet either because the human body cannot manufacture them or because the body makes them in inadequate amounts. Altogether, the 13 vitamins (four of them fat-soluble and nine water-soluble) needed in the daily diet amount to only about oneeighth of a teaspoon. Vitamins regulate and facilitate metabolic functions. Most act as coenzymes, combining with body proteins to form metabolically active enzymes, which catalyze hundreds of chemical reactions in the body. In this way, a single vitamin can affect the functions of several different organ systems. Thiamin, for example, is an essential part of an enzyme crucial to the metabolism of carbohydrates; niacin is part of a coenzyme needed to obtain energy from glucose. Excess vitamins are either excreted from the body, stored in body fat and other organs or used by the body as drugs to perform other, nonvitamin functions. It is the process of excreting or storing the excess that often causes serious side effects. Mineral nutrients are inorganic substances that are required in the diet - also in tiny amounts. There are two types: the seven macrominerals, like calcium or potassium, needed in relatively large quantities, and the nine microminerals (or trace minerals), like iron and selenium, that are needed in only miniscule amounts and are usually poisonous in larger doses. An expert committee appointed by the National Academy of Sciences has determined certain levels, called Recommended Dietary Allowances, or R.D.A.'s, that meet the needs of the overwhelming majority of people, differentiating for sex, age and certain special circumstances (pregnancy and lactation). The U.S.R.D.A.'s seen on labels of food products and dietary supplements are set by the Food and Drug Administration for nutrition-labeling purposes and are a simplified form of the R.D.A.'s. For the remaining essential micronutrients that are less well-studied, the committee has established ''estimated safe and adequate'' levels. In all cases, the R.D.A.'s include a sizable built-in safety margin and are designed to take into account the needs of individuals with different genetic backgrounds and life patterns. A megadose has been arbitrarily defined as more than 10 times the R.D.A. In 1973, the F.D.A. proposed to restrict the dosages of vitamins and minerals sold over the counter. But in 1976, an Act of Congress sponsored by William Proxmire, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin, and supported by the megadose lobby, stayed the agency's hand and permitted the sale of ''dietary supplements'' in huge doses and in almost any combination. ''As long as vitamins are harmless and not misadvertised,'' says Howard Shuman, an administrative assistant to Senator Proxmire, ''there is no reason the F.D.A. should limit how much you take any more than they can limit how much water you drink or how many bananas you eat. However, if any vitamin doses are demonstrated to be harmful, the F.D.A. can limit them.'' So far, the only vitamin whose sale is restricted for safety reasons is the B vitamin folacin, which, in doses of more than .5 milligrams, mask the symptoms of pernicious anemia. ''We're derelict if we don't protect the public health,'' says Dr. Vanderveen of the F.D.A., ''and we're criticized for interfering with freedom of choice if we do.'' An F.D.A. advisory panel concluded in March 1979 that even relatively small doses of certain micronutrients are too dangerous to be sold without a prescription or taken without medical supervision. The panel recommended that vitamin K, copper, fluoride, iodine, magnesium, manganese and phosphorus, as well as potassium, be removed from over-the-counter sale, and that vitamin A be sold only in limited doses, because of potential hazards associated with misuse of these substances. But their recommendations have yet to be put into effect. Ironically, the health-food pioneers who originated the megadose movement now share their market with the very food processing concerns whose products they spurn as stripped of ''natural goodness.'' Several large food corporations have attempted to capitalize on the interest in micronutrients by adding vitamins and minerals to their products. Unlike previous enrichment efforts, which were designed to counter widespread nutrient deficiencies (such as the addition of vitamin D to milk) or to replace natural ingredients lost in processing (like the enrichment of bread and flour with B vitamins), most recent fortification schemes are not responding to established nutritional needs. Rather, many nutritionists complain, such efforts are mostly attempts to cash in on the widespread desire for extra vitamins and minerals and to mask the nutritional emptiness of heavily-processed products that are overly refined and/ or laden with fat, sugar or additives. Consumers may think that the vitamin C added to Tang orange drink makes it as beneficial as orange juice, but their bodies know that the natural juice is more than just an orange-colored solution of vitamin C (with some vitamin A). The real juice provides, in addition, potassium and natural fiber, both of which are missing from Tang. Manufacturers make good money on their micronutrient investments: The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer organization, stated in a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission that the two cents worth of extra vitamins and minerals added by General Mills to a 12-ounce box of Total cereal brings in 30 cents more at the checkout counter than a consumer would pay for the company's less-fortified but otherwise comparable cereal, Wheaties. Total is so highly fortified (it contains 100 percent of the recommended daily allowance for 10 micronutrients) that it cannot even be called a breakfast cereal; it must be labeled a ''dietary supplement,'' according to the F.D.A. SECOND JUMP As Carole Christopher, a consultant on advertising practices for the F.T.C. puts it, ''Fortification gives a veneer of nutritional respectability to manufactured foods.'' She deplores the changed role of fortification from a public-health measure to a sales gimmick. The manufacturers of one-a-day type supplements, which contain more reasonable doses of only those vitamins and minerals proven to be dietary essentials, are also trying to get a piece of the action. Through national advertising by manufacturers and ''background information'' issued by the industry-sponsored Vitamin Nutrition Information Service, the one-a-day industry seems to be trying to convince Americans that nearly everyone's diet is somehow unbalanced or inadequate and therefore in need of the supplements it sells. ''Consumers are being misled by manufacturers concerning the need for these products,'' says Dr. Daphne A. Roe, professor of nutrition at Cornell University and author of several professional texts on micronutrient deficiencies. National surveys have shown that most Americans are consuming adequate levels of most vitamins and minerals with their regular meals, and that existing deficiencies can easily be corrected by dietary improvements. There is no question, though, that the typical 1980's American diet is at risk of failing to satisfy the R.D.A.'s. Rarely these days do people intelligently plan the day's meals with an eye toward nutrient content. The modern eat-on-the-run, buy-it-in-a-box, let's-havedinner-out diet has little respect for balancing micronutrient needs. Achieving such a balance is not hard on a diet of 2,000 calories a day consisting of mostly fresh foods from the four major food groups: four servings of vegetables and fruits, including one citrus fruit; four of breads, cereals and grains, including some whole grains; two of milk products and two of meat, fish, poultry or high-quality vegetable protein. Instead, more than half our calories now come from refined and processed foods of sometimes questionable nutrient content. (Not all processed foods are less nutritious than fresh ones, however; tomatoes ripened on the vine and then canned may have as much vitamin C as those picked green, shipped to market and, weeks later, eaten fresh.) America's sedentary lifestyles and its obsession with stick-figure slimness (particularly among affluent and well-educated women) have led to a steady decline in caloric consumption, with the average woman now eating only 1,500 calories a day. ''No matter how we've tried - even eliminating all empty-calorie desserts and snacks -we've been unable to plan a 1,500-calorie menu that would provide all the micronutrients recommended for women of childbearing age,'' says Dr. Mark D. Hegsted, a former Harvard nutritionist who now heads Human Nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture. A person who is physically active has a better chance of consuming needed nutrients because the extra calories burned through exercise allow greater leeway in his or her diet. But even on a more generous regimen of 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day, it is easy to fall short of the recommended micronutrient allowances if a quarter or more of those calories comes from nutritionally deficient alcoholic beverages, sweets and snacks. A daily vitamin-mineral supplement (in amounts not exceeding the U.S.R.D.A.) is generally recommended for pregnant and nursing women, heavy drinkers, strict dieters, anyone on prolonged antibiotic therapy, women who take oral contraceptives and people who eat a limited variety of foods. Extra iron is often needed by women of child-bearing age, especially if they have heavy menstrual bleeding or eat fewer than 1,600 calories a day. Persons with intestinal disorders that interfere with the absorption of fats may need extra fat-soluble vitamins. Strict vegetarians who eat no animal foods need B-12 supplements. Persons who take a one-a-day supplement, however, cannot assume that they have fulfilled their day's micronutrient needs and now can safely consume empty calories or eat haphazardly in place of balanced meals. No supplement currently marketed provides 100 percent of the U.S.R.D.A. for all required nutrients (calcium, potassium, iron and other minerals are commonly in short supply), and other required nutrients are not even in these pills and capsules. The R.D.A.'s cover only 17 of the more than 40 required nutrients. Dr. Helen A. Guthrie, professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University and author of a leading nutrition textbook, says many of the one-a-days are irrationally formulated. ''A recent survey of 10 multinutrient supplements showed that they contained an average of 17 nutrients,'' she explained, ''of which up to 32 percent were present in amounts less than 25 percent of the U.S.R.D.A.'s and up to 47 percent were present in amounts more than 200 percent of the U.S.R.D.A.'s. Some contained as much as 5,000 percent.'' The Upjohn Company, makers of Unicaps, and other major one-a-day manufacturers disagree, saying they stick closely to the R.D.A.s in formulating their products. Most circumstances that compromise vitamin and mineral nutrition can be managed through diet rather than supplements. For example, there is evidence that heavy smokers and persons undergoing surgery or a related physical trauma might benefit from extra vitamin C, which is easily obtained by eating more C-rich foods. Persons taking diuretics, which wash needed potassium out of the body, are advised to consume at least four ounces of orange juice or eat an orange or a banana or other potassium-rich food daily. But potassium supplements can be dangerous and should not be taken without medical supervision. A 32-year-old woman who took a potassium supplement whenever she felt weak or tired died of an overdose of the mineral. A two-month-old infant, whose parents said they followed the advice of the late Adelle Davis to treat colic with potassium, met with a similar fate. The parents sued the Davis estate and her publisher for more than $1 million in damages. The estate filed a denial, and the case is now being prepared for a jury trial. Physicians at Yale University School of Medicine tell of a 4-yearold hyperactive boy who fell ill after being given massive doses of vitamin A. The child became extremely irritable, ran a fever, developed an enlarged liver and severe leg pain. The symptoms gradually abated during four weeks in the hospital as levels of vitamin A in his body declined. Vitamins A, D and K are especially dangerous in large doses because, as fat-soluble vitamins, they are stored in the body. Vitamin A toxicity has occurred at daily doses only five to eight times greater than the daily recommended amount of 1,000 retinol equivalents (the units by which Vitamin A is now measured). Too much D can cause kidney stones, irreversible kidney damage, deposits of calcium in soft tissues, abnormal heart rhythms, lethargy, coma and even death. Vitamin E, a mainstay of megadosers, is also a fat-soluble vitamin, but thus far the risks of large amounts are ill-defined. Megadoses of E can interfere with blood-clotting by destroying some of the vitamin K made in the body. In laboratory animals, excess E delays wound healing and impairs formation of vitamin A in the liver. THIRD JUMP Water-soluble vitamins in excessive amounts can also cause trouble. B vitamins tend to work as a team, and an overdose of one may create a greater need for others, in effect inducing a shortage. Excess pantothenic acid, for example, may precipitate thiamin deficiency symptoms, such as muscular weakness and leg cramps. Megadoses of the B vitamin folacin can mask the symptoms of a B-12 deficiency. Large amounts of vitamin B-6 may cause liver damage and can produce a dependency on high doses. As for the most popular member of the megadose set, vitamin C, excessive doses can create a dependency on abnormal amounts, precipitating symptoms of scurvy when they are suddenly discontinued (in fact, many doctors suggest that discontinuing megadoses of C be done gradually). In Canada, researchers observed that infants born to mothers who had taken vitamin C supplements during pregnancy developed scurvy when they received normal levels of the vitamin. Vitamin C megadoses can precipitate kidney or bladder stones in persons prone to this condition. Other side effects of vitamin C megadoses include diarrhea, urinary tract irritation and an increased tendency of the blood to clot. They can also distort blood-sugar tests for diabetes and examinations for hidden blood in the stool. Mineral overdoses can be even more dangerous. An actress's career was prematurely ended at age 37 when she became unable to walk without a cane. During the previous three years her health had deteriorated dramatically with loss of weight and hair, muscular weakness, anemia, abdominal pains and constipation. Though 22 doctors were unable to deduce the cause, she eventually was shown to be suffering from lead poisoning, the result of taking lead-contaminated bone meal as a calcium supplement. According to Dr. Victor Herbert, such toxic contaminants do not occur in pure calcium supplements but are likely to be found in bone meal and dolomite. Too much calcium - even when pure - can cause troubles, such as drowsiness and extreme lethargy and may also interfere with the absorption of the essential trace minerals: iron, zinc and manganese. Megadoses of phosphorus can, in turn, induce a relative deficiency of calcium. And magnesium excesses can upset the function of the nervous system by distorting the balance of calcium to magnesium. Magnesium megadoses are also cathartic (Milk of Magnesia, for example). Large doses of most of the trace minerals - copper, fluorine, selenium, manganese and molybdenum - are outright poisons. While excesses of most minerals can be excreted, the body has only one way to get rid of extra iron - through bleeding. Chronic overdoses can result in a build-up of toxic amounts, causing damage to the liver, pancreas and heart. Taking iron supplements without a doctor's advice is ill-advised, although the amounts of iron in most multivitamin preparations are below toxic levels. Excessive amounts of zinc, another popular mineral with megadosers, can cause nausea, vomiting, bleeding in the stomach, premature birth or stillbirth, abdominal pain, fever and severe anemia. It can also reduce the amount of a cholesterol-carrying blood protein that appears to protect against heart disease. Many of the most prominent claims for vitamin and mineral megadoses have been discredited by properly designed studies. Ohio State University researchers studied the effects of megavitamin therapy on 31 children with hyperactivity and learning disabilities. The children were randomly assigned to receive either the vitamins or a placebo. Only two children improved significantly in the course of the experiment - and both were on the placebo. Similarly, an expert task force of the American Psychiatric Association made a placebocontrolled test of megavitamin therapy (also called orthomolecular treatment) for schizophrenia and found it ineffective. Except for those people suffering from pernicious anemia as a result of an inherited inability to absorb vitamin B-12, injections of that vitamin provide nothing more than a diminished purse and a sore butt. According to Dr. Paul R. McCurdy, professor of medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine, megadoses of B-12 can neither provide ''more pep,'' nor counter depression or fatigue or neurological disorders in persons who are already absorbing adequate amounts of the vitamin. As for vitamin C and the common cold, Linus Pauling's claims and the personal testimony of countless Americans notwithstanding, carefully controlled studies show it is primarily a case of mind over matter. Nearly a dozen double-blind studies (that is, studies in which neither subject nor experimenter knew who took the placebo and who took the vitamin until the test was over) showed no decrease in the frequency of colds and at best an occasional diminution in the severity of cold symptoms among those taking the vitamin. More recently, vitamin C has been touted as a cancer treatment and preventive. A study by Dr. Pauling and Dr. Ewan Cameron at a small hospital in the Scottish Highlands among 100 ''terminal'' cancer patients who were given 10 grams of vitamin C a day showed that they lived an average of 300 days longer than a similar group of 1,000 patients not given the vitamin. A more strictly controlled study at the Mayo Clinic of 60 terminal cancer patients randomly assigned to receive either vitamin C or a placebo showed no anticancer effect or survival benefit from 10 grams a day of the vitamin; in fact, the patients who survived the longest had been treated with a placebo. Dr. Pauling maintains that the Mayo study is an inadequate test of vitamin C's anticancer effects, however, because nearly all the patients had received chemotherapy, which, he says, damages the protective mechanisms that are helped by vitamin C. Mayo is now conducting a second study of 120 patients with various kinds of cancer who have not had chemotherapy. Researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee reported success in treating an inherited precancerous condition, familial polyposis, a precancerous condition of the colon, with massive doses of vitamin C. The vitamin led to a disappearance of polyps in two of eight patients and a shrinkage of the growths in three others, none of whom had been helped by surgery. However, in a two-year study of cancer prevention at St. Mark's Hospital in London, the use of vitamin C or a placebo in 50 persons with rectal polyps, often a precursor to cancer, showed no difference between the groups in the number or size of the growths. Vitamin A, also the focus of several cancer-prevention studies, is essential to the normal development of skin and lining (epithelial) cells. A study at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo showed that smokers who developed lung cancer had a lower daily intake of vitamin A than those smokers who were free of cancer. Since the straight vitamin is too toxic to use in megadoses, safer chemical cousins of the substance will be examined among persons known to face a high risk of developing cancers that originate in epithelial tissues, such as the bladder and lungs. Vitamin E is being studied as a possible cancer preventive, since its antioxidant properties may block the formation of nitrosamines and other cancer-causing chemicals. In addition, animal studies indicate that vitamin E may protect lung tissue from pollution damage. There is no scientifically sound evidence, however, to support the claims that megadoses of E can slow the human aging process, prevent heart attacks, maintain virility and fertility or counter the symptoms of menopause. While controversies over the benefits and risks of megadoses persist, Dr. Myron Brin, director of clinical nutrition at Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., one of the country's largest suppliers of vitamins, believes that ''continuing research will reveal more indications for large doses of particular vitamins.'' Indeed, the day may come when vitamin or mineral megadoses join penicillin and aspirin in the medical armamentarium. But, as was the case with these well-established remedies, the usefulness of micronutrients as drugs will have to be based on properly designed clinical "}
