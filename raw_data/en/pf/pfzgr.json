All you need to know India is known for its rich heritage of diverse traditions and deep-rooted ancient practices. Here is all you need to know about alternative therapy. Alternative therapy, also known as complementary medicine, is an umbrella term used to describe a range of healing practices and modalities that are not a part of conventional Western medicine. These can include everything from Ayurveda, Yoga, Acupuncture, Naturopathy, Homeopathy and Traditional Chinese Medicine to different types of massage therapies, energy healing and meditation practices. WHAT IS ALTERNATIVE THERAPY AND ITS HISTORY? The history of alternative therapy dates back thousands of years to ancient civilizations such as India, China and Greece. In India, Ayurveda and Yoga have been the primary forms of alternative therapy for centuries. However, in India, the above forms are not considered alternative therapy per se, as they are deeply ingrained as a part of one's 'dincharya' or daily routine. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in Ayurveda and other alternative healing practices around the world. People are looking for natural and holistic solutions to their health problems and Ayurveda offers just that. According to a report by the Global Wellness Institute, the global wellness industry is now worth over $4.5 trillion and alternative healing practices like Ayurveda are a big part of that growth. Another report by Grand View Research shows the global alternative medicine market was valued at USD 117,210.3 million in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.1% from 2023 to 2030. CONSUMPTION \"The consumption pattern of alternative therapies has also witnessed a huge shift post-Covid-19. The pandemic has led to increased stress, anxiety, and mental health issues, which resulted in a surge in demand for alternative therapies, including Ayurveda, Yoga and Homeopathy\", said Akshi Khandelwal, Founder & CEO, Butterfly Ayurveda. She also added that these therapies have gained immense trust and appreciation from people for their ability to provide a holistic approach to treatment. They also have the ability to cure while treating the root cause of the health issue, without causing any side effects, while ensuring sustained relief and rejuvenation within an individual. India is a hub for such practices since Ayurveda and naturopathy are central to the Indian kitchens, and make an essential contribution to one's daily lifestyle. They not only help treat a range of health issues ranging from reducing stress, anxiety and depression, but also help in alleviating chronic bodily ailments including digestive health, joint health and nervous system health. They improve overall well-being and provide individuals with a greater sense of awareness of their health. It is, however, important to seek consultation in alternative therapy from qualified professionals who have received extensive training, and possess the right knowledge and the needful experience to find success in using these methods to enhance overall health and quality of life. India has formalised alternative therapy and healing as a part of the AYUSH (Ayurveda Yoga Unani Siddha Homeopathy) Ministry of the Government of India, and has provided a series of opportunities and faculties for improving education and awareness about the subjects, alongside formalising the assessment, and certification of manufacturing capabilities of alternative medicine and brands that work in this industry. Furthermore, India has realized the need to invest in research and development of such practices, especially that of Ayurveda, and the finance ministry of India has increased the total allocation of budget to Ayush Ministry by 20 percent to Rs 3647 crores in 2023. The budget has also emphasized promoting evidence-based research in Ayush systems through Ayush research councils. INCREASING DEMAND The increasing demand for natural and holistic solutions to health problems and the growth of the global wellness industry has brought Ayurveda and other alternative healing practices into the spotlight. As per a report by Mordor Intelligence, AYUSH and the alternative medicine industry in India are expected to register a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period 2023-2028. \"It is important that we continue to invest in research and development, promote education and awareness, and improve modern scientific validation processes of alternative therapies to ensure that these practices are safe and effective to use and become accessible across the globe\", said Akshi Khandelwal. Prioritizing sustainable forms of healing practices indicates a bright future for the planet, and India is poised to lead the way in the global alternative therapy and healing market. "}
