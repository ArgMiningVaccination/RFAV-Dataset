Various research and scientific viewpoints are debated and argued about, as well as documented in reputed peer-reviewed journals.. The data that regularly emerges from vaccination drives seems strongly back the clinical trials, which is a timely boost in the attempt to return to the pre-pandemic normalcy and opening of countries borders for travel. However, a closer analysis of what is being communicated can be complex to grasp given the complex nature of the situation. We have been hearing that vaccines are 95 percent effective for many months, but we don't really delve into what this number represents. The difference between vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness is sometimes used interchangeably and therefore it is important to understand the difference between the two. In Simple terms, efficacy specifies the degree to which a vaccine can prevent diseases in controlled and routine circumstances where numerous clinical trials are involved, while effectiveness is the measurement of real-world results. Carefully designed clinical trials help to bridge the gap between efficacy and effectiveness. Clinical trials are carefully designed to help mitigate the inconsistencies between efficacy and effectiveness. Efficacy versus effectiveness Efficacy figures simply indicate how good the vaccines can prevent illness altogether, rather than how good it is at stopping a person from being infected with COVID-19. Vaccine effectiveness helps us in understanding how a vaccine functions once people outside of clinical trials start taking the vaccine. It has also been observed that some people may not gain full protection even after taking the full regimen of the vaccine (single or double dose based on the vaccine), but there has been a significant reduction in death and hospitalization amongst those that have been fully vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness helps scientists to reduce new cases and severity of the Covid-19 symptoms, and the impact it has on the various organs in the human body. Scientists use the effectiveness of data to reach herd immunity. Herd immunity implies that an adequate number of people have received protection from the disease, that will gradually slow down or stop the community spread of the virus. Factors that impact vaccine effectiveness are age, comorbidity that the recipient might have like asthma and diabetes, the timeline between the doses of vaccine, and the variant of circulating virus. Clinical Trials Every new vaccine developed undergoes mandatory clinical trials to test its performance. The developer of a vaccine usually determines the goal of their trial during the clinical trial study process. Established mechanism to generate safety and efficacy profile of the vaccine entails clearly defined phase-wise development with objective endpoints. This ensures the trade-off between the safety and the novel nature of the vaccine. People with pre-existing health issues or who are under medication need close monitoring before and after taking the vaccine. Skipping any of these steps may lead to tweaking the risk vs benefit profile and without proper justification; such steps should not be encouraged to avoid any catastrophic outcome in the future. There need to be clearly defined goals as primary and secondary endpoints for each of the phases of vaccine development. In the case of the Covid-19 vaccine, the primary endpoint for the pivotal phase 3 trial typically focuses on preventing new cases or symptoms of covid. The major primary endpoints are efficacy of the vaccine versus placebo in the prevention of Covid-19, safety and tolerability of vaccine post complete dosing versus the placebo group, and reactogenicity of the vaccine against placebo. Vaccine efficacy can be measured by how well it works to prevent diseases that are symptomatic or reduce the severity of a critical disease. Vaccine efficacy is also the potential reduction in the level of risk. Whatever was a person's risk before taking the jab, it gets reduced by close to 90 percent if one gets vaccinated. While taking a vaccine will reduce the concerns related to the toll of Covid-19 on a person's health, it doesn't necessarily mean that a healthy person who gets vaccinated cannot spread the disease. This is further confirmed and justified by the secondary endpoints of a clinical trial setting like prevention of severe disease &infection by SARS Covid-19, and also the sero conversion rate at day 28, month 3, and month 6 post successful dosing of the vaccine. A vaccine with really high efficacy in a clinical trial will rarely show lower effectiveness. Volunteers who consider taking part in a vaccine clinical trial often are under scrutiny with continuous monitoring of health parameters. The trial team is usually cognizant of the volunteering participants' general health conditions. Any side effects and symptoms are also checked regularly. Clinical trials also exclude volunteering criteria for conditions such as pregnancy, age, and pre-existing illness. Measuring formula for vaccine efficacy and effectiveness Measuring the efficacy and effectiveness of a vaccine is critical to ensuring the success rate of the developed vaccine. The data is important to understand the immunization parameter in proportion to the population. The conclusive aspects of measurement are often via observational studies which include case-control studies depending on the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. A high effectiveness ratio need not necessarily mean it is the best choice, for instance, the vaccine provided for influenza is 40-60% effective yet saves thousands of lives every year. Vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness are measured by determining the risk of disease among vaccinated people and unvaccinated people. The greater the percentage of disease reduction in the vaccinated group, the greater the vaccine efficacy/effectiveness. One word of caution here is that long-term safety and efficacy data for each of the vaccine candidates are still emerging and though the vaccine rollout is in full swing across the globe, a well-established pharmacovigilance system is the need of the hour. Any repetitive adverse event noted post-vaccination in the general public at large needs to be immediately investigated upon and further steps need to be transparently communicated back. For example, blood clots observed post-vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine were further investigated and given a clean chit as it was occurring in a minuscule population but safe for rest. Current Scenario In the past few weeks, trial results for several leading vaccine candidates have suggested high efficacy rates. While efficacy rates are high, it is also important to note that the deployment of any kind of vaccine directly impacts how well the vaccine works for the majority population. A uniform assessment of common criteria to address public health requirements is the need of the hour. The studies and considerations on efficacy and effectiveness cannot be conclusive to the prevention of hospitalization, death, or severe conditions of the disease. It is critical to consider the suitability of the vaccines along with all the indicators that involve vaccine availability, deployment, and costs. In the real world, the effectiveness of a vaccine can depend on unpredictable and multiple facts like the spread of a virus, people adhering to the dosage timelines, storage of vaccines in correct temperatures, and people who are unaware of if they were exposed to the virus at all. Lack of knowledge about the properties of viruses and how a person's immunity responds to the virus in a short span of time is a key factor that needs to be considered while determining the efficacy or effectiveness of a vaccine. This is a primary reason why most vaccines have got emergency use approval and are announced as a voluntary choice in most countries. Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own. "}
