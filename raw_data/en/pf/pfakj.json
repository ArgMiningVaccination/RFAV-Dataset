Syncope can occur following , or even b efore, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. Proced ures shoul d be in place t o prevent falling and injury an d to manage syncope. As with any v accine, vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent may not protect 10 0% of recipients against influenza illness. Influenza virus is unpredictable i n that signif icant anti genic changes m ay occur from time to time. At this time, current influe nza virus vaccines are not effective against all possible influenza strains. Protection is high est again st those strains of virus from which the vaccine is prepar ed or against closely related strains . Febrile or Acute Disease: Vaccinati on should be postpon ed in cas e of a moderate or severe acute disease with or without fever; however, a mild disease should not usually be a reason to postpone vaccination. Sanofi Pasteur Pro duct - Types A and B (Split Virion) ) Page 8 of 27 Hematologi c Because an y intramus cular injectio n can cause an injection site hem atoma in persons wi th an y bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or in persons on anticoagulant therapy, intramuscular injections with FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalen t should not be admini stered to such persons unless the potential ben efits outweigh the risk of adminis tration. If the decision is made to administer any product by intramuscular injection to such persons, it should be given with caution, with steps taken to avoid the risk of h ematoma format ion following injection. The Can adian Immunization Guide has recom mendations for giving vaccinations to persons with bleeding disorders. Immune Prior to any vac cination, all known pre cautions should be taken to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Epinephr ine hydrochloride solution (1:1,0 00) and other appropriat e agents u sed for the control of immediate allergic reactions must be available to treat unexpec ted reactions, such as anaphyla xis. As with all injectable vaccines , appropriat e medical treatment and s upervision should always be read ily available in case of an anaphy lactic event following the administration of the vaccine. H ealth -care providers should be fami liar with current recom mendations for the initial managemen t of anaphyl axis in no n-hospital set tings including proper airway man agement . For instruction s on recog nition and treatment of anaphylactic reactions see the current edition of the Canadian Immuniz ation Guide or visit th e Health Canada website . As each do se may conta in traces of formaldehyd e, ovalbumin and octylphenol etho xylate, which are used d uring vacc ine production, caution should be exercised when the vaccine is administered to person s with h ypersensitivity to one of these substance s. See 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS . The immuno genicity of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent may be reduced by immunosuppress ive treatment or in individuals with im mune deficiency sy ndromes. In such c ases it is r ecommend ed to postpone t he vaccination until after the im munosuppressive treatment or resol ution of the immunosuppressive condition, if feasible. Nevertheless, as recommended by NACI, t he possibility of lower efficacy should n ot prevent immuniz ation in tho se at hi gh risk of influ enza-associated morbidity, since some protection is still likely to occur. Neurologic If Guillain-Barr \u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has occurred within 6 weeks of any previo us influenza vaccinatio n, the decision to give FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadr ivalent should be based o n careful consideration of the potential benefits and ris ks.

The adve rse reactio n rates observed in the clinical tr ials; therefore, may not r eflect th e rates observed in practice a nd should not be compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug . Adverse reaction inf ormation from clinical trials may be useful in identifying and a pproximating rates of advers e drug reactions in real -world use. The safety of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent was assessed in one randomized, active -controlled, modified double -blind Phase III clinical trial conducted in the Uni ted States which enrolle d 2,670 adults 65 years of age a nd older. The study compa red the sa fety and immunogenicity of FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent to those of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose, which is a trivalent influenza vaccine indicated for adults 65 years of ag e and older and which al so contains 60 g of hema gglutinin for each strain. The safety analysis set included FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent recipients, 443 of FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose containing the alternate B infl uenza strain. Safe ty results for the FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose and investigational FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose containing the - Types A and B (Split Virion) ) Page 10 of 27 influenza strain recipients were pooled for the analysis. Sa fety evaluations were performed during the first 28 days followi ng vaccina tion. Serious advers e reactio ns were collected during six months of follow -up. The overall safety profile of FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent was comparable to FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose. The most common reactions occurring after FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadri valent adm inistration we (41%), myalgia (23%), headache (14%) and malaise (13%). Onset usually occurred within the first 3 days after vaccination. The majority of solicited reactions resolved within three days of vaccination.

See 7 WARNINGS A ND PR ECAUTIONS . 9.4 Drug -Drug Interactions FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent should not be mixed wit h any oth er vaccin e in the s ame syringe o r vial. There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent with other vaccines . If FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent needs to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s) , immuni zation should always be carried o ut on separate limbs. 9.7 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions Interference of F LUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent with laboratory and/or diagnostic tests has not been studied. Following influenza vaccination, false positive r esults in serology tests usin g the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV1, hepatitis C, and especially HTLV1 have been reported. An appropriate Western Blot test should be used to confirm or disprove the results of the ELISA test. The tra nsient fa lse posit ive reactions could b e due to a n on-specific IgM response induced by influenza vaccine. 10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 10.1 Mechanism of Action The inoculation with antigen prepared from inactivated influenza virus stimulates the production of specific antibodi es. Prote ction is highest agai nst those stra ins of virus from which the vaccine is prepared or closely related strains. Immunization against influenza reduces the risk of influenza illness and complications caused by infection with the strains contained in the vaccine. Globa l surveilla nce of influ enza identifies yearly of influen za A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Specific levels of hem agglutina tion inhi bition (HAI) antibody titre post-va virus vaccines have not been correlated with protection fr om influenza virus infection. Antibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no pr otection against a nother . Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of t he same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virological basis for seaso nal epidem ics and the r eason for th e usual change of one or more strains in each year's influenza vaccine. Therefore, influenza va ccines are standardized to Sanofi Pasteur a Virus - Types A and B ( Split Virion) ) Page 13 of 27 contain the hemagglutinins of influenza virus strains representing the influenza viruses l ikely to be circulating in the upcoming season. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended because immunity during the year after vaccinat ion declines and because circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year. 10.2 Pharmacodynamics Seroprote ction is genera lly obtained wi thin 4 weeks . Adults 65 years and older generally have a heightened susceptibility to influenza -related complications due to natural and progressive weakening of the immune system over time known as immunosenescence. Immunosene scence ca n als o render seniors less respo nsive to standard dose influenza vaccine. In clinical trials of adults 65 years of age and older, immunization with FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose (Trivalent) induced a higher immune response to the A-strains containe d in the v accine than di d im munization with a stand ard-dose influenza vaccine. Immune responses to FLUZONE\u00ae High- Dose Quadrivalent were shown to be non -inferior to those obtained with FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose (Trivalent) in adults 65 years of age and older and statistic ally high er for the B strain n ot contained in FLUZONE\u00ae High Dose. See PART II: SCIE NTIFIC INFORMATION for further detail regarding clinical trials 10.3 Pharmacokinetics Duration of Effect: Protection against inf expected to pe rsist throug hout the influenza season for which the vaccine is indicated. 11 STORAGE , STABILITY AND DISPOSAL Store at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (i.e. in a refrigerator).

The objective was to de mons trate the non -inferiority of the immune response to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent as compared to FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose in adults 65 years o f age and older, as assessed b y HAI (hemagglu tinin inhibition) Geometric mean antibo dy titres (GMTs) at Day 28 and seroconversion rates. A total of 2,670 adults 65 years of age or older were randomized to receive either one dose of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose ivalent [QIV -HD] or one of compa or TIV -HD2] ); each TIV -HD formulation contained a B strain that corresponds to one of the two B strains in FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent (either a B strain of the Y amagata lineage or a B strai n of the Victoria lineage). The mean age was 72.9 years in the FLUZON E\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent group (ranged from 65 through 100 years) and the mean age was 73.0 in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group (ranged from 65 t hrou gh 95 years). 35.4% of pa rticipants in t he FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent grou p and 35.8% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group were 75 years of age or older. The immunogenicity results of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent in the QHD00013 stu dy are summarized Table 6 a and Table 6b .

Therefore, the Type I error was n ot inflated and the adjustment for al pha was not needed for multiple sta tistical testing. Sanofi Pasteur - Types A and B (Split Virion) ) Page 20 of 27 Immunogen icity of Quadrivalent was found to non -inferior FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose. The pre-defined non -inferiority immunogenicity criteria for FLU ZONE\u00ae High -Dose were met for both GMTs and seroconversion r ates for a ll four o f the inf luenza strains common between the two vaccines. Ad ditionally, FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent induced a higher immune response, as measured by GM Ts and sero conversion rates, with respect to the additional B strain than the immune response induced by FLUZON E\u00ae High-Dose t hat does not contain the correspondi ng B. The efficacy results of FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose are thus inferred to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadri valent given the demonstration of non FLUZONE\u00ae formulation) is relevant to FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent since both vaccines are ma nufactured according to similar pro cesses and have overlapping compositions. In a multi -centre, double-blind con trolled study (FIM05) conducted in the United States, adults 65 years of age and older were ran domized to receive either FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose or t he standard -dose FLUZONE\u00ae vaccine ( 2006-2007 formulat ion). The objective was to demonstrate superiority of FLUZO NE\u00ae High-Dose over a standard dose inactivated influenza vaccine containing 15 micrograms of each strains (2 A strains and 1 B strain), as assessed by seroconversion rates and GMT s. A total of 3,851 partici pants were inc luded in High-Dose group and 54.7% of partic ipants i n the FLU ZONE\u00ae group. I n both groups, the mean age was 72.9 years (ranged from 65 through 97 years in the FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose group and 65 through 94 years in the FLU ZONE\u00ae group); 35% of participants in t he FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose group and 36% of partic ipants i n the FLU ZONE\u00ae group were 75 years of age or older. The pr imary endpoints of the study were hemagglutination inhibition (HI) GMTs and seroconversion rates 28 days a fter vaccination. Pre -specified statis tical superiority criteria required that the lower li mit (LL) of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio (FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose divided by FLUZONE\u00ae) be greater than 1.50 for at least two of the strains, and if one strain fail ed, non -inferiority of that strain mus t be demonstrated (LL>0.67), and th at the low er limit of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the seroconversion rate differenc e (FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose minus FLUZONE\u00ae) be greater than 10% for at least two of the strains, and if one stra in failed, non-inferiority of that strain must be demonstrated (LL>-10%). As shown in Table 7 statistically superior HI GMTs and seroconversion rates after vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High- Dose compared to FLUZONE\u00ae were demonstrated for influenza A subtypes, A (H1N1) and A (H3N2), but not for in fluenza ty pe B. For s train B, non -inferiority of FL UZONE\u00ae High-Dose compared to FLUZONE\u00ae was demonstrated both GMTs and seroconversion rates.

The adjustment for alpha was not needed for statistical multiple test ing as the overall Type I error was no higher than 0.05 under t he most conservative statistical assumptions to demonstrate a t least 2 strains being superior fo r FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose to FLUZONE\u00ae given that at most 1 strain was superior when one-sided alpha 0. 025 for su periority was used. According to the criteria set in the protocol, FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose e licited a superior immune r esponse compared to a standard dos e trivalent i nactivated influenza vaccine for both A -strains as measured by seroconversion rates and GMTs. - Types A and B (Split Virion) ) Page 22 of 27 15 MICROBIOLOGY No microbiological information is required for this drug product. 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXI COLOGY General Toxicology : FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent has eval uated in rabb its in a repeat -dose toxicity study following three intramuscular injections at one human dose and in a loc al tolerance study following one subcutan eous injection at one human dose.

You cannot catch influenza from this vaccine as t he virus has been killed and split into small particles that are not infectious. The National Adv isory Committ ee o n Immunization (NACI) adv ises year ly influenza v accination for all Canadians who are able to have the vaccine. For more information about inf luenza and the vaccine, see the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccin es High body to produce its own prote ction against four different types of influenza virus (2 A strai ns and 2 B strains). Af ter you get a flu shot, your immune system produces antibodies against the strains of virus that are in the vaccine. Your body takes up to 4 weeks after vaccination to produce antibodies. The antibodies a re ef fective for the duration of the f lu season. Whe n you are exposed to the virus, the antibodies will help to keep you from getting sick. If you do get the flu, you may not be as sick. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadriva lent co ntains four times the a mount of kil led, split vi rus particles for each typ e compared to standard -dose influenza vaccines. The higher dose is intended to give people 65 years and older a better immune response and, therefore, better protection agai nst the f lu.
