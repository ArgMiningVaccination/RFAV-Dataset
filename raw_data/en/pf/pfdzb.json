He says, \"It stimulates production of new stem cells, activates existing ones, kills all kinds of bacteria, spirochetes, viruses, fungus, etc. It rebuilds mitochondria as an energy source, and generally revitalizes the whole body. It selectively kills cancer cells and strengthens and rejuvenates normal cells. High Dose Ozone therapy even slows down telomeres shortening. This procedure works great as a major detox tool, comparable to EDTA and other IV protocols. Besides, it doesn't deplete body of important electrolytes and other micronutrients.\" High Dose Ozone therapy is very popular in Europe, especially in Germany. In some countries, it is a routine procedure in hospitals and medical offices, and it is covered by health insurance. Lutskovsky attended a master class workshop and learned directly from Dr. Lahodny, the founder of High Dose Ozone. High Dose Ozone therapy can be used to treat cardiovascular diseases, peripheral vascular disease, autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis, leaky gut, Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, chronic infection, Lyme disease, sepsis, HIV, chronic ulcers, heavy metal poisoning and more.
