Like the practice of IM itself, IM research too has been driven primarily by studies on individual modalities. There are significant challenges to moving research on whole systems medicine forward, with funding being at the top of the list. Historically, NIH has not been receptive to supporting research on whole systems, preferring instead to support studies that are more individual modality driven so that mechanisms can be identified. Purely mechanistic research, however, assumes unidirectional causality and linear responses yet clinical responses to whole systems approaches are more often multidirectional and dynamically unpredictable. The concept of emergence is applicable here. Whole systems approaches suggest that by incorporating therapies into holistic treatment programs we not only treat symptoms but accomplish more by activating the body's inherent self- organizing healing mechanisms and treat the root cause of illnesses as well as associated symptoms. Given that interest in integrative therapies with the general public and medical community is steadily increasing, there is need for more research that explores intact whole systems approaches to elucidate the relevant system-wide effects and dynamic interactions related to these practices.

Consistent with how traditional Western medicine is most often practiced, biomedical res earch too has historically been reductionist, with the focus being almost exclusively on examining a single treatment to d iscover its potential efficacy for a specific symptom and/or disease.1,2A primary purpose of the biomedical literature is to inform the direction of med- ical practice, and limitations in research methodologies greatly limits potential advan ces in medicine. The degree to which the reductionist approa ch to biomedical research has impeded discovery of a sustainable health care model in the United States is an open question.3,4 Integrative medicine is most often defined as the integration of complementary practices and therapies such as meditation, yoga, and/or acupuncture within the allopathic medical setting for the purposes of alleviating illness and creating health.5The converse also applies in that Western biomedical approaches have been integrated into hospitals and clinics of traditional medical systems from where the many complementary prac- tices and therapies originated.6-9Both these integrative approaches present challenges to the existing systems5,8Withregard to the latter model, for example, pressure in Lhasa Tibet to integrate Western-oriented biomedicine into traditional Tibetan medicine hospitals has led to standardized policies such as administering antibiotics to all inpatients, policies that trump the traditional practices and have undermined traditional Tibetan physician's diagnostic and therapeutic methods.8 While the intention of integrative medicine is whole person medicine, it has for the most part remained driven by individual 1University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA 2Mind-Body Medical Group, The Chopra Center for Wellbeing, Carlsbad, CA, USA 3Heal and Thrive, California Institute for Human Sciences, Encinitas, CA, USA 4Ayurveda and Yoga Research, Chopra Foundation, Carlsbad, CA, USA Corresponding Author: Paul J.

Like the practice of integrative medicine itself, integrative medicine research too has been driven primarily by studies on individual modalities. This has been recognized for many years, with calls to advance the conduct of truly integrative research.16-18The most recent such call by the Academic Con- sortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care pre- sented consensus recommendations to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).18In addition to recommendations for NCCIH to expand its funding for col- lection of outcome data related to costs and furthering support for capacity building within complementary and integrative health disciplines, the consensus statement presented a strong case to prioritize research based on whole disciplines.18 Granted, much of the growth and success of integrative med- icine has been the result of the impressive accumulating body of evidence-based literature on individual complementary practices and therapies across a broad range of medical needs.19-21Despite this advance, however, few integrative studies have actually taken a truly integrative, whole systems approach. To demonstrate this, the table below presents results of a Pub Med.gov search of a number of single complementary practices and therapies that are typically found in the whole medical system Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a traditional medicine system for which there are numerous studies demonstrating effectiveness of indi- vidual treatment modalities.6,22-27The column on the left shows the search term of each respective individual modality, while the column on the right shows the observed number of publications for that individual modality (search conducted August 2017). What happens when we repeat the search, but this time incrementally combine each single modality together? As shown in the table below, with each incremental step, the num- ber of citations decreases drastically, indicating an absence of research publications reporting on the integrity of the whole system as it was intended to be practiced.Note that we do acknowledge that potential limitations in the keywords used in some published articles could lead to their omission from the search. Even with that consideration, however, the trend would be clear. When we repeated the search and added the search term \"acupuncture,\" a component of traditional Chi- nese and traditional Tibetan medicine, the significant diminish- ment in respective numbers of publications are much the same. There are, fortunately, a growing number of studies attempt- ing to more comprehensively assess whole medical systems effects. For example, a pilot study in a small cohort of patients with coronary heart disease examined the effects of an ayurve- dic intervention program that included diet, herbs, yoga, med- itation, and breathing exercises28and reported improvements in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and arter- ial pulse wave velocity. The study also reported that a majority of hypertensive patients in the trial were able to reduce or eliminate their antihypertensive medications. Other such stud- ies examining intact ayurvedic programs report improvements in wellbeing and metabolomics pathways, including phospho- lipid biosynthesis and lipoprotein metabolism.29,30Other stud- ies not focused on traditional medical systems per se include Zeng et al31who reported on outcomes of 2 intensive lifestyle modification programs (the Cardiac Wellness Program of the Benson-Henry Mind Body Institute and the Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease) on cardiac patients and demonstrated significant reductions of 43 %on average medical costs. Reduc- tions in cardiac and noncardiac hospitalization rates and a trend toward lower mortality were also demonstrated.31Bredesen et al32,33provided evidence for an integrative approach com- prised of customized nutrition and dietary supplements, oral hygiene, meditation, and yoga practice that improved cognition and memory in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Oberg et al13and Bradley et al12reported on naturopathic medicine's whole systems approach, which emphasized patient-centered health promotion and routine use of clinical counseling on wellness and prevention, improving outcomes for individuals with type 2 diabetes. There are significant challenges to moving this type of research forward, with fundin g being at the top of the list. Historically, the National Institutes of Health has not been receptive to supporting research on whole systems approaches, preferring instead to support studies that are more individual modality driven so that mechanisms can be identified. This individual modality mechanis m approach is in contrast to whole systems research where the focus is not to examine the effects of each of separate practice and/or therapy but rather an evaluation of the impact of the system in its entirety. NCCIH, which exists to support scientific research on \"diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine\" does not support research on whole systems. While there has been efforts in the past for NCCIH to support whole systems research (then the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine),16these efforts did not gain traction within the agency. In a recent interview, NCCIH director Jose- phine Briggs, MD, expressed that we have not yet quite figuredCombining Modalities Number of Publications Meditation 4493 Meditation and yoga 895 Meditation and yoga and massage 65 Meditation and yoga and massage and therapeutic herbs2Modality Number of Publications Meditation 4493 Yoga 4072 Massage 13417 Therapeutic herbs 50032 Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary & Alternative Medicineout what right experimental approaches are needed to research systems.34,35Dr Briggs also recently noted, \"those interested in whole systems need to develop standardized, multimodality protocols to domesticate the wildness of integrative personalization\".17NCCIH's 2016 Strategic Plan, while addressing strategies to develop \"new and improved research methods and tools for conducting rigorous studies of comple- mentary health approaches and their integration into health care,\" does not place emphasis on whole systems research (https://nccih.nih.gov/about/strategic-plans/2016). More whole systems studies need to be conducted to exam- ine the potential beneficial, multidimensional effects of these approaches to healing. Mechanistic research assumes unidirec- tional causality and linear responses; however, clinical responses to whole systems approaches are often multidirec- tional and dynamically unpredictable. The concept of emer- gence, or that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts as a result of self-organization, is applicable here.36,37 Given that a primary purpose of the biomedical literature is to inform the direction of medicine, in order to fully inform the practice of integrative approaches, the research itself will need to become increasingly more integrative. This requires an experimentally rigorous yet integrative approach to empirically identify markers of both health and disease and to describe the behavior of the system and environmental interactions. Such research on intact whole systems often requires strong colla- borations across a broad range of disciplines. Organizations such as the Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care and health care provider organizations like the Academy for Integrative Health and Medicine could help further advance this work by educating its members on practice-based research met hodologies, and encourage research on the whole systems approaches within their respec- tive organizations. In summary, the era of integrative medicine has already dawned and substantial evidence exists to support probing more deeply into its holistic potential, which has yet to be fully determined. But if indeed the whole is greater than the parts, the public deserves to know if the current benefits of integrative medicine can be greatly expanded into more whole systems approaches to well-being.16Whole systems approaches suggest that by incorporating therapies into holistic treatment programs we not only treat symptoms, but accomplish more by activating the body's inherent self-organizing healing mechanisms and treat the root cause of illnesses as well as associated symp- toms.38Thus, given that interest in integrative therapies with the general public and medical community is steadily increas- ing, there is a need for studies that explore whole systems research approaches to elucidate the relevant system-wide effects and dynamic interactions related to these practices.
