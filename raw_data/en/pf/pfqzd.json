The best of our leaders are a kind of saint-statesperson, whose character is immediately apparent and transformative in its own right. Such leaders include Lincoln, King, Gandhi, Gorbachev, Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the Dalai Lama, Deitrich Bonhoffer, and Nelson Mandela, etc. For example, when Abraham Lincoln gave his famous speech as Cooper Union in New York, one observer wrote afterward, \"I have just seen the greatest man since St. Paul.\" This is the ultimate power of decency, egolessness, and emotional intelligence. In today's workplace it is important to step outside restrictive labels and understand that others have different beliefs that are equally as important to them as our personal beliefs are to us. Spirituality or spiritual growth is all about connecting with your inner being and consciousness which can inspire faith in yourself, bring inner grace, and usher in change in a dreary life, thus greatly enriching your life. As a result, you will be freed from the never-ending rat race of ever pursuing more because spirituality will help you to fill that awkward hole in your heart that no material possession, relationship, or worldly experience could ever fill. Mothers, teach your children this. Teach your children that wisdom is everywhere. In pieces. Some of the wisdom is in the trees, some of the wisdom is with the animals. Some of the wisdom is with the planets and the stars and the moons and the sun. Some of the wisdom flows with the waters. Some of the wisdom was with our ancestors. Some of the wisdom is in our minds. All of the wisdom is from the Spirit of God. - Esther Davis-Thompson There's somehow more to life than meets the eye, an awakening process to a higher reality that leaves you no longer satisfied with living a purely materialistic lifestyle based on superficial possession. As a result, you will start to actively seek to enrich your life by adopting a more spiritual worldview. You will feel connected to a source greater than yourself, thus embarking on a spiritual journey in order to find yourself and to seek God, with the conclusion that you are a spiritual being inhabiting a physical body. Developing spiritually is at the core of who we are as human beings and what drives us. It is a belief in something beyond the self, a higher power, or a holistic belief in an individual connection to others and to the world as a whole. Spirituality has been associated with improved health and well-being because it is a productive way to cope with some of life's greatest challenges, including times of stress, depression, and grief. It can also provide a source of social support through engagement with organized communities. Thus, spiritual education is the very foundation on which a lasting edifice can be built. While our bodies belong to the world of nature and follows nature's laws, our spirit belongs to the everlasting spiritual world and follows the light of the spirit. Consequently, our physical body relies on spiritual power for its motive force, so with a healthy spirit a person will have a healthier body, too. As we embrace spirituality, we become more selfless and trust to providence. This is the opposite of being materialistic, which brings a sense of perspective, meaning and purpose to our lives. Why Spirituality The individual, if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast-like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly conceive. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has not so much in virtue of his individuality, but rather as a member of a great human society, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle to the grave. - Albert Einstein Spiritualism is a search for something sacred, an increasingly important topic to people today. Thus, spirituality is your belief or sense of purpose and meaning, which gives you a sense of value or worth in your life. You can be spiritual without belonging to a specific religion, while to be religious is to follow a particular faith and may be connected with specific groups or traditions. Spirituality helps people to have better relationships with themselves, others, and the unknown, including to deal with stress by giving you a sense of peace, purpose, and forgiveness. In times of emotional stress or illness, it is important to understand the difference between a spiritual crisis and a mental illness, because mental issues like depression and substance abuse can be a sign of a spiritual void in your life. What is Spirituality Without the slightest doubt there is something through which material and spiritual energy hold together and are complementary. In the last analysis, somehow or other, there must be a single energy operating in the world. And the first idea that occurs to us is that the 'soul' must be as it were the focal point of transformation at which, from all the points of nature, the forces of bodies converge, to become interiorized and sublimated in beauty and truth. - Pierre Teilhard de Chardin Being spiritual is the belief in something bigger than what is seen or can be explained; something that we might call God, Goddess, Buddha, the Great Spirit or a myriad of other titles. Spirituality may be defined as \"the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred.\" - Christina Puchalski. Spirituality is more about finding meaning, connection, and value, while religion is concerned with what is true and right. How to embrace Spirituality The human mind is not capable of grasping the Universe. We are like a little child entering a huge library. The walls are covered to the ceilings with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written these books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. But the child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books\u2014-a mysterious order which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. - Albert Einstein - Cultivate empathy and compassion: The ability and willingness to fully understand another person's experience and connect it to your own - Identify (and live by) your beliefs and values: Make a list of your beliefs and values will help you live with intention. - Find a spiritual community and friends: Join a spiritual group, whether that is a church or mosque, meditation center, yoga class, or a local group that meets to discuss spiritual issues. - Practice forgiveness: The rewards of relinquishing negative feelings are aplenty. - Seek transcendence through nature, art, or music - Be good to yourself: Exercising regularly, eating a nutrient-rich diet, and treating yourself with compassion - Make contemplative practice a part of your everyday life - Enhance the lives of those around: Moving beyond oneself and shifting the focus to relationships with others, close community, and God. - Spiritual people make healthier choices: People who practice a religion or a faithful tradition are less likely to smoke or drink, commit a crime, or become involved in any violent activity. - Love and care for yourself, express compassion for others, delight in the natural and human-made worlds, and cherish your place and participation in the web of life; - Trust your intuitions and conscience, develop trustworthy relationships, trust that meaning can be found in every moment and place of your life, discern whom you can trust, and trust that the universe (or higher entity) is friendly no matter what happens; - Forgive yourself for failures and wrongdoing, seek justice when you have been abused or wronged, let go of the desire for revenge when you have been hurt, accept that in the big picture you are accepted and valued just as you are. Who to embrace Spirituality There have, however, always been men of high and disciplined spirituality who have insisted on their direct experience of something greater than themselves. Their conviction of the reality of a spiritual life apart from and transcending the life of the body may not lend itself to scientific proof or disproof; nevertheless, the remarkable transformation in personality seen in those who rightfully lay claim to such experience is as objective as tomorrow's sunrise. Millions of lesser men draw strength from the contacts they can make through prayer and meditation with this aspect of the inner life. - Ralph Wyckoff Spirituality is for everyone whether you worship or believe in God, Goddess, Buddha, the Great Spirit or a myriad of other titles. \"Every Christian is called to be a saint\" - Pope Benedict XVI. \"Sometimes people think that sanctity is a privilege reserved for a chosen few,\" the Pope added. \"But in reality, every Christian is called to be a saint, as is every human being!\" When to embrace Spirituality The greatest disease in the West today is not TB or leprosy; it is being unwanted, unloved, and uncared for. We can cure physical diseases with medicine, but the only cure for loneliness, despair, and hopelessness is love. There are many in the world who are dying for a piece of bread but there are many more dying for a little love. The poverty in the West is a different kind of poverty \u2014 it is not only a poverty of loneliness but also of spirituality. There's a hunger for love, as there is a hunger for God. Mother Teresa We should embrace our spirituality awakening on a daily basis, and the following are some of the turning points for many people: - Traumas (emotional or physical) - Divorces or other major relationship changes - Midlife crises - Depression/anxiety - Life-threatening illnesses or injuries - Near-death experiences - Major world events (like wars and pandemics) Where to embrace Spirituality The value of fundamental research does not lie only in the ideas it produces. There is more to it. It affects the whole intellectual life of a nation by determining its way of thinking and the standards by which actions and intellectual production are judged. If science is highly regarded and if the importance of being concerned with the most up-to-date problems of fundamental research is recognized, then a spiritual climate is created which influences the other activities. An atmosphere of creativity is established which penetrates every cultural frontier. Applied sciences and technology are forced to adjust themselves to the highest intellectual standards which are developed in the basic sciences. This influence works in many ways: some fundamental students go into industry; the techniques which are applied to meet the stringent requirements of fundamental research serve to create new technological methods. The style, the scale, and the level of scientific and technical work are determined in pure research; that is what attracts productive people and what brings scientists to those countries where science is at the highest level. Fundamental research sets the standards of modern scientific thought; it creates the intellectual climate in which our modern civilization flourishes. It pumps the lifeblood of idea and inventiveness not only into the technological laboratories and factories, but into every cultural activity of our time. The case for generous support for pure and fundamental science is as simple as that. - Victor Weisskopf You can embrace your spirituality through the following: - Meditation or quiet time - Prayer - Service to the community - Spending time in nature - Spiritual retreats - Yoga - Buddhism - Christianity - Hinduism - Humanism - Islam - Judaism - Sikhism Positive impacts of spirituality \"You do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage, faith and hope.\" - Thomas Merton - You may feel a higher sense of purpose, peace, hope, and meaning: Spirituality can help people develop a more hopeful outlook on life. - You may experience better confidence, self-esteem, and self-control. - It can help you make sense of your experiences in life. - When unwell, it can help you feel inner strength and result in faster recovery: Spiritual experiences can be helpful when coping with the stresses of life. - Those in a spiritual community may have more support: Because spiritual traditions often involve organized religions or groups, becoming a part of such a group can serve as an important source of social support. - You may work at better relationships with yourself and others. - Spiritual people make healthier choices. - Spirituality may help you live longer. - Forgiveness is good medicine. What are the Benefits of Spirituality? The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity. - Albert Einstein - Reduction in stress: Adopting spiritual growth habits has been shown to considerably reduce stress in individuals. - Reduce blood pressure: Increasing spirituality can help lower blood pressure. - Improve the functioning of immune system: Growth in the spiritual practices helps keep up physically by strengthening the immune system! - Lower rates of anxiety: Those who experience anxiety can see a reduction in anxiety as the spiritual practices increase. - Increased social interactions: Caring and meaningful relationships are shown time and again towards boosting mental and emotional well-being. - Overall improvement in mental well-being: Spirituality can help improve overall mental health. - Increase longevity: Reduction of stress, blood pressure, depression, and anxiety, combined with an increase in social interaction and gaining immune system strength, consider all these aspects. Improving spiritual health The genius of Man in our time has gone into jet-propulsion, atom-splitting, penicillin-curing, etc. There is left none over for works of imagination; of spiritual insight or mystical enlightenment. I asked for bread and was given a tranquilizer. It is important to recognize that in our time man has not written one word, thought one thought, put two notes or two bricks together, splashed color on to canvas or concrete into space, in a manner which will be of any conceivable imaginative interest to posterity. - Malcolm Muggeridge - Find out what makes you feel peaceful, loved, strong, and connected. - Dedicate part of your day doing community service. - Read inspirational books. - Try meditating. - Take a walk outdoors. - Pray - alone or with a group. - Practice yoga. - Play your favorite sport. - Dedicate quiet time to yourself. Contemplative practice is good for you. \"A human being is part of a whole, called by us the 'Universe' \u2014a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts, and feelings, as something separated from the rest\u2014a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\" - Albert Einstein - Meditation can induce feelings of calm and clear-headedness as well as improve concentration and attention. - Prayer may elicit the relaxation response, along with feelings of hope, gratitude, and compassion\u2014all of which have a positive effect on overall wellbeing - Yoga is a centuries-old spiritual practice that aims to create a sense of union within the practitioner through physical postures, ethical behaviors, and breath expansion. - Journaling is another, often overlooked, contemplative practice that can help you become more aware of your inner life and feel more connected to your experience and the world around you. Spirituality versus emotional health What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility. This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism. - Albert Einstein 1. Spirituality is about seeking a meaningful connection with something bigger than yourself, which can result in positive emotions, such as peace, awe, contentment, gratitude, and acceptance. 2. Emotional health is about cultivating a positive state of mind, which can broaden your outlook to recognize and incorporate a connection to something larger than yourself. 3. Religion and spirituality can help people cope with the effects of everyday stress. 4. Older women are more grateful to God than older men, and they receive greater stress-buffering health effects due to this gratitude 5. Those with an intrinsic religious orientation, regardless of gender, exhibited less physiological reactivity toward stress than those with an extrinsic religious orientation. Seven Spiritual Needs When we survey our lives and endeavours we soon observe that almost the whole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings. We see that our whole nature resembles that of the social animals. We eat food that others have grown, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been communicated to us by other people through the medium of a language which others have created. Without language our mental capacities would be poor indeed, comparable to those of the higher animals; we have, therefore, to admit that we owe our principal advantage over the beasts to the fact of living in human society. The individual, if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast-like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly conceive. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has not so much in virtue of his individuality, but rather as a member of a great human society, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle to the grave. - Albert Einstein 1. Experience the healing and empowerment of love\u2014from others, self, and an ultimate source. 2. Experience renewing times of transcendence\u2014expansive moments beyond the immediate sensory spheres. 3. Have vital beliefs that lend meaning and hope in the midst of losses, tragedies, and failures. 4. Have values, priorities, and life commitments centered in issues of justice, integrity, and love to provide guidance in personally and socially responsible living. 5. Discover and develop inner wisdom, creativity, and love of self. 6. Develop a deepening awareness of oneness with other people, the natural world, and all living things. 7. Have spiritual resources to help heal grief, guilt, resentment, unforgiveness, self-rejection, and shame and deepen experiences of trust, self-esteem, hope, joy and love of life. Develop your sense of empathy and compassion \"If your understanding of the divine made you kinder, more empathetic, and impelled you to express sympathy in concrete acts of loving-kindness, this was good theology. But if your notion of God made you unkind, belligerent, cruel, of self-righteous, or if it led you to kill in God's name, it was bad theology. \" - Karen Armstrong 1. Listening deeply: Allow yourself to fully listen to the way others describe their experience. 2. Taking others' perspectives into account: Open yourself up to imagining what it would be like to be in their shoes. 3. Look for the good: Acknowledge the whole picture of another person will help you see them as a complex, dynamic human who is worthy of kindness and compassion. Spirituality can also be expressed in ways not considered religious We have to abandon the idea that schooling is something restricted to youth. How can it be, in a world where half the things a man knows at 20 are no longer true at 40, and half the things he knows at 40 hadn't been discovered when he was 20? - Arthur C. Clarke 1. relating to friends, family, and neighbours in ways that give and receive love, support, kindness, guidance, loyalty, and forgiveness; 2. expressing themselves creatively or artistically (e.g., woodworking or sewing, writing poetry or making music, painting or sculpting); 3. appreciating visual or performing arts (e.g., attending a concert, visiting an art gallery, or going to a movie); 4. reading books and engaging in conversations about the meaning of life; 5. paying attention to the movements of their emotional lives, the stirrings of the spirit evident in sadness, longing, love, anxiety/fear, anger, joy, pride, hope, and compassion; 6. enjoying the natural world (e.g., gardening or hiking, watching songbirds or sunsets, travelling to scenic places, spending time at a cottage, savouring the first snowfall or spring buds); 7. connecting with their bodies through exercise, meditation, massage, dancing, eating and drinking, or sexuality; 8. enjoying comedy and humour (e.g., light-hearted banter in everyday conversation, the capacity to see the joke in life's discouraging moments, or comedies on the stage or in books or movies); 9. trying to live ethically, by integrating justice and fairness, peace-making, or green practices into their lives. Why Be Spiritual? Five Benefits of Spirituality Success is achievable without public recognition, and the world has many unsung heroes. The teacher who inspires you to pursue your education to your ultimate ability is a success. The parents who taught you the noblest human principles are a success. The coach who shows you the importance of teamwork is a success. The spiritual leader who instills in you spiritual values and faith is a success. The relatives, friends, and neighbors with whom you develop a reciprocal relationship of respect and support - they, too, are successes. The most menial workers can properly consider themselves successful if they perform their best and if the product of their work is of service to humanity. - Michael Ellis DeBakey 1. Spiritual people are gracious: Expressing gratitude is associated with many positive emotions such as optimism, being generous with time and resources, and overall vitality. 2. Spiritual people are compassionate: Experiencing compassion toward others is one of the strongest correlates with living a spiritual life. 3. Spiritual people flourish: Spiritual people have positive relationships, high self-esteem, are optimistic, and have meaning and purpose in life. 4. Spiritual people self-actualize: Spiritual individuals strive toward a better life and consider personal growth and fulfillment a central goal. Spirituality can be considered to be a path toward self-actualization. 5. Spiritual people take time to savor life experiences: Individuals who value spirituality take the time to reflect on their daily activities and ultimately build lasting memories of their experiences. ADVANTAGES OF BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH PATIENTS' SPIRITUALITY Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is. - Isaac Asimov 1. Spirituality may be a dynamic in the patient's understanding of the disease 2. Religious convictions may affect health care decision making 3. Spirituality may be a patient need and may be important in patient coping 4. An understanding of the patient's spirituality is integral to whole patient care. ASPECTS OF SPIRITUAL PATIENT CARE In so many ways, the same impulse to know the world and our place in it is at the roots of both science and spirituality. Both are attempts to illuminate the mysteries of our world and expand our vision of the greater whole. By charting the history of science, I hope these pages have shown how vital and awesome real science is. Throughout history, scientific discovery has brought us closer to the wonders of life and the universe - and immeasurably deepened our appreciation for creation. It engages the world and inspires the best in us. But the pursuit of truth should not be driven by zealous agenda. Nor should it overreach and speak with righteous authority where it's on unsolid ground. That's not science - and let's not allow those who falsely invoke its name to diminish us. - Amir D. Aczel 1. Practicing compassionate presence\u2014i.e., being fully present and attentive to patients and being supportive to them in all of their suffering: physical, emotional, and spiritual 2. Listening to patients' fears, hopes, pain, and dreams 3. Obtaining a spiritual history 4. Being attentive to all dimensions of patients and their families: body, mind, and spirit 5. Incorporating spiritual practices as appropriate 6. Involving chaplains as members of the interdisciplinary health care team An 8-Step Guide To Tapping Into Your Spiritual Side Today The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that what is impenetrable for us really exists and manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are intelligible to our poor faculties - this knowledge, this feeling ... that is the core of the true religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men. - Albert Einstein 1. Set your intention: Acknowledging that you want to become more spiritual in the first place. 2. Feed your mind: Read everything you can get your hands on. Feed your inquisitiveness, and remember that knowledge and curiosity are the cornerstones of any truly rich spiritual journey. 3. Be still every day: Set aside time to intentionally quiet your thinking mind using meditation, chanting, or mindfulness. 4. Don't neglect your body: The mind, body, and spirit are all connected, so don't forget to employ your physical body in your pursuit of the mystical. See if you can get out of your head and simply allow your body to tell you what it wants. 5. Approach your practice with playfulness: Approach your budding practice with a light heart. 6. Watch for signs: As you begin to cultivate a spiritual practice, you may find that the universe sends you little hints and clues to encourage you on your seeker's path. Stay open, and you will begin to feel subtle course corrections as you travel through life. 7. Connect with your tribe: If you want to feel your practice really take shape, get together with other seekers. Attend workshops, classes, and retreats. Join an online community. There's an energetic resonance that only comes from being part of a group. 8. Experiment: Cherry-pick from any discipline, idea, or philosophy that speaks to you. Try everything and trust your gut. Whatever fuels your interest, resonates with your heart, and feeds your soul...do that! 6 SIGNS OF A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING (AND HOW TO EMBRACE THEM) Intelligence makes clear to us the interrelationship of means and ends. But mere thinking cannot give us a sense of the ultimate and fundamental ends. To make clear these fundamental ends and valuations and to set them fast in the emotional life of the individual, seems to me precisely the most important function which religion has to form in the social life of man. - Albert Einstein 1. QUESTIONING YOURSELF: You might start asking yourself why you have trouble waking up when you alarm goes off in the morning, or why you feel unfulfilled in your relationships and/or career. 2. A SUDDEN DISCONNECTION: From people or even from hobbies or other things you used to enjoy. It shows you're subconsciously realizing that there is more to your existence\u2014and that your spirit is craving a connection to a higher purpose. 3. YOUR INTUITION FEELS STRONGER: Your sense of intuition simply feels stronger and more focused. 4. YOU EXPERIENCE D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU: If you've been experiencing more deja vu (where you have a strange feeling that you've experienced something before), this could be a sign that your spirit is awakening. 5. YOU FEEL A STRONGER SENSE OF PURPOSE: You suddenly feel a compulsion to volunteer or find other ways to make a difference in your community, which means your spirit is guiding you towards finding a higher purpose in the way you live your life. 6. YOU EXPERIENCE VIVID DREAMS: You may find yourself waking up in the mornings and having a hard time differentiating between something that happened in a dream and something that happened in real life. THE 10 MOST INFLUENTIAL SPIRITUAL LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD \"At any moment, you have a choice, that either leads you closer to your spirit or further away from it.\" \u2014 Thich Nhat Hanh 1. Deepak Chopra: In his book, he outlines a simple set of guidelines focused on making you a better human being. 2. The Dalai Lama: Tenzin Gyatso is the 14th Dalai Lama, and at 78 years old, he still travels the world constantly, spreading the buddhist (and Elvis Costello's) beliefs in peace, love and understanding. 3. Paulo Coelho: His spiritual books have sold over 150 million copies in over 150 countries. The Alchemist is one of the top selling books ever! 4. Pope Francis: This 226th Pope is turning the image of the Catholic church around in a most positive way for the entire world! 5. Thich Nhat Hanh: At 89 years young, he is still touring the world, writing books and leading retreats on the art of mindful living. 6. Eckhart Tolle: The Power Of Now and A New Earth are two of the best-selling spiritual books in the world. 7. James Redfield: The Celestine Prophecy helped pave the way for a new generation of soul-seekers to set off on their path of spiritual awakening. 8. don Miguel Ruiz: The Four Agreements has always been and will always be a set of four ancient Toltec teachings which transcend all religious and philosophical doctrines. 9. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: As a humanitarian and ambassador of peace, he has united millions of people throughout the world with service projects and courses focusing on a stress-free and violence-free society. 10. Rhonda Byrne: Listed among Time Magazine's 100 people who shape the world, her book The Secret has re-popularized the spiritual belief in the law of attraction and positive thinking. Toltec Wisdom: Words of wisdom from those who ruled central Mexico a thousand years ago. \"Peaceful is the one who's not concerned with having more or less. Unbound by name and fame, he is free from sorrow from the world and mostly from himself.\" - Rumi Toltec philosophy has much in common with the world's major religions: \"Jesus said the truth shall set you free. The Buddha said we should see the world as it is, not as it is clouded by prejudice. In Toltec tradition we must work our way through the fog that confuses us with opinions rather than facts. We must learn to return to our own nature,\" Don Miguel Ruiz. He adds, \"The four agreements are a perfect mirror that lets you see yourself as you are. Not as you wish to be. Not as you pretend to be, but as you really are. We help people find themselves.\" 1. Be impeccable with your word: Words have great power and we should use them carefully. We should avoid using words to judge or bring shame to others. Gossip is particularly poisonous and we should never engage in it, Ruiz says. 2. Don't Take Anything Personally: This agreement is considered the most life-altering. Ruiz says our whole life can change if we realize the actions and opinions of others have nothing to do with us. Others are living their own reality, having their own experiences. If words or deeds set us off emotionally, it means they have touched a wounded place within us. We should focus on healing our wounds, not on getting even. 3. Don't Make Assumptions: We make assumptions because we are afraid to ask questions, Ruiz says. Very often, these assumptions change the course of our lives. For example, we assume that we know what someone else, such as a spouse, thinks, believes, or desires. We should ask questions, express what we want, and communicate clearly or our lives will be filled with misunderstandings, resentment, and lost opportunities. 4. Always Do Your Best: Our best will change constantly, emphasizes Ruiz. We are sometimes sick or tired, but we can still do our best. If we do our best and accept the result, we will never judge ourselves against someone else's standards. We will never judge ourselves harshly if we fail, he says. 7 Disciplines of Spiritual Leaders \"Wise individuals frequently say very little, but what they do say hits the mark. Such remarks often remain in the mind of the recipient for a long time, possibly a lifetime.\" - Donna Goddard 1. Self-Awareness: Great leaders know where they've come from, what makes them tick, how they come across to others, and why they make the decisions they do. They are aware of their mission and their calling in life. They are well acquainted with their own failures and flaws, their sinful tendencies and recurring temptations. 2. Self-Management: Great leaders know how to manage their feelings, whether they come in the forms of depression, anger, hostility, grief, loss, fear, or bitterness. They also know how to manage expectations - both their own expectations of themselves and the expectations others place of them. Self-management guides leaders in their efforts to stay healthy, both physically and spiritually. 3. Self-Development: Great leaders are marked by a posture of lifelong learning. They know the importance of building on their strengths, not focusing all their attention on shoring up their weaknesses. 4. Sense of Mission: Great leaders are not defined by their role or task, but by their life's mission - what they hope to accomplish. A great leader is captivated by a great vision, a mission that is not invented but discovered. 5. Decision-Making: Great leaders know how to make decisions, when to make them, and what the right decision is. They learn from mistakes and successes alike by building in opportunities to debrief with others about their choices. 6. & 7. Belonging and \"Aloneness\": One is about belonging, and the other is \"aloneness.\" Put together, these disciplines create a needed balance. Great leaders are not loners. They need to have their family and home life in order. They need friends, coworkers, mentors, and followers. Great Scientists Who Were Committed Christians \"No one can have the peace of God until they are at peace with God.\" -Jack Wellman 1.
