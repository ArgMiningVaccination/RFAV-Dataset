Some studies have found some complementary therapies to be generally safe to use together with conventional cancer treatments and medicines. However, some complementary therapies can affect the way conventional cancer treatments and medicines work, and even stop them working altogether. All therapies have the potential to cause injury or harm. When trying anything new, discuss with your doctor and therapist whether it is suitable for you and whether you need to take any safety precautions. Some common safety issues include: Mind-body practices Sometimes people feel overwhelmed by the emotions they experience during or after a session. This usually settles soon afterwards. If not, contact your therapist for further support. Body-based practices If you have cancer in the bones, or bruise or bleed easily, you may need to take care when using body-based practices such as [acupuncture](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/acupuncture/) and [massage](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/massage/#concerns). Herb and plant-based therapies People often think natural products are safe, but this isn't always true. [Some herbs can interact with conventional cancer treatment or medicines](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/safety-concerns/safety-of-herbs/), and change how they work or how the dose is absorbed. Some complementary therapists do not need to have any specific qualifications to practise. To reduce the potential for harm, [always check the practitioner is qualified](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/making-informed-decisions/finding-a-complementary-therapist/).
