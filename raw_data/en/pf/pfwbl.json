Since discovering Dr. Duplain I feel TONS better!!! Dr. Duplain has helped me successfully navigate through some health challenges and he has helped two of my daughters through emotional and health challenges as well. One daughter in particular has experienced a profound turn around since seeing Dr. Duplain which to me is pretty miraculous and special. It definitely bears mentioning that Dr. Duplain has a really great personality, His knowledge and skill is truly positive and solid. He takes time with me and explains everything simply and clearly. There are no \"dumb questions\"!! His homeopathic remedies and B12 shots are absolutely fresh, custom and effective. (just so you know not all B12 shots are equal), I totally recommend Dr. Duplain. - 4/10/2015 Scott is a great acupuncturist and herbalist. I had a three week cold going that dove into full flu symptoms for a few days. It was hard to enjoy pretty much anything and was making me need to miss work. After one acupuncture treatment and a couple days on herbs, I was feeling much better. All nontoxic- no antibiotics! It's a nice office with some parking too. - 8/31/2015 This place is the best in town. Dr. Duplain knows what he is doing. He is timely, attentive, focused, and attends to your unique needs.
