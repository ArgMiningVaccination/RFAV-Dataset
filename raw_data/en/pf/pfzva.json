Since that time she has been working intensely as an integrated holistic chiropractic practitioner and currently has offices in Stillwater and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Dr. Mitchell's commitment is to individuals, not diseases\u2014to healing, not curing. She listens to symptoms and how they live as a story in the body, supporting people in connection with what's happening physically, as well as metaphysically. Dr. Mitchell offers insights that help guide these individuals into their own deep inner knowing. Using Kinesiology as a diagnostic tool, she then treats with specific chiropractor methods that correct the spine while educating the spine's ability to self correct. Supporting the healing process, she integrates dietary consultations and nutritional factors and in-depth interviewing for constitutional homeopathic remedies. On the succeeding pages, you will see some of the techniques that she uses such as cranial sacral therapy, classical homeopathy and more.
