Guilt from having an illness may stem from thepopular view that if one does all the right things, thenillness can be avoided. This view of wellness, althoughintended to empower, can leave the physically illwondering if they are in some way to blame. Patientsmay question if there is a chicken or egg dilemma-whichcame first? Has the physical illness led to mental stress,depression and lack of motivation or have these factorscontributed to the physical illness that seems unrelenting?It is likely that this debate will continue well into the newmillennium.

This paper provides a brief overviewof the naturopathic medical model, and examinescounselors' collaboration with an alternative medicalmodel with regard to professional counselor practice,training, and ethics. uch has been written about the mind-body connection. The pendulum has swung from the view that illness isbrought about by \"evil spirits\" or is an unfortunateMCA Dimensions in Counseling 30:2 August 2002 9The dissatisfaction with conventional medicine's sometimes fragmented, impersonal, and costly approachto treating health problems has resulted in more andmore clients turning to alternative health care providers(Bar, 1998). The holistic perspective of alternative healthcare espouses a basic belief that also underlies counselingpractice\u2014empowering the individual\u2014and offering hopeto the suffering where once there was none. The mind-body connection is affirmed and holism encouragespatients to develop their personal power in cultivatingand maintaining healthy lifestyles within a supportiveclimate. Interestingly, a recent survey of the nation's 125conventional medical schools revealed that of the 117schools responding, 75 reported that they offeredalternative medical electives or included such topics inrequired courses (Wetzel, Eisenberg, & Kaptchuk, 1998). An increased dialogue concerning holistic health issues has been noted in professional mental health publications(Collins, 1997; Farberman & Haber, 1998; Haber, 1998;Johnson, 1997) examining the potential of alternativetreatments to enhance the physical and mental health ofclients, especially those who have not found adequateresolution of health problems through conventionalmedicine. Included in the discourse have been possibledrawbacks of reaching beyond the conventional medicalcommunity, especially with regard to the lack ofcontinuity observed in regulating alternativepractitioners.health profession has traditionally taken a cautious stance with regard to the participation in natural medicinehealth care; however, growing populations of people whoprefer alternative medical care, or who use programsoffering holistic healing concepts are talking to counselorsabout their health care choices. Often such alternativecare is adjunct to patients' conventional medical care andis frequently sought without the knowledge of theprimary care physicians. Given this reality, counselors areencouraged to take inventory of the knowledge theypossess regarding alternative approaches and to exploretheir personal attitude toward holistic health care. Howwill these two factors impact the way in which counselorsassist their clients? As we entertain the idea ofbroadening our views on health care beyondconventional approaches, the counseling profession mustask how this will influence service provision, but alsohow standards for practice, training, professionalcollaboration, and ethical behavior can be expanded toencompass a new perspective. Naturopathy: A Possible Choice For alternative approaches to be viewed as legitimatehealth care options, increased rigor in the preparation ofproviders, the standards of care, and the regulation ofhealth care products must also be realized. One well-coordinated option is naturopathic medicine.Naturopathy is defined as a distinct system of primaryhealthcare-an art, science, philosophy and practice ofdiagnosis, treatment and prevention of illness. Thetechniques of naturopathic medicine include modern andtraditional, scientific and empirical methods (American he holistic perspective of alternative health care espouses a basic belief that also underlies counseling practice\u2014 empowering the individual\u2014and offering hope to the suffering where once there was none.TThe Counseling Profession's Role in Adjunct Holistic Medical Care With the increase in chronic conditions and their associated stresses, counseling hasbecome more and more acceptable as anadjunct to the general practice ofconventional and alternative medicine.Many primary medical practices have addedcounselors to their staffs. Especially popularin Great Britain, counselors are viewed asliaisons between patients and doctors(Hemmings, 2000). Counselors can use theirspecialized training to assist patients inseveral areas such as communication,advocacy, stress management, pain control,and behavioral changes. As the trend toward inclusion of professional counselors continues,counselors will likely find themselvesamong the therapeutic agents incomprehensive holistic health care programs(Papadopoulus & Bor, 1995). The mentallife expectancy of adults. This shift in focus and frequency from infectiousmaladies to chronic or degenerativeconditions has fueled the popularity ofholism and alternative medicine (Flint,1998; Lyddon, 1987). Illnesses such aschronic fatigue syndrome (Albrecht &Wallace, 1998), fibromyalgia, and variousforms of arthritis, to name a few, are oftendifficult to diagnose and to treat.Consequently, many people have found thehealing they desire to be elusive. Some ofthe most heart-wrenching and frustratingpatients in medical doctors' offices are thosewho suffer from these \"difficult to diagnoseand to treat\" chronic illnesses. Whetherunable or unwilling to take steps to bettertheir health, such patients may continue torequest assistance even after finding little orno relief from known treatment protocols.Not only are these patients time-consumingfor medical doctors, they challenge themedical profession's foundational trainingto \"fix\" what is wrong.10 MCA Dimensions in Counseling 30:2 August 2002empower those who seek assistance through education and the recognition of individuals' uniqueness. Activeinvolvement with regard to selection of treatment goalsand therapeutic interventions is highly encouraged. Bothdisciplines embrace an optimistic stance, believing thatpeople not only have the capability of overcomingpresent challenges but also have the potential to reachbeyond their premorbid state of functioning to achieve ahigher level of wellness (Gordon, 1990). Given the shared philosophy between naturopathy and counseling, it would appear that collaboration betweenthe fields has the potential to provide enhanced holisticcare. An exploration of possible questions resulting froma collaborative effort should be conducted to ensure thatthe welfare of clients is given highest priority. What arethe challenges posed by such a partnership in the areas ofcounselor practice, training, and ethics? Practice One primary factor for consideration in the area ofpractice is that of \"counselor-as-person.\" Much like thelay public, counselors' degrees of openness to alternativecare will be influenced by their personal experiences,experiences of friends and family, and their knowledgebase regarding the subject. Counseling professionalsunderstand that their personal knowledge, values, andopinions impact the counseling process and thus theclient. Therefore, counselors are challenged to exploretheir own attitudes and beliefs about naturopathic careand to expand their knowledge base before endeavoringto assist clients. Following efforts to educate themselves, counselors then are faced with the task of identifying those clients whomay benefit from naturopathic care. Furnham and Smith(1988) noted in their comparative study of patients whoadvanced the idea that by utilizing natural laws the human body could heal itself (Murray & Pizzorno, 1991).The late 1960s and early 1970s brought disenchantmentwith many things, including conventional medicine. Thefailure of chronic health problems to respond adequatelyto the conventional approach shed light on the medicalmodel's limitations. In the wake of this disillusionment,natural medicine gained renewed respect. By 1987 thegovernment had recognized the Council on NaturopathicMedical Education as the official accrediting body forinstitutions of higher learning (Collinge, 1996). Naturopathy todayWith the advent of the 1990s came a directive from Congress instructing the government to create andsupport a new branch of the National Institute of Health:The Office of Alternative Medicine (Chowka, 1996). As aresult of its newfound status, naturopathic medicine hasbegun to enjoy increased backing from government andindustry in the form of funding for research and financialsupport for practice. For example, in 1994 BastyrUniversity received a government grant of $840,000 toestablish an alternative medicine research center for HIV/AIDS (Bastyr University, 1998). The university alsoestablished and manages the nation's first publiclyfunded natural medicine clinic located in Kent,Washington (Bastyr University, 1998). A growing numberof medical insurance companies now provide for theservices of a naturopathic physician. Eleven states currently enforce licensure standards (Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Montana,New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, andWashington) for naturopathic physicians. Althoughspecific requirements differ across states, in general, toreceive licensure prospective physicians must possessundergraduate degrees (typically pre-med) and doctoral ounselors are challenged to explore their own attitudes and beliefs about naturopathic care and to expand their knowledge base before endeavoring to assist clients.CAssociation of Naturopathic Physicians, 2002). The naturopath's holistic view of health encompasses physical, mental,and spiritual well-being. Such factorsas physiological functioning, diet, exercise,mental attitude, and environment, areconsidered when assessing health status.Patients are encouraged to become activeagents in establishing and maintaininghealthy balanced lifestyles. This proactiveapproach is a foundational cornerstone ofnaturopathic medicine. HistoryThe origin of naturopathic philosophy has been traced back to Hippocrates, whodegrees in naturopathic medicine from an accredited college or university, and pass aprofessional board exam (Murray &Pizzorno, 1991). Naturopathy and Professional Counseling as Partners There are several areas in which naturopathy and counseling share commonground. Both disciplines recognize andappreciate the mind-body connection aswell as the potential impact of spiritual,environmental, and social factors on health.Professional counseling and naturopathicmedicine are developmental in nature,with a focus on prevention and personalresponsibility for wellness. The hope ofboth the naturopath and counselor is toMCA Dimensions in Counseling 30:2 August 2002 11either chose a conventional or a homeopathic physician that people who sought alternative treatment fell into acategory that labeled them as \"hard to treat\" by theconventional medical community. When compared topatients who chose a general medical practitioner, thesepatients possessed more critical attitudes about the abilityof conventional doctors to meet their needs. In addition,they were judged as having a greater degree of neurosisthan the \"average\" patient as evidenced by higher scoreson a measure of psychological disturbance. As counselors, we can reframe this negative interpretation by viewing clients' qualities as strengthsrather than limitations. We can choose to view those whoseek alternative care as people who have a greatersensitivity towards their body, are confident that they canmake a difference in improving their health, and have agreater desire for long-term health. In general, clientswho value an egalitarian therapeutic relationship (Hewer,1983), aspire towards a greater degree of participation inhealth care decisions and the wellness process, and areless likely to passively accede to the treatmentsprescribed by their health care provider. Clients who are attracted to naturopathic care may find themselves confused by the diverse health care choicesnow available to them. Professional conversations in themental health community include the various aspects ofsupporting clients who are attempting to select anapproach from among an array of alternative treatmentoptions. Our charge, as counselors, is to sort out our rolewhen dealing with clients who display a combination ofphysical and emotional symptoms. We are likely toencounter depression in clients who have illnesses thatare difficult to diagnose or treat, or for which treatment iseither unpleasant or not available. For example, Albrechtand Wallace (1998) highlighted the potential challengesencountered by clients who suffered from chronic fatiguesyndrome and the role of counselors in assisting suchclients. Though we should not present ourselves asnaturopathic specialists, we can serve as detective,supporter, and educator for such clients. Clients can begiven basic information on how to select an alternativehealth care provider for complementary care, where tofind materials that explain treatment options, and how todecipher the results of research studies. Counselors can assist clients through skills training aimed at the development of effective problem-solving anddecision-making ability, as well as the ability to advocatefor themselves within the general medical community.While many clients have learned to take a passive role,counselors can encourage an assertive stance based on theconviction that clients can learn to become experts ontheir own bodies, personal needs, and preferences. In theactual selection of courses of treatment, clients,counselors, and naturopaths have the opportunity towork cooperatively. Such empowerment is likely to lead to a better fit between clients and the treatments of choice. Training Licensed professional counselors and counselors-in-training could benefit by continuing education thatincludes an overview of alternative or naturopathicmedicine. Traditionally, counselor education programshave encouraged students to learn about thephysiological aspects of mental disorders and thepsychopharmacological interventions that supportconventional medicine's view of these disorders. Studentsreceive guidance with regard to which clients should bereferred to physicians or psychiatrists, how to refer to theconventional medical community, and how to supportclients who are actively engaged in some type of medicalintervention. Little, if any, course work is offered thatwould assist counselors in considering alternativemedical approaches. Recognition of the need to expand training opportunities is an important first step in strengthening the ability ofprofessional counselors to meet the needs of today'sclientele. In their discussion of possible trends incounseling and their implications for counselor training,Eriksen et al. (1997) drew specific attention to \"themedicine-psychology intersection\" and included withinthis content area the topic of alternative medicalapproaches. If the counseling profession were to embracesuch a proposal, what then would counselor educatorsneed to impart to their students about natural approachesand who would provide training for the counseloreducators? The answer to this latter question is likely tobe found through interdisciplinary collaboration with thenaturopathic medical community. A mutual exchange between educators from both disciplines has the potential to illuminate a central bodyof knowledge, key concepts, pertinent issues, and bestpractices that are considered foundational to naturopathy.In preparing students to work with clients who prefer analternative approach, counselor educators would haveguidance in choosing legitimate and respectedinformation sources to assist students in understandingthe field of naturopathic medicine. Included among thetasks in educating counselors-in-training are: (a)increasing students' awareness, (b) imparting a basicunderstanding of the approach, (c) highlightingcommonalities and differences between naturopathy andconventional medicine, (d) exploring the efficacy ofvarious naturopathic medical treatment approaches, and(e) identifying trusted information sources. Students willalso need tools to recognize legitimate naturopathicpractitioners and have the ability to distinguish betweenclients who may or may not benefit from a naturopathicmedical approach.12 MCA Dimensions in Counseling 30:2 August 2002other concerns, students must also be taught to review possible ethical considerations. Ethics A primary concern for the counseling profession is thealignment of ethical standards across disciplines.Interdisciplinary collaboration can occur only in thepresence of agreement that protection of client rights isgiven priority above all else. In addition, appropriateboundaries between the professions need to be madedefinite. For example, just as counselors must refrainfrom reaching beyond the scope of their training andexpertise with regard to medical issues, naturopaths mustbe sensitive to their own limitations in the area of mentalhealth. Although they may have taken as many as sevencourses in counseling and communication skills(Collinge, 1996), naturopaths should refer those clientswhose mental health needs surpass the training theyreceived in medical school. Ongoing conversationbetween the two professions has the potential to clarifysimilar issues and develop suitable parameters. Another ethical challenge that may emerge in counseling is related to the problem-solving process. As with anypresenting problem, it is the counselors' charge to assistclients in exploring an array of possible solutions. At thisstage of the counseling process, the dilemma that couldunfold for counselors is whether or not the clients' issuesare connected to physical or mental health. The followingquestions remain unanswered in counseling practice: (a)products can pose a practical and ethical challenge for counselors. As alternative care increases in popularity, sotoo will the numbers of clients that counselors serve whostruggle with common problems such as insomnia,depression, and anxiety, and likewise are attracted tonatural approaches to self-treatment. Tempted by thelatest natural remedy reviewed in the popular media,clients may well consider experimenting with herbalremedies and food supplements. As counselors,supporting such actions seems ill advised given theaverage person's limited knowledge. However, thenaturopathic physicians are experts who can thoroughlyaddress issues such as the validity of various treatmentapproaches for specific conditions, and how to locatereliable sources for quality remedies and supplements.Clients who wish to pursue the use of these productsshould be referred to the professionals who have thespecific expertise. On the occasion when referral to naturopathic physicians would be appropriate, ethics would direct counselors tobe certain that the doctors are properly educated andtrained, and are considered a respected member of theprofessional community. Several reputable sources ofinformation are available to assist counselors in makingthis determination. Contacting an organization chargedwith safeguarding the profession, such as the NationalAssociation of Naturopathic Physicians, is one means ofascertaining whether or not naturopaths are members ingood standing. If in a state with licensure or practicelaws, counselors also can contact the Department ofHealth's professional licensing division. or those clients who ultimately seek out the alternative health care services, counselors-in- training must know how to support them in their efforts to enhance wellness.FFor those clients who ultimately seek out the alternative health care services,counselors-in-training must know howto support them in their efforts toenhance wellness. In some respects, thismay be challenging in that a naturopathicapproach often brings relief through a moregradual healing and restoration processwhen compared to conventional medicine'sinterventions, which are aimed at timelysuppression of symptoms. Clients new tothe approach may be too hasty inconcluding that the naturopathicintervention failed to bring about thedesired end product and prematurelyterminate treatment. Should clients beencouraged, then, to continue with theirprescribed treatment regime? With this andWhat responsibility, if any, do counselors have to interject naturopathic medicalapproaches among the viable courses ofaction being reviewed? (b) If clients areunfamiliar with the naturopathic approach,should counselors impart information andoffer introductory educational materials?And finally, (c) should counselors who areunfamiliar with naturopathy, oruncomfortable with the approach altogether,refer clients to counselors who can helpthem? The answers to these questions canbest be found through professionalcounseling's ongoing dialogue, study, andresearch, which can in turn inform an ethical\"best practices\" approach. Unregulated nonprescription health careMCA Dimensions in Counseling 30:2 August 2002 13Summary With increasing frequency, clients are seeking natural solutions to health concerns. As naturopathic medicine'svalidity is established in the health care community,collaboration between counseling and naturopathicmedicine seems worthy of exploration for all concerned.With client well-being taking center stage, it will beimportant for counselors to understand the \"what, when,and how\" of alternative medical treatment and referraldecisions. Interdisciplinary dialogue, especially withnaturopathy's educational community, has the potentialto clarify and inform an ethical \"best practices\" approachto counselor training and service provision for thoseclients who would benefit from holistic approaches.
