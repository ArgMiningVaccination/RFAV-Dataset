However, in practice, correctly-priced stocks and overpriced toxic stocks are intertwined in such a way that it is tough to distinguish those. Usually, overhyped toxic stocks are vulnerable to external shocks. Moreover, these stocks are loaded with a large amount of debt. The price of these stocks is artificially inflated. Nonetheless, the elevated price of toxic stocks is only temporary in nature as it is higher than its true intrinsic value. Investors are likely to gain from accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows investors to sell a stock first and then buy it when price falls. While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets. So, accurately figuring toxic stocks and discarding or short selling those at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses.
