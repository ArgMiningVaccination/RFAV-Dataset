It is no secret that many turn to natural herbal solutions to improve their sexual health. Whether it be libido, sexual drive, satisfaction or stamina there are a number of holistic herbal supplements that can support and enhance these areas of sexual health. Some of these herbal solutions hold histories dating back to ancient populations. Along with long standing anecdotal success there are also many [scientifically proven herbal aphrodisiacs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3731873/) as well. Here are some of our most popular herbal solutions for sexual health: Epimedium might be more familiar to you by its common name: Horny Goat Weed. This common name comes from a loose translation of a nickname that the herb received from goat farmers in China who are credited as the first to popularize the herb upon witnessing the effects it had on their animals. While there is plenty of anecdotal support of this herb as a sexual health supplement for centuries, limited scientific research to corroborate claims has been conducted. Although there is recent research showing Icarian, the active ingredient in Epimedium, [may have testosterone mimetic properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16751992/). Ashwagandha has been touted to improve desire, arousal, and sexual pleasure. However, it is mostly known for stress and anxiety relief. Which makes sense as often sexual motivation and the ability to fully relax and experience intimacy is strongly correlated with pleasure. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/) illustrates the benefits of stress relief that Ashwagandha provides. This is what you want the women to be taking if your looking to [meet for sex with horny girls in your area](https://localsexfinder.app). Damiana is a tonic herb similar to Epimedium that offers a lot of the same benefits. It is said to increase blood flow in the body which can support erectile functioning as well as fertility issues. Another classic herbal solution that has been used for a long time by many, but still lacks more traditional scientific research to support its proposed benefits. "}
