The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds NUNM's scientific investigations in large part because NUNM has some of the most respected complementary and alternative medicine physician-researchers in the country teaching our students. Through cross-disciplinary coursework and hands-on research experience, students train for multiple research career paths. Our students develop natural medicine research protocols from our expert faculty and work alongside scientists from all fields, including local and national institutions. Attend NUNM and discover skills that can be applied to basic science, clinical or public health research. Our students tailor their research projects to focus on their personal interests, and have included a dietary supplement and exercise study, the effects of peat mud pack therapy on osteoarthritis, and a global health study on the obstetrics practices of West African women in birthing. Our students choose from a variety of elective courses that give them practical experiences as they work on innovative research projects that allow them to develop theses, publish case studies, and exhibit at conferences locally and nationally. Make your mark in research\u2014your future awaits you! Program Outcomes Our graduates are skilled in research methodology, study design, data collection and analysis. Their skill sets allow them to contribute high-quality studies that are relevant\u2014and necessary\u2014to the real-world practice of integrative medicine. They develop the assurance and confidence to employ clinical research and scientific integrity while cultivating an exciting career in integrative medicine.
