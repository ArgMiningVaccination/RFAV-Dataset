Depending on the jurisdiction, it is authorized for use in people aged six months, [[43]](#cite_note-43) twelve years, or eighteen years and older. It provides protection against [COVID-19](/wiki/COVID-19) which is caused by infection by the [SARS-CoV-2](/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) virus.

[[47]](#cite_note-Baden-47) It is authorized for use at some level in many countries. [[48]](#cite_note-48) [[49]](#cite_note-49) [[50]](#cite_note-50) [[51]](#cite_note-Moderna_PR_20210805-51) In August and September 2022, bivalent 0-omicron (Spikevax Bivalent Zero/Omicron) [[52]](#cite_note-:1-52) were authorized for use as booster doses in individuals aged 18 years of age or older in the United Kingdom, [[53]](#cite_note-MHRA_PR_20220815-53) [[54]](#cite_note-:2-54) Switzerland, [[55]](#cite_note-55) Australia, [[56]](#cite_note-56) Canada, [[57]](#cite_note-57) [[58]](#cite_note-:3-58) Union, [[2]](#cite_note-Spikevax_EPAR-2) and the United States. [[59]](#cite_note-FDA_PR_20220831-59) [[60]](#cite_note-60) The second component of the version of the bivalent vaccine used in the United States (mRNA-1273.222 [[61]](#cite_note-Moderna_PR_2022.08.23_re_mRNA-1273.222-61)) is based on the [Omicron BA.4/BA.5](/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant#BA.4/5) variant, [[59]](#cite_note-FDA_PR_20220831-59) while the second component in the bivalent vaccine version used in other countries (mRNA-1273.214) is COVID19 vaccine is used to provide protection against infection by the [SARSCoV2](/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) virus in order to prevent COVID19. [[37]](#cite_note-Moderna_COVID-19_Vaccine_FDA_label-37) [[2]](#cite_note-Spikevax_EPAR-2) The vaccine is given by [intramuscular injection](/wiki/Intramuscular_injection) into the [deltoid muscle](/wiki/Deltoid_muscle) of the arm. [[29]](#cite_note-CDC_standing_order-29) The initial course consists of two doses. [[29]](#cite_note-CDC_standing_order-29) The [World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization) (WHO) recommends an interval of eight weeks between doses. [[62]](#cite_note-who-guidance-62) A third, fourth, or fifth dose can be added in some countries. [[45]](#cite_note-FDA_PR_20210812-45) [[46]](#cite_note-CDC_immunocompromised-46) [[63]](#cite_note-EMA_extra_doses-63) Efficacy Evidence of [vaccine efficacy](/wiki/Vaccine_efficacy) starts about two weeks after the first dose. [[64]](#cite_note-who-back-64) [[65]](#cite_note-65) High efficacy is achieved with full immunization, two weeks after the second dose, and was evaluated at 94.1%: at the end of the vaccine study that led to emergency authorization in the US, there were eleven cases of COVID19 in the vaccine group (out of 15,181 people) versus 185 cases in the [placebo group](/wiki/Placebo) (15,170 people). [[64]](#cite_note-who-back-64) Moreover, there were zero cases of severe COVID19 in the vaccine group, versus eleven in the placebo group. [[66]](#cite_note-:0-66) This efficacy has been described as \"astonishing\" [[67]](#cite_note-astonishing-67) and \"borderline historic\" [[68]](#cite_note-contagionlive-68) for a respiratory virus vaccine, and it is similar to the efficacy of the [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine](/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine). [[69]](#cite_note-69) [[70]](#cite_note-70) Efficacy estimates were similar across age groups, sexes, racial and ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID19. [[71]](#cite_note-briefing-71) Only individuals aged 18 or older were studied. Studies are underway to gauge efficacy and safety in children aged 0-11 (KidCOVE) and 12-17 (TeenCOVE). [[72]](#cite_note-72) A further study conducted by the US [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) (CDC) between December 2020, and March 2021, on nearly 4 thousand health care personnel, [first responders](/wiki/First_responder), and other essential and frontline workers concluded that under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness of full immunization (14 days or more after second dose) was 90% against [SARS-CoV-2](/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) infections, regardless of symptoms, and vaccine effectiveness of partial immunization (14 days or more after first dose but before second dose) was 80%. [[73]](#cite_note-cdc0-realworld-73) The duration of protection provided by the vaccine is unknown as of April 2021 [[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moderna_COVID-19_vaccine&action=edit), [[47]](#cite_note-Baden-47) [[74]](#cite_note-nejm-antibody-persistence-74) and a two-year followup study is underway to determine the duration. [[68]](#cite_note-contagionlive-68) Preliminary results from a phase III trial indicate that vaccine efficacy is durable, remaining at 93% six months after the second dose. [[75]](#cite_note-75) Effectiveness A vaccine is generally considered effective if the estimate is 50% with a >30% lower limit of the 95% [confidence interval](/wiki/Confidence_interval). [[76]](#cite_note-76) Effectiveness is generally expected to slowly decrease over time. [[77]](#cite_note-77) In August 2021, results from a study suggested that the effectiveness against infection decreased from 91% (81-96%) to 66% (26-84%) when the [Delta variant](/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Delta_variant) became predominant in the US, which may be due to unmeasured and residual [confounding](/wiki/Confounding) related to a decline in vaccine are available on the safety of the Moderna COVID19 vaccine during pregnancy. [[81]](#cite_note-cdc-pregnancy-84) The initial study excluded pregnant women or discontinued them from vaccination upon a positive pregnancy test. [[64]](#cite_note-who-back-64) Studies in animals found no safety concerns and clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID19 vaccines in pregnant women. [[81]](#cite_note-cdc-pregnancy-84) Real-world observations through the CDC v-safe tracking program have not uncovered unusual numbers of adverse events or outcomes of interest. [[82]](#cite_note-85) Based on the results of a preliminary study, the US CDC recommends that pregnant women get vaccinated with the COVID19 vaccine. [[83]](#cite_note-86) [[84]](#cite_note-87) Adverse effects The [World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization) (WHO) stated that \"the safety data supported a favorable safety profile\" and that the vaccine's AE ( [adverse not suggest any specific safety concerns\". [[64]](#cite_note-who-back-64) The most common adverse events were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, [myalgia](/wiki/Myalgia) (muscle pain), and [arthralgia](/wiki/Arthralgia) (joint pain). [[64]](#cite_note-who-back-64) The US [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) (CDC) has reported [anaphylaxis](/wiki/Anaphylaxis) (a severe allergic reaction) in 2.5 cases per million doses administered and has recommended a 15-minute observation period after injection. [[86]](#cite_note-89) Delayed cutaneous reactions at injection sites resulting in rash-like [erythemas](/wiki/Erythema) have also been observed in rare cases but are not considered serious or contraindications to subsequent vaccination. [[87]](#cite_note-90) The incidence rate for local adverse erythema is about 10.8%, in 1.9% of cases redness may extend to a size of 100 mm or greater. [[36]](#cite_note-EUA_fact_sheet-36) In June 2021, the US CDC confirmed that [myocarditis](/wiki/Myocarditis) or [pericarditis](/wiki/Pericarditis) occurs in about 13 of every 1 million young people, mostly male and over the age of 16, who received the Moderna or the [Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine](/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine). [[88]](#cite_note-91) [[89]](#cite_note-92) Most affected individuals recover quickly with adequate treatment and rest. [[90]](#cite_note-93) Additional side effects include extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb. [[91]](#cite_note-EU_safety_20220803-94) Pharmacology Moderna's technology uses [nanoparticle drug delivery](/wiki/Nanoparticle_drug_delivery) (LNP) system. [[92]](#cite_note-nylj1-95) Once the compound is inside a human cell, the mRNA links up with the cell's [endoplasmic reticulum](/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum). The mRNA-1273 is encoded to trigger the cell into making a specific protein using the cell's normal manufacturing process. The vaccine encodes a version of the spike protein with a modification called 2P, in which the protein includes two stabilizing mutations in which the original amino acids are replaced with [prolines](/wiki/Proline), developed by researchers at the [University of Texas at Austin](/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin) and the [National Institute of and Infectious Diseases](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases)' [Vaccine Research Center](/wiki/Vaccine_Research_Center). [[93]](#cite_note-C&EN092920-96) [[94]](#cite_note-WAPO120620-97) [[95]](#cite_note-2020-NatGeo-98) Once the protein is expelled from the cell, it is eventually detected by the immune system, which begins generating efficacious antibodies. Chemistry The vaccine contains the following ingredients: [[37]](#cite_note-Moderna_COVID-19_Vaccine_FDA_label-37) [[36]](#cite_note-EUA_fact_sheet-36) The active ingredient is an mRNA sequence containing a total of 4101 V987P) designed to stabilize the pre-fusion conformation. The sequence is further optimized by: [[97]](#cite_note-WHO_pINN_125-100) [[98]](#cite_note-jackson-101) - all [uridines](/wiki/Uridine)(U) substituted with [N1-methylpseudouridine](/wiki/N1-methylpseudouridine)(U m1), - flanked by an artificial 5' [untranslated region](/wiki/Untranslated_region)(UTR) and a 3' UTR derived from the human alpha globin gene ( [HBA1](/wiki/HBA1)), - introduction of two additional [stop codons](/wiki/Stop_codon), - terminated by a 3' poly(A) tail. A putative sequence of the vaccine has been published on a [forum](/wiki/Internet_forum) for professional virologists, obtained by direct sequencing of residual vaccine material in used vials. [[99]](#cite_note-102) The vaccine mRNA is dissolved nanoparticles](/wiki/Lipid_nanoparticle) that stabilize the mRNA and facilitate its entry into cells. [[47]](#cite_note-Baden-47) The nanoparticles are manufactured on [contract manufacturing organizations](/wiki/Contract_manufacturing_organization) to scale up its vaccine manufacturing process. The first step of the process\u2014synthesis of DNA [plasmids](/wiki/Plasmid) (to be used as a template for synthesis of mRNA)\u2014has been handled by a contractor called Aldevron based in [Fargo, North Dakota](/wiki/Fargo,_North_Dakota). [[100]](#cite_note-Springer-103) For the remainder of the process, Moderna contracted with [Lonza Group](/wiki/Lonza_Group) to manufacture the vaccine at facilities in [Portsmouth, New Hampshire](/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire) in the United States, and in [Visp](/wiki/Visp) in Switzerland, and purchased the necessary lipid [excipients](/wiki/Excipient) from CordenPharma. [[101]](#cite_note-Mullin-104) Besides CMOs, Moderna also manufactures the vaccine at its own production facility in [Norwood, Massachusetts](/wiki/Norwood,_Massachusetts). [[102]](#cite_note-Cote-105) Another manufacturing site for the vaccines for the market outside the U.S. (since the end of 2021) is in [Geleen](/wiki/Geleen) in the Netherlands, produced by its manufacturing partner [Lonza](/wiki/Lonza_Group). [[103]](#cite_note-106) Earlier, Lonza did produce the vaccine for the EU, U.K. and Canada at its site in Switzerland only, but had to cut projected deliveries to the U.K. and Canada earlier in 2021 due to production issues. [[104]](#cite_note-107) For the tasks of filling and packaging vials ( [fill and finish](/wiki/Fill_and_finish)), Moderna entered into contracts in the United States and Laboratorios Farmac\u00e9uticos Rovi in Spain. [[101]](#cite_note-Mullin-104) In April 2021, Moderna expanded its agreement with Catalent to increase manufacturing output at the latter's plant in [Bloomington, Indiana](/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana). The expansion will allow Catalent to manufacture up to 400 vials per minute and fill an additional 80 million vials per year. [[105]](#cite_note-108) Later that month, Moderna announced its plans to spend billions of dollars to boost production of its vaccines, potentially tripling the output in 2022, claiming as well that it would make no less than 800 million doses in 2021. The increase in production is in part attributed to improvements made by the company in manufacturing methods. [[106]](#cite_note-109) [[107]](#cite_note-110) [[108]](#cite_note-111) The Moderna news followed preliminary results from the [Pfizer](/wiki/Pfizer)- [BioNTech](/wiki/BioNTech) vaccine candidate, [BNT162b2](/wiki/BNT162b2), with Moderna demonstrating similar efficacy, but requiring storage at the temperature of a standard medical refrigerator of 2-8 \u00b0C (36-46 \u00b0F) for up to thirty days or 20 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) for up to four months, whereas the Pfizer-BioNTech candidate requires [ultracold freezer](/wiki/ULT_freezer) storage between 80 and 60 \u00b0C (112 and \u00b0F). [[109]](#cite_note-Vaccination_Storage-112) [[110]](#cite_note-cnbc11-16-113) Low-income countries usually have [cold chain](/wiki/Cold_chain) capacity for only standard refrigerator storage, not ultracold freezer storage. [[111]](#cite_note-114) [[112]](#cite_note-115) In February 2021, the restrictions on the Pfizer vaccine were relaxed when the US [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) updated the emergency use authorization (EUA) to permit undiluted frozen vials of the vaccine to be transported and stored at between 25 and 15 \u00b0C (13 and 5 \u00b0F) for up to two weeks before use. [[36]](#cite_note-EUA_fact_sheet-36) [[113]](#cite_note-116) [[114]](#cite_note-Pfizer_PR_20210219-117) The Moderna vaccine should not be stored at a temperature below 50 \u00b0C (58 \u00b0F). [[115]](#cite_note-118) In November 2020, [Nature](/wiki/Nature_(journal)) reported that \"While it's possible that differences in LNP formulations or mRNA secondary structures could account for the thermostability differences [between Moderna and BioNtech], many experts suspect both vaccine products will ultimately prove to have similar storage requirements and shelf lives under various temperature conditions.\" [[116]](#cite_note-nature1-119) History Original version In January 2020, Moderna announced development of an [RNA vaccine](/wiki/RNA_vaccine), received US$955 Advanced Research and Development Authority](/wiki/Biomedical_Advanced_Research_and_Development_Authority) (BARDA), an office of the [US Department of Health and Human Services](/wiki/US_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services). BARDA funded 100% of the cost of bringing the vaccine to FDA licensure. [[120]](#cite_note-123) [[121]](#cite_note-124) The United States government provided $2.5 billion in total funding for the Moderna COVID19 vaccine (mRNA-1273). [[122]](#cite_note-125) Private donors also made contributions to the vaccine's development. The [Dolly Parton](/wiki/Dolly_Parton) COVID-19 Research Fund contributed $1 million. [[123]](#cite_note-126) Phase I-II clinical trials In March 2020, the [phase I](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_I) human trial of mRNA-1273 began in partnership with the US [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases). [[124]](#cite_note-127) In April, the US [Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority](/wiki/Biomedical_Advanced_Research_and_Development_Authority) (BARDA) allocated up to $483 million for Moderna's vaccine development. [[125]](#cite_note-bigbet-128) Plans for a [phase II](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_II) dosing and efficacy trial to begin in May were approved by the US [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA). [[126]](#cite_note-keown-129) Moderna signed a partnership with Swiss vaccine manufacturer [Lonza Group](/wiki/Lonza_Group), [[127]](#cite_note-130) to supply 300 million doses per annum. [[128]](#cite_note-131) On 25 May 2020, Moderna began a [phase IIa clinical trial](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research) recruiting six hundred adult participants to assess safety and differences in [antibody](/wiki/Antibody) response to two doses of its candidate vaccine, mRNA-1273, a study expected to complete in 2021. [[129]](#cite_note-mod-04405076-132) On 14 July 2020, Moderna scientists published preliminary results of the phase I dose escalation clinical trial of mRNA-1273, showing dose-dependent induction of neutralizing antibodies against S1/S2 as early as 15 days post-injection. Mild to moderate [adverse reactions](/wiki/Adverse_effect), such as [fever](/wiki/Fever), fatigue, headache, [muscle ache](/wiki/Myalgia), and pain at the injection site were observed in all dose groups, but were common with increased dosage. [[98]](#cite_note-jackson-101) The vaccine in low doses was deemed safe and effective in order to advance a [phase III](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) clinical trial using two 100-g doses administered 29 days apart. [[98]](#cite_note-jackson-101) In July 2020, Moderna announced in a preliminary report that its [Operation Warp Speed](/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed) candidate had led to production of [neutralizing antibodies](/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody) in healthy adults in [phase I clinical [[130]](#cite_note-133) \"At the 100-microgram dose, the one Moderna is advancing into larger trials, all 15 patients experienced side effects, including fatigue, chills, headache, muscle pain, and pain at the site of injection.\" [[131]](#cite_note-mhdg-134) The troublesome higher doses were discarded in July from future studies. [[131]](#cite_note-mhdg-134)[ [duplication?](/wiki/Template:Importance_inline)] On 14 September 2021, a study funded by the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases) reported a strong immune response after six months, even at low doses, suggesting that more doses could be deployed from a limited vaccine supply. Six months after low-dose vaccination, 67% of participants still had [memory](/wiki/Memory_T_cell) [cytotoxic T cells](/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell), suggesting that immune memory is stable. The study also found that [cross-reactive](/wiki/Cross-reactivity) T cells acquired during infection with other coronaviruses that cause the common cold increased the response to the vaccine. [[132]](#cite_note-135) [[133]](#cite_note-136) Phase III clinical trials Moderna and the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases) began a phase III trial in the US on 27 July, with a plan to enroll and assign thirty-thousand volunteers to two groups - one group receiving two 100-g doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine and the other receiving a [placebo](/wiki/Placebo) of 0.9% sodium chloride. [[134]](#cite_note-palca-137) As of 7 August, more than 4,500 volunteers had enrolled.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] In September 2020, Moderna published the detailed study plan for the clinical trial. [[135]](#cite_note-138) On 30 September, CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel said that, if the trial is successful, the vaccine might be available to the public as early as late March or early April 2021. [[136]](#cite_note-139) As of October 2020, Moderna had completed the enrollment of 30,000 participants needed for its phase III trial. [[137]](#cite_note-140) The US National Institutes of Health announced on 15 November 2020, that overall trial results were positive. [[138]](#cite_note-141) Since September 2020, Moderna has used [Roche Diagnostics](/wiki/Roche_Diagnostics)' Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test, authorized by the US [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) under an emergency use authorization (EUA) on 25 November 2020. According to an independent supplier of clinical assays in microbiology, \"this will facilitate the quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and help to establish a correlation between vaccine-induced protection and levels of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies.\" The partnership was announced by Roche on 9 December 2020. [[139]](#cite_note-142) A review by the FDA in December 2020, of interim results of the phase III clinical trial on mRNA-1273 showed it to be safe and effective against COVID19 infection resulting in the issuance of an EUA by the FDA. [[140]](#cite_note-nih-eua-143) In February 2021, results from [phase III clinical trial](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) were published in [the New England Journal of Medicine](/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine), indicating 94% [Side effects](/wiki/Side_effect) included flu-like symptoms, as pain at the injection site, fatigue, [muscle pain](/wiki/Myalgia), and headache. [[110]](#cite_note-cnbc11-16-113) The clinical trial is ongoing and is set to conclude in late 2022. [[142]](#cite_note-NCT04470427-145) Pregnant and breastfeeding women were also excluded from the initial trials used to obtain the emergency use authorization, [[143]](#cite_note-146) though trials in those populations were expected to be performed in 2021. [[144]](#cite_note-147) On 16 March 2021, in order to increase the span of vaccination beyond adults, Moderna started the clinical trials of vaccines on children age 6-months to 11-years-old in the US and in Canada (KidCove), [[145]](#cite_note-148) in addition to the existing 12-17 year-olds (TeenCOVE). [[146]](#cite_note-149) of December 2020, the Moderna COVID19 vaccine was under evaluation for emergency authorization or approval by multiple countries which would enable rapid rollout of the vaccine in the United Kingdom, the European Union (EU), Canada, and the United States. [[147]](#cite_note-CNN-150) [[148]](#cite_note-burger-151) [[149]](#cite_note-kuchler-152) [[150]](#cite_note-parsons-153) In December 2020, the Moderna COVID19 vaccine was authorized by the US [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) under an [emergency use authorization](/wiki/Emergency_use_authorization) (EUA) for people aged 18 years of age and older. [[151]](#cite_note-FDA_PR_20201218-154) [[38]](#cite_note-Moderna_COVID-19_Vaccine_FDA_EUA-38) [[140]](#cite_note-nih-eua-143) This is the first product from Moderna that has been authorized by the FDA. [[152]](#cite_note-155) [[153]](#cite_note-pmid33382675-156) In June 2022, the EUA was expanded to include people aged six months through sixteen years of age. [[35]](#cite_note-FDA_PR_20220617-35) In April 2023, the authorization for the original, monovalent, version of the vaccine in the US was withdrawn. [[154]](#cite_note-FDA_20230418-157) [[155]](#cite_note-FDA_PR_20230418-158) As of April 2023, only the bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) version of the vaccine is authorized in the US. [[154]](#cite_note-FDA_20230418-157) [[155]](#cite_note-FDA_PR_20230418-158) On 23 December 2020, the Moderna authorized by [Health 5 January 2021, the Moderna COVID19 vaccine was authorized for use in Israel by its [Ministry of Health](/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Israel)). [[157]](#cite_note-160) On 3 February 2021, the Moderna COVID19 vaccine was authorized for use in Singapore by its [Health Sciences Authority](/wiki/Health_Sciences_Authority). [[158]](#cite_note-161) On 30 April 2021, the [World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization) (WHO) granted emergency use listing. [[159]](#cite_note-162) [[160]](#cite_note-163) On 5 May 2021, the Moderna COVID19 vaccine was authorized for emergency use in the Philippines by the Philippines [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(Philippines)). [[161]](#cite_note-1273-PHapprove-164) In 2020, Moderna partnered with [Takeda Pharmaceutical Company](/wiki/Takeda_Pharmaceutical_Company), Health, Labour and Welfare](/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare) (MHLW). [[162]](#cite_note-165) [[163]](#cite_note-166) Intramuscular Injection (formerly TAK-919) was authorized for emergency use in Japan. [[3]](#cite_note-TakRNA-3) On 29 June 2021, the Moderna COVID19 vaccine was authorized for use in India by the [Drugs Controller General of India](/wiki/Drugs_Controller_General_of_India).
