The American Academy of Pediatrics states that childhood vaccines are 90%-99% effective in preventing diseases. Thimerosal, formaldehyde, and aluminum are common and safe ingredients used in most vaccines. If children are vaccinated now and continue to get vaccinated throughout their lives, parents in the future may be able to trust that some diseases of today will no longer be around to harm their children in the future. Children and families can benefit from the wisdom of grandparents and great-grandparents who remember a time of the polio or measles pandemic, where millions of people were killed. Any medicine or drug that offers an extensive amount of benefits or alleviates pain is undoubtedly going to have some kind of negative side effect. The Center for Disease Control states that all vaccines carry a risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is only common in about one per million children (\"Guardian: Children Continue to Die from Vaccine-preventable Diseases\"). In order to ensure a healthy life, all children should receive vaccinations because vaccines prevent children from contracting deadly diseases, are proctored in a very safe and effective way, and ensure immunity to diseases/illnesses for future generations in the family.
