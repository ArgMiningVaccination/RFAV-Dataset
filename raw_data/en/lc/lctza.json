To remedy sleeplessness, there are some medical treatments available. While these methods can be helpful, there are also several natural remedies to try alongside, or before, seeking medical options. Below, we'll break down some of these treatments, outlining how they can help to promote sleep. Relaxation techniques Meditation The benefits of meditation are manifold. Alongside supporting the reduction of anxiety and other mood disturbances, this simple practice can also ease the body into sleep. Scientifically speaking, meditation lowers your heart rate by awakening the parasympathetic nervous system and encouraging slower breathing, which relaxes you and increases the likelihood of quality sleep.i To allow the body to de-stress, slow down, and unwind, put aside 10 minutes before bed for an easy breathing meditation practice. You can find sleep-based guided meditations online or via an app. Visualisation New research conducted by the University of Oxford found that visualising an environment where you feel calm could have an overwhelmingly positive effect on sleep.ii The theory behind this 'imaginary distraction' is visualising a place that's engaging enough to pull you away from the anxieties and stress in your mind, such as a waterfall, beach or meadow. Essential oils Aromatherapy \u2014 in particular lavender essential oil \u2014 is widely touted for promoting sleep and relaxation. In a 2005 study, researchers revealed that participants who inhaled lavender for two minutes at three, 10-minute intervals before bedtime improved their sleep quality and felt more energised when they woke up.iii Alongside inhalation, you could diffuse lavender essential oil, sprinkle it on your pillow, or add a few drops to a hot bath before bed.

Gratitude journaling Gratitude journaling is another effective tool to help you unwind before bed. Research shows that if you cultivate gratitude throughout the day, you're more likely to have optimistic, happy thoughts as you fall asleep.iv Before sleeping, try writing down three to five things you feel grateful for that day. Nutrition Magnesium Nutrition plays a key role in sleep hygiene. Foods rich in magnesium (bananas, pumpkin seeds, and figs) are especially beneficial for preparing the body for rest. Otherwise known as 'nature's tranquilliser', this potent mineral helps to activate the neurotransmitters responsible for relaxing the body and mind, which can encourage healthy sleeping patterns.v Tryptophan Eating food high in tryptophan can also prime the body for sleep. When the body metabolises tryptophan, it turns into [serotonin and melatonin](https://www.naturesbest.co.uk/pharmacy/sleep-health/melatonin-and-serotonin-how-hormones-help-us-to-fall-asleep/) \u2014 two of the main hormones that facilitate and regulate sleep.vi Rich sources of tryptophan include oats, nuts, and milk. Sugar, alcohol, caffeine, fast food and cheese are [all foods that keep you awake](https://www.naturesbest.co.uk/pharmacy/sleep-health/what-food-and-drink-help-you-sleep/) at night, so avoid consuming them before bed. For nightime nutritional advice, here are 6 foods to help you sleep at night. Herbal Remedies When it comes to herbal remedies for insomnia, there are a number of options available. Theanine & Lemonbalm These nutritional agents have demonstrated enormous promise in soothing anxiety and promoting relaxation \u2014 both of which are vitally important for preparing the body for rest.vii Valerian Root This herb comprises of potent compounds \u2014 isovaleric acid, valerenic acid, and a range of antioxidants \u2014 that both relax and sedate the body, improving sleep quality and quantity and fighting insomnia.viii St John's Wort Traditionally used to manage [low mood](https://www.naturesbest.co.uk/pharmacy/sleep-health/what-is-the-relationship-between-sleep-and-depression/) and [anxiety](https://www.naturesbest.co.uk/pharmacy/sleep-health/can-stress-and-anxiety-affect-sleep/) \u2014 which can aid sleep in its own right as insomnia is often a by-product of these mood disturbances \u2014 St John's Wort supports sleep by influencing the brain chemistry involved in the body's [circadian rhythm](https://www.naturesbest.co.uk/pharmacy/sleep-health/how-to-reset-your-body-clock-understanding-circadian-cycles/) (sleep-wake cycle).ix Behavioural techniques Get up and entertain yourself for 10 minutes If you can't fall asleep within 30-minutes, get out of bed and entertain yourself for 10 minutes with something that requires your head and hands, like a mindfulness colouring exercise. Avoid turning to your phone or using your laptop, as the [blue light](https://www.naturesbest.co.uk/pharmacy/sleep-health/how-does-blue-light-affect-your-sleep/) will only keep you awake for longer. Ultimately, you need to see your bed as a place for sleeping - not a place for worrying, ruminating, and feeling anxious. Cognitive behaviour therapy CBT aims to change the thoughts and behaviours around sleeping habits that often perpetuate sleep difficulties. Often, those with chronic insomnia have deep-rooted misconceptions or emotions about sleep. Therapists use coaching, conversation, and 'homework' to correct these mental blocks. A recent meta-study revealed that CBT is as effective as treating insomnia as sleeping medications.x Your GP can point you in the right direction of finding an appropriate cognitive behavioural therapist. Sleep restriction therapy The premise of this strategy forces the body to sleep during a fixed window and stay awake for the rest of the time, helping to [reset your natural body clock](https://www.naturesbest.co.uk/pharmacy/sleep-health/how-to-reset-your-body-clock-understanding-circadian-cycles/). This routine is designed to restrict sleep, which will lead to tiredness and, ultimately, better sleep quality. For instance, if you normally go to bed at 10.30 pm and wake up at 6.30 pm, but report sleeping for only 6 hours, your new sleep window may start with an 11.30 bedtime and a 5.30 wake-up. There's no quick fix to insomnia \u2014 it simply comes down to finding which method works best for you.
