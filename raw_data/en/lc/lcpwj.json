Having previously brought to light the reality of spiritual translocation\u2014the movement of pathological entities that cause disease\u2014Thoresen now reveals the roots of this phenomenon in pre-history. The corruption of healing methods in both conventional and alternative medical fields harks back to the introduction of the five-element system in traditional medicine. This philosophy was established by the legendary Yellow Emperor\u2014a god of folk religion and the author of the influential book on which Chinese medicine is based. The Yellow Emperor, Thoresen tells us, was the incarnation of a mighty spiritual being whose influence has shone through the centuries. However, this being seeks to deceive humanity. Its maligning ideas are the reason most diseases\u2014as well as the demonic entities that cause them\u2014are translocated, causing further suffering. Are Thoresen describes his past life as the foremost healer in the court of Yu the Great, two thousand years before the birth of Christ. The emperor\u2014overshadowed by a powerful entity\u2014ultimately becomes dissatisfied with his chief medical adviser and plots his demise. The Lucifer Deception presents this gripping narrative as well as offering profound spiritual insights into illness and healing in the present time.
