The idea of this natural treatment is that there are patterns of energy flow all throughout the body, which are crucial for optimal health. You get sick because there are interferences in said flow and acupuncture corrects these disproportions at specific points. We often get asked \"what can acupuncture help me with?\" The following may pleasantly surprise you. 1. Your Immune System Seeing an acupuncturist monthly (for treatment of course) has been shown to increase the amount of white blood cells that your body creates. When your white blood cells increase, your body's immune system naturally gets a boost. Stress can greatly affect how your body fights off infections. Acupuncture can reduce stress and in turn boost your immune system. Not to mention, many find acupuncture relaxing. It can be a nice time out from the hustle and bustle of life, especially for those of you who commute to and from Ocean County to New York City for work! 2. Weight Loss Sitting at a desk can make it tough to lose weight. However, combining acupuncture with a traditional weight loss plan has been shown to help people lose more weight. This is a safe way to help people reach reasonable weight loss goals and it can also cut down on bloating. 3. Sleep Those who receive acupuncture to help with sleep problems have found that it has helped them fall asleep faster and stay asleep. Many who get acupuncture treatment report waking up less throughout the night. This happens due to increased amounts of melatonin that is produced with treatment. 4. Pain The most common symptom that acupuncture is known to help is pain. Studies have shown that it has helped back, neck and shoulder pain, arthritis, and carpal tunnel. Acupuncture has been proven to help with chronic pain, more specifically. Sounds better than taking pain pills, doesn't it? 5. Smoking, and Not Doing it Quitting smoking is one of the toughest habits to break. Acupuncture helps to detoxify your body of the addicting toxins that smoking can leave behind. You know, those toxins that make you addicted. It also stops jitters, reduces cravings, decreases irritability, and increases relaxation. Alternatives such as [Disposable vape kits](https://www.mycigara.com/collections/disposable-vape) are also incredibly beneficial in curbing the smoking habit. Interested in learning more?
