Like its predecessor, it is a relatively easy-to-use tool for qualitatively evaluating the condition of aquatic ecosystems associated with wadeable streams, that is, those shal - low enough to be sampled without use of a boat. Such wadeable streams include those modified to improve drainage on agricultural lands, especially if these systems are part of an ecologically functional stream and/or river network. While the protocol does not require users to be experts in aquatic ecology, it does require they read the protocol's user guidance thoroughly before beginning an assessment. The SVAP and SVAP2 are tools that work best when users first identify local stream reference conditions that can effectively provide a standard for comparison. State offices are encouraged to refine the protocol based on the physical settings, stream conditions, and life history requirements of aquatic fauna found in their specific locales. Additional guidance on how to make State modifications is provided in ap - pendix C. Both versions of the SVAP provide a relatively basic level of ecological assessment based on qualitative descriptions. Each is designed to give a snapshot of wadeable stream ecosystem conditions that allows planners and conservationists to assist landowners with determining the quality of stream habitats located on their property. SVAP2 was developed to provide more comprehensive descriptions of several scoring elements, namely, channel condition, hydrological alteration, riparian area conditions, and fish habitat complexity. Field conservationists are encouraged to use SVAP2 in those situations where more detail is needed to critically score these ele - ments and their relative contribution to the condition of the stream. This version lends itself to tracking trends in stream conditions over time, as well as identifying resource concerns and their potential causes. The origi - nal SVAP is designed to be conducted with the landowner. SVAP2 can be completed with a landowner or conservation planning team. Background information relevant to ecological processes and functions of stream/ripar - ian ecosystems is incorporated into both versions of the SVAP .PrefaceNational Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-ii (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)614-iii (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)This version of the Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP) was devel - oped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the leadership of Kathryn Boyer , fish biologist, West National Technology Support Center, Portland, OR.

The majority of the Nation's streams and rivers are small, often with intermittent flows and, yet, they constitute a close multidimensional linkage between land and water management. These smaller streams and rivers are increasingly a focus of Natural Resources Conserva - tion Service (NRCS) assistance to landowners. This protocol is developed for relatively small streams, be they perennial or intermittent. If the stream can be sampled during low flow or seasonally wet periods of the year without a boat, it can be assessed using the SVAP . Although this protocol has been developed for use nationwide, its authors recognize the importance of regional differences in influencing stream condi - tions. The NRCS thus encourages modification and calibration of the national protocol's scoring elements, if needed, to achieve greater sensitivity to resource conditions at State and regional levels. Thus, version 2 (SVAP2) can be viewed as a national framework for States to revise or amend, if necessary, to better assess local stream and riparian conditions. Guidance for such modifications is provided in appendix C. The SVAP2 protocol can be successfully applied by conservationists with limited training in biology, geomorphology, or hydrology. Since publication of the initial version of the SVAP , the protocol has taken on broader applications as a tool to evaluate quality criteria for conservation planning, establish eligibil - ity for Farm Bill programs, identify potential resource concerns, and assess trends in stream and riparian conditions over time. Consequently, NRCS State Offic - es have played a large role in modifying the protocol, updating training materials, and transferring SVAP2 technology to the field. States should continue with such efforts and also pay close attention to achieving consistency in how the protocol is applied within their States and in adjacent States. It is less critical that a particular assessment discern between a score of 5 or 6 with subtle subjective differences than it is that the protocol be interpreted and applied consistently, year-to-year by multiple users. Consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness can be gained by collaborating closely with local users and those in other States within the region. NRCS State Offices are encouraged to contact appropriate National Technology Support Center (NTSC) specialists regarding refinement of this SVAP2's scoring criteria to more accurately reflect local conditions. NTSC specialists can also assist with coordinating regional training to improve understand - ing of the methodology and consistency in use of the SVAP2. The SVAP2 is a preliminary qualitative assessment tool to evaluate features that affect overall stream condi - tions at the property level. The tool assesses visually apparent physical, chemical, and biological features within a specified reach of a stream corridor. Because of its qualitative nature, the protocol may not detect all causes of resource concerns, especially if such causes are a result of land use actions in other parts of the watershed. It does provide a means to assess site conditions in the context of the larger watershed. A synthesis of information gathered during the prelimi - nary assessment and field assessment portions of the protocol can be used to provide general guidance to landowners on how watershed features and practices they employ are reflected in the quality of their stream ecosystems. Subpart B Conservation Planning Part 614 Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-2 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)614.01 What is a healthy stream? A stream's watershed captures precipitation, filters and stores water, and regulates its release through the stream channel network and eventually into a lake, another watershed, or an estuary and the ocean. Watersheds are characterized by different climates, geomorphic features, soil types, vegetation, and land uses. Their upland features control the quantity and timing of water and materials that make their way overland and into a stream system. The environmental conditions of a stream or river corridor (such as water quantity and quality, riparian and flood plain function, and habitat quality) are thus linked to the entire wa - tershed. These linkages affect stream processes that act vertically, laterally, longitudinally, and over time. Land managers may have little control of watershed management beyond their property lines or jurisdic - tional boundaries. Nevertheless, activities that occur in many individual farm fields, rangelands, or pastures can have cumulative impacts on the condition of an individual landowner's stream and those downstream. Sound watershed and stream corridor management are important for maintaining stream conditions that allow the stream to be resilient and resistant to natu - ral disturbance and human-caused perturbations. The natural resilience of a stream to recover from floods, fire, and drought is an indicator that it is healthy (Meyer 1997). Streams, their flood plains, and adjacent riparian areas are complex ecosystems where numerous biological, physical, and chemical processes interact (Cushing and Allen 2001). Changes in any one feature or process in a stream ecosystem have cascading effects through - out the stream as it flows downstream and as its flows change with seasonal shifts in precipitation. Stream processes are interconnected, and these connections maintain a balance of materials that are transported and deposited by the stream, including sediment, water, wood, and nutrients. If conditions change, these processes must readjust to keep the stream resilient and functional for energy and material transport and aquatic fauna and flora. The conditions of a stream reflect current and past land uses and management ac - tions. As such, they can also help predict future trends of watershed land use and conditions.Multiple factors affect stream conditions and, there - fore, stream quality (fig. 1). For example, increased nu - trient loads alone may not cause a visual change to a forested stream, but when combined with tree removal and channel widening, the result may shift the energy dynamics from a community based on leaf litter inputs to one based on algae and aquatic plants. The result - ing chemical changes caused by photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic plants coupled with temperature increases due to loss of canopy cover will alter the aquatic community . Many stream processes are in delicate balance. For example, the force of the streamflow, amount of sedi - ment, and stream features that slow or hasten flow must be in relative balance to prevent channel incision or bank erosion. Increases in sediment loads beyond the capacity of the stream to transport them down - stream can lead to extensive deposition of sediments and channel widening. Lastly, the biological community of a stream also affects its overall condition. As indicators of biologi - cal integrity fish, aquatic invertebrates, and all other members of a stream's community portray a pattern of stream condition that further enhances our abil - ity to detect concerns. For example, the prevalence of exotic species in a fish assemblage of a particular stream often indicates deterioration in stream function or quality. While beyond the scope of the SVAP2, such indices of biological integrity provide an even more comprehensive picture of a stream ecosystem's condi - tion (Giller and Malmqvist 1998; Matthews 1998). Stream corridors benefit from complex and diverse physical structure. Such complexity increases chan - nel roughness that dissipates the energy of water and reduces its erosive power. Structural complexity is provided by channel form (meanders, pools, riffles, backwaters, wetlands), profile (stream gradient, width, and depth), materials that have fallen into the chan - nel (trees and bank material), overhanging vegetation, roots extending into the flow, and streambed materials (sand, gravel, rocks, and boulders). The movement of these materials and the path of flow form pools, riffles, backwaters, side channels, flood plain wetlands, and many other types of habitats. Thus, streams with com - plex flood plains and a diversity of structural features generally support a higher diversity of aquatic species 614-3 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 Figure 1 Factors that influence the quality or condition of streams (modified from Karr et al.

Chemical pollution of streams and rivers diminishes stream health and harms aquatic species. The major categories of chemical pollutants are oxygen-deplet - ing sources such as manure, ammonia, and organic wastes; nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from both fertilizers and animal wastes; acids from mining or industrial effluents; and contaminants such as pesticides, salts, metals, and pharmaceuticals. It is important to note that the effects of many chemicals depend on multiple factors. For example, an increase in the pH caused by excessive algal plant growth may cause an otherwise safe concentration of ammonia to become toxic. Finally, it is important to recognize that healthy, resil - ient streams, riparian areas, and flood plains operate as a connected stream corridor system. Lateral ex - change of water and materials between a stream and its flood plain is the driving force for nutrient dynam - ics in the stream corridor community. Primary produc - tivity of flood plain habitats is closely tied to hydrope - riod, or the length of time the flood plain is inundated or saturated with water. Productivity is greatest in wet - lands with pulsed flooding (periodic inundation and drying) and high nutrient input and lower in drained or permanently flooded conditions. Flood plains and their associated wetlands play a critical role in the health of the stream itself. An example would be the removal of nitrogen (denitrification) in floodwaters by flood plain wetlands (Forshay and Stanley 2005). Riparian wetlands may also influence stream channel morphology and flows, buffering the stream channel against the physical effects of high flows by dissipat - ing energy as waters spread out onto the flood plain. In many instances, these flood plains provide refuge habitat for aquatic species, especially during flood events. As streamflows recede, riparian wetlands provide water storage, slowly releasing water and aquatic organisms back to the stream through surface and subsurface transport, thereby influencing stream baseflows during drier times of the year. In summary, physical, chemical, and biological ele - ments that influence stream conditions also provide indicators of how well a stream is functioning and responding to natural disturbances (floods) or hu -man actions (land clearing). A stream corridor that maintains key ecological and physical functions over time is a healthy, resilient ecosystem that can support diverse communities of aquatic species. 614-5 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614.02 Stream classifica - tion A healthy stream will look and function differently de - pending on its location or ecological setting. A moun - tain stream that flows through a narrow valley over a shale bedrock bottom is very different from a stream that flows through a wide valley over alluvial deposits. Similarly, coastal streams are different from piedmont streams and desert canyon streams. Accurately classi - fying the type of stream in an area of interest is impor - tant to assessing the current condition, or health, of that particular stream. Stream classification is a way to account for the effects of natural variation in streams and helps avoid comparing the conditions of streams of different classes. A stream's classification provides a point of reference for subsequent assessments that may occur at the site. Ideally, a separate SVAP modifi - cation should be developed for each stream class, but realistically, this is not possible. At best, States should identify only as many stream classes as are necessary to account for natural variation in streams caused by the prevailing environmental influences of their region. Some important factors to consider are major land re - source areas (MLRA) or ecoregion, drainage area, and gradient. Ecoregions are geographic areas in which ecosystems are expected to be similar. Drainage area is the size of the area of a watershed (catchment or basin). Gradient is the slope of a stream. For example, an SVAP2 modification may be warranted for low gradient, wadeable streams of the northern Piedmont of North Carolina. References regarding stream clas - sification can be found in appendix A. NRCS State Offices are responsible for SVAP2 modifi - cations. Because there are many stream classification systems, States should select the one most suitable to their ecoregion and decide the scale at which their SVAP2 will be modified or refined (for all stream classes within the State, for all stream classes within an ecoregion of the State, or for several stream classes within an ecoregion). Enough up-front work should be done by State Offices in tailoring the protocol to permit field offices to use it without further modifica - tion. This includes refining and evaluating the pro - tocol, modifying the element criteria and scoring to reflect local conditions, and delineating the geographic bound aries for its intended use. 614.03 Reference sites One of the most difficult challenges associated with evaluating a stream's quality or existing condition is the determination of historic and potential condi - tions. An accurate assessment of the stream requires a benchmark of, or reference to, what a healthy stream in the targeted ecoregions should look like. It is often assumed that historic conditions of streams were healthy or resilient after disturbances. However, it is unrealistic to expect that all stream systems can potentially be as resilient as they were prior to exten - sive land use activity. In such cases, land managers often identify a benchmark condition that reflects the least impaired conditions of the ecoregion. Under this scenario, the SVAP2 would be adapted to reflect the stream corridor conditions to which managers are aspiring to. Reference sites represent the range of conditions that potentially exist for a particular class of stream. Least impaired reference sites represent the best condi - tions attainable, and most impaired reference sites the worst. One challenge in selecting least impaired refer - ence sites is that there are few streams left, especially in agricultural landscapes, that have not been influ - enced by human actions. Accessible, least impaired reference sites are important not only because they define a benchmark for attainable conditions, but they also serve as demonstration areas for field staff to observe the characteristics of the region's best streams that would result in the highest possible SVAP2 scores. A common pitfall in reference site selection is the fail - ure to survey a wide enough area to find sites that are truly least impaired and are representative of an entire class of stream. Another common problem, particular - ly in highly altered landscapes, is the failure to identify sites that are most impaired. In addition to setting the lower bar of the stream health gradient, most impaired sites provide a clear illustration of how streams are not supposed to look and serve as models for improve - ment actions. Remember, reference sites should rep - resent an entire stream class and thus may be located in another county or State. Therefore, it helps if they can be identified at a State or higher level and with the help of State agencies that may have already estab - lished reference sites that represent a full range of human perturbations for a given class of stream. National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-6 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)614.04 Using this protocol This protocol is intended for use in the field with the landowner. Conducting the assessment with the landowner provides an opportunity to discuss natural resource concerns and conservation opportunities. Be - fore leaving the office to assess a stream, a preliminary assessment of watershed features should be conduct - ed in the field office. The Stream Visual Assessment Summary Sheet (exhibit 1) provides a standardized form for recording information and data collected during both the preliminary and field portions of the assessment. (a) Preliminary assessment of the stream's watershed Become familiar with watershed conditions before going to the assessment site. Stream con - ditions are influenced by the entire watershed including uplands that surround the assessment site. Changes in upland conditions can change the discharge, timing, or duration of streamflow events that affect stream conditions. Aerial pho - tographs, topographic maps, stream gages, and any other source of data available can be used to obtain information about watershed conditions before conducting the SVAP2 on a stream. State agencies, watershed groups, local landowners, and Federal land managers are likely to already have documented relevant information about watershed conditions. Ecoregion descriptions, size of the watershed (drainage area) and upland practices often explain conditions at the assess - ment site and are helpful for addressing some of the elements in SVAP2. Gather land use information about the water - shed to provide a context for the stream to be assessed and a better understanding of the condi - tions at the site. For example, road crossings and water control structures may prevent movement of aquatic species. Mining, agriculture, and ur - banization all influence water quality and quan - tity, as well as stream corridor condition. Review available water resource information for the watershed and stream reach. Water con - trol structures and/or activities outside of the assessment reach may be affecting streamflow. Ask the landowner if he or she is aware of up - stream withdrawals (surface diversions or pump stations), drains, or any features that affect the amount of instream flow during the year. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Surf Your Watershed Web site ( http://www.epa. gov/surf ) is also a good source of information. Consult the State fish and wildlife agency re- garding stream and riparian species likely to be present in the reach and whether fish passage to or from the area is limited. Become familiar with potential riparian plant species and community types appropriate to the area to be assessed. (b) Delineating the assessment reach Assess one or more representative reaches, evaluate conditions on both sides of the stream, and indicate left and right bank conditions looking downstream. A reach is a length of stream with relatively consistent gradient and channel form. An assessment reach for this protocol is, at a minimum, a length of stream equal to 12 times the bankfull channel width . Longer reaches may be appropriate, depending on the objec - tives of the assessment. Bankfull channel width is the stream width at the bankfull discharge, or flow rate that forms and con - trols the shape and size of the active channel. Bankfull discharge or bankfull flow is the flow rate at which the stream begins to move onto its active flood plain, if one is present. On average, the bankfull discharge occurs every 1.5 to 2 years, depending on local stream channel and weather conditions. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between baseflow (low flow), bankfull flow, and the flood plain. Bankfull width is determined by locating the first flat depositional surface occurring above the bed of the stream. The lowest elevation at which the bankfull sur - face could occur is at the top of the point bars or other sediment deposits in the channel bed. These generally occur on the inside of the meanders (white part of the figure 2). Other indicators of bankfull elevation include a break in slope on the bank, vegetation changes or ex - posed roots, a change in the particle size of bank mate - rial, and wood or small debris left from high waters. In 614-7 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 temperate areas of the country, vegetation can grow into depositional bars below some bankfull indicators. Therefore, look for signs of well-established vegeta - tion at the elevation level with the top of point bars to help identify bankfull stage.

USDA General Technical Report (RM-245): 61. Often the stream length within the landowner's prop - erty boundaries is shorter than the minimum length needed to adequately determine conditions using the SVAP2. If permission is received to cross property boundaries, it is appropriate to do so to evaluate an adequate length of the stream. If crossing property boundaries is not an option, the assessment reach length will be the length that is within the property boundaries. When large sections of stream are to be assessed and there are constraints that prohibit assess - ing the entire stream length, representative reaches of the stream on the property should be subsampled. Using aerial photographs, topographic maps, and various stream classification methods, streams can be stratified into smaller units (stream reaches) that share common physical characteristics such as stream gradient and average bankfull width. The degree of Figure 2 Baseflow, bankfull, and flood plain locations (Rosgen 1996) BankfullInside of meander Bankfull BaseflowBaseflowNational Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-8 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)stratification will depend on the reason for assess - ing the stream. If simply providing an opportunity for the landowner to learn about the general conditions of the stream, perhaps only one reach is assessed. If the SVAP2 is being conducted to identify potential improvement actions, the entire stream within the property should be assessed. SVAP2 scores can then be used as a preliminary and qualitative evaluation of conditions. Low scores likely indicate more quantita - tive assessments of geomorphic, hydrological, and biological features of the stream corridor are needed to determine what stressors are causing the problems identified. Quantitative assessments should only be completed by trained specialists (stream ecologists, hydrologists, geomorphologists, hydraulic engineers) to assure the complex features influencing stream con - ditions are being evaluated as accurately as possible. If there are several stream types (reaches) within the property, multiple stream visual assessments should be completed, one for each reach. Regardless of the situation, the SVAP2 requires field personnel to score four elements based upon the entire length of the stream that is within a single landowner's property. These are: riparian area quantity, riparian area quality, canopy cover, and barriers to aquatic species move - ment. (c) Scoring the elements of the Stream Visual Assessment Protocol The SVAP2 ideally should be completed during base - flows when habitat feature limitations are likely to be most visible. Each assessment element is scored with a value of zero to 10. Some of the 16 elements, for example, salinity, may not be relevant to the stream being assessed. Score only those elements appropriate to the ecological setting of the stream. Livestock or hu - man waste should be scored in all reach assessments. Background information is provided for each assess - ment element, as well as a description of what to look for. Using Part 2B of the Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Summary Sheet, record the score that best fits the observations made in the assessment reach. Base observations on the descriptions in the matrix provided for each element assessed. Assign a score that applies to the conditions observed in the assess - ment reach. If the conditions of the stream fit de -scriptions that occur in more than one column of the matrix, score the element based on the lower valued descriptions. For example, when scoring the element hydrological alteration, if bankfull flows occur accord - ing to the natural flow regime (score 10-9 column), but there is a water control structure present (score 8-7 column), assign the score based on the lowest scoring indicator present within the reach, which in this case would be an 8 or 7. Again, evaluate conditions on both sides of the stream, and note left bank and right bank conditions while looking downstream. The complete assessment is recorded on the summary sheet, which consists of two principal sections: Pre - liminary Watershed Assessment and Field Assessment. Section 1 records basic information about the water - shed and reach such as drainage area, location, and land uses. Space is provided for a description of the reach, which may be useful to locate the reach or illustrate problem areas. On the worksheet, indicate tributaries, presence of drainage ditches, and irriga - tion ditches; note springs and ponds that drain to the stream; include road crossings, and note whether they are fords, culverts, or bridges. Section 2 is used to record the scores for up to 16 assessment elements. Score an element by compar - ing the observations to the descriptions provided. If matching descriptions is difficult, try to compare what is being observed to the conditions at reference sites for the area. Again, some of the elements may not be applicable to the site and, therefore, should not be included in the assessment. The overall assess - ment score is determined by adding the values for each element and dividing by the number of elements assessed. For example, if the scores add up to 76 and 12 assessment elements were used, the overall assess - ment value would be 6.3, which is classified as FAIR. This value provides a numerical score of the environ - mental condition of the stream reach. This value can be used as a general statement about the state of the environment of the stream or (over time) as an indica - tor of trends in condition.614-9 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614.05 Stream assessment elements (a) Element 1\u2014Channel condi - tion Description and rationale for assessing chan - nel condition The shape of a stream channel changes constantly, im - perceptibly, or dramatically, depending on the condi - tion of the stream corridor (channel, riparian area, and flood plain) and how it transports water and materials. Channel condition is a description of the geomorphic stage of the channel as it adjusts its shape relative to its flood plain. Channel adjustments resulting in a dra - matic drop in streambed elevation (incision or degra - dation) or excessive deposition of bedload that raises the bed elevation (aggradation) affect the degree of bank shear and often decrease stream channel stabil - ity. Such channel adjustments can have substantial effects on the condition of streams, adjacent riparian areas, associated habitats, and their biota. For ex - ample, the greater the incision in a channel, the more it is separated from its flood plain, both physically and ecologically. Conversely, the greater the aggradation, the wider and shallower a stream becomes, which can affect riparian vegetation, surface water temperatures, and stream and riparian habitat features. Conceptual models of how a channel evolves or ad - justs over time illustrate the sequence of geomorphic changes in a stream that result from disturbances in the watershed. Such sequences are useful for evalu - ating trends in channel condition. The stages of the Schumm Channel Evolution Model (CEM), as shown in figure 3, provide a visual orientation of the pattern of streambed adjustment in an incising stream, its gradual detachment from the existing flood plain, and eventual formation of a new flood plain at a lower elevation. A similar model by Simon (1989) is also de - scribed in the Stream Corridor Restoration Handbook (FISRWG 1998) available in most NRCS field offices. Stage I channels are generally stable and have fre - quent interaction with their flood plains. The relative stability of the streambed and banks is due to the fact that the stream and its flood plain are connected, and flooding occurs at regular intervals (Q2). Consequently, the stream's banks and flood plain are well vegetated. Depositional areas (bars), if present, form a gradual transition into the active flood plain, as shown by the arrow in figure 4.

Typically excellent channel condi - tion with natural bank protection National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-10 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)Land use activities that increase runoff, such as land- clearing, paving, or channel straightening, often result in channel incision processes characteristic of stage II in channel evolution. The height of the banks increases due to downcutting of the channel, and the stream and flood plain have less frequent interaction. Bank vegeta - tion becomes stressed, and banks are prone to failure. Once failures begin, the channel widening of stage III begins. A stage II channel is typically narrower at the bed relative to the depth (often referred to as low width-to-depth ratio) than a stage III channel. A stage II channel is in an active downward trend in condition and active headcuts are often present (fig. 5). During stage III, bank failures increase the formation of bars located next to the now relatively vertical banks. In stage III, alternating point bars are typically forming on opposite banks adjacent to vertical banks (fig. 6). Channel widening continues until the stream bed is wide enough to disperse streamflows and slow the water, beginning stage IV in channel evolution. Bank vegetation loss continues. During stage IV, sediments begin to build up in the channel instead of moving downstream, aggrading the bed. Eventually, vegetation begins to establish in the sediment deposited along the edge of the stream, cre - ating channel roughness and further slowing the flow. An early stage IV channel indicates relatively poor conditions, while a late stage IV channel indicates an Figure 7 CEM Stage V channel, with developing flood plain (left) and abandoned flood plain, now a terrace, behind trees on right side of streamimproving trend in channel condition. At this stage, the stream has become more sinuous. Alternating bar features are apparent. Stage V begins when a new flood plain begins to form. Early in stage V, bank vegetation may not be fully established, and some bank erosion is likely. In a late stage V, the original active flood plain from stage I is now a high terrace, and the evolution of a stage I channel begins, with a new flood plain developing at a lower elevation than the terrace (fig. 7).

In areas where heavy vegetation occurs naturally due to higher annual pre - cipitation, eroded banks and slightly incised channels may be masked and consequently harder to observe. In these areas, try to observe bank features from a location near the channel bed.

Excessive streambank failure and lateral migration (the process of a stream shifting from side to side within a valley or other confinement) often result in wider and shallower channels unable to transport sediments downstream. Excessive channel filling occurs when a stream channel can no longer transport both the size and load of sediments associat - ed with the watershed runoff conditions. Streams with no pools that previously had pools and riffles are most likely aggraded. Stream segments that are excessively wide and shallow with multiple center bars are often aggraded. Streams that once maintained single- or dual-threaded channel patterns, but have converted to a braided system (three or more channels at bankfull discharge), are typically aggraded. Excessively ag - graded systems are unstable and channel adjustments from side to side can be rapid. Channel is aggrading. The streambed appears to be filling with sediment faster than it can be transported downstream. Deposits appear over- steepened and unstable, as in figure 21.

Scores of less than 5 for channel condition may indicate substantial channel adjust - ments are occurring and a quantitative assessment by well-trained specialists is warranted.(b) Element 2\u2014Hydrologic alter - ation Description and rationale for assessing hydro - logic alteration Hydrologic alteration is the degree to which hydrol - ogy and streamflow conditions differ from natural, unregulated flow patterns. Streamflow regime affects the distribution and abundance of stream species and influences the health of streams through several physical and chemical processes (Allan 1995; Poff et al. 1997). Naturally occurring daily and annual flow variations provide ecological benefits to flood plain ecosystems and the aquatic and terrestrial organisms that depend upon them (Poff and Ward 1989). With respect to fish, natural streamflow variations provide cues for spawning, egg hatching, rearing, and swim - ming to off-channel flood plain habitats for feeding or reproduction and upstream or downstream migration (Junk et al. 1989). The full range of streamflow at any point in a given wa - tershed is essential in maintaining the complex physi - cal and biological structures and functions of a stream corridor. The geometry, composition, and appearance of a stream channel and its adjacent flood plain are largely the result of fluvial processes that govern a dy - namic equilibrium between streamflow, the materials it carries, and riparian vegetation (Lane 1955; Leopold et al. 1964). Bankfull and higher flows are important factors that control stream channel shape and function and maintain physical habitat for animals and plants (Wolman and Miller 1960). Generally, bankfull flow occurs every 1 to 2 years in unregulated alluvial rivers (Wolman and Leopold 1957) and lasts for only a few days each year. However, numerous researchers have recorded bankfull flow return intervals greater than 2 years (Williams 1978), especially in arid and semiarid settings such as in the southwestern United States (Wolman and Gerson 1978). Conversely, in regions dominated by frequent, prolonged rainfall, bankfull flow can occur once or twice yearly. Consequently, the 2-year event should be considered as only a coarse estimate of bankfull flow. The reader is encouraged to seek additional assistance when working in streams where streamflow is generated by monsoonal precipi - tation or other extreme climatic events or affected by significant flow regulation because of upstream reser - voirs, pump plants, or diversions.National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-18 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)Water and land management practices that alter the timing, duration, magnitude, frequency, or rate of change of streamflow patterns can substantially alter riparian and instream habitat along regulated stream reaches (Calow and Petts 1994). Water withdrawals, watershed and flood plain development, agricultural or wastewater effluents, and practices that change sur - face runoff (dikes and levees) or subsurface drainage (tile drainage systems) affect the amount and quality of water in a stream channel across the water year. The effects of water withdrawals on aquatic resources and stream condition can usually be readily observed (especially during low-flow periods). However, aug - menting streamflow with irrigation runoff or stormwa -ter from municipal areas also often results in adverse physical and biological impacts. For example, the total runoff volume from a 1-acre parking lot is about 16 times that produced by an undeveloped acre of meadow (Schueler 1994). Additionally, peak discharge, velocity, and time of concentration also increase significantly when natural landscapes are replaced by impervious surfaces (Booth 1990). Further, runoff introduces pollutants to waterways and often results in rapid physical deterioration and aquatic community changes (Booth and Jackson 1997). Finally, heavy grazing and clearcutting often have similar, although typically less severe, effects (Platts 1991; Jones and Grant 1996). What to look for Ask the landowner about the frequency of bank - full, overbank, and low flows, referring to figure 2 as needed. Be cautious\u2014water in an adjacent field does not necessarily indicate natural flood - ing. The water may have flowed overland from a low spot in the bank outside the assessment reach or be an artifact of irrigation or drainage management. Look for indicators that help identify bankfull stage (refer to channel condition element). If there is newly deposited debris (leaves and branches) or unvegetated mineral sediments (mud lines, sands, and silts) near the edge of the active channel, it is very likely that bankfull or higher flows have occurred in recent months. If channel bars are present, inspect the type and general age of vegetation.

An absence of vegetation on bars could be interpreted in the same manner, unless the stream is braided (three or more channels with excessive sand, gravel and/or cobble substrates and a notable lack of permanent vegetation) and/or streamflow is sig - nificantly regulated. Evidence of flooding includes high water marks, such as water stain lines, sediment deposits, or stream debris, well above the stream channel. Look for these on streambanks, trees, rocks, or other structures such as bridge pilings or cul - verts. Water control structures are any feature that alters streamflow. Examples commonly include stream surface intakes (pump stations, flash - board or full-round risers, drop pipes, stop log structures, screw or flap gate structures), stream - side infiltration galleries or ring wells, diversions, dikes, or dams (both temporary and permanent). Any water control structures that divert wa - ter directly out of a stream should be suitably screened to prevent entrapment or capture of fish. (c) Element 3\u2014Bank condition Description and rationale for assessing bank condition Stable streambanks are essential components of functional physical habitat and unimpaired biological communities. An excess of fine sediment in streams impacts aquatic species assemblages (Waters 1995) and results in significant water quality impacts with se - vere economic consequences (Pons 2003). Simon et al. (2000) found that unstable streambanks can contribute as much as 85 percent of the total sediment yield in an entire watershed. Severely unstable streambanks can result in the loss of valuable farmland, force changes in water tables, and endanger transportation infra - structure and other flood plain features. Bank erosion is a natural mechanism in alluvial rivers, cannot be totally eradicated and provides important physical and ecological functions to the evolution of stream channels and flood plains (Wolman and Leo - pold 1957; Hooke and Redmond 1992). Excessive bank erosion usually occurs where riparian areas are de - graded or when a stream is unstable because of chang - es in land management practices, hydrology, sediment dynamics, or isolation from its flood plain. Bank failures are generally attributed to the interaction of fluvial and gravitational forces (Thorne 1982)\u2014high, steep banks with undercutting occurring at the base of the slopes are very prone to erosion or collapse. A healthy riparian corridor with a well-vegetated flood plain contributes to bank stability. The roots of some perennial grasses, sedges, and woody vegetation can help hold bank soils together and physically protect the bank from scour during bankfull and higher flow events. Therefore, the type of vegetation covering streambanks is an important component of bank stability. For example, many trees, shrubs, sedges, and rushes have the type of root masses capable of withstanding high streamflow events, while Kentucky bluegrass does not. Further, native riparian vegetation generally provides better erosion resistance and bank stability than invasive species (Tickner et al. 2001). Finally, surface and subsurface soil types also influ - ence bank stability. For example, banks with a thin soil cover over gravel or sand are more prone to collapse than are banks with deep, cohesive soil layers. Score each bank individually and average the total to report a single, composite bank condition score. National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-20 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009) What to look for Evaluate the entire length of all banks along the assessment reach, and then consider the propor - tion of unstable to stable banks. Obviously, if a quantifiable portion of the reach shows signs of accelerated erosion or bank failures, bank stabil - ity is a problem and should be scored as such. Conversely, if the majority of the reach shows minimal erosion and no signs of bank failure, bank stability is likely good. Finally, it is best to score this element during the summer or when - ever flows in the assessment reach are low. Signs of erosion and possible bank stability prob - lems include unvegetated stretches, exposed tree roots, and scalloped edges (sections of eroded bank between relatively intact sections). When observing banks from within the active channel or below bankfull elevation, look for piping holes, rills, and or gullies. Each of these concentrated flow paths is associated with even - tual bank stability problems or outright failures. Look for tension cracks while walking along streambanks. Tension cracks will appear as verti - cal fissures or crevices running along the top of the streambank roughly parallel to the flow. Evidence of construction, vehicular, or animal paths near banks or grazing areas leading di - rectly to the water's edge suggest conditions that may lead to bank collapse. Sections of streambank lying instream adjacent to existing banks are a telltale sign of active bank erosion and instability.

Riparian vegetation thrives on the moisture provided by streamflow and ground water associated with the stream corridor. Ri - parian areas may or may not include flood plains and associated wetlands, depending on the valley form of the stream corridor. For example, steep mountainous streams in narrow V-shaped valleys often do not have obvious flood plains. Riparian areas are among the most biologically diverse habitats of landscapes and are sources of wood, leaves, and organic matter for the stream. These areas provide important habitat and travel corridors for numerous plants, insects, amphib - ians, birds, and mammals. Ecological processes that occur in the stream corridor are linked to those in uplands via intact riparian areas and flood plains, if present. Riparian areas themselves also provide valuable functions that maintain or im - prove stream and flood plain conditions. The capacity for riparian areas to sustain these functions depends in part on the quality and quantity of the riparian vegeta - tion and how it interacts with the stream ecosystem. The quality of the riparian area increases with the width, complexity, and linear extent of its vegeta - tion along a stream. A complex riparian community consists of diverse plant species native to the site or functioning similarly to native species, with multiple age-classes providing vertical structural diversity suit - able for the site. As explained previously, the quality of riparian areas is influenced by the hydrological features of the stream, as well as upland and bank conditions. Well-established and connected riparian ar - eas perform critical functions for maintaining healthy, resilient stream ecosystems by providing: a vegetative filter for surface runoff, reducing pollutants and sediment entering streams, and no concentrated flow from upland areas roughness that slows water and the erosive ef - fects of floodwater root systems that bind soil, protect streambank integrity, and build flood plain surfaces moisture, soil conditions, surface macrotopogra - phy and microtopography, and microclimates for a diversity of riparian plants, animals, and micro - organisms structurally diverse habitat for migratory song - birds, as well as resident species of wildlife that are especially dependent on woody riparian vegetation for reproduction and feeding shade or overhanging vegetation to maintain cooler water temperatures for aquatic species large wood to forested stream channels, which offers instream cover, creates pools, traps sedi - ments, and provides habitat for stream biota organic material (leaves, twigs, grass) and in - sects for stream and riparian food chains undercut banks important to fish for hiding and resting diverse, complex off-channel habitats, such as backwaters, wetlands, and side channels formed by the interaction of streamflow, riparian vegeta - tion, and often large wood. These areas of slower water provide critical refuge during floods for a variety of aquatic species and serve as rearing areas for juvenile fish a diversity of plant species of multiple age classes, adapted to the site and providing critical habitat for both resident and migratory birds and other riparian wildlife species Well-established riparian areas are critical for stream health and fish and wildlife habitat. For this reason, it is important to evaluate both the quantity (Element 4) and the quality (Element 5) of the riparian area, and score the riparian conditions of the entire stream within a property boundary. Visually score the entire stream, if possible. If the stream is too extensive to score using SVAP2, score only the assessment reach visually, and use recent aerial photos (less than 2 years old) to score those riparian areas of the stream outside of the assessment reach. National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-22 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)Riparian area quantity: what to look for This element rates the extent of the riparian area on the property (length \u00d7 width). Estimate the width of the vegetation area from the edge of the active channel outward to where natural riparian vegetation ends and other land use/land cover begins. Vegetation gaps are lengths of streamside with no natural vegetation ecologically suitable for the site and at a density and spacing uncharacteristic of the plant community being assessed. Estimate gap percentage by dividing the total length of gaps by the total length of the stream within the property boundary multiplied by 100. For this element, natural plant community means one with species native to the site or introduced species that have become naturalized and func - tion similarly to native species of designated ref - erence sites, growing at densities characteristic of the site. Regional plant guidebooks are useful to have in the field for scoring this element. Compare the width of the riparian area to the bankfull channel width.

Forested sites should also have a diverse mix of shrubs, understory trees, and new shrub and tree regeneration. Early successional sites (recently disturbed by fire, tree harvesting, graz - ing, land clearing) should have representative native species (typically herbaceous, woody, and tree seedlings). Continually disturbed sites usually have only a few species, and often these include nonnative invasive species. As early veg - etation matures, the structure of the plant com - munity becomes more diverse with a multilayer canopy. Finally, the plant community reaches a mature stage with regeneration, growth, and mortality occurring in all layers. In forested streams, mature trees with potential for falling into the stream are present. Regional plant guide - books are useful for scoring this element. Vigorously growing vegetation in the riparian area on both sides of the stream is important for healthy stream and riparian conditions. In doing the assessment, examine both sides of the stream, and note on the site diagram which side of the stream has problems. For the highest ratings, there should be no evidence of concen - trated flows through the riparian area that are not adequately buffered or intended to short-cir - cuit the riparian area or buffer and no nonnative invasive species. The type, timing, intensity, and extent of activi - ties in riparian areas are critical in determining the impact on these areas. Note these in the Summary Sheet. Riparian areas that have roads, agricultural activities, residential or commercial structures, excessive animal use, or significant areas of bare soils have reduced functional value for the stream and its watershed.

Cool water has a greater oxygen holding capacity than warm water. In many cases, when streamside trees are removed, the stream is exposed to the warming effects of the sun, causing the water temperature to increase for longer periods during the daylight hours and for more days during the year. This shift in light intensity and temperature often causes a decline in the numbers of certain spe - cies of fish, insects, and other invertebrates and some aquatic plants. They may be replaced altogether by other species that are more tolerant of increased light intensity, lower dissolved oxygen, and warmer water temperature. For example, trout and salmon require cool, oxygen-rich water and may rely on food organ - isms produced by detritus-based food chains. Loss of streamside vegetation that causes increased water temperature and decreased oxygen levels contributes to the decrease in abundance of trout and salmon from many streams that historically supported these species. Warm-water species also benefit from canopy cover to keep streams from exceeding optimal tem -peratures. Increased light and the warmer water also promote excessive growth of submerged macrophytes (vascular plants) and algae that can cause a shift from a detritus-based to an algae-based food chain, thus altering the biotic community of the stream. Although some stream food webs are detritus-based, others (especially some warm-water streams) are algae-based and require a certain amount of light to be naturally productive. Therefore, this element is particularly sensitive to the type of stream (stream class) and fish community that is being assessed and calibra - tion of scoring may be necessary. Remember that many of the features of this element are influenced by the degree of upstream shading in addition to flow volume, degree of flow alterations, channel type, and other factors. Therefore, the element is assessed for canopy over the entire property rather than at a single assessment reach. Choose the matrix appropriate for the stream and its native fauna. For example, if the stream is a trout stream, use the matrix for cold-water streams. If the stream is naturally warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit, use the matrix for warm-water streams. Lastly, percentages in the scoring matrix should be modified according to the site's potential for plant communities that will provide shade to the stream.

Numbers above the ovals refer to the percent black (= shade/cover). (USDA Forest Service FIA Manual, http://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/ ) What to look for Estimate the percent of the stream surface area that is shaded over the entire property. This may require cover estimates at several points within and outside the assessment reach. Time of the year, time of the day, and weather can affect the observation of shading. Therefore, the relative amount of shade is estimated by assuming that the sun is directly overhead and the vegetation is in full leaf-out. To enhance accuracy of the as - sessment, aerial photographs taken during full leaf-out should be used to supplement visual as - sessments. Figure 25 may be used as a guide for both visual and aerial estimates.

The assess - ment of turbidity is the depth to which an object can be clearly seen. Clear water indicates low turbidity. Cloudy or opaque water indicates high turbidity. Tur - bidity is caused mostly by particles of soil and organic and inorganic matter suspended in the water column. Streams often show some turbidity after a storm event because of soil and organic particles carried by runoff into the stream or suspended by turbulence. Intrinsic characteristics of a watershed, such as geology and soils unaffected by human activities, should be con - sidered in reference conditions and assessment. For example, glacial flour creates high turbidity and is con - sidered a natural process of erosion in glacial streams. Tea-colored water due to tannins from a natural pro - cess in bogs and wetlands may also affect clarity in some streams. Altered clarity due to natural processes would not receive low ratings. What to look for Clarity of the water is an obvious and easy fea - ture to assess. The deeper an object in the water can be seen, the lower the amount of turbidity. This measure should be taken after a stream has had the opportunity to settle down following a storm event. A stream should not smell like oil or have pro - nounced motor oil sheen on its surface. Use the depth that objects are visible only if the stream is deep enough to evaluate turbidity using this approach. For example, if the water is clear, but only 1 foot deep, do not rate it as if an object became obscured at a depth of 1 foot. Clear visibility 3-6 ft Slightly turbid 1-5-3 ft Turbid 0.5-1.5 ft High turbidity <0.5Water is very clear, or clarity appropriate to site; submerged features in stream (rocks, wood) are visible at depths of 3 to 6 feet No motor oil sheen on sur - face; no evidence of metal precipitates in streams Water is slightly tur - bid, especially after storm event, but clears after weather clears; submerged features in stream (rocks, wood) are only visible at depths of 1.5 to 3 feet No motor oil sheen on surface or evidence of metal precipitates in streamWater is turbid most of the time; submerged features in stream (rocks, wood) are visible at depths of only .5 to 1.5 feet and/or Motor oil sheen is pres - ent on water surface or areas of slackwater and/or There is evidence of metal precipitates in streamVery very turbid wa - ter most of the time; submerged features in stream (rocks, wood) are visible only within .5 feet below surface and/or Motor oil sheen is pres - ent on the water surface or areas of slackwater 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Element 7 Water appearance614-27 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 (g) Element 8\u2014Nutrient enrich - ment Description and rationale for assessing nutri - ent enrichment Nutrients are necessary for stream food webs by pro - moting algal and aquatic plant growth, which provide habitat and food for aquatic organisms. However, an excessive amount of algal and plant growth is detri - mental to stream ecosystems. High levels of nutrients (especially phosphorus and nitrogen) lead to increased growth of algae and aquatic plants. Subsequently, respiration and decomposition of plant organic matter consume dissolved oxygen in the water, lowering the concentration of oxygen available to aquatic organ - isms and possibly contributing to significant die-offs. A landowner may have seen fish gulping for air at the water surface during warm weather, indicating a lack of dissolved oxygen. Streams respond differently to nutrient loading. The presence of algal blooms\u2014thick mats of algae and an overabundance of aquatic plants (macrophytes)\u2014are often indicators that nutrients are high. However, the absence of such blooms may not al - ways be indicative of nutrient concentrations. Stream velocity, light availability, temperature, and types of stable substrate present in a stream are important factors that affect algal and plant abundances. Water quality problems that arise from excess turbidity, herbicides, or salinity will also affect the abundance or absence of algae or macrophytes. If there is little or no algal growth, assess the factors described in the What to look for section, and summarize the findings accord - ingly. Nutrient enrichment is difficult to assess visually. If a score of less than 5 is determined, a simple quan - titative assessment, such as water quality testing for total phosphorus, may be warranted . What to look for Streams with high velocity greater than .33 foot per second and high concentrations of nutrients are typically not dominated by filamentous algae. Thus, the water may appear very clear, yet still have high nutrient concentrations. If light is a limiting factor due to shading from ri - parian vegetation, look for algal growth on rocks and boulders in reaches exposed to light. Most algae grow more rapidly at higher tempera - tures. Within a range of 32 to 77 degrees Fahren - heit, increasing temperature by 18 degrees Fahr - enheit typically doubles the rate of algal growth. Low complexity of substrate reduces filamentous algal growth. The presence of dense stands of aquatic macro - phytes may be an indicator of nutrient availabil - ity. Diversity with the aquatic plant community should be noted and considered. Some species typically associated with springs, such as water - cress, may not be associated with heavy nutrient loading. Clear water and a diverse, dispersed aquatic plant community are optimal for this characteristic.Clear water along entire reach Little algal growth pres - ent Fairly clear or slightly greenish water Moderate algal growth on substrates Greenish water particu - larly in slow sections Abundant algal growth, especially during warmer months and/or Slight odor of ammonia or rotten eggs and/or Sporadic growth of aquatic plants within slack water areasPea green color present; thick algal mats domi - nating stream and/or Strong odor of ammonia or rotten eggs and/or Dense stands of aquatic plants widely dispersed 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Element 8 Nutrient enrichmentNational Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-28 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)(h) Element 9\u2014Manure or hu - man waste presence Description and rationale for assessing manure or human waste presence Manure and human waste increase nutrients and bio - chemical oxygen demand in streams, which alter food webs and nutrient cycles of stream/riparian ecosys -tems. Ask the property manager if and when livestock have access to the stream. Manure from livestock contaminates water if livestock have direct access to the stream or runoff from corrals, pastures, or pad - docks is not diverted away from the stream. Similarly, wastewater piped or diverted directly to a stream is a health risk to aquatic species and humans. Score this element on the entire property and all properties where SVAP2 is completed.

Streams with a mix of shallow and deep pools offer diverse habitat for different species of fish and other aquatic species. In fish-bearing streams, a general rule of thumb to distinguish deep pools from shallow pools is this: a deep pool is 2 times deeper than the maximum depth of its upstream riffle, while a shallow pool is less than 2 times deeper than the maximum depth of its upstream riffle. This general rule may not apply to extremely high-gradient streams dominated by cascades, however. Continuous pools (those not separated by riffles, wood jams, rock steps, or fast- water) provide less diverse habitat and are indicative of poor stream structure and should not be considered for scoring in the first three boxes (only the last). Fish use such cover to rest, hide from predators, catch food items in the swirling currents that occur around submerged structures, and avoid territorial conflicts. Isolated pools occur when streamflows are so low that portions of the stream are essentially dewatered temporarily. If deep enough, these isolated pools serve as refuges for stranded fish and other aquatic species until rains restore continuous flow in the system and reconnect the pools to their previously dry riffles. Fish habitat is often limited by the amount of available cover, such as submerged logs, boulders, tree roots, and undercut banks, in pools. Stream alteration often reduces the amount and complexity of pools, thus degrading fish habitat. On the other hand, beavers often create pools in streams, which may add habitat diversity and enhance pool habitats; however, their effects may also inundate riffles and other shallow water habitats. Thus, it is important to assess SVAP stream reaches in the correct context, that is, in rela - tion to local reference conditions. States are encour - aged to modify scoring of this element according to local pool-to-riffle ratios generally present in reference stream reaches. Remember, representative reaches of streams throughout the area are being assessed, and if conditions should change dramatically within the property due to alteration or other influences affecting the structure and function of the stream, additional reaches should be assessed. More than two deep pools separated by riffles, each with greater than 30% of the pool bottom obscured by depth, wood, or other cover Shallow pools also presentOne or two deep pools separated by riffles, each with greater than 30% of the pool bottom obscured by depth wood, or other cover At least one shallow pool presentPools present but shal - low (<2 times maximum depth of the upstream riffle) Only 10-30% of pool bot - toms are obscured due to depth or wood coverPools absent, but some slow water habitat is available No cover discernible or Reach is dominated by shallow continuous pools or slow water 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Element 10 Pools: Low-gradient streams (<2%) scoring matrixOnly one pool morphology type (low gradient or high gradient) should be used per assessment reach.National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-30 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)What to look for (low-gradient streams) The number of pools per assessment reach is estimated based on walking the stream or prob - ing from the streambank with a stick or pole. You should find deep pools on the outside of meander bends. Pools are typically separated by riffles or other shallow water habitats. In drier climates, deep pools may be temporarily isolated from their riffles, yet still provide important refuge habitat. Pools are formed by obstructions in the stream channel such as fallen trees, accumula - tions of wood (jams), beaver dams, boulders, root wads, rock outcrops, beaver dams, and ac - cumulated plant debris. Assess pool cover by estimating the percent of the pool bottom that is obscured by cover fea - tures or depth, assuming one is positioned direct - ly over the feature looking straight down at the stream bottom. In shallow, clear streams a visual inspection may provide an accurate estimate.More than three deep pools separated by boul - ders or wood, each with greater than 30% of the pool bottom obscured by depth, wood, or other cover. For small streams, pool bottoms may not be com - pletely obscured by depth, but pools are deep enough to provide adequate cover for resident fish Shallow pools also presentTwo to three deep pools, each with greater than 30% of the pool bottom obscured by depth wood or other cover; at least one shallow pool pres - ent.

Step-pools operate similar to stair steps with water dropping vertically over nearly complete channel obstruc - tions (often a large rock and/or large wood) scouring out small depressions or plunge pools (Hunter 1991). Streams with step-pool conditions usually have gradients greater than 4 percent and pools are spaced at one pool every 1.5 to 4 bank - full channel widths. Pool spacing decreases as gradient increases (Rosgen 1996). Streams with gradients between 2 and 4 percent are often rapids and lateral scour pool dominat - ed. Scour pool spacing is typically one pool every 4 to 5 bankfull channel widths and is created by channel confinements and wood or sediments. Plunge pools and scour pools are important aquatic habitat features providing resting and hiding cover for fish and aquatic species. With these pools, turbulence, large rock, wood, and the depth of water all contribute hiding cover for fish.614-31 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 (j) Element 11\u2014Barriers to aquatic species movement Description and rationale for assessing barri - ers to aquatic species movement Most aquatic organisms move around their habitats or undertake daily, seasonal, or annual migrations. For example, anadromous trout and salmon spawn and rear in freshwater, move to marine environments to grow to adulthood, and return to freshwater after a period of months or years to reproduce and die (Groot and Margolis 1991). Other fish commonly use estu - aries, river mouths, and the lower reaches of rivers within a span of a few days for feeding, sheltering, or as refuge from predators (Gross et al. 1988). Others use headwater streams for spawning and downstream lakes or rivers for feeding as they mature. Conse - quently, barriers that block the movement of fish or other aquatic organisms are important components of stream assessment. Instream features or water management practices can create barriers that limit or prohibit the passage of aquatic organisms either seasonally or annually. Pas - sage barriers may prevent the movement or migration of fish, deny access to important breeding or forag - ing habitats, and isolate populations of fish and other aquatic animals. Both natural and fabricated barriers occur within river and stream systems, and natural physical barriers include waterfalls, cascades, and large rapids. Common fabricated physical barriers include dams, diversions, culverts, weirs, excessively high-grade control structures or buried sills with broad crests. Chemical and biological barriers, such as water quality and quantity (temperature and low stream flows) and predation from nonnative species, also ex - ist in many rivers across the United States. However, these types of passage problems are often seasonal and can be difficult to identify with limited field time and site-specific data. Passage barriers are typically categorized by charac - teristics such as water velocity, water depth, and bar - rier height in relation to the passage requirements of a given species and/or life stage. Three commonly used barrier classes are: Partial \u2014impassable to some species or certain age classes all or most of the time Temporary \u2014impassable during some times to all or most species and/or age classes (e.g., during low flow conditions) Complete \u2014 impassable to all fish at all times For example, a poorly designed or damaged culvert may be a temporary barrier to upstream migrating adults when flows are high because velocities within the culvert barrel exceed their natural swimming capabilities. Some highly migratory fishes like Pacific salmonids can leap 6 feet or more to bypass a water - fall, whereas shad in the same river will be faced with a complete barrier (Bell 1990; Haro and Kynard 1997). Many State and Federal agencies have laws that are applicable to this element. Conservationists should become familiar with State-applicable regulations as part of the preliminary assessment. When addressing this element, assess a length of stream at least 12 times the bankfull width or the entire stream length on the landowner's property, whichever is greater. Be sure to detail in the notes the species and life stages of aquatic organisms for which barriers are being evaluated. No artificial barriers that prohibit movement of aquatic organisms during any time of the yearPhysical structures, water withdrawals and/ or water quality season - ally restrict movement of aquatic speciesPhysical structures, water withdrawals and/ or water quality restrict movement of aquatic species throughout the yearPhysical structures, water withdrawals and/ or water quality prohibit movement of aquatic species 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Element 11 Barriers to aquatic species movement scoring matrix National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 614-32 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)What to look for Ask the landowner about any dams or other bar - riers that may be present 3 to 5 miles upstream or downstream of his or her property. Note the presence of natural barriers along the assessment reach, their size. Beaver dams generally do not prevent fish mi - gration and should not be identified as passage barriers unless supporting information exists. Livestock and/or equipment/vehicle crossings can be passage barriers if water flows fast and shallow (less than 6 in) across smooth or uni - form surfaces at least half as wide (from up - stream to downstream) as the bankfull width. For example, a 12-foot-wide hardened vehicle ford that crosses a stream with a bankfull width of 20 feet is likely a temporary passage barrier. Low-head dams are most likely temporary or complete barriers, especially if outfitted with a concrete apron that covers the streambed along the entire downstream face. Culverts can be especially problematic to mi - gratory aquatic organisms. Unless specifically designed with passage purposes in mind, most culverts are partial upstream passage barriers for the smallest life stages of native fish. Culverts should be scored as temporary or complete pas - sage barriers if the culvert: alignment does not match the stream - width is less than bankfull width - slope is greater than channel slope - is not countersunk - is perched (elevated) above the outlet pool - inlet is plugged with debris - inlet or outlet shows sign of erosion or insta - - bility(k) Element 12\u2014Fish habitat complexity Description and rationale for assessing fish habitat complexity The dynamic features of stream corridors create diverse habitat types and conditions for fish and other aquatic species. Quality fish habitat is a mosaic of different types of habitats created by various combina - tions of water quality and quantity, water depth, veloci - ty, wood, boulders, riparian vegetation, and the species that inhabit stream corridors. The greater the variety of habitat features, the more likely a stream is to sup - port a diversity of aquatic species. Fish require these complex habitats with diverse types of hiding, resting, and feeding cover in parts of the stream and variable flow features. For example, deep pools (with slower currents) provide cover, thermal refuge, and a place to rest. Riffles (with faster currents) provide benthic invertebrates to prey on. Fast water is well aerated, providing more oxygen to the stream ecosystem. The more types of different structural features, the more resilient the habitat is to natural disturbances (such as floods), as well as human perturbations (such as water withdrawals). The dynamic nature of instream habitat features assures fish and other species are able to find suitable areas to rear, feed, grow, hide, and reproduce during the course of their life histories. Because fish habitat needs and types vary considerably from spe - cies to species and throughout the country, States should adjust scoring of this element to reflect refer - ence conditions and species habitat features charac - teristic of their region. 614-33 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 What to look for Within the entire assessment reach, observe the num - ber of different habitat features that provide diverse and complex habitats for fish.

Some species can be placed in more than one functional feeding group. The groups are typically present in all streams, although the dominance of groups will vary from headwater streams to larger streams and rivers. These functional feeding groups help predict the location and diverse substrate needs of specific invertebrates within the stream. Substrates are materials that provide a base for invertebrates to live and colonize. In a healthy stream, substrates are varied, free of sediment, abun - dant, and in place long enough to allow colonization by invertebrates. High stream velocities, high sediment loads, and frequent flooding may deplete substrate or cause it to be unsuitable habitat, at least temporarily until recolonization occurs. Wood and riffle areas with boulders/cobbles support the bulk of the invertebrate community in temperate streams (Benke et al. 1984). Wood typically supports a more diverse invertebrate community, while boulders and cobble within riffles typically support higher num - bers (abundance) of species. High numbers of habitat types for fish often equate to high invertebrate habitat types. The scale of habitat assessment is necessarily much smaller for invertebrates because their range of mobility limits the size of their habitat, or microhabi - tat. Therefore, an array of different types of habitat should be found within a smaller area of the reach. As - sess the number of different types of habitat within a representative subsection of the assessment reach that is equivalent in length to five times the active channel width. To score, habitat types should be present in appreciable amounts (as expected in reference condi - tions or least impaired conditions). At least 9 types of habi - tat present A combination of wood with riffles should be present and suitable in addition to other types of habitat (If nonforested stream, consider reference site's optimal habitat type needed for this high score)8 to 6 types of habitat Site may be in need of more wood or refer - ence habitat features and stable wood-riffle sections5 to 4 types of habitat present3 to 2 types of habitat presentNone to 1 type of habitat present 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Note: Aquatic invertebrate habitat types, in order of importance: Logs/large wood, cobble within riffles, boulders within riffles. Additional habitat features should include: leaf packs, fine woody debris, overhanging vegetation, aquatic vegetation, undercut banks, pools, and root mats.

However, successful assessments require knowledge of the life cycles of some aquatic insects and other macroinverte - brates and the ability to identify them. For this reason, this is an optional element. Aquatic invertebrates include crustaceans (such as crayfish), mollusks (such as snails), spiders, and aquat - ic insects. These organisms are important to aquatic food webs. To better understand aquatic invertebrate functions, habitat needs and interrelationships within the food web, ecologists have categorized these organ - isms into four major functional feeding groups: Shredders process leaves, sticks, and twigs. Their habitats are distinguished by areas that trap and retain organic matter (leaf packs). They are generally found in headwater streams. Collectors are made up of two types of aquatic invertebrates, also generally found in headwater streams: Filterers - process smaller organic matter, sus - pended in the water. Their habitats are large stable rock or logs. Gatherers - actively collect their food, plant and animal material. Their habitat is usually medium to large rocks. Grazers feed on algae in areas of streams re - ceiving sunlight. Like gatherers, their habitat is medium to large rocks. Predators feed on other animals. Their habitats include logs, medium to large rocks, water col - umn, pools, and leaf litter. The presence of a diversity of intolerant macroinver - tebrate species (pollution sensitive) indicates healthy, resilient stream conditions. Macroinvertebrates, such as stoneflies, mayflies, and caddisflies, are sensitive to pollution and do not tolerate polluted water. These intolerant orders of insects comprise group I. Group II macroinvertebrates are facultative, meaning they can tolerate limited pollution. This group includes dam - selflies, aquatic sowbugs, and crayfish. The dominant presence of group III macroinvertebrates, including midges, craneflies and leeches, without the presence of group I suggests the water is significantly polluted. The presence and abundance of only one or two spe - cies from group I species in a reach community does not generally indicate diversity is good. As with all ele - ments in the SVAP , comparison with reference condi - tions or those found in least impaired streams in the area are encouraged. Invertebrate community is diverse and well represent - ed by group I or intolerant species One or two species do not dominateInvertebrate community is well represented by group II or facultative species, and group I species are also present One or two species do not dominate Invertebrate com - munity is composed mainly of groups II and III and/or One or two species of any group may domi - nateInvertebrate community composition is predominantly group III species and/or only one or two species of any group is present and abundance is low 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Element 14 Aquatic invertebrate community scoring matrix614-37 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 What to look for Figure 26 shows illustrations for each of the three groups of macroinvertebrates with the listing of inver - tebrate taxonomic order. This rating is qualitative and therefore potential biases should be avoided to pro - vide accurate representation of each site. Collect macroinvertebrates by picking up cob - bles, gravel, leaf packs, silt, fine woody debris, and other submerged objects in the water. Sam - ple all types of potential insect habitat (refer to insect/invertebrate habitat element) for an equal amount of time to reduce biases and improve accuracy. A healthy and stable invertebrate community will be consistent in its proportional representation (evenness) of species, though individual spe - cies abundance may vary in magnitude. Note the kinds of macroinvertebrates (group type), ap - proximate number of each species, and relative abundance of each species sampled. Determine if one or two species dominate the aquatic inverte - brate community. An abundance of an individual species, such as caddisflies or snails, is often equated to a tolerance of stress, such as poor water quality, and lower diversity.

It relates directly to the suitability of the stream substrate as habitat for macroinvertebrates, fish spawning, and egg incubation. Riffles are areas, of - ten downstream of a pool, where the water is breaking over rocks, cobbles, gravel, or other substrate mate - rial on the bed of a stream, causing surface agitation. In coastal areas, riffles can be created by shoals and submerged objects. Riffles are critical for maintaining high species diversity and abundance of insects for most streams and for serving as spawning and feed - ing grounds for some fish species. This element is sensitive to regional landscape differences and should therefore be related to locally established reference conditions. Do not assess this element unless riffles or swift- flowing water and coarse substrates are present or a natural feature that should be present. Element 15 Riffle embeddedness scoring matrix Gravel or cobble sub - strates <10% embed - dedGravel are >40% embedded 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 What to look for This element should be assessed only in streams where riffles are a natural feature. The measure is the depth to which objects are buried by sediment. This assessment is made by picking up particles of gravel or cobble with fingertips at the fine sediment layer. Pull the par - ticle out of the bed, and estimate what percent of the particle was buried. Some streams have been so smothered by fine sediment that the original stream bottom is not visible. Test for complete burial of a streambed by probing with a measuring stick. Does sub - strate move easily when the substrate is moved around with one's feet? If not, substrate material is likely greater than 40 percent embedded. 614-41 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 (o) Element 16\u2014Salinity (if ap - plicable) Description and rationale for assessing salinity The origin of elevated salinity levels in streams is often associated with irrigation of salt-laden soils, dryland crop/fallow systems that produce saline seeps, oil and gas well operations, and animal waste. Salt accumu -lation in streambanks can cause break down of soil structure, decreased infiltration of water, and toxicity. High salinity in streams affects aquatic vegetation, macroinvertebrates, and fish. If observed impacts of salt are a product of natural weathering processes of soil and geologic material uninfluenced by humans, this element should not be scored. No wilting, bleaching, leaf burn, or stunting of riparian vegetation No salt-tolerant vegetation vegetation Some salt-tolerant stream - side vegetationRiparian vegetation may show significant wilting, bleaching, leaf burn, or stunting Dominance of salt-tolerant streamside wilting, bleaching, leaf burn, or stunting; pres of only salt tolerant riparian vegetation Most streamside vegetation is salt tolerant 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Note: Do not assess this element unless elevated salinity levels caused by people are suspected. Element 16 Salinity scoring matrix What to look for High salinity levels can cause a burning or bleaching of riparian vegetation. Wilting, loss of plant color, decreased productivity, and stunted growth are visible signs. Other indicators include whitish salt accumula - tions on streambanks and displacement of salt intolerant vegetation by more tolerant species.

Permanent vegetation generally does not become established in the active channel. Active flood plain That part of a flood plain that is frequently inundated with water. Aggradation Geologic process by which a stream bottom or flood plain is raised in elevation by the deposition of material. Alluvial Deposited by running water, such as sediments. Bankfull discharge The stream discharge (flow rate, such as cubic feet per second) that forms and controls the shape and size of the active channel and creates the flood plain. This discharge generally occurs once every 1.5 years on average. Bankfull flow Discharge where water just begins to leave the stream channel and spread onto the flood plain. Bankfull flow is roughly equivalent to channel-forming (conceptual) and effective (calculated) discharge for alluvial streams in equilibrium, and generally occurs every 1 to 2 years (on average). Bankfull stage The stage at which water starts to flow over the flood plain; the elevation of the water surface at bankfull discharge Baseflow The portion of streamflow that is derived from natural storage of precipita - tion that percolates to ground water and moves slowly through substrate before reaching the channel. Baseflow sustains streamflow during periods of little or no precipitation and is the average stream discharge during low flow conditions. Benthos Bottom-dwelling or substrate-oriented organisms. Boulders Large rocks measuring more than 10 inches across. Channel With respect to streams, a channel is a natural depression of perceptible extent that periodically or continuously contains moving water. It has a definite bed and banks that serve to confine the stream's water. Channel form The morphology of the channel is typically described by thread (single or multiple channels in valley floor), and sinuosity (amount of curvature in the channel). Channel roughness Physical elements of a stream channel upon which flow energy is expend - ed including coarseness and texture of bed material, the curvature of the channel, and variation in the longitudinal profile. Channelization Straightening of a stream channel to make water move faster. Cobbles Medium-sized rocks that measure 2.5 to 10 inches across. Confined channel A channel that does not have access to a flood plain. Concentrated flow Undispersed flow, usually flowing directly from an unbuffered area of over - land flow; concentrated flow generally contains sediments and/or contami - nants from areas beyond the stream corridor. Degradation Geologic process by which a stream bottom is lowered in elevation due to the net loss of substrate material. Often called downcutting. Detritus Materials such as leaves, twigs, or branches that enter a stream from the uplands or riparian area. Downcutting See Degradation. Ecoregion A geographic area defined by similarity of climate, landform, soil, potential natural vegetation, hydrology, or other ecologically relevant variables.National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 B-2 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)Embeddedness The degree to which an object is buried in steam sediment. Emergent plants Aquatic plants that extend out of the water. Ephemeral stream A stream with a channel that is above the water table at all times and car - ries water only during and immediately after a rain event. Flood plain The level area of land near a stream channel, constructed by the stream in the present climate, and overflowed during moderate flow events (after Leopold 1994). Flow augmentation Artificially adding water to a stream channel with timing and magnitude that disrupts the natural flow regime. Examples include irrigation deliver - ies, trans-basin diversions, or wastewater from irrigated lands, treatment plants, or commercial facilities. Fluvial A feature of or pertaining to the action of moving water. Forb Any broad-leaved herbaceous plant other than those in the Gramineae (Poceae), Cyperacea, and Juncaceae families (Society for Range Manage - ment1989). Gabions A wire basket filled with rocks; used to stabilize streambanks and control erosion. Geomorphology The study of the evolution, process, and configuration of landforms. Glide A fast water habitat type that has low to moderate velocities, no surface agitation, and a U-shaped, smooth, wide bottom. Gradient Slope calculated as the amount of vertical rise over horizontal run ex - pressed as feet per foot or as percent (ft/ft \u00d7 100). Grass An annual to perennial herb, generally with round erect stems and swollen nodes; leaves are alternate and two-ranked; flowers are in spikelets each subtended by two bracts. Gravel Small rocks measuring 0.825 to 2.5 inches across. Habitat The area or environment in which an organism lives. Herbaceous Plants with nonwoody stems. Hydrology The study of the properties, distribution, and effects of water on the Earth's surface, soil, and atmosphere. Hyporheic Below the surface of the streambed, including interstitial spaces. Incised channel A channel with a streambed lower in elevation than its historic elevation in relation to the flood plain. Intermittent stream A stream that flows only certain times of the year, such as when it receives water from springs, ground water, or surface runoff. Lateral migration The adjustment of a stream channel from side to side often involving the recession of a streambank. In a braided river system, both streambanks may be recessing due to excessive channel filling and limited bedload transport capabilities (see fig. 18). Macrophyte bed A dense mat of aquatic plants. Macrotopography Depositional features within a flood plain developed by water flow and greater than 6 inches than the average land surface of the flood plain.B-3 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 Microtopography Features within a flood plain developed by water flow and less than 6 inches than the average land surface of the flood plain. Meander A winding section of stream with many bends that is at least 1.2 times longer, following the channel, than its straight-line distance. A single me - ander generally comprises two complete opposing bends, starting from the relatively straight section of the channel just before the first bend to the relatively straight section just after the second bend. Macroinvertebrate A spineless animal visible to the naked eye or larger than 0.5 millimeters. Natural flow regime The full range of daily, monthly, and annual streamflows critical to sustain - ing native biodiversity and integrity in a freshwater ecosystem. Important flow regime characteristics include natural variations in streamflow magni - tude, timing, duration, frequency, and rates of change (see Poff et al. 1997 for further detail). Nickpoint The point where a stream is actively eroding (downcutting) to a new base elevation. Nickpoints migrate upstream (through a process called headcut - ting). Oligotrophic Having little or no nutrients and, thus, low primary production . Perennial stream A steam that typically flows continuously throughout the year. Point bar A gravel or sand deposit on the inside of a meander; actively mobile depos - its. Pool Deeper area of a stream with slow-moving water. Reach A section of stream (defined in a variety of ways, such as the section be - tween tributaries or a section with consistent characteristics). Riffle A shallow section in a stream where water is breaking over rocks, wood, or other partly submerged debris and producing surface agitation. Riparian areas Riparian areas are transitional areas between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and are distinguished by gradients in biophysical conditions, ecological processes, and biota. They are areas through which surface and subsurface hydrology connect waterbodies with their adjacent uplands. They include those portions of terrestrial ecosystems that significantly influence exchanges of energy and matter with aquatic ecosystems. Riprap Rock material of varying size used to stabilize streambanks and other slopes. Run A fast-moving section of a stream with a defined thalweg and little surface agitation. Scouring The erosive removal of material from the stream bottom and banks.

The topics covered in this section include a summary of changes from Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 1 (SVAP) and development of SVAP2, context for use with other methods of stream assess - ment, summary of results of a validation study of the SVAP2, and instructions for modifying the protocol. Summary of changes in SVAP2 Applications and uses of the SVAP evolved as more NRCS personnel became familiar with it. Most impor - tantly, field and State Office personnel were asked to utilize SVAP for determination of eligibility for fish and wildlife resource conservation in Farm Bill programs, evaluation of the level at which aquatic habitat is being achieved in an RMS, preliminary evaluation of streams where restoration actions were being considered, and documentation of trends after stream and riparian project implementation. The uses for the protocol thus expanded beyond the original intent of the SVAP . Revi - sions are now made to allow field personnel to assess conditions relatively quickly and with a reasonable degree of accuracy and repeatability. Because SVAP Version 1 was designed for landowners to learn about streams with assistance from field office personnel, the cadre of specialists retained this objective in the development of SVAP2. The following concerns of field users of SVAP Version 1 were addressed in the revision and are reflected in SVAP2: Revise SVAP to be congruent with existing wild - life habitat evaluation guides. A value of .5 is the threshold/difference between source and sink habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Using SVAP2, a score of 5 or above for a stream should be con - sidered the threshold/difference between source and sink stream habitat for fish and wildlife. Revise wording and protocol elements to assure better consistency among and between States to allow repeat assessments over time. Revise critical scoring elements to better reflect the current state of the art and NRCS emphasis on stream corridor conservation. These elements are channel condition, hydrological alteration, riparian quality, riparian quantity, and bank con - dition. The SVAP Version 1 and SVAP2 were developed by combining parts of several existing assessment pro - cedures. Many of these sources are listed in the refer - ences section. Three drafts of SVAP2 were developed and reviewed by the workgroup and others between the fall of 2006 and the spring of 2008. During the summer of 2007, the workgroup conducted a field trial evaluation of the third draft. Subsequently, additional revisions were made, and the fourth draft was sent to all NRCS State Offices, selected Federal agencies, and other partners for review and comment during the spring of 2008. Comments were received from eight NRCS State Offices, Bureau of Land Management, and several NRCS national specialists. Comments were, for the most part, uniformly supportive of the need for user guidance and for the document as drafted. Many reviewers provided suggestions that improved explan - atory text for the supporting descriptions accompany - ing the assessment elements. Most of the suggested revisions were incorporated into the final draft of the protocol. Context for use of SVAP2 The SVAP2, like its predecessor, is intended to be a relatively simple, yet comprehensive assessment of stream condition that maximizes ease of use. It is suit - able as a general approximation of stream condition at the time in which the protocol is used. It can also be used to identify the need for more precise quantita - tive assessment methods that focus on a particular aspect of the aquatic system. These would include geomorphic analysis, quantitative habitat condition, and biological surveys. The SVAP2 is applicable na - tionwide because it utilizes ecological and physical factors that are least sensitive to regional differences. However, regional differences are a significant aspect of stream assessment, and therefore, the protocol's scoring elements are expected to be modified to reflect regional differences in physical landscape features and weather patterns. The national SVAP2 is viewed as a framework that will evolve over time to better reflect State or within-State regional differences. Instructions for modification are provided later in this document. The SVAP2 is issued as a component of the National Biology Handbook. States are encouraged to incor - porate it within the Field Office Technical Guide. The document may be modified by States. The electronic file for the document may be downloaded from the NRCS Web site.National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 C-2 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)Summary of validation study of SVAP2 SVAP2 was field tested regionally and nationally, along with three alternative protocols designed to evaluate physical habitat condition of streams. The protocols evaluated were NRCS's SVAP2, the Ohio EPA's Qualita - tive the Bioassessment Protocol (EPA-RBP), and a quanti - tative protocol developed by EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP-QTPH). The contractors sampled one site on each of 51 wade - able agricultural streams in the summer of 2007. Sites were distributed throughout the United States, except for the Deep South because of high waters, and they included 8 sites in California (Central Valley), 10 in Oregon (Willamette Valley), 4 in North Dakota (North - ern Plains), 8 in South Dakota (Northern Plains), 4 in Nebraska (Western Corn Belt), 5 in Iowa (Western Corn Belt), 2 in Minnesota (Western Corn Belt), 6 in Pennsylvania (ridge and valley), 3 in Maryland (ridge and valley), and 1 in West Virginia (ridge and valley). Precision was assessed through use of scatter plots, coefficients of variation, and a signal/noise test (among-site variance/within-site observer variance) for all four protocols. Results indicated high precision among field technicians for all qualitative protocols, but greater precision for the quantitative protocol. Overall, all four methods produced similar assess - ment precision results, although SVAP2 elements riffle embeddedness and nutrient enrichment demonstrated low observer precision. Depending on the purpose for completing the SVAP2, a simple quantitative assess - ment of these elements such as pebble counts or water quality testing for total phosphorus may be warranted if element scores are lower than 5. Salinity and macro - invertebrate elements were not included in the study. Accuracy of SVAP2 was evaluated by comparing qualitative index scores against a quantitative physical habitat index (EMAP-QTPH), qualitative metric scores against quantitative (EMAP-QTPH) metric scores, and qualitative and quantitative habitat index scores against quantitative biological index scores (fish as - semblage tolerance index, fish IBI, macroinvertebrate EPT, macroinvertebrate IBI). The results indicated ac - ceptable levels of accuracy for all four habitat indices, but greater accuracy for the quantitative protocol. Also, comparisons between each of the four habitat indexes, and the biological indexes were only weakly correlated. These comparisons were likely confounded by other stressors, such as water quality or landscape- scale perturbances, and their effects on aquatic biota. Four SVAP2 elements (channel condition, hydrologi - cal alteration, water appearance, and nutrient enrich - ment) were found to be less accurate in characterizing these stream features than the quantitative EMAP met - rics. However, the EMAP metric used to make three of these comparisons (hydrological alteration, water appearance, nutrient enrichment) were only weakly comparable, which may explain some of the varia - tion between the two methods. The comparison of the EMAP metric (bed stability) to the SVAP2 channel condition was relatively comparable, and so the lack of strong correlation between these two methods is likely due to the complexity of visually assessing these stream features (table C-1). This finding reinforces the need to complete a quantitative assessment of channel condition if SVAP2 scores for this element are lower than 5. Instructions for modification of SVAP2 to better reflect local con - ditions The NRCS SVAP2 may be used in many locales with - out modification when the objective of the user is to learn about features that determine overall stream and riparian conditions. As its predecessor, SVAP2 was designed to use assessment elements that are the least sensitive to regional differences. Nonetheless, when using the tool to evaluate trends in stream corridor habitat conditions over time, the elements and scoring categories should be calibrated to reflect conditions characteristic of the geographic area. If narrative descriptions of scoring elements match local features and hydrologic regimes the SVAP2 will be: easier to use locally more responsive to changes in local stream con - dition over time more precise and accurate Two parts of the SVAP2 may be modified\u2014the indi - vidual elements and their narrative descriptions and the rating scale for assigning an overall condition rating. The simplest approach to modifying the SVAP2 C-3 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 Table C-1 Correlations between qualitative SVAP metrics and quantitative EMAP metrics.

Un - der this approach an interdisciplinary team should be assembled to develop proposed revisions. Revisions should then be evaluated by conducting comparison assessments at sites representing a range of conditions and evaluating accuracy (correlation between differ - ent assessment methods), precision (reproducibility among different users), and ease of use. Step 1 Decide on tentative number of versions. Is the desire to develop a revised version for the State, for each ecoregion within the State, or for several stream classes within each ecoregion? Step 2 Develop a tentative stream classification. If developing protocols by stream class, develop a tentative classification system. (If interested in a statewide or ecoregion protocol, go to step 3.) One might develop a classification system based on stream order, elevation, or landscape character. Do not create too many categories. The greater the number of categories, the more assessment work will be needed to modify the protocol, resulting in more accommodation of degradation within the evaluation system. As an extreme example of the latter problem, one would not want to create a stream class consisting of those streams that have bank-to-bank cropping and at least one sewage outfall. Step 3 Assess sites. Assess a series of sites representing a range of con - ditions from highly impacted sites to least impacted sites. Try to have at least 10 sites in each tentative classes. Those sites should include several potential least impacted reference sites. Try to use sites that have been assessed by other assessment methods (such as sites assessed by State agencies or univer - sities). As part of the assessments, be sure to record information on potential classification factors and if any particular elements are difficult to score. Take notes so that future revisions of the elements can be rescored without another site visit. Step 4 Rank the sites. Begin the data analysis by ranking all the sites from most impacted to least impacted. Rank sites according to the independent assessment results (preferred) or by the SVAP scores. Initially, rank all of the sites in the State data set. Classifications will be tested in subsequent iterations. Step 5 Display scoring data. Prepare a chart of the data from all sites in the State. The columns are the sites arranged by the ranking. The rows are the assessment elements, overall numerical score, and narrative rating. If independent assessment data is available, create a second chart by plotting the overall SVAP scores against the independent scores. Step 6 Evaluate responsiveness. Does the SVAP score change in response to the con - dition gradient represented by the different sites? Are the individual element scores responding to key resource problems? Were users comfortable with all elements? If the answers are yes, do not change the elements and proceed to step 7. If the answers are no, isolate which elements are not responsive. Revise the narrative descriptions for those elements to better respond to the observable conditions. Con - duct a desktop reassessment of the sites with the new descriptions, and return to step 4. Step 7 Evaluate the narrative rating breakpoints. Do the breakpoints for the narrative rating corre - spond to other assessment results? The excellent range should encompass only reference sites. If not, reset the narrative rating breakpoints. Set the excellent breakpoint based on the least impacted reference sites. Use judgment to set the other break - points. Step 8 Evaluate tentative classification systems. Go back to step 4 and display the data this time by the tentative classes (ecoregions or stream classes). In other words, analyze sites from each ecoregion or each stream class separately. Repeat steps 5 through 7. If the responsiveness is significantly different from the responsiveness of the State-wide data set or the breakpoints appear to be significantly differ - ent, adopt the classification system, and revise the protocol for each ecoregion or stream class. If not, a single statewide protocol is adequate. After the ini - tial modification of the SVAP , the State may want to set up a process to consider future revisions. Field offices should be encouraged to locate and assess least impacted reference sites to build the database for interpretation and future revisions. Ancillary C-5 (190-VI-NBH, December 2009)National Biology Handbook Aquatic and Terrestrial Habitat ResourcesConservation Planning Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2Subpart B Part 614 data should be collected to help evaluate whether a potential reference site should be considered a reference site. Caution should be exercised when considering future revisions. Revisions complicate comparing SVAP scores determined before and after the implementation of conservation practices if the protocol is substantially revised in the intervening period. Developing information to support refining the SVAP can be carried out by research partners working "}
