The CBRD expertise developed under NAVSEA's leadership is both nationally and internationally recognized by the CBRD community. While the primary focus of this expertise is in support of the Navy's CBRD program, this expertise is also leveraged to support the other Department of Defense services and agencies, as well as civilian homeland defense organizations. This section discusses the Navy's technical authority hierarchy, the direct support provided to sustain the fleet's CBRD capabilities, and examples of the support provided to support the joint service and homeland defense initiatives. 14 Technical Warrant Holder: Enabling the Navy's Warfighting Capability in a Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Environment Jon Cofield 18 Engineering Agents for Chemical and Biological Defense Information Systems: Getting the Navy's Information Systems to the Field Santiel Creekmore 22 Sustaining the Navy's Chemical and Biological Detection Capabilities Nancy Haymes 26 CBRD Waterfront Team Improves Fleet Readiness Tara Lalonde and Ronald Roller 32 Chemical and Biological Defense Individual Protection Equipment Materiel Readiness Improvement Program Michael Carl 38 Shipboard Isolation and Quarantine: Protecting Sailors From Infectious Diseases John Garmon 42 Joint Project Manager for Protection Leverages NSWCDD's Systems Engineering and Integration Expertise in New Trail Boss Role Jorge Hernandez 44 Fixed-Facility Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Defense: Protecting Building Occupants From Airborne Threats Kevin Cogley and Walter Dzula 50 Biological Defense Quality Assurance Sample Technical Laboratory Andrew Sobota 52 Field Activity Support to the Naval Treaty Implementation Program Matthew J.

When prevention is not successful, detection is used to identify what type, how much, and where the CBR hazard is present. When a contaminated area cannot be avoided, it is necessary to protect individuals and equipment from contamination and to decontaminate those individuals and equipment that come in contact with the CBR hazard. The Naval Sea Systems Command and its partners in the joint CBR community provide the tools and capabilities necessary to detect, protect, and decontaminate threats resulting from a CBR attack. This section addresses the specific detection, collective protection, and decontamination systems and their integration into fleet and shore assets and facilities. 64 Chemical and Biological Detection for the Fleet Daniel C.

M&S is used to predict the hazard over time resulting from a CBR incident in order to support the ability to avoid the contamination and determine the duration of protection and the extent of decontamination that will be required. Some M&S products are intended to be fielded, whereas others are used to develop and support other fielded products. M&S is also used in the development of new capabilities to evaluate alternative designs and to supplement test data. This section addresses the development and use of M&S in providing CBR defense capabilities to the fleet. 112 Validation, Verification, and Accreditation Challenges for the Joint Effects Model (JEM) Russell P .

When these weapons don't kill, they disable. Either way, they can affect the Navy's ability to execute its missions and operations. That is why the Navy places a high priority on chemical, biological, and radiological defense (CBRD) research, development, testing, and evaluation to support the Sailors, whether afloat or ashore, surface or undersea. The CBR Defense Division at the Naval Surface Warfare Cen- ter, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) spearheads the surface Navy's CBRD capabilities. The Division works in partnership with other Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Warfare Center activities and defense community members to ensure that Navy and joint warfighters are safe from the harmful effects of chemical, biologi-cal, or radiological contamination. The scope of these efforts rang-es from detection and protection, to mitigation and survivability in contaminated environments. Moreover, should warfighters be-come exposed while operating in a contaminated environment, the Warfare Centers also arm warfighters with capabilities for de-contamination. NSWCDD is proud of the CBR Defense Division's reputa- tion for excellence in developing CBR protection systems. A re-cent Centers for Disease Control inspection, for example, deemed our CBR biosafety program \"a model for other organizations. \" This same excellence is evident in the work described in the articles in this issue of the Leading Edge magazine. The articles that follow represent a wide range of programs and innovative technologies key to CBRD. In these articles, you will learn how our Navy civilian engineers and scientists are work-ing diligently on solutions to the CBR threats that face our war - fig hters, as well as the population worldwide. I invite you to explore the CBRD issue of the Leading Edge mag - azine and learn about the exciting and important work NSWCDD and others are doing in support of this most important area of de-fense. Given the wide array of contributions that our CBRD team is making, I am proud to say that our Navy will continue to be pro-tected from CBR attacks, now and in the future.Captain Michael H. Smith, USN Commander , NSWCDD 67Draft - Working Papers Draft - Working Papers Draft - Working PapersDraft - Working Papers Draft - Working Papers Draft - Working Papers Draft - Working PapersDraft - Working Papers Introductions Meeting Today's CBRD Challenges Technology and information advances over the past 50 years have resulted in a wide range of available chemical and biological agents to non-state actors with little scientific skill. Breakthroughs in chemical and biological sciences have also led to the emergence of new warfare threats. As a result, our world has never been more at risk from weapons of mass destruction than it is now. The chal-lenge of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Bi-ological Defense (JPEO-CBD) is to defend the warfighter and the nation against these threats. We are the joint service, single focal point for research, development, acquisition, fielding, and life-cycle support of chemical and biological defense equipment and medical countermeasures. The JPEO-CBD leads the battle against known, unknown, unexpected, and unseen chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. Successful development of CBRN defense capabilities is very much a team effort. The resources brought to the table by the Na-val Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) are a critical piece of the national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction. I have seen firsthand how the CBR Defense Division facilities, both in Dahlgren and Norfolk, support the warfighter on land and at sea by providing a full complement of capabilities that take products through their full life cycle from development to fielding and ultimate disposal. The division's top-notch labora-tories\u2014ranging from the traditional and mechanical to biosafety level 2 and 3 laboratories\u2014support the ability of the organiza-tion's scientists and engineers to address emerging chemical and biological defense challenges. The skilled professionals within the CBR Defense Division demonstrate the Navy core values of hon-or, courage, and commitment through their expertise, dedica-tion, and adaptability in meeting the ever-changing needs of our service members. When I recently toured USS Ashland (LSD 48) and USS Whidbey Island (LSD 41), I was quite impressed with the complexity of design and the seamless integration of CBRN coun-termeasures for shipboard use. It is clear to see just how NSWCDD has earned its stellar reputation throughout the CBRN defense community as a leader in systems engineering. Brigadier General Jess A.

As the CBR Defense Division Head at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahl- gren Division, I am extremely proud and humbled by both the quality and quantity of work that is performed by our outstand-ing government and contractor team, many of whom have written articles contained herein. I hope that as you read through the fol-lowing pages, you will get a sense of the technical competence and patriotic dedication that these employees give every day to our ul-timate customer\u2014the warfighter. Because of our unique CBRD expertise at Dahlgren, our work is not limited to ships. In addition to the fleet, we apply our CBRD experience to help the Department of Defense, the joint services, and other government agencies in support of national needs. Our work covers the full range of research and development, science and technology, and testing and evaluation. From basic research to full operational capability, you will find our scientists in the lab, on a ship, and every place in between. Much of this work is show-cased in the following articles. The CBR threat is real. Chemical and biological weapons have been used in the past. Accordingly, we must guard against current and future use. That's our mission\u2014to keep our Navy prepared and safe and to provide warfighters with the tools, systems, and equip-ment needed to fight and win in a CBR threatened or contaminat-ed environment. It's an important mission necessary for keeping America's Navy number one in the world, and for helping to keep warfighters safe from the threat of chemical and biological attacks.Introductions 8 Michael Purello Head, CBR Defense Division Acknowledgments There are many people who worked very hard to make this CBRD issue of the Leading Edge magazine a reality. I would like to thank the CX7 publishing staff and the NSWCDD Corporate Communications team, who worked hard to produce this professional document. Without articles, we would not have a Leading Edge , so my thanks also go to the many authors who provided their expertise and talent, and put pen to paper to write these articles. I' d like to acknowledge the support of my chain of command\u2014my Department Head, Mr. John Lysher, my Commander, Captain Mike Smith, and my Techni-cal Director, Mr. Carl R. Siel, Jr.\u2014who have been very supportive of our work in CBRD for the Navy, joint, and national needs areas. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't especially recognize two individuals who can share the credit in being largely responsible for this issue of the Leading Edge: Mr. Matt Hornbaker quarterbacked this effort for the Division and kept things moving forward from a Division perspective. He was also our Division liaison to Corporate Communications and Command PAO. Ms. Sandra Wood provided a critical review of all the articles and worked with many of the authors to ensure that the articles were current and nonredundant.

Norman Schwarzkopf 1 The effects of a chemical or biological (CB) attack on a fighting force cannot be over - stated. On a Navy ship, every Sailor plays a critical role. In order to fight in a chemically or biologically contaminated environment, the shipboard fighting force needs to func-tion at its optimal level. An enemy's purpose in using CB weapons against a ship is to degrade or cease ship operations. Imagine how a ship's effectiveness might be reduced if 50 percent or more of its crew suddenly came down with the flu, food poisoning, or other debilitating illnesses. Even the threat of CB weapons can impact ship operations, as the crew would need to don individual protective equipment in case an actual attack should occur\u2014the threat is real. The Chemical and Biological Threat About a dozen countries have offensive biological weapons programs in various stages from research and development to weapons stockpiles. Most of these offensive ca-pabilities have been developed covertly, including the following countries: China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and Taiwan. Similarly, 12 countries had chemical weapons production facilities, but under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), pledged to destroy them or convert them to civilian uses. 2 The chemical weapon (CW) threat remains despite the decline in the number of coun- tries with active chemical warfare programs and the decrease of CWC-declared stockpiles. The number of countries capable of producing chemical agents has grown, and will con-tinue to grow, as the availability of chemical production equipment increases due to the globalization of the chemical industry. The increased availability of related technologies, coupled with the relative ease of producing some chemical agents, has increased concern that their production and employment may become more attractive to states or terrorist 11 Why Chemical and Biological Defense Is Important groups. Additionally, both state and non-state actors may utilize nonweaponized chemicals\u2014including toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) and toxic indus-trial materials (TIMs)\u2014to achieve the same goals. TICs/TIMs are usually more readily available and, in some cases, can produce the same lethal and in-capacitating results as traditional CW agents. 3 Con - sequently, accidents or intentional attacks involving TICs/TIMs must also be considered. Chemical, Biological, and Toxic Industrial Incidents During the 20th and early 21st centuries, chem- ical and biological agents were used, and toxic chemicals were accidently released. A number of examples follow: 4, 5 1978\u2014Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian defector living in London, was killed with ricin. 1979\u2014The accidental release of 10 kg of an-thrax spores over Sverdlovsk, USSR, resulted in at least 66 deaths. 1984\u2014The Rajneeshee cult contaminated sal-ad bars in Oregon with Salmonella typhimuri - um, resulting in 751 people suffering from food poisoning, with 45 of them requiring hospitalization. A Union Carbide plant accidently released a methylisocynate cloud in Bhopal, India, in 1984; approximately 3,800 people died, and thousands more were injured. 1980-1988\u2014Saddam Hussein used chemi-cal agents (e.g., mustard and tabun) during the Iran-Iraq War against the Iranians and Iraqi civilians (Kurds), resulting in thou-sands of casualties. 1994\u2014The Japanese cult, Aum Shinrikyo, re-leased sarin in Matsumoto, Japan, killing 7 people and injuring at least 500. 1995\u2014Aum Shinrikyo released Sarin gas in the Tokyo subway system, resulting in 12 deaths and 5,000 people requiring treatment. Testimony during the Aum Shinrikyo trials indicated that they had used VX on individ-uals, killing at least 10 cult members and one individual outside the cult. 1997\u2014Food in Texas was intentionally con-taminated with Shigella dysenteriae, result-ing in the infection of 45 people. 2001\u2014Mail contaminated with anthrax spores were received in Florida; New Y ork City; Wash-ington, DC; and New Jersey. These letters scared the country to the point where every government mail distribution office or facil-ity issued all its employees masks and gloves to be used as they handled, processed, sort-ed, and distributed mail in the office. 11Why Chemical and Biological Defense Is Important12 CBRD Prologue\u2014The Need for Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense 2004\u2014This was an accidental chlorine re- lease resulting from a train accident near Macdona, Texas. 6 2005\u2014This was an accidental chlorine re-lease resulting from a train accident in Gran-iteville, South Carolina. 7 2007\u2014Multiple terrorist use of chlorine gas was reported in Iraq. 8, 9 2009\u2014There were reported rumors that the Sri Lankan military used chemical weapons. 10 In addition, 9 people died, 550 people sought medical treatment, and 5,400 people had to be evacuated from Graniteville, South Carolina, due to 54,000 kilograms of chlorine that was released by a train wreck in 2005. 11 Some people think that the 1972 CWC pro- vides them with protection and peace of mind. However, it is both unwise and na\u00efve to believe that nation-state terrorists will abide by any agree-ments. Consequently, the threat remains and, as indicated above, is likely to continue. Insofar as no country can fight toe-to-toe with the United States in a conventional wartime scenario, a number of countries or terrorist organizations might consider using asymmetric means, such as CB weapons or TICs/TIMs to advance their interests. Effects of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents The effects of chemical and biological agents depend upon the specific agent, the amount of ex- posure, and the mechanism of exposure, as well as the individual. The following summaries re-flect generalizations of some of the major types of agents: 12 Blister agent: The effects of blister agents are often not seen for hours. In early stag-es of contamination, one may experience ir - ritation and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat, trachea, bronchi, and/or lung, as well as reddened skin, which is followed by blistering and/or ulceration, and if severe enough, death. Nerve Agent: The effects of exposure to va-por agents begin within seconds to a minute, while the effects of exposure to a liquid agent begin within 30 minutes. The effects can range from twitching, sweating, dim/blurred vision, pain, nausea, vomiting, runny nose, shortness of breath, and coughing to convul-sions, loss of consciousness, and death. Biological Agents: The effects of biological agents can include: Fl u-like symptoms\u2014fever, headaches, chills, pain, and fatigue Ga strointestinal disease-type symptoms\u2014 vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, and col-lapse O ther symptoms\u2014rashes, skin ulcerations, respiratory problems, abnormal bleeding, and if severe enough, death Often, the effects of a CB attack do not reveal the true impact until weeks or months later. For ex-ample, when the Union Carbide plant accidently re-leased a methylisocynate cloud in Bhopal, India, in 1984, approximately 3,800 people died, and thou-sands more were injured. Since that time, many more people have died in deaths whose causes have been attributed to the 1984 accident. 13, 14 The Navy Role A robust and comprehensive Navy CB pro- gram is necessary to ensure that the Navy can operate unconstrained in a CBR-threatened or contaminated environment. This need is attribut-ed to several factors: The shift of naval operations from the blue wa-ter (open ocean) to the littorals and inland wa-terways has increased both the importance of, and need for, Navy CB defense capabilities. Sit-ting in the middle of an ocean, a ship is primar - ily concerned with threats from above (planes), from below (submarines), and from other ships. The likelihood of a CB attack, however, increases dramatically as the Navy operates in the green- and brown-water environment (lit-torals and inland waterways). Thus, the Navy needs to concern itself more with CB threats launched from land or from small craft operat-ing along the coast or near harbors. Chemical and biological defense (CBD) sen-sors and systems have to work in concert with other complex systems on ships. Navy exper - tise is required to ensure that these systems are properly designed and integrated into the ship to ensure that they function properly and do not degrade other ship systems. Also, the maritime environment is a harsh environ-ment. For example, high humidity, reflectivity off the water, sea clutter, etc., can degrade per - formance of the Navy's best sensors. Couple this with the corrosive effects of salt air, and it becomes clear that requirements are differ - ent for sensors made to operate on land ver - sus the sea. These maritime environmental factors provide unique challenges to the Navy and manufacturers of CB equipment. Ground forces are able to leave a contami-nated area after an attack and move to a saf-er, clean area where they can resume normal 13 Why Chemical and Biological Defense Is Importantoperations. A ship can move to a different location, too, but the working environment comes with them. Consequently, they must continue to operate in the dirty environment until the ship has been adequately decon-taminated. That is why 24/7 collective pro-tection systems, operational detectors, and decontamination stations are critical. The Way Ahead The Navy must remain active in the Joint Chemical and Biological Defense Program to en-sure that the Navy's maritime environment, op-erational considerations, and complex system interfaces are properly considered. The CB threat continues to exist. History provides ample evi-dence reflecting the employment of CB agents and TICs, such as mustard, sarin, tabun, anthrax, ricin, and chlorine. The purposeful use or accidental re-lease of CB agents and TICs, therefore, will contin-ue to pose a threat. The Navy must be protected. The impact of an adversary using a CB weapon against the fleet could significantly degrade operations and could potentially result in the loss of Sailors and Ma-rines. That, ultimately, is why CBD is important. Protecting Sailors and Marines from the effects of CB weapons requires expert knowledge of the Na-vy's environment, operations, and complex sys-tem interfaces. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) has the knowl-edge\u2014along with the CB expertise and experience necessary\u2014to protect the Navy and other warfight-ers from these types of attacks. NSWCDD's Chem-ical and Biological Defense Division's mission is to ensure that naval forces are armed with superior CB defense capabilities to predict, detect, and stay protected whenever the need arises.

One way the enemy\u2014be it a nation state or terrorist\u2014may attempt to degrade these capabilities is through the use of chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) weapons. A key objective of the chemi-cal, biological, and radiological defense (CBRD) community is to provide our warfight-ers with the means to prevent mission degradation from CBR attacks and eliminate the enemy's incentive to use such weapons. Department of Defense (DoD) policy requires mission-critical systems to be chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) survivable. It also requires that survivabili-ty be accomplished by material measures, or that remediation of vulnerabilities be accom-plished through tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) throughout the systems' life cycles. This policy is aimed primarily at the ability of a platform to survive and operate in a CBRN environment. 1 A related policy requires program managers (e.g., milestone deci- sion authorities) to address personnel survivability when exposed to residual chemical, bi-ological, and nuclear (i.e., radiation) effects. 2 Inherent in the survivability of personnel and platforms is the ability to complete the platform's mission within a CBRN environment. The Director, Surface Warfare Division (OPNAV N86) is the Chief of Naval Oper - ations' (OPNAV's) Executive Agent for CBRD. This office provides the organization-al focus for other military services, joint staff, and DoD agencies, and coordinates with warfare sponsors. OPNAV designated the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) as the lead systems command (SYSCOM) for CBRD programs. 3 Technical Warrant Authority The Navy also is an integral player in the Joint Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) Program, which is responsible for developing CBRD equipment. The NAVSEA Technical Warrant Holder (TWH) interfaces with the Joint CBD Program through the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD)\u2014as well as its subor - dinate joint project managers\u2014to ensure that the research, development, acquisition, and support of this equipment adequately addresses the Navy's requirements, as defined by the fleet and validated by OPNAV . As the lead SYSCOM for CBRD, NAVSEA has the added 15 Technical Warrant Holder: Enabling The Navy's Warfighting Capability in a Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Environmentresponsibility for coordinating these efforts not only within NAVSEA, but throughout the Navy. The SYSCOMs defined the role of technical au- thority \"to support program managers and the fleet in providing best-value engineering and technical products. \" 4 Some key responsibilities include safe- ty and reliability, risk management, technical op-tions for decision makers, and stewardship of the technical community. Warrants need to interact with each other since products and systems often involve multiple technical areas. The TWH is the technical voice within the Navy and to the Joint CBD Program and the other U.S. military services both directly and through designated subject mat-ter experts (SMEs). The CBD TWH supports the transition of CBD materiel solutions developed by the JPEO-CBD to the fleet. The TWH for CBD's scope of technical authority includes: Acting as the lead technical advisor to the OPNAV executive agent (EA) for CBD Acting as the lead technical point-of-con-tact for the CBD areas of: I ndividual protection equipment (IPE) C ollective protection C hemical and biological (CB) detectors D econtamination systems I ntegration of warning and modeling sys- tems M edical support systems Providing and advocating for the technical details in support of Navy requirements to the Joint CBD Program in the development of materiel solutions Leading and providing guidance to the CBD SMEs Providing guidance to ship program offices in meeting CBD requirements Coordinating and collaborating with the TWH for medical, climate control, and ra-diation Providing CBD execution risk/cost weight-ing to the program manager Assessing the health of the engineering agents Maintaining CBD specifications and stan-dards Providing execution risk guidance for the: N aval Air Systems Command (NAV AIR) N aval Special Warfare Command (NAVSOC) M ilitary Sealift Command aval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) The CBD TWH's goal is to partner with the Joint CBD Program and the appropriate offices within each SYSCOM and program executive office (PEO) to provide the best products to the warfight-er. NAVSEA SMEs help guide individual programs with requirements identification, decomposition, and verification. CBD Engineering and Logistics Support Activities CBD engineering supports Navy missions un- der chemical or biological threat. It can be thought of in terms of avoiding contaminated environ-ments, protecting against contaminants when in a contaminated environment, and taking neces-sary actions when exposed to contaminants in or - der to ensure survivability. To avoid contaminated environments, warfighters need to know, through detection, where the contaminants are and where the contaminants will likely migrate. The latter is achieved through modeling and simulation or in-formation systems (IS). To protect personnel and systems against exposure when operating in a con-taminated environment, the Navy relies on pro-phylaxes (e.g., vaccines), IPE, collective protection systems (CPS), and protective coatings. To ensure survivability when exposed to contaminants, the Navy relies on medical countermeasures for indi-viduals, as well as decontamination of individuals and equipment. These are also excellent examples of cross-warrant interactions as medical, climate control, radiological, damage control, and fire pro-tection technical areas are also involved. To address the entire scope of CBD, the tech- nical warrant authority delegates engineering au-thority along the following lines: Detection IS IPE CPS Decontamination Medical Support In addition, the TWH reaches out to the Naval Sea Logistics Center to oversee the logistics man-agement across the full spectrum of CB defense. Key NAVSEA Warfare Center activities involved with engineering support of CB defense equipment include: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Divi-sion (NSWCDD)\u2014located in Dahlgren, Vir - ginia, is the lead for CB detection, CPS, CBRD IS, decontamination, and medical support. As the lead for these commodities, NSWCDD supports joint CBD research development and acquisition, fields new equipment, and en-sures that Navy needs are properly addressed. They also manage the Readiness Assist Visit (RAV) efforts, which provide a readiness as-sessment of all CBR commodities on a ship within 90 days prior to deployment.16 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense Support Figure 1. CBR Team Fits and Measures USS Wasp Sailors Prior to Deployment Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Divi- sion (NSWCCD)\u2014located at the Ship Systems Engineering Station in Philadelphia, Pennsyl-vania, is the activity assigned responsibility of the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) for IPE, CPS, and decontamination. As the ISEA, NSWCCD is responsible for the overall engi-neering, test, maintenance, and logistics re-quirements of fielded systems and equipment. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC PCD)\u2014located in Panama City, Florida, is designated as the engineering agent for CB IPE. As the lead for IPE, NSWC PCD supports the joint CBD research, de-velopment, testing, and acquisition of IPE; fields new equipment; and ensures that Navy IPE needs are properly addressed. They also oversee the CBD-IPE Readiness Improve-ment Program (RIP), which ensures that every deploying Sailor is outfitted with the proper CBD-IPE. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane)\u2014located in Crane, Indiana, is where detectors containing radioactive mate-rial are stored by authority of their Naval Ra-dioactive Material Permit. In addition, NSWC Crane serves as the Joint Service Depot for the Joint Biological Point Detection System. Programs to Improve Fleet Readiness The CBD TWH implemented three comple- mentary programs in an agreement with the Type Commands that have improved the fleet's CBRD readiness at reduced costs to the Navy. The first two programs are the CBD IPE RIP and the RAV Pro-gram. Both programs are tied to ship deployments. RIP focuses on ensuring that the deploying ships are properly outfitted with IPE. RAV addresses all CBRD commodity areas to assist the deploying ship in improving its CBRD readiness. This provides ship commanding officers with full knowledge concern-ing the ship's CBRD readiness. As mentioned above, NSWC PCD manages the CBD-IPE RIP , which en-sures that every deploying Sailor is outfitted with the proper CBD-IPE (e.g., gas mask, suits, boots, and gloves). Prior to issuance of new equipment, each Sailor undergoes sizing of the equipment and quantitative fit testing of his or her mask using ei-ther a TDA-99M (respirator function tester) or a Joint Service Mask Leak Tester. The proper fit and sizing of the equipment is essential in order to pro-tect the Sailor in a CB environment. The program supports all naval enterprises with fully operation-al equipment\u2014provided in kit bags\u2014which support the Navy's mission-oriented protective posture and continued operations in a CBR threat environment. Figure 1 shows a Sailor being fitted for CBR defense prior to deployment. Concerning RAV , a RAV team from NSWCDD conducts a readiness assessment of all CBR commod-ities on a ship within 90 days prior to deployment. The team assesses the condition of CBR detectors, decontamination consumables, and CPS. The team ensures that the ship has been, or is scheduled to be, outfitted by RIP . It fields all CB consumables in ac-cordance with the deployment allowance equip-ment lists, and it provides crew training as necessary (see Figure 2). Each ship is provided with completed checklists, a readiness review report, recommended maintenance requests, and current CBRD literature. When each ship returns from deployment, the RAV team returns to the ship and collects unexpired con-sumables for use on another deploying ship. The implementation of the RIP and RAV efforts has reduced the support costs for CBRD equipment while ensuring the CBR defense readiness of de-ploying ships through deployment-focused CBRD support. As a result of these programs, the com-manding officers of over 130 ships have deployed in 17 Technical Warrant Holder: Enabling The Navy's Warfighting Capability in a Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) EnvironmentFigure 2. NSWCDD Engineer Conducts Shipboard CPS Training Aboard USS Tortuga recent years with the appropriate CBRD equipment and full knowledge of their CBR readiness. The third readiness program is the CPS filter change-out program executed by NSWCDD and NSWCCD. It replaces CBR filters on a cyclic basis and assures proper installation for Sailor protection. The team procures multiple filter types for distribu-tion, performs leaks tests to make sure all air passes through them, and trains Sailors on the detection of problems. Scheduling is particularly important with this program, as shipwide cooperation is necessary. The TWH's role is to champion Warfare Cen- ter ideas for improvements, to increase data sure-ty, and to increase our responsiveness to the Navy stakeholders. Increased awareness of Total Own-ership Cost provides opportunities to rethink our technical options in areas such as IPE, bioconsum-ables, decontamination, and CPS filters. With the addition of risk management practices, the CBD team has been able to provide the CBD Program Manager with solutions that have already resulted in cost avoidance and that will result in millions of dollars of cost avoidance across the Future Y ears Defense Program. Many of these actions have been executed through the JPEO-CBD and with the oth-er U.S. military services, which means that our col-lective efforts have DoD-wide benefits.Future Challenges As DoD budgets continue to tighten, the exper - tise and creativity of the CBD engineering and logis-tics support teams will be needed to maintain and improve the fleet's CBRD readiness. Coordination with Navy stakeholders is key to prioritizing Navy needs to best focus available resources. Additionally, clearly communicating Navy requirements and pri-orities to the joint community is critical for ensur - ing that Navy needs are addressed within the Joint CBD Enterprise. By leveraging TWHs and their re-spective authorities, the Navy's warfighting capabil-ities are better enabled, even in a CBR environment. References 1.

Fortunately, the Navy ships operating in the area were prepared to handle this threat. This type of event demonstrates the Navy's need for ear - ly warning, reporting, and hazard prediction capabilities. The Navy will use informa-tion systems (IS)\u2014such as the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JW ARN) a and the Joint Effects Model (JEM)b\u2014to provide these capabilities for nuclear (including ra- diological), biological, and chemical (NBC) hazards. Getting these systems from the technology development phase to an operationally proven and fielded Navy capabili-ty requires the active involvement of several key players, including the Technical Direc-tion Agent (TDA), the Acquisition Engineering Agent (AEA), and the Logisticians for chemical and biological defense (CBD) IS. The TDA, AEA, and Logistician for CBD IS provide systems engineering support for the engineering, testing, evaluation, mainte-nance, and logistics requirements for the development and initial production of the Na-vy's CBD IS. The Naval Sea Systems Command's (NAVSEA 's) Technical Warrant Holder (TWH) for CBD has designated the Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense Division at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division as the TDA and AEA for CBD TDA, AEA, and Logisticians for CBD IS (collectively referred to as engineering agents (EAs) in this article) to ensure that JW ARN and JEM are devel-oped, tested, and sustained in accordance with the Navy's technical policies and stan-dards. The EAs accomplish this by exerting influence on all acquisition activities and aspects of an IS. This article focuses on EAs' activities regarding CBD IS design, archi-tecture, test and evaluation (T&E), and sustainment planning. EAs and CBD IS Design and Architecture EAs help ensure that the CBD IS interfaces and information exchanges are compatible with the Navy's command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems and the Navy's system employment concepts. This compatibility enables the Navy to seamlessly exchange NBC information among its components and with joint forces (Figure 1) under the various operating conditions. EAs are tasked to find and close gaps between CBD IS design, C4I architecture, and the Navy's system employment concepts. They teamed with engineers from the Global Command and Control System-Maritime 19 Engineering Agents for Chemical and Biological Defense Information Systems: Getting the Navy's Information Systems to the Field Figure 1. JWARN Information Exchanges Occurring Between Navy Components and Joint Forces (GCCS-M) and the Tactical Messaging program of- fices to develop architecture for JW ARN informa-tion exchanges executed under emission control (EMCON) conditions. The EAs also teamed with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) and Knowledge Dominance Action Offi-cers within the Office of the Chief of Naval Opera-tions to ensure that the architecture was consistent with the Navy's JW ARN system employment con-cept. Once the architecture and details regarding im-plementation (e.g., communication protocols) were validated, they were provided to the JW ARN devel-opers to incorporate into the system design. In this way, EAs helped ensure that CBD IS interfaces and information exchanges support the Navy's intended use under the Navy's various operating conditions. EAs also help mitigate the risks that ever- changing information technology (IT) and C4I infrastructure pose to CBD IS. These changes in-clude third-party software updates, patches to in-terfaces, engineering change proposals, waivers, and deferrals to IT and C4I infrastructure, as well as changes in personnel qualifications/manning. The challenges posed by change can be shown by the 2009 changes to the Navy's command and con-trol system, GCCS - M. These changes altered the GCCS - M configuration aboard several group- level and unit-level ships. The new configuration precluded the use of several software applications, including JW ARN and JEM, thereby reducing the number of JW ARN-capable ships. This change re-quired the Navy to modify its JW ARN system em-ployment concept to ensure that all ships have early warning of NBC events. To support modifications to the system em- ployment concept, the EAs teamed with JW ARN developers, JEM developers, and GCCS-M en-gineers to determine what information could be exchanged between JW ARN-capable and non-JW ARN-capable ships. The EAs and engineers found that JEM hazard predictions and JW ARN's Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)-45 plots could be exchanged from the JW ARN-capable ships to the common operational picture (COP) of non-JW ARN-capable ships. The JW ARN-capable ship would create and publish JEM shapefiles and JW ARN layers in near-real time. These shape files and layers would then be published on the non-JW ARN-capable ship's COP via the COP synchro-nization tools of GCCS - M. This information could then be used to plan egress routes and notify land-based units when the area is \"clear\" (Figure 2). This Engineering Agents for Chemical and Biological Defense Information Systems: Getting the Navy's Information Systems to the Field20 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense Support concept was used to revise the JW ARN system em- ployment concept and addressed the gap in ear - ly warning created by the decreased number of JW ARN-capable ships. EAs and T&E for CBD IS When in the field, commanding officers and emergency responders need to be able to de-pend upon the CBD IS information products to plan operations within NBC environments as they make potentially life-and-death decisions. To en-sure that decision makers can rely on CBD IS, the EAs work closely with IS developers and opera-tional test agencies to ensure that CBD IS systems are tested, operationally evaluated, and proven ef-fective and suitable for Navy use prior to fielding. EAs are tasked to support all development testing and operational testing occurring throughout the CBD IS's life cycle. EAs are members of the T&E integrated product team (T&E IPT) that defines the test activities, challenges, pass/fail criteria, and resources needed to fully test each CBD IS. The EA 's role in the T&E IPT is to help testers identi-fy and close gaps between CBD IS test activities and the Navy's system employment concept. For example, the Navy's system employment concept and requirements called for JW ARN and JEM soft-ware to be operated on ships with the versions of Common Personal Computer Operating System Environment (COMPOSE) c that transitioned to current Microsoft products (Windows 7, Micro-soft Outlook 2008, etc.). JW ARN and JEM, how-ever, were developed, integrated, and tested (both developmental and operational) within a previ-ous version of COMPOSE that contained ear - lier versions of the Microsoft products. The EAs worked with members of the T&E IPT, GCCS - M engineers, and COMPOSE engineers to identi-fy potential issues associated with the change in versions (e.g., access to Microsoft exchange serv-er) that would impact JW ARN and JEM perfor - mance. The EAs also worked with the operational test agencies to develop and document a strate-gy in the T&E master plan (TEMP) to ensure ad-equate testing for JW ARN within all versions of COMPOSE. Once documented within the TEMP , the T&E IPT was able to identify adequate re-sources to execute full testing (both developmen-tal and operational) and ensure that JW ARN and JEM are operationally proven, within all required versions of COMPOSE. EAs monitor the CBD IS performance during developmental testing and authenticate test data collected during operational testing. By doing so, the EAs can inform the Navy's stakeholder of the technical challenges and risks that may prevent the CBD IS from meeting the Navy's needs (e.g., loss of interoperability between JW ARN fielded to Figure 2. COP with JWARN Plot (Yellow) and JEM Hazard Prediction (Blue)\u2014The COP displays the areas that need to be contained or avoided with a NATO ATP-45 triangle of the impacted area. 21 Engineering Agents for Chemical and Biological Defense Information Systems: Getting the Navy's Information Systems to the FieldMaritime Operation Centers and JW ARN devel- oped for ships). EAs and Sustainment Planning for CBD IS EAs help the Navy plan for sustainment of each CBD IS. Prior to fielding a CBD IS, EAs work with NAVSEA 's logisticians to maintain and regu-larly update sustainment plans. Sustainment plans for JW ARN and JEM specify when the software is installed on each ship and who performs the in-stallation, configures the settings, trains the oper - ator (Figure 3), maintains the software/training, and maintains a help desk for technical support. The EAs update the sustainment plan to address IT and C4I infrastructure changes, as well as pro-gram schedule and testing deviations. Through maintenance of the sustainment plan, EAs enable the Navy's stakeholders to align appropriate lev-els of sustainment funds for CBD IS capabilities. EAs' sustainment planning activities are critical to maintaining the fleet's readiness for CBD IS. Engineering Agents (EAs)\u2014 Value-Added Warfighters today are faced with a wide va- riety of NBC threats. Fortunately, the Navy's EAs for CBD IS work hard to see that CBD IS\u2014such as JW ARN and JEM\u2014are properly designed, are op-erationally proven, and have adequate sustainment plans before they get to the field. If not for the Navy's EAs for CBD IS, Navy and joint warfighters would not be equipped with superbly designed and effec-tive CBD IS to defend against NBC threats. Endnote a. JW ARN is a computer-based application that integrates CBRN data and facilitates sensor information into joint and service command and control systems for battlespace situational awareness. JW ARN automates the manual processes of incident reporting and haz-ard plot generation described in Allied Technical Publication 45. JW ARN incorporates sensor-alert information and CBRN obser - vation reports from the field, generates a plot of the hazard area, displays it on the COP , and generates the warning message. b. JEM i s a Web-based software application that effectively models and simulates the effects of CBRN weapon strikes and incidents. JEM is capable of providing warfighters with the ability to accurately mod-el and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Indus-trial Chemical/Material events and effects. JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of weapons of mass destruction and provides rapid estimates of hazards and effects for integration into the COP . c. C OMPOSE is the underlying infrastructure on which JW ARN, JEM, and GCCS-M reside. It is a combination of commercial off-the-shelf and government off-the-shelf products that deliver directory services, E-mail, Web acceleration, office automation ap-plications, collaboration tools, and antivirus software.

(Photo Courtesy of U.S. Navy) 22 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense SupportSustaining the Navy's Chemical and Biological Detection Capabilities By Nancy Haymes The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Report related that, \"The potential spread of weapons of mass destruction poses a grave threat. \" The QDR further related that, \" As the ability to create and employ weapons of mass destruction spreads globally, so must our combined efforts to detect, interdict, and contain the effects of these weapons. \" 1 The 2010 QDR validated the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) instruction entitled Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Requirements Supporting Opera-tional Fleet Readiness , which included a statement from OPNAVINST 3400.10F, which references the 1997 QDR in stating that, \"...weapons of mass destruction (WMD) pres-ent a grave and urgent challenge to the United States, our allies, and troops abroad. \" The instruction then went on to relate: \"Consistent with national policy and strategy, the Navy shall maintain those CBR defense capabilities required to support deterrence and enhance convention- al warfighting through defensive means. The goal is to ensure that the use or threat of use of chemical or biological weapons or radiological contamination against a naval force will be a nondecisive factor in the outcome of any operation. \" 2 Chemical and biological (CB) detection systems are required for Sailors to take pro- tective actions and initiate treatment, as required, to minimize the impact of CB agents that are employed against naval forces. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Di-vision (NSWCDD) performs sustainment in support of CB detection equipment field-ed to the Sailor by providing direct fleet technical expertise and assistance. NSWCDD supports sustainment by: Maintaining technical and logistical documentation Complying with legal and regulatory requirements Acquiring facilities for staging, storing, and maintaining fielded and radiological source detectors Providing configuration management of the Navy's CB detectors Disposing of retired systems Example CB agent detection systems are shown in Figure 1.23 Sustaining the Navy's Chemical and Biological Detection CapabilitiesFigure 1. Examples of Chemical and Biological Agent Detection Systems Sustainment of CB agent detection systems en- ables: Sailors to operate and maintain CB systems and execute the processes that will allow fleet forces to avoid CB contamination The supply system to procure quality spares and repair parts to maintain detection sys-tems Trainers to train the Sailor The support infrastructure to validate/re-vise doctrine, develop and execute im-proved business processes, develop product improvements to reduce operational and support costs, and to enhance the Sailors' operational capability Roles and Responsibilities NSWCDD performs sustainment of CB de- tectors in support of the Naval Sea Systems Com-mand (NAVSEA), Ship Integrity and Performance Engineering Directorate, Damage Control and Personnel Protection (SEA 05P14). These func-tions are performed by the Technical Direction Acquisition Engineering Agent (AEA), In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA), and Configuration Manager (CM). The TDA provides engineering and technical expertise and leader - ship for the Navy's CB detection systems and sup-ports NAVSEA 05P14 in the form of briefings, technical reports, policy instructions, and white papers to support the readiness and sustainment for both shipboard and shore sites. The TDA supports all research, development, testing, and evaluation programs related to the Navy's CB de-tection needs. The AEA provides budgetary, logistician plan- ning, and sustainment of U.S. Navy CB detectors. Responsibilities include asset management, produc-tion of reports and trend analyses from performance data, improvements to logistics and processes to im-prove overall fleet readiness\u2014reducing costs when and where possible\u2014and developing and executing a demilitarization plan for all legacy CB detectors. The ISEA provides effective management of waterfront team assets to support legacy detec-tors. This includes interfacing with ship install teams; monitoring cost, schedule, and performance changes as needed; and responding to routine and emergent fleet issues needing resolution. It also in-cludes maintaining knowledgeable training assets 24 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense Supportand providing training to the Regional Mainte- nance Centers (RMCs) and warfighters. The CM provides technical support to the AEA and ISEA in the form of database analysis and up-dates for configuration, alteration, or logistics data specific to CB detectors. This is done utiliz-ing the Configuration Data Managers Database-Open Architecture (CDMD-OA). CDMD-OA has been designated by NAVSEA 's Logistics, Mainte-nance, and Industrial Operations (SEA 04) as the official repository for all Navy equipment and sys-tems. The CM interfaces with the logisticians, pro-gram manager, Alteration Installation Team, AEA, ISEA, Waterfront Team, and other technical points of contact to obtain the most accurate data in con-currence with the associated life-cycle milestone. Legal and Regulatory Requirements Many of the CB detectors that the Navy uses contain a radiological source, which means that the detector must comply with legal and regulatory re-quirements as dictated by the Radiological Affairs Support Office (RASO). RASO is a detachment of NAVSEA and is responsible for establishing pol-icy for all radioactive material owned by the De-partment of Defense. Currently, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) maintains the Naval Radioactive Material Permit (NRMP) for CB detection systems. This permit al-lows for the handling and distribution of radiation source CB detectors. Compliance with the NRMP is mandated by RASO. The NRMP requires a biyearly physical inven- tory of all radiation-source CB detectors. The in-ventory includes tracking the serial number and location of each CB detector. For fielded assets, NSWC Crane releases a naval message requiring each unit to perform this inventory and provide information back. Units that are nonresponsive to this request are subject to an external audit con-ducted by NSWC Crane. Possible impacts of non-compliance include fines, negative impact to the Commanding Officer's fitness reports, and the re-vocation of the NRMP permit, leaving the fleet without the necessary CB detection capabilities, as required by instruction. For stored assets, NSWC Crane performs the physical inspection of all assets at their facility. Following the inventory, a formal report is sent to RASO, which accounts for all units either through serial number inventory verifica-tion or through a Judge Advocate General Manual investigation of missing units. NSWC Crane will continue to maintain the NRMP for CB detection systems until NSWCDD NRMP's are approved and assets can be legally transferred. NSWCDD is currently building a fa-cility acceptable for staging and maintaining ra-diation-source CB detectors that comply with regulatory requirements. Touching the Fleet When a command has an issue or concern with their CB detection equipment, the ISEA is noti-fied, and the appropriate activities are contacted. An ISEA Waterfront Team from NSWCDD has been established on both the East and West coasts to ad-dress concerns/repairs quickly and efficiently, re-sulting in tremendous cost savings to the Navy. This team is able to provide direct fleet technical support within hours after an issue is raised. Moreover, it can perform limited repairs on some CB detectors, such as the Improved Point Detection System (IPDS) on board ship. This significantly decreases downtime of the equipment, as well as cost per repair. The ISEA Waterfront Team also provides indi- vidualized hands-on training and support to Navy warfighters, technicians, and support staff to in-crease operator and corporate knowledge of CB de-tectors. This includes training for RMC personnel who frequently support CB detectors. The train-ing focuses on troubleshooting minor repairs of shipboard CB detectors. Waterfront training to the warfighter is also provided. Most training is provid-ed by the CB Detector Schoolhouse at the Center of Naval Engineering located at the Norfolk Naval Base, the Navy's Fleet Training Centers, and Afloat Training Groups. Their support includes ensuring that the course curriculum reflects the proper op-eration and maintenance of fielded CB detectors. Training devices are also maintained by the RMCs and the CBR Waterfront Team to ensure that they are fully operational and represent the current con-figuration of fielded CB detectors. Sustainment Supports Readiness NSWCDD, in partnership with NSWC Crane, works to ensure that naval warfighters can contin-ue to rely on their CB detection systems and are trained to use those systems in the event of a chem-ical or biological attack. Accordingly, by sustain-ing CB detection systems, the divisions are actively supporting Navy readiness. References 1. Q uadrennial Defense Review Report, Department of Defense, Feb- ruary 2010. 2.

A photograph of the damage caused by the terrorist attack on USS Cole is shown in Figure 1.2 In reflecting on the attack, what if the terrorists had used chemical or biological weapons? Would the Sailors have been prepared? Would the shipboard systems have been operable? Would the Sailors have been trained to use the equipment? The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA)\u2014in response to Surface Warfare En- terprise (SWE) and Naval Air Enterprise (NAE) concerns of heightened risk of a weap-ons of mass destruction (WMD) attack\u2014established the Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense (CBRD) Readiness Support Policy in 2007 to increase afloat fleet CBRD readiness. This policy launched the Readiness Assist Visit (RAV) Program that provides a comprehensive CBRD assessment to all ships within 90 days of deployment. The purpose of the RAV is threefold: 1. A ssess all chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) equipment and systems 2. T rain shipboard personnel in operation and maintenance 3. I nventory and issue the chemical and biological warfare agent consumables The following equipment and systems are assessed during the course of a visit: Collective Protection System (CPS) Improved Point Detection System (IPDS) Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Dry Filter Unit (DFU) Radiological Detectors Portable Chemical Agent Detectors Decontamination Since its inception, the RA V team has increased CBRD readiness by an average of 49 percent on more than 170 ships. A RA V team assessing the JBAIDS on board USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7) is shown in Figure 2.27 CBRD Waterfront Team Improves Fleet ReadinessIn February 2009, following the success of the RAV Program, NAVSEA chartered a Navy CBRD Waterfront Fleet Support Team, which was en-dorsed by Fleet Forces Command and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The Waterfront Team, centered at Naval Station Norfolk and Naval Base San Diego, boasts over 140 years of combined shipboard experience. In addition to the RAV sup-port, the Waterfront Team provides: Centralized consumables management Shipboard support to CBR commodity owners Management of the CBRD website New CBRD equipment installation support Subject matter expert (SME) support for CBR training Publication and documentation SME sup-port Centralized Consumables Management With warehouse space located on both coasts, the CBRD Waterfront Team is responsible for cen- trally managing all chemical and biological detec-tion consumables. These consumables are very costly and have stringent shelf-life criterion, which makes it overly burdensome for the ships to individually manage. In managing the consumable material on Figure 1.

Approximately 23,000 sq ft of Storage in Norfolk, Virginia, Houses Equipment and Consumables for Various CBR Commoditiesbehalf of the fleet, the Waterfront Team is able to in- crease readiness and maximize cost efficiencies by le-veraging the RAV program to field the material to deploying ships and then return the material to a ro-tational pool when ships come back from deploy-ment. All material is bar-coded, which provides the ability to track expiration dates and maximize shelf life. This alleviates the need for each ship to conduct an annual inventory, since the bar-coded inventory is automatically rolled up to the Annual Report to Congress (ARC). A storage facility in Norfolk, Vir - ginia, that houses equipment and consumables for various CBR commodities is shown in Figure 3. Shipboard Support to CBR Commodity Owners Various CBR commodity owners fund the Wa- terfront Team to provide direct fleet support on their behalf. Particularly noteworthy is the support pro-vided to the CPS and Detection Acquisition Engi-neering Agents (AEAs), and to the program manager for the JBPDS. In 2010, the Waterfront Team\u2014in conjunction with the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) and the Naval Education and the Training Program Development Center (NETPDC)\u2014filmed a CPS filter change-out on board USS Cole . This vid- eo will be used as a training tool to provide increased fleet awareness and shipboard support. The ware-houses are also utilized to store and stage CPS filters for each change-out. In late 2009, the Radiological Affairs Support Office (RASO) authorized a \"U\" radiation permit, which allows repairs of IPDS units to be conduct-ed in the laboratories located at both warehouses. By conducting the repairs, the ship is no longer re-quired to requisition a new unit. Consequently, this Waterfront Team effort will save the Navy a project- ed $2 million annually while this system is fielded. A photograph of a CBR Waterfront Team member conducting IPDS repairs in the Norfolk, Virginia, laboratory is shown in Figure 4. Management of the CBRD Website The CBRD Waterfront Support Team is also responsible for maintaining the CBRD website. 29 CBRD Waterfront Team Improves Fleet ReadinessThe website provides valuable information that the more than 1800 registered Sailors can access 24/7, including the most current CBR guidance and doc-umentation, as well as a plethora of other resourc-es. The \" Ask the Expert\" function included on the website allows questions to be e-mailed to the Wa-terfront Team; Sailors typically receive appropriate direction within 24 hours. The CBRD website al-lows the Waterfront Support Team to provide dis-tance support for deployed units, including ships operating in theater. New CBRD Equipment Installation Support In addition to CBR sustainment efforts, the Wa- terfront Team also supports new equipment instal- lations. The Norfolk, Virginia, warehouse serves as the site for the acceptance testing and inventorying of each JBPDS, JBAIDS, and Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) prior to initial fielding. SME Support for CBR Training Given the ever-increasing terrorist threat, training for CBR events is improving. The Water - front Team recently helped to develop shipboard drills and scenarios in conjunction with the staff at Commander, Third Fleet. The drills help to train and assess first responders and support person-nel in the collection and processing of simulated biological warfare agents\u2014from discovery to final analysis confirmation. Publication and Documentation SME Support Existing doctrine, as promulgated in the Sur - face Force Training Manual , mandates shipboard Figure 4. A CBR Waterfront Team Member Conducts Improved Point Detection System (IPDS) Repairs in the Norfolk, Virginia, Laboratory 30 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense Support training in a CBR environment. For many years, the manual was tailored for scenarios that no longer reflect the current \"real-world threat. \" Li-aisons with the Commander, Naval Surface Forc-es (CNSF); the Afloat Training Group (ATG); the numbered fleet commanders; and the CBRD Wa-terfront Support Team have resulted in an updated version to be released soon. The revision includes mandatory drills for biological warfare and a more robust self-assessment to be conducted by ship personnel on CBR systems and equipment. Emergency Life Support System At the request of the CNSF, the CBRD Water - front Team recently joined in a teaming effort with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City to in-clude assessment and training of the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) charging systems dur - ing the RAV . This system provides breathing air to emergency responders on board ship in the case of fires and/or toxic gas emissions. Although SCBA systems fall outside of the CBRD scope, cost effi-ciencies are realized by utilizing RAV , since the team is already on board the ship conducting an assess-ment and training of the CBR equipment.Conclusion In today's world of terrorist threats, ships must be capable of operating in a CBR environ-ment. The possibility of a CBR attack on a na-val ship is no longer remote. For many years, it was the responsibility of the ship's damage-con-trol organization to equip the ship for all CBR and damage-control contingencies. Today, the CBRD Waterfront Team outfits each ship with the nec-essary CBR equipment and supplies prior to de-ployment, and trains Sailors in the operation and maintenance of all CBR systems and equipment. Though the CBRD Waterfront Support Team is a relatively new initiative, the proven increase in readiness and knowledge of Sailors demonstrates that the program is paramount in establishing and maintaining readiness for the warfighter on the front line.

In what has become an extremely fast-paced environment, the warfight-ers were in desperate need of a logistics support solution that ensured they were consistently provided with fully serviceable individual pro-tection equipment (IPE)\u2014capable of preventing or reducing individ-ual exposures when faced with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. To deal with this challenge, a partnership was formed between the Navy's resource, requirements, and materiel de-velopment offices. This partnership has been focused on improving the materiel readiness and sustainment affordability of this vital equipment. Combining principles drawn from the concepts for reduction of Total Ownership Cost and LEAN thinking, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA); the Office for Chemical and Biological Defense; and the Na-val Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), Ex-treme Environments and Life Support Branch, have implemented an extremely successful business transformation for the management of the Navy's IPE assets, known as the IPE Readiness Improvement Pro-gram (RIP). The foundation that makes the IPE RIP successful is based on three core concepts: 1. IP E kit bags, one per each warfighter 2. Q uantitative fit testing and sizing of the individual warfighters for proper-fitting chemical protective clothing and masks 3. C entralized management of the Navy-wide IPE assetsEditor's Note: In August 2010, the author, Mike Carl, passed away, leaving a legacy of excel-lence in support of chemical, bio-logical, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) defense systems. This article is a testament to his skill and devotion in providing CBRN solutions for our warfighters.33 Chemical and Biological Defense Individual Protection Equipment Materiel Readiness Improvement Program Figure 1. Individual Protection Equipment (IPE): Protective GearReadiness Improvement Program (RIP) The concept of the RIP began in 2002. At that time, combatant commanders realized that they had an urgent need to: Promote the capability to have their war- fighters have their protective gear close at hand (see Figure 1) Give better care to the equipment Aid in the accountability of the equipment In response to warfighter feedback, the NAVSEA Office for Chemical and Biological Defense and the NSWC PCD, Extreme Environments and Life Support Branch analyzed various alternatives for meeting the combatant commander needs. The most noteworthy alternative identified by this working group was the RIP . The most attractive feature of the program is the fact that it would not only address combatant commander needs, but it would also ensure that forward-deployed and deploying forces were provided with properly sized IPE ready for immediate retrieval in response to the dictated mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) condition, which includes a fully serviceable, properly fitted chemical protective mask. In order to meet the combatant commanders' need to have protective gear close at hand, give bet-ter care to the equipment, and aid in the account-ability of the equipment, it was necessary to provide the equipment as a serialized kit that could be is-sued to each individual warfighter (see Figure 2). Legacy Process\u2014Prior to RIP This legacy process, as reflected in Figure 3, provided limited accountability, and unsatisfacto- ry materiel and operational readiness, and was a burden to the warfighter. This is greatly due to lim-ited oversight and inaccurate inventories of equip-ment assets. Current Process It was clearly evident that the forces deploy- ing in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) were not at adequate chemical and biological de-fense (CBD) readiness levels, and that the typi-cal way of doing business would not support the 34 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense Supportimmediate requirements for OIF or future CBD operations. The partnership, by implementing pol-icy and doctrinal changes, morphed the operations and support (O&S) processes for maintaining the Navy's IPE into the current process reflected in Figure 4. The key components of the process are to provide centralized asset management and to con-duct fit-testing and sizing operations, ensuring that forward-deployed and deploying forces are, in fact, provided with properly sized IPE ready for imme-diate retrieval in response to various MOPP condi-tions, and that this equipment is fully serviceable with a properly fitted chemical protective mask. The IPE Commodity Area is a diverse organi- zation that is strategically positioned to fully meet the demands of the Navy Warfare Enterprises. The organizational structure selected provides the most favorable cost, as compared to the amount of resources, facilities, response time, etc., that is required and provided. The Navy IPE support or - ganization and locations are depicted in Figure 5. Centralized Assets Management The foundation that makes the IPE RIP suc- cessful is the centralized management of the Navy-wide assets, and the cornerstone of the management of these assets is the NAVSEA Consolidated Stor - age Facility (CSF), which is located at Fort Worth, Texas. This is a Government Services Administra-tion (GSA)-owned/customer-leased facility that is approximately 240-K square feet of completely uti-lized space.Figure 3. Legacy Process Figure 2.

Fit Testing and Sizing During fit testing and sizing (see Figure 7), the following activities are performed: Perform protective mask sizing and quanti-tative fit testing using JSMLT Perform IPE sizing and fit verification Provide a data file populated with mask and IPE sizing data Have the individual sign a page 13 contain-ing fitting, sizing, and personal data Provide training on the conduct of mask fit-ting and IPE sizing with designated personnel Provide training on the operation of the TDA-99M or JSMLT with designated personnel Conclusion The NAVSEA CBD IPE RIP has been a colossal success in maintaining a high level of materiel and operational readiness that is affordable, providing the Warfare Enterprise with the capability to operate effectively and decisively in the face of CBRN threats. Implementing the RIP\u2014and thereby redirect- ing the O&S requirements for the inventory, care, and maintenance of this vital equipment\u2014has en-abled a severely undermanned and overburdened warfighting community to focus on the more cru-cial aspects of their missions: training, logistics sup-port, and execution. Plus, not only is the materiel and operational readiness consistently sustained at combat-ready levels, but the overall Navy's Total Ownership Cost has been significantly decreased. Figure 6.

As he made his way down to medical, he collapsed and be- gan coughing up blood. Even to the untrained seaman who helped him to medical, Rod-gers' condition clearly represented something unusual. Naturally occurring or maliciously spread infectious diseases pose a direct threat to warfighters, ships, and the fleet. Doctors and corpsmen are trained to methodically di-agnose patients using their knowledge, resources, and contacts to handle infectious dis-eases, but without proper facilities and protocol, many Sailors remain at risk. Given the Navy's global presence, the preceding example of a shipborne infectious disease outbreak is a real possibility. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 represented an actual example that put many Navy personnel in the Pacific region at high risk of being exposed to the deadly disease. A subsequent review of medical protocol and emergency response plans for infectious disease outbreaks clear - ly indicated that there was a need for an isolation and quarantine capability aboard U.S. Navy ships. Figure 1 shows the aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN 73) being moved by tugboats to a pier in Busan, Republic of Korea. In 2005, Commander Third Fleet (C3F) sponsored a limited-scope evaluation of a temporary shipboard isolation and quarantine (SIQ) capability. The evaluation as-sessed the feasibility of using existing damage-control equipment (de-smoking fans, smoke curtains, etc.) and commercial high-efficiency particulate air filter and ultra-violet air purification equipment to meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended guidelines for air exchanges, directional airflow, negative pres-sure, and air-cleaning requirements. Engineering support for this effort was provided by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), and medical support was provided by the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC). The ship's damage control equipment was found capable of meeting the CDC guidelines; however, poor access for medical personnel and environmental control of the space were identified as obstacles to ensure proper patient care if the capability was required for more than a 24-hour peri-od. A makeshift anteroom aboard CVN 76 for the 2005 experiment is shown in Figure 2.39 Shipboard Isolation and Quarantine: Protecting Sailors From Infectious Diseases Figure 1. 100721-N-2013O-422 BUSAN, Republic of Korea (21 July 2010) Tugboats move the aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN 73) to a pier in Busan, Republic of Korea. This is the first port visit for George Washington during its 2010 summer patrol in the western Pacific Ocean and the second visit to Busan by the ship since October 2008. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Charles Oki/Released) The evaluation revealed that the commercial air-purification equipment performed well, but was not suitable for shipboard application due to size, weight, and noise factors. In their final report, NHRC staff identified elements that were essen-tial for proper patient care. They also identified the need to examine doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) elements in relation to the potential SIQ capability. Some of the recommenda-tions made by NHRC included: A vestibule for controlled entry and exit Sufficient storage for personal protective equipment Personal hygiene supplies Proper food and laundry delivery/removal processes Access to toilet and shower facilities These capability gaps were confirmed by C3F as the \"next steps\" in developing the SIQ capability. Developing this capability for the fleet was giv- en a higher priority in 2009, as influenza virus H1N1 spread around the world and became a potential threat to fleet readiness. In response, a SIQ Limit - ed Objective Experiment (LOE) was approved by Shipboard Isolation and Quarantine: Protecting Sailors From Infectious Diseases Figure 2. Makeshift Anteroom for the 2005 Limited-Scope Evaluation 40 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense Supportthe Joint Requirements Office for Chemical, Bio- logical, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense and was subsequently funded by the Joint Program Exec-utive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD). Objectives of the current LOE are to: Identify materiel and nonmateriel solutions for establishing SIQ capability on the Navy's large-deck amphibious ships Develop tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and medical protocol that can be used in conjunction with SIQ space Analyze DOTMLPF impacts of providing SIQ capabilities to the fleet The SIQ LOE Team completed a 3-day tabletop exercise in May 2010 to evaluate the preliminary TTPs, identify potential materiel requirements, and begin to list DOTMLPF impacts. The final phase of the LOE was a live experiment on board a Navy ship to test the revised TTPs using a SIQ area mock-up provided by JPEO-CBD and NSWCDD. A photograph of the SIQ LOE live experiment is shown in Figure 3. In line with the original objectives, the LOE should result in a more mature understanding of the DOTMLPF impacts, TTPs, and materiel re-quirements. The goal is to protect warfighters from the spread of infectious disease and maximize fleet readiness by providing the foundation for this iso-lation and quarantine capability. Once achieved, warfighters will benefit from safe and effective SIQ capabilities that protect them from exposure to in-fectious diseases.

The JPEO-CBD established the MDAP Trail Boss in response to a 2006 General Ac- counting Office (GAO) Report. The GAO report found that the integration of CBRND capabilities was not consistent across the nine major weapons systems and platforms re-viewed. This inconsistency resulted in duplication of effort and an increased risk to the warfighter due to interoperability issues. 1 The Trail Boss concept ensures consistent inte- gration of CBRND capabilities across the military services by: Building partnerships for the integration of technology Building consensus for major governance and acquisition decisions Being responsible for horizontal integration across the enterprise In January 2011, the JPM offices for Collective Protection, Individual Protection, and Decontamination converged into a single organization, the JPM Office for Protec-tion. At the same time, the JPM Office for Protection became the MDAP Trail Boss. The MDAP Trail Boss is responsible for facilitating research, development, testing, procure-ment, operations and sustainment, and delivery of CBRND systems in support of plat-forms designated CBR mission critical, as well as those requiring CBRND capabilities. The MDAP Trail Boss focuses on coordinating with the supported program man- ager early in the acquisition process to ensure that their CBRND capability require-ments are adequately addressed in a way that minimizes redundancy of effort across the Department of Defense (DoD) throughout the life cycle of the platform. MDAP sup-ports the development of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) con-cept of operations (CONOPS) for the host platform, which can then be used, along with 43 Joint Project Manager for Protection Leverages NSWCDD's Systems Engineering and Integration Expertise in New Trail Boss Rolecapability documents and the projected threat, to derive the platform's CBRND requirements. The MDAP Trail Boss is divided into five product areas: 1. G round Mobile (i.e., ground vehicles) 2. S hips 3. A ircraft (e.g., rotary and fixed-wing) 4. Fix ed Site (i.e., buildings) 5. T ransportable (i.e., portable shelters and gear worn by the warfighter) To assist in executing the MDAP Trail Boss responsibilities, the JPM for Protection assigned NSWCDD the role of Director for CBRN Surviv-ability and MDAP Support (currently held by the author). This position is supported by a team of NSWCDD system engineers. This Systems Engi-neering Team documents the requirements derived from the CONOPS and the program's capabili-ty documents, along with the methods to be used to validate these requirements in a Requirements Traceability Matrix. By leveraging the expertise across the JPEO enterprise, the CBRND require-ments are then used to identify the total family of subsystems and components from the JPEO-CBD portfolio, which satisfy platform CBRND capabil-ity requirements within the platform's cost, sched-ule, and performance parameters. This family is known as the CBRND capability set (CapSet). For example, the MDAP Trail Boss is working closely with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program to devel-op a chemical and biological (CB) defense CapSet to meet the program's survivability and force pro-tection requirements (see Figure 1). The JSF Oper - ational Requirements Document (ORD) requires that the aircraft must be designed to facilitate pilot survivability and facilitate decontamination when exposed to CB agents. To address these critical re-quirements, the MDAP Trail Boss and his partners are developing a CB defense CapSet consisting of a flight mask and an aircraft decontamination sys-tem for use in the JSF live fire testing. The MDAP Trail Boss's use of the systems en- gineering process ensures consistent application and integration of CBRND capabilities through-out the DoD. This process prevents duplication of effort, assists programs in achieving their CBRN survivability requirements, increases interopera-bility amongst the various platforms, and affirms that CBRND systems are sustainable through-out the life of the platform. As more platforms integrate CBRND capabilities, the joint force com-manders will see a significant increase in CBRND situational awareness, enhancing the Soldier, Sail-or, Airmen, and Marines' ability to continue effec-tive operations in the presence of a CBRND threat.

These systems utilize specialized filtration, detection, notification, and decontamination equipment to provide safe working environments for facilities such as command and control centers, communication nodes, and medical facilities. Personnel from the CBR Protection and Integration Branch of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) lead multiple CBRD integration projects at DoD and government facilities. These projects have varied from small-scale retrofit ef-forts to multimillion-dollar construction programs in locations ranging from the Wash-ington, D.C., metropolitan area to facilities overseas in multiple areas of responsibility. Working under the umbrella of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Bi-ological Defense (JPEO-CBD), NSWCDD partners with other organizations\u2014includ-ing Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other sponsors and programs\u2014to develop and field facility CBRD systems. Working with these partners, NSWCDD personnel develop and field optimal solutions and systems that sup-port critical missions, reduce life-cycle costs, and shape the future of fixed-facility CBRD. Facility CBRD System Design Effective CBRD systems in facilities provide a significant level of protection for building occupants against internal and external threats. These systems range from ro-bust architectures that ensure mission continuity to low-impact design changes that increase protection and support evacuation. They also affect the long-term impact of restoration after an attack, as CBRD systems can reduce the spread of contaminants in a facility, reducing the time and cost of remediation. In 2008, the DoD published Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-024-01, Security En- gineering: Procedures for Designing Airborne Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Pro-tection for Buildings . 1 This document, developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 45 Fixed-Facility Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense (CBRD): Protecting Building Occupants From Airborne Threatswith the support of other DoD activities including NSWCDD, provides minimum criteria and design guidance for facility CBRD systems. UFC 4-024 - 01 is intended for building owners, antiterrorism/force protection (AT/FP) specialists, and archi-tects and engineers to ensure that facilities include equipment and design elements to protect against CBR threats. The document focuses on systems that provide occupants with protection for mis-sion durations of days to weeks, as well as low-cost measures that can be implemented at any facility to provide some level of protection for occupants. The measures described in UFC 4-024-01 include enhanced measures beyond those described in an-other DoD document, UFC 4-010-01, DoD Mini-mum Antiterrorism Standards for . systems implemented at most mis- sion-critical facilities include: Equipment to provide for the collective pro-tection of occupants Detection of threats inside and outside the facility Means to decontaminate personnel Facility collective protection systems provide contaminant-free areas within a facility, enabling personnel to move about freely without individ-ual protective equipment. These systems include air filtration using military-grade carbon and high- efficiency particulate arresting (HEPA) filters, which remove chemical and biological agents, radiological particles, and many toxic industrial chemicals (see Figure 2). Collectively protected spaces are main-tained at an overpressure (generally less than 0.5 inches water gauge (inwg)) with respect to sur - rounding areas; such low overpressures reduce the fan and filtration equipment costs and are gener - ally unnoticeable to the general public. Detection systems must be capable of detecting threats in low quantities in the air. These detectors are often lo-cated at intakes and interior areas such as corridors and lobbies. Additionally, detectors may be locat-ed in fixed positions around the facility perime-ter, providing an early-warning standoff detection capability. Facility missions with a requirement to in-process personnel during a CBR event also in-corporate entry decontamination. These solutions range from stand-alone systems that can be expe-diently set up to fully integrated decontamination stations permanently installed in a building. Although the measures discussed can present a significant capital and sustainment cost, rela-tively simple modifications, such as those listed in UFC 4-010-01, can greatly increase its protective posture. One such modification is the location of Figure 1. Artist's Rendering of a Notional Government Facility With Integrated CBRD Systems 46 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense Supporta building's outside air intake. Consider that many airborne threats are heavier than air and collect in low-lying areas. Shifting facility air intakes to the highest possible point will greatly reduce the potential for contaminants to enter the build-ing's airstream. Second, many facilities utilize air shutoff switches located in lobbies and public ar - eas. When an airborne threat is identified, activa-tion of these switches can rapidly shut down the building's outside air supply, thus allowing facil-ity occupants to shelter in place until the threat has passed. Finally, extensive sealing of a build-ing's envelope is being widely adopted in both the government and commercial sectors. By reduc-ing air leakage through walls, windows, and roofs, two benefits are realized: 1. Th e building is better suited to block the in- filtration of airborne threats. 2. En ergy efficiency is increased by limiting the loss of conditioned air. A widely used target for envelope leakage is 0.25 cubic feet per minute of air per square foot of envelope area (CFM/ft 2) at 0.30 inwg of over - pressure\u2014a significant improvement when con-sidering that many buildings today have envelope leakage rates of 1.0 CFM/ft 2 and greater.Challenges and Opportunities Facilities present a significantly different oper - ating environment from traditional military CBRD platforms such as ships, shelters, and vehicles. Fa-cilities also pose unique challenges to system de-signers, as well as opportunities not available in other systems. First, consider the challenge of protecting the wide array of personnel that occupy a given pro-tected facility. In most government or DoD build-ings, occupants range from military personnel with extensive experience and training in crisis manage-ment and operation in CBR environments, to ci-vilian and contractor personnel who may not have similar education or background, to visitors and guests who may not have any familiarity at all. Moreover, facility populations will vary through-out the day. Second, consider the tenant-landlord ar - rangements being implemented today as part of a service-based approach at many installations, which can present conflicts between building op-erators and tenant missions regarding CBRD re-quirements. System designers and operators must take into account the static nature of facilities. Unlike other platforms, such as ships and vehicles Figure 2. CBR Collective Protection Filter Housings Installed in a Facility 47 Fixed-Facility Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense (CBRD): Protecting Building Occupants From Airborne Threatsthat can move to avoid a threat, buildings are fixed in location. Finally, consider that many facilities that house critical missions are high-profile and are often in the public eye. This high-profile visibility increases the probability of an attack and necessitates taking measures to ensure that protection systems remain invisible and seamless within the facility. The unique nature of fixed facilities also can present opportunities for CBRD systems. CBRD systems can benefit greatly from the mature build-ing construction industry, as products and meth-ods are often developed in industry that can be applied to building CBRD systems. Additional-ly, the pharmaceutical, clean room, manufactur - ing, and nuclear markets significantly overlap with CBRD and frequently develop dual-use products that can be used in building protection systems. Need for System Integration Traditionally, fixed-facility CBRD efforts have been highly compartmentalized, with each func-tion (such as collective protection, detection, or decontamination) focusing only on its respective area (see Figure 3). In these cases, the equipment and systems did not communicate, interact with, or utilize the functions of other areas. This stove-piped approach often resulted in increased costs due to redundant functions or gaps in protective posture. Building managers were also frustrated by this ap-proach because they had to serve as the gener - al contractors, as well as integrated CBRD subject matter experts for their facilities. With these issues in mind, the integration of subsystems into the overall protective strategy for the building is critical. Thus, a systems engineer - ing approach ensures that the protection system meets the mission needs and that the integrated so-lution is greater than the sum of its parts. Integra-tion teams must consider materiel solutions, as well as the development of concept of operations, sus-tainment, and training. This systems engineering effort must focus on developing an integrated ar - chitecture that utilizes components or subsystems to provide CBRD. Integration is complex and re-quires expertise in engineering design, systems en-gineering, and operational planning. The need for integration of CBRD in fixed fa- cilities becomes critical as major programs address CBR survivability requirements for fully integrated weapons systems. NSWCDD is home to the office of the Product Director, Fixed CBR Survivabili-ty (PD-FCS) within the Joint Project Manager for Collective Protection (JPM-ColPro), one of nine Figure 3. Typical Fixed-Facility Command and Control Center 48 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense SupportJPMs reporting to the JPEO-CBD. The PD -FCS s erves as the lead for fixed-facility CBRD efforts throughout the DoD, including coordination be- tween partner agencies, development of design guidance and practices, and oversight of develop-ment and integration efforts. Path Forward for Fixed-Facility CBRD Solutions for future fixed CBRD systems must balance the need for increased protection for build- ing occupants, while considering the long-term cost and impact of these systems. Key areas of in-terest to the user community include: Increasing the capabilities of currently field-ed equipment and methods Developing lower-burden systems that can effectively and affordably protect a wider building population Providing opportunities for reduced opera-tions and maintenance cost These key areas, when implemented in new and existing facilities, offer the potential to signifi-cantly impact the future of fixed CBRD. Addition-ally, efforts are underway to investigate the use of protective architectures and facility heating, ven-tilation, and air-conditioning (HV AC) systems to mitigate the effect of releases in buildings. These ef-forts increase building CBRD through the use of detection-based airflow modifications using fans, dampers, and exhaust systems. In these cases, a detector alarm can trigger changes within a facil-ity, such as shutting down air-handling units, acti-vating standby filtration units or exhaust systems, or generating tenant alarms. By automatically im-plementing measures based on detection triggers, the spread of contaminants inside the building can be minimized. Ongoing efforts by NSWCDD en-gineers seek to optimize these integrated architec-tures and field systems in test locations. Recently, PD-FCS\u2014with Joint Project Man- ager Guardian (JPM-Guardian)\u2014fielded a low-impact protection system at an installation in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. This system operates with outside air systems in low speed (ap-proximately 15 to 30 percent) in normal opera-tions using a variable-frequency drive system, and ramps to full speed in a threat environment. This mode reduces the energy consumption of the fan system during normal operations and is intended to extend the operational life of the CBR filters for several additional years. This system remains un-der study to determine long-term benefits. As part of another effort, PD-FCS, with JPM- Guardian, constructed and tested a fixed collective protection test bed intended to evaluate facility de-sign and operation parameters (see Figure 4). As part of this effort, the project team constructed a fil-tration and air-movement system, and a 1,300 - ft2 test structure with airflow, differential pressure, and Figure 4. Fixed-Facility Test-Bed Structure in the Test Chamber 49 Fixed-Facility Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense (CBRD): Protecting Building Occupants From Airborne Threats chemical sensors. This package was placed inside a test facility and exposed to an external chemical simulant challenge. During this testing, the over - pressure, leakage, and wind speed were varied to de-termine the impact on building protection. Testing and analyses are ongoing, but results at this point are already proving valuable to system designers. Future testing plans include biological agent testing, additional chemical simulant testing, and experi-mentation with new architectures and technologies. Conclusion CBR and nuclear attacks remain a threat to DoD and government assets, including fixed fa-cilities. Implementation of CBRD systems at these sites can result in sustainment of mission, personnel protection, and reduction of scope and time for postattack remediation. When considered carefully during building design, construction, and renovation, these systems can be implemented with significant effectiveness and relatively mini-mal impact to tenant operations and life-cycle cost. NSWCDD engineers continue to lead the devel-opment, design, and fielding of these critical life-safety systems, and will continue to partner with industry, DoD, and other government agencies to further fixed-facility CBRD.

It also became necessary at that time to establish a capability to rapidly analyze quality assurance (QA) samples for biological defense, as environmental sampling capabilities throughout the NCR highlighted several op-erational challenges for the Department of Defense (DoD). Screening associated with the anthrax letters of 2001 and other perceived threats quickly forced the DoD gold- standard laboratories\u2014such as the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC)\u2014away from their mission of routine research and development, and occasional sample analysis, to analytical production facilities. Although available laboratories successful-ly accommodated the nation's needs, their staffs were inundated as the high volume of samples produced by the NCR sampling effort easily overloaded the laboratories beyond the sampling capacity that these organizations were designed to perform. Moreover, timely analysis within these laboratories was constrained by limited available laboratory space, personnel, and analytical instruments. In response to these challenges, the Joint Program Office (JPO)\u2014now the Joint Pro- gram Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD)\u2014deployed the Dry Filter Unit (DFU) as a sample collection system. The DFU is used to collect aerosolized particles on filters. While some filters can be screened using a hand-held as-say (HHA), similar to a pregnancy test, analysis of such a large number of filter samples requires production-level laboratories dedicated solely to the analysis of the filters. The JPO worked with the Pentagon and other government agencies to create a contractor-owned and -operated facility. Midwest Research Institute (MRI) was awarded the con-tract to operate the NCR laboratory.51 Biological Defense Quality Assurance Sample Technical LaboratoryNCR Laboratory The NCR laboratory is one of many laboratories that constantly analyze environmental samples for the JPEO-CBD Lab-QA Program. The NCR Lab-oratory actively employs a proven and optimized set of standard operating procedures and detec-tion assays transitioned mostly from USAMRIID, a gold-standard laboratory. To provide addition-al confidence about the quality of the analysis per - formed within the NCR laboratory, the JPEO - CBD established a QA, testing, verification, and valida-tion program (Lab-QA Program) in 2002 to mon-itor the performance of the laboratory. Since that time, environmental monitoring expanded to a re-gional laboratory that supports samples collected for: The Installation Protection Program (JPM-Guardian) Operations at the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Command (ECBC), Edgewood, Maryland Operations undertaken by the National Guard Bureau's Civil Support Teams (CSTs) The Lab-QA Program is oriented for laborato-ries utilizing government reagents for routine en-vironmental biological hazard testing but also can provide rapid testing when required. The Lab-QA Program currently exists in two parts: 1. D evelopment and management of the strate- gy for QA and proficiency test (PT) samples using a Lab-QA Program contractor under the discretionary guidance of the JPEO-CBD. 2. P roduction and distribution of the QA and PT samples using a quality assurance sample technical laboratory (QA lab). The Lab-QA Program allows the results of the laborato-ry to be presented with increased confidence that the results are accurate and that standard operating procedures are being followed. Analytical testing of samples ranges from initial screening using the HHA to more comprehensive laboratory analysis utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or electrochemilumi-nescence (ECL) immunoassay techniques. These techniques assist in determining the presence or ab-sence of a particular threat. Figure 1 shows a scien-tist operating the BioVeris M1M, which is used for ECL to detect bacteria, viruses, and toxins/proteins. A major facet of establishing and maintaining the credibility of an analytical laboratory is the abil-ity of the laboratory to detect samples spiked with known inactivated targets at a known concentra-tion. QA samples serve as the positive and negative controls that are required for the validation of any laboratory experiment. The Naval Surface Warfare Figure 1. Scientist Operating the BioVeris M1M Used for Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) to Detect Bacteria, Viruses, and Toxins/Proteins Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) serves as the QA lab for the Lab-QA Program. The QA lab prepares the sample blanks and spikes used by the analytical laboratories for routine analysis, PT, and special studies, as determined by the JPEO-CBD. The sample spikes contain inactivated biowarfare threat agents supplied by the Critical Reagents Pro-gram (CRP). The QA samples are designed to eval-uate whether or not the analytical laboratory meets the JPEO-CBD's expectations for long-term false-negative and false-positive rates. The QA sample results generated must meet minimum statistically relevant acceptability standards, and the analytical laboratory's performance must be consistent with other peer laboratories. Beyond supporting the Navy, the DoD and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recent-ly entered into an interagency agreement speci-fying that the QA lab will provide QA samples to both agencies on a weekly basis. There are 29 Lab-oratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories that support the DHS BioWatch Program. During any given week, the QA lab could ship anywhere from 33 to 90 small boxes containing QA or PT samples. The NSWCDD QA lab, therefore, represents an important and integral part of an overall process to help ensure that the American people are protected from the threat of biological warfare attacks.52 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense SupportField Activity Support to the Naval Treaty Implementation Program By Matthew J. Hornbaker The United States is signatory to over 60 treaties and agreements pertaining to arms control, many of which have the potential to impact U.S. Navy and Marine Corps pro- grams. These treaties are important international confidence-building measures that enhance global and regional stability. All U.S. Navy and Marine Corps programs are re-quired to adhere to arms control compliance requirements, obligations, and constraints as an integral part of their planning, acquisition, and operational processes. The Naval Treaty Implementation Program (NTIP) provides the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN (RDA)) comprehensive support for the oversight of arms control implementation, compliance, and verification. Under the NTIP Compliance Assessment Program (CAP), senior military and civilian personnel assess U.S. Navy and Marine Corps programs to identify and resolve poten-tial arms control compliance concerns. If necessary, NTIP provides inspection planning, preparation, and on-site support. Chemical, biological, and radiological defense (CBRD) program managers need to maintain heightened awareness of treaties and agreements that pertain to CBRD. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), for example, prohibits the development, pro-duction, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer, and use of chemical weapons. The Biologi-cal Weapons Convention (BWC) prohibits States Parties from developing, producing, stockpiling, acquiring, or retaining biological agents, toxins, or weapons. The Open Skies Treaty obligates States Parties to accept unarmed aerial observation flights of their national territory using aircraft equipped with sensors and recording devices. Under the terms of the arms control agreements ratified by the United States, Navy and Marine Corps activities and facilities are candidates for comprehensive, intrusive, in-ternational verification inspections. For example, the CWC contains a provision whereby 53 Field Activity Support to the Naval Treaty Implementation Program a State Party can question another State Party's com- pliance and request a short-notice, on-site inspec-tion, referred to as a CWC Challenge Inspection. In the event of a treaty-related activity\u2014such as a CWC Challenge Inspection or an Open Skies obser - vation flight\u2014NTIP provides assistance to a com-mand, installation, or program. A command is not allowed to deny or delay one of these events. Con-sequently, scheduled exercises, operations, and tests may be interrupted, delayed, or canceled in order to support the affected activity's compliance require-ments. NTIP steps in to help ensure that treaty ob-ligations are met while simultaneously safeguarding national security. In the event of a CWC Challenge Inspection, NTIP deploys an Assistance Team comprising three integrated teams: 1. T reaty Management Center (TMC) Team 2. P oint of Entry (POE) Team 3. T iger Team Each of these teams works closely with the fa- cility commander's inspection planning staff for the duration of the event. The TMC functions as the central source of authority and information; it deploys Assistance Team personnel to the affect-ed facility to collect, record, and compile inspec-tion-related information. The POE Team serves as liaison between NTIP and the host command's security office. The Tiger Team facilitates com-munication, supports preparation activities, and performs analysis of the compliance concern. Fig-ure 1 shows an inspection team preparing to en-ter an ammunition storage bunker during a CWC Challenge Inspection exercise. To execute its mission, NTIP utilizes sever - al field activity support offices staffed by person-nel from the: Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), China Lake, California Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), Dahlgren, Virginia Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division (NSWCIHD), Indian Head, Mary-land Field Activity personnel assist NTIP by provid- ing equipment and subject matter expertise to sup-port NTIP Tiger Team training exercises and stand by to support in the event of a Challenge Inspection. 53Field Activity Support to the Naval Treaty Implementation Program54 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense SupportNAWS China Lake is a Navy-operated, air - borne weapons testing and training range located in California at the southeastern base of the Sier - ra Nevada Mountains. NTIP support personnel in China Lake comprise the Non-Strategic Treaty Co-ordination Office. They are organizationally aligned with the Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Di-vision (NAWCWD), a NAWS China Lake tenant command. The Non-Strategic Treaty Coordination Office is positioned to serve as an \" Advance Team\" to support NTIP activities on the West Coast by ar - riving prior to the main NTIP Assist Team to initi-ate coordination efforts. The Non-Strategic Treaty Coordination Office maintains a backup of NTIP's two critical treaty support systems: Treaty Infor - mation Management System (TIMS) and the Trea-ty Library System (TLS). The team also conducts regular Open Skies, CWC, and CAP training and outreach efforts to ensure that research, develop-ment, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) personnel and acquisition program managers understand their arms control responsibilities.NSWCDD is a premier RDT&E center, special- izing in integrated warfare systems, weapons and ammunition, sensor systems, directed energy, and asymmetric defense systems. The NTIP support team at NSWCDD is at- tached to the Chemical, Biological, and Ra-diological (CBR) Defense Division within the Asymmetric Systems Department. The CBR De-fense Division is the lead laborato-ry for nonmedical CBRD activities. NSWCDD's NTIP personnel primarily support the Tiger Team in the area of sampling and analysis of ma-terials found at an installation. They assist the self-monitoring, base escort, and base prepara-tion teams as needed. NSWCDD supports NTIP annual data calls by capturing program details for all NSWCDD programs involving chemical, bio-logical, riot control, or nonlethal defense capabili-ties. The team also conducts arms control training efforts to educate management and the workforce about treaty considerations and obligations af-fecting their programs. Figure 1. An Inspection Team Prepares to Enter an Ammunition Storage Bunker During a CWC Challenge Inspection Exercise 55 Field Activity Support to the Naval Treaty Implementation ProgramNSWCIHD provides RDT&E and in-service sup p ort of energetic materials for warheads, pro p ul sio n systems, ordnance, pyrotechnic devices, and fuzing for Navy, joint forces, and national spon - s ors. The Treaty Support Branch of NSWCIHD pro v ides technical, administrative, and logistical sup p ort to NTIP . The TIMS (see Figure 2) used by the NTIP Assistance Team to help to plan inspections and monitor perimeters, sites, buildings, and in - s pec t ion progress, was developed by the Treaty Sup p ort Branch. NSWCIHD maintains facilities and equipment to serve as a backup TMC should NTIP offices be unavailable. Much of the work at NSWCIHD is focused on chemicals, propellants, ex p lo si ves, and special weapons support. This makes the site uniquely positioned to provide com - p re h ensive training opportunities. Effective international arms control measures enhance national security in a number of ways. Increased transparency among nations about the size, composition, and operations of their military forces can reduce incentives and opportunities to attack; these agreements can also be used to build confidence and trust among historic adversaries. The direct result is fewer regional conflicts that can escalate to involve U.S. forces. In an era of declining defense budgets, arms control agreements stretch Pentagon dollars and complement U.S. force struc-ture objectives by placing limits or restraints on U.S. and other nations' activities. Finally, slowing or preventing the spread of CBR weapons and de-livery systems reduces the likelihood that they will be acquired by terrorist organizations, thus reduc-ing the threat to the U.S. homeland. The comprehensive oversight of arms control implementation, compliance, and verification that NTIP provides is an invaluable component of our nation's defense. NTIP team members within the field activities provide technical expertise, as well as guidance and clarification on efforts involving the use of chemical, biological, nonlethal, and riot control materials. Field activity support teams rou-tinely participate in NTIP training exercises to en-sure the NTIP Assistance Team maintains a high level of readiness and proficiency to assist Navy and Marine Corps installations. NTIP support person-nel at the field activities are committed to ensuring the U.S. remains in compliance with all treaties and agreements while simultaneously safeguarding our nation's fielded and emerging technologies. Figure 2. Inspection Tracking Using the Treaty Information Management System (TIMS) 56 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense SupportIs Your Program Arms Control Compliant? By Angela Mersiowsky All Department of the Navy (DON) activities and programs are required to be com- pliant with international arms control treaties and agreements.1 These programs, proj- ects, and/or activities run the gamut from basic bench-top research\u2014such as chemical and biological decontamination and detection technology\u2014to weapon systems, deliv-ery platforms, and dual-use technologies. The program, project, activity manager, or principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that his or her program, project, and/or activity has been reviewed for arms control compliance. Program information is re-viewed by arms control treaty experts at the Naval Treaty Implementation Program (NTIP) office. To determine arms control compliance, program information is com-pared and assessed against all applicable treaties in which the United States is a signa-tory, as well as U.S. policies. Anytime a Navy or Marine Corps equity is involved, no matter which branch of service or government agency has the lead on the program/project, the DON has an arms control compliance obligation to ensure its participation is arms control compliant. Acquisition practitioners, requirements officers, and opera-tional planners should apply proven acquisition and operational business practices by integrating the NTIP into the risk management process and mitigation plans. Issues of a potential compliance concern, if not addressed and resolved early, can have serious, programmatic cost ramifications, program cancellation, or allegations of violating bind-ing international agreements. All DON stakeholders are responsible to ensure that work performed, regardless of the program sponsor, has been reviewed for arms control com-pliance and received an arms control compliance certification by NTIP . Program, proj-ect, activity managers, or principal investigators cannot self-certify. Who Reviews the Programs? All systems developed or acquired by DON shall be reviewed by the Director, Stra- tegic Systems Programs (SSP) via the NTIP Office, with the advice of the SSP Office of General Counsel (OGC), to certify compliance with arms control agreements. 2 NTIP is assigned the responsibility for coordinating DON (U.S. Navy (USN)) and U.S. Marine 57 Is Your Program Arms Control Compliant?Corps (USMC)) implementation and compliance for designated treaties worldwide. NTIP supports all DON organizations with expert arms control implementation and compliance assistance. The Compliance Assessment Program staff conducts comprehensive compliance assessments of USN and USMC programs, which consider over 40 trea-ties and agreements, as well as U.S. policy, statuto-ry, and regulatory obligations at no cost. How Does a Program Obtain an Arms Control Certification? The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD); the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head (NSWCIH); and the Naval Air Weapons Directorate, China Lake (NAWDCL) are NTIP Field Activities. A program, project, ac-tivity manager, or project lead can submit acquisi-tion programs, research and development projects, concepts of operation, and exercises in need of certification to the on-site treaty point of contact (POC) located at one of the designated field activ-ities or directly to NTIP . NTIP field activity POCs help to ensure that all appropriate program doc-umentation is current and technically descrip-tive. Program documentation can be in the form of statements of work, white papers, articles, and even scientific abstracts, etc. NTIP conducts arms control compliance assessments (ACCAs) at every stage of the acquisition life cycle (see Figure 1), as it is a requirement for each milestone review. What Is the Compliance Assessment Process? The compliance assessment process consists of a thorough review of current technical/descrip- tive program documentation from NTIP and SSP OGC against arms control treaties, agreements, U.S. statutory regulations, and policy documents to determine arms control compliance. If causes for concern are identified, the program manager is consulted, and the program, project, or activity may be presented to the Naval Arms Control Re-view Board (NACRB). Members of the NACRB in-clude representatives from Headquarters Marine Corps, Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Oper - ations, Judicial Advocate General, and Naval Crim-inal Investigative Services. If the NACRB endorses the NTIP assessment conclusion, they may recom-mend that the program be presented to the appro-priate Treaty Manager at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OSD (AT&L)), who will convene the Compliance Review Group (CRG). The CRG makes the final compliance decision on programs that raise a rea-sonable compliance concern. If there are no causes for concern, the program is certified compliant by NTIP . A depiction of the compliance assessment process is shown in Figure 2. The treaty field activity POC or NTIP tracks the progress of the compliance assessment review and coordinates with the program, project, or activity. In the case of classified programs, NTIP personnel are appropriately cleared and have access to Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) ac-counts and other classified electronic means in or - der to accommodate receiving documentation.

In the aftermath of the attacks, the difficulties experienced by first responders exposed numerous capability gaps and vulnerabilities, especially for city fire departments. The attacks also intensified the concern over the possible terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in U.S. cities. Some major city governments\u2014given fire de-partment readiness levels\u2014identified emergency services capability shortfalls that like-ly would be encountered before, during, and after a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) event. The Seattle Fire Department (SFD) and the Fire Department of New Y ork City (FDNY) were the first to field capabilities upgrading their CBRN readi-ness posture by the acquisition of new fireboats with a collective protection system (CPS). Shipboard Collective Protection System (CPS) A shipboard CPS generally operates full time and is seamlessly integrated with a ship's heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system. The CPS provides protected ar - eas within airtight, controlled boundaries, referred to as a citadel. High-pressure fans, coupled with special CBRN filters, provide a continuous, contaminant-free environ-ment within the citadel. The CBRN filters capture or neutralize harmful CBRN par - ticulates, liquids, and vapors prior to the air's entry into the citadel. Additionally, the high-pressure fans keep the citadel at an increased pressure over that of the exterior ambient conditions, which prevents contamination from entering the protected areas. An overview of a CPS is shown in Figure 1.61 Homeland Defense Partnerships: Major City Fire Departments Reach Out to Shipboard Collective Protection ExpertiseControlled access to the citadel via air locks and decontamination stations prevents the in- gress of contamination and allows personnel to move in and out of the protective areas. Thus, CPS allows firefighters to perform their duties more effectively and efficiently while not hindered by cumbersome personal protective equipment (e.g., masks, suits, gloves, and boots). A decontamina-tion station is included in case firemen have been exposed to contaminants outside of the protect-ed areas. A decontamination station and shower is shown in Figure 2. In 2007, the SFD received two new fireboats to upgrade their maritime firefighting capabil-ity. The new fireboats were outfitted with a CPS capability, the first such system fielded to a local government's fire department. The SFD contact-ed the Joint Project Management Office for Col-lective Protection (JPMO-ColPro) and requested technical assistance for this new capability. SFD leadership realized that specialized assistance was needed to ensure that firefighters understood the proper operational and maintenance requirements for the new system. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Protection and Integration Branch en-gineers and other Navy shipboard CPS experts met with SFD's Captain Chris Dahline and Chief Engi-neer Dick Chester to address the fireboat's CBRN system. NSWCDD engineers assessed the fireboat's systems and provided operational, maintenance, and performance feedback to fire department per - sonnel. The Fireboat Leschi is shown in Figure 3. Concurrently in 2007, the FDNY was in the planning stages to acquire two new fireboats with the same CBR capability as the SFD. Since the FDNY had no prior experience fielding these spe-cialized systems, the FDNY requested the advise-ment of NSWCDD CPS subject matter experts and contracted NSWCDD as the technical advi-sor for the CBRN system acquisition for their new Figure 1. Overview of a Collective Protection System62 CBRD Fleet, Joint, and Homeland Defense SupportFigure 2. Decontamination Station and Shower Aboard the SFD's Fireboat Leschi Figure 3. The Leschi , built in 2007, is a 108-foot fireboat that can shoot 22,000 gallons of water per minute and travel at 14 knots. 63 Homeland Defense Partnerships: Major City Fire Departments Reach Out to Shipboard Collective Protection Expertisefireboats. In discussions about shipboard CPS, Battalion Chief Jim Dalton remarked, \"In the future, the FDNY fireboats may encounter the same threats as the U.S. Navy ... I wa nt on my boats the same CBRN system design as the U.S. Navy. \" During 2007, at the Joint Chemical-Biological Decontamination and Protection Conference and Exhibition, FDNY Battalion Chief Ed Bergamini remarked in his address to conference attendees, \"I am a fireman but I know where we are lacking. I needed engineering and technical support to help solve my problems, and for that I went to the experts at JPMO-ColPro and NSWCDD for their expertise and knowledge. \" Subsequently, FDNY's first fireboat, Three Forty Three , was commissioned in May 2010, and the sec- ond fireboat, Fire Fighter II, was commissioned in December 2010. The partnership fostered between the FDNY and NSWCDD serves as a model for how the Department of Defense's expertise can transition to meet the needs of homeland defenders and first responders. Fireboat Three Forty Three\u2014named in honor of the 343 firefighters who perished on Sep-tember 11, 2001, in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center\u2014is shown in Figure 4. New threats to homeland security require spe- cial equipment and procedures to ensure that the nation's first responders are well-equipped to han-dle any emergency. As was learned from capability gaps identified following the September 11, 2001, attacks, civilian first responders must be prepared to operate in dangerous CBRN environments. In working to close these gaps, collaborative relation-ships between the Department of Defense and civ-il support agencies facilitated the development and fielding of unique protection systems and the training of first responders necessary to protect cit-izenry in the event of a CBRN event. As a result, the SFD and FDNY are now equipped with the best CBRN protection systems available and are well prepared to meet CBRN challenges. Figure 4. FDNY Fireboat Three Forty Three 64 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsChemical and Biological Detection for the Fleet By Daniel C. Driscoll Today's warfighter is faced with a broad spectrum of threats ranging from conven- tional battlefield weapons commonly associated with armies or fleets fighting \"force on force\" battles, to asymmetric threats more likely to be employed in terrorism or gueril-la warfare. Of these latter threats, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) have captured the attention of the public and the news media in recent years. Ironically, neither of these threats represents anything new from the standpoint of technology; the Depart-ment of Defense has been concerned with countering these kinds of threats for decades. The question of how to detect and counter chemical and biological warfare agents goes back to the days of the Cold War. The Soviet warfighting doctrine of that era included plans to make heavy use of both chemical and biological weapons. In response, the U.S. military developed tools, techniques, and procedures to fight in a chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR)-contaminated environment. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the nature of the threat changed in the sense that massive use of WMDs on the battlefield became much less likely, but the experience of the Gulf War that same year, and the growth of the global terrorist threat in the years since, have demonstrated that the threat remains. The Historical Chemical Threat: Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) Chemical warfare can trace its origins to ancient times when toxic fumes from burning vegetation or sulfur were used in siege warfare.1, 2 However, it wasn't until World War I (WWI) that toxic chemicals were deliberately used on a massive scale to at least attempt to affect the outcome on the battlefield. By the end of the fighting in 1918, thou-sands of deaths and many thousands more injuries\u2014many of which caused permanent disabilities\u2014resulted from the use of mustard gas (H). Many countries, including the United States, continued to manufacture and stockpile mustard agents for decades af-terward. 3 Figure 1 shows a battery of dug-in Livens projectors, with one gas shell and its propellant charge shown in the foreground, followed by Table 1, which reflects casual-ties from gas during WWI.65 Chemical and Biological Detection for the Fleet Figure 1. A Battery of Dug-In Livens Projectors with One Gas Shell and Its Propellant Charge Shown in the Foreground4 Table 1. Casualties from Gas During WWI3 65Chemical and Biological Detection for the Fleet66 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsDuring World War II (WWII), German scien- tists\u2014who began their work in the 1930s looking at organophosphorous compounds for better insecti-cides\u2014formulated the G-series nerve agents more commonly referred to as \"nerve gas. \" While these were never used, and chemical weapons in gener - al were not employed to any great extent during WWII, nerve agents were recognized to be a po-tentially very effective weapon. With the onset of the Cold War, nerve agents, together with mustard and later VX (a more lethal form of nerve agent), were stockpiled as the standard chemical weapons arsenal by the United States, the USSR, and their respective allies. Another class of chemical threats is TICs. While the G and V series nerve agents and mus-tard are dedicated weapons requiring the resources of a state actor to produce and maintain, TICs, as their name indicates, are industrial products that can be found anywhere in the world where signif-icant industrial activity is conducted. Traditional CW As are much more toxic than most TICs, but the large quantities of TICS that may be present at an industrial site can still pose a significant threat as tragically demonstrated in the Bhopal, India, di-saster in 1984. 5 The Bhopal disaster was an indus- trial catastrophe that took place at a pesticide plant owned and operated by Union Carbide in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. Around midnight on 2-3 December 1984, the plant released methyl isocya-nate (MIC) gas and other toxins. The official im-mediate death toll was 2,259; the government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. Others estimated that 8,000 died within the first weeks, and that anoth-er 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases. 5 Whether through accidental release, as in the case of Bhopal, or by deliberate release due to terrorism, sabotage, or collateral damage due to military op-erations, TICs have the potential to cause signifi-cant casualties. The Historical Biological and Disease Threat As with the chemical threat, the threat posed by biological agents has its roots in ancient times in siege warfare. Throughout history, attempts have been made to employ disease as an ally on the bat-tlefield, though usually with limited success. Like the chemical threat, the evolution of a significant credible biological threat came in the 20th century and reached a peak during the Cold War. Biological weapons were not used in combat either in WWI or WWII, but during the Cold War, a variety of threat agents were developed and stockpiled. Since the end of the Cold War, with the rise of asymmet-ric warfare, the biological threat has evolved and re-mains a threat today. A compelling measure of the threat posed by biological weapons is reflected in the effects of dis-ease throughout history, which can be traced from the plague of medieval times through the near - ly 225,000 deaths by disease among Civil War sol-diers 6 and, later, victims of the Spanish influenza outbreak in 1918 that killed more people than were killed during WWI. 7 While weapons were devel- oped and deployed throughout the 20th century, detection technology lagged behind the develop-ment of the CW As, with no significant ability to sense the presence of agents until the 1970s, oth-er than by the smell and the sound the ordnance made when delivered. Not until the arrival of the M8A1 detector and M8 paper (circa 1978), fol-lowed by chemical reaction-based detection in the M256 kit, 8 did the warfighter have something more effective than his nose. Just as with the threat posed by CW As, the fleet must be prepared to protect Sail-ors from the threat of biological warfare agents, as well as naturally occurring diseases, such as H1N1. Detection of the Contemporary Chemical Warfare Threat Chemical weapons today can be disseminated by means of explosive ordnance\u2014such as artillery rounds, missiles, and bombs\u2014or through impro-vised explosive devices. Aerial sprayers or clan-destine spray release are possible as well, though perhaps less likely due to the possible presence of counterfire. Chemical dissemination is also possi-ble through vapor, airborne respirable aerosols, liq-uid on surfaces, or as contamination absorbed into soil or water. In response, detectors have been de-veloped to detect the presence of chemical agents\u2014whether in the immediate vicinity of the users (point detection), remotely, or as standoff detection. M256 Kit and M8/9 Paper M8 (or M9) paper is used to detect the pres- ence of liquid chemical agent on surfaces, or the paper can be secured on surfaces to detect the impact of agent droplets. The paper is embed-ded with chemically reactive dyes, which produce a characteristic color change unique to the kind of agent present when exposed. So, for example, if the M8 paper turns red, that indicates the pres-ence of a blister agent (mustard). If it turns orange to light yellow, that indicates the presence of the G nerve agent (the VX nerve agent will turn it dark green). The M256 kit, shown in Figure 2, is a two-component detector kit: M8 paper and a chemical 67 Chemical and Biological Detection for the Fleetreagent-based detection sampler that reacts to the presence of chemical agent vapors by producing color changes when the reagent ampoules are bro-ken open and exposed on the sampler card. The combination of M8 paper and the M256 kit are used on board ships for postattack moni-toring and for surveys conducted by damage con-trol teams walking predetermined routes through the ship after an attack. M8 paper can be affixed to surfaces on the exterior of the ship and monitored for color changes to indicate the arrival of aerosols. For vapor exposures, if the M256 sample turns blue for example, that indicates a nerve agent. An in-tense blue-purple color indicates mustard gas. An olive-drab color indicates lewisite. Ion Mobility Spectroscopy (IMS) IMS is a technology used to detect the pres- ence of chemical vapors in air. This is accomplished by ionizing a sample of air drawn into the detector and then analyzing the sample by first ionizing the constituents of air and then measuring the transit time of cluster ions formed in the ionization region across a constant electric field inside the detector in order to determine the mobility of the sample species. Molecules of differing sizes, polarizabili-ties, and electron affinities will have distinct times to cross the field region, so they produce a char - acteristic IMS signature. Compared to other ana-lytic techniques, such as mass spectroscopy, IMS is simple, relatively cheap, and can be packaged in a lightweight sensor. For this reason, IMS detectors have been employed for a number of missions, in-cluding limited shipboard use. An example of an IMS cell is shown in Figure 3. The Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM), the Im- proved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM), and the Automatic Chemical Agent Detector Alarm (ACADA) were among the first IMS detectors de-veloped for use by the military. Designed for use by the Army in land-based missions, they have seen Navy use by expeditionary and other ashore activities. The Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) is in use with deployed Navy units in ex-peditionary, explosive ordnance disposal, and medical missions. It is employed to survey inte-rior and exterior spaces, surfaces, equipment, and personnel, and provides users with the capabil-ity to automatically detect, identify, localize, and alarm to the presence of acute levels of CW A va-pors by agent class. In each of these examples, a set of performance requirements must be met while also meeting survivability, reliability, and cost de-mands within a harsh operating environment. The JCAD is shown in Figure 4. The Mk 26 Mod 0 Improved Point Detection System (IPDS) is an IMS detector that was devel-oped to monitor the ship's exterior and has been in service with the fleet for over 10 years. As the Mk 26 Mod 0 reached the end of its service life, an Improved Point Detection System - Life-Cycle Replacement (IPDS-LR) was selected. Testing was completed as planned in 2010, and installation of IPDS-LR on Navy ships commenced in late 2011. IPDS is designed to detect the presence of CW As at the immediate exterior of a ship; IPDS-LR will fill this same mission without loss of performance and with superior reliability and maintainability. A de-piction and functional description of the IPDS-LR System is shown in Figure 5. Figure 2. The M256 Kit shown being used by Soldiers in mission-oriented protective posture gear. The kit, as issued, is shown on the right. 68 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsDetection of the Contemporary Biological Warfare Threat Biological threats can be present as either re- spirable aerosols or in other forms, such as drink- ing water, or they can be spread by human contact (communicable diseases). Responding to this spectrum of biological threats requires diverse technologies, each tailored to the type of sample to be interrogated and the environment in which it will be used. Three systems that are currently be-ing procured and fielded to the fleet are the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS), the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Detec-tion System (JBAIDS), and the Joint Chemical, Bi-ological, and Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM), which address the areas of airborne threats, medical/confirmatory, and waterborne threats, respectively. The JCBRAWM and hand-held assay ticket are shown in Figure 6. In addition to the JBPDS, detection of bio- aerosols in air is also addressed by the Joint Bio-logical Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) being developed to fill a flexible deployment, surveillance, and monitoring mission currently being covered by Figure 4. Joint Chemical Agent Detector (M4) (JCAD) Figure 3. Example of an IMS Cell 69 Chemical and Biological Detection for the Fleetdry filter units and deployed in the fleet, as well as a number of continental U.S. facilities. While chemical detection allows for direct in- terrogation of the target species by a chemical or physical interaction, the more complex nature and larger size of biological species introduces an add-ed level of complexity to biological detection. Each system named above requires that a sample first be collected, and then a separate detection and iden-tification (ID) step\u2014relying on either antibody capture of the agent antigen or genetic amplifica-tion (recombinant DNA)\u2014is necessary to make a presumptive or confirmatory detection of the tar - get agent. The JBAIDS and JCBRAWM detectors do not specifically target detection of agents in air. The JBAIDS is a confirmatory detection and ID system that primarily targets medical samples. JBAIDS employs polymerase chain reaction to am-plify and identify the genetic material of the target agent. The JCBRAWM interrogates water samples for two biological agents enterotoxin B (SEB)) via a hand-held assay anti-body ticket and, for gross alpha and beta radiolog-ical contamination, by distilling the water sample on a heated planchet, followed by reading with a radiation detection, indication, and computation (RADIAC) device. Just as with chemical detection, it is desired that remote or standoff detection of biological species in air be available. Additionally, as in the chemical case, the preferred approaches to this problem have been to use optical techniques, such as Light De-tection and Ranging (LIDAR), to interrogate sus-pect aerosol clouds. The Joint Biological Standoff Detection System is in a second increment of de-velopment. Unlike the chemical case, direct inter - rogation of the target by electromagnetic radiation does not permit a species ID. The best that can be done with the current state of the art is a determi-nation of whether the target is of biological origin. Figure 5. IPDS-LR external air sampling units sample exterior air and transfer it to the detector units (DUs) for analysis. Two exterior points are sampled and alarm/status is communicated to two points in the ship: Damage Control Central and the Bridge. 70 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsThe Way Ahead The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), working through the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Bio-logical Defense, is developing and fielding a range of systems to address the full spectrum of chemi-cal and biological threats. Beginning with intelli-gence of an adversary's intentions, and continuing through multiple layers of detection from remote or standoff detection to point detection for both inside and outside the ship, Sailors need to be pro-tected by a robust set of detection technologies ad-dressing a spectrum of chemical and biological threats. Through NSWCDD's participation in the joint program, the Navy is able to leverage other services' development efforts which, together with research, development, and systems engineering, are providing the fleet with a suite of detectors ad-dressing these requirements. Future efforts will en-hance this suite of detection capabilities. References 1. Th aroor, Ishaan, \"Why Chemical Warfare is Ancient History, \" Time Magazine, 13 February 2009.2.

The Joint Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) and Hand-Held Assay Ticket 71 Chemical and Biological Detection for the Fleet 71Chemical and Biological Detection for the Fleet72 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsM4 Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) By Harold Bannister U.S. military forces have not experienced direct exposure to chemical warfare agents (CW As) or toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in decades despite the fact that a number of nation states possess capabilities for producing and deploying CW As. Still, adversary countries, non-nation states, warlords, or terrorist organizations may one day deploy CW As or TICs against U.S. warfighters in the form of a poor man's nuclear weapon. If such a hazardous or contaminated environment were to occur, Navy and joint warfight-ers will be prepared because of a suite of detectors, including the improved hand-held CW A and TIC vapor detection capability. Current Detection Capabilities Current lightweight detectors within the Navy warfighter inventory are the M256 Chemical Paper Kits, the Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM), and the Automat-ic Chemical Agent Detector Alarm (ACADA), shown in Figures 1 through 3, respectively. The M256 kit provides confirmation of the presence of chemical agents. Although the M256 kits are very reliable, they require 30 minutes or more to process a sample. When the warfighter is in need of quick and accurate detection, the alternative is to use the electronic detectors (ICAM and ACADA). Both electronic detectors are currently in use by all U.S. military forces. The ICAM and the ACADA utilize radiological sources and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), an analytical technique used to separate and iden-tify ionized molecules. Navy regulations require the tracking of radiological sources, such as the minute quantities found in the ICAM and the ACADA. The radiological tracking process in-cludes an annual inspection, which adds additional overhead cost to the Navy's sus-tainment. Both the ICAM and the ACADA can detect CW As and TICs within several minutes, which illustrates the advantage over the M256 kits. The warfighters, however, need faster CW A and TIC detection capabilities. Moreover, they require a chemical de-tector that is lightweight; accurate; has no radiological source; is able to detect nerve, blood, and blister agents; and produces fewer false alarms. Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) The M4 JCAD is a commercial solution in response to the CW A and TIC agent detection requirements of the Joint Program Executive Office. Weighing in at a little more than 3 pounds, the M4 JCAD is a hand-held, portable, nonradiological source 73 M4 Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) Figure 1. M256 Chemical Paper Kits Figure 2. Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM) Figure 3. Automatic Chemical Agent Detector Alarm (ACADA) chemical detector. It uses IMS technology to alert the warfighter of CW A and TIC vapors by draw-ing air from the surrounding area into an internal chamber where positive and negative charged ions are separated to identify the presence of nerve, blood, and blister agents. Commercial AA batter - ies power the M4 JCAD, which supports reducing sustainment cost to the warfighter. The M4 JCAD contains no radiological sources like its prede-cessors, ICAM and ACADA. With no radiologi-cal sources, an annual radiological inspection of the M4 JCAD is not required, further reducing the Navy's sustainment cost. The M4 JCAD provides the warfighter with a detection alarm within seconds vice the ICAM and ACADA response time of several minutes. The JCAD is shown in Figure 4. The Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Bu- reau of Medicine, and Construction Battalions (Seabees) received the first increment of M4 JCADs in March of 2009. By September of the same year, the Navy reached initial operational capability. In the near-term, the Navy will retire the ICAMs and ACADAs and replace them with JCADs as soon as full operational capability is achieved in fiscal year 2011. Equipped with JCAD's capabilities, the warfighter will be better protected, given the more rapid detection times and increased capabilities that JCAD provides in the face of serious chemi-cal agent threats. Figure 4. Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) 73M4 Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD)74 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsThe Joint Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) By Brian Patrick U.S. joint forces (JF) need to be able to detect the presence of chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contamination under a variety of conditions and circumstanc- es. The Joint Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) Program was initiated to enhance the current capabilities by providing an additional portable detection capability for individuals to test water sources. When fully developed and fielded, the JCBRAWM will be used for water treatment monitoring, water distribu-tion monitoring, and water preconsumption situations. It also will be used to determine the presence, quantity, and identification of agents in local water sources (lakes, rivers, creeks, wells, and water purification and distribution points) that JF might encounter. Water treatment monitoring facilities will use the JCBRAWM to verify that the water, before and after processing, does not contain CBR agents at established detection lev-els. Water distribution monitoring also will use the JCBRAWM to determine if stored or distributed water is contaminated. Detection and identification of biological agents and radiological contamination in water are required to protect forces across the range of military operations (e.g., conventional war, combating terrorism, peace enforcement, and peacekeeping). A soldier on patrol in Afghanistan is shown taking a drink of water in Figure 1. JCBRAWM Increment I provides this capability by augmenting the current-ly fielded M272 Water Testing Kit. The JCBRAWM Program covers the interval from now through the near future, with future growth possible in later time frames. The currently fielded U.S. Navy (USN) M272 Water Testing Kit was designed to de- tect chemical warfare agents (CW As). It cannot be modified to detect biological agents or radiological contamination. As a result, chemical reconnaissance units; most medi-cal units; or units with a water purification, transportation, and distribution mission can currently detect and identify CW A contamination in water. The detection of biological agents and radiological contamination in potable water historically has been difficult to employ. The JCBRAWM, however, is contributing to the overall biological and radiolog-ical defense concept by providing crucial detection, identification, quantification, and warning information about biological and radiological hazards in water prior to distri-bution to JF for consumption or use. The M272 Water Testing Kit is shown in Figure 2. The JCBRAWM will be fielded in four increments. Increment 1 will provide for the detection and identification of two biological agents using immunoassays and the detec-tion of gross alpha and beta radiation using components of fielded Radiation Detection, 75 The Joint Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM)Indication, and Computation (RADIAC) meters and probes. Follow-on JCBRAWM increments are planned to enhance detection of additional biolog-ical, chemical, and radiological agents, to include replacement of the M272 Water Testing Kit and provided inline monitoring capability. The JCBRAWM Increment 1 kit provides de- tection capability for two biological agents and gross alpha and beta radiological contaminants in water. The system is provided to the JF in two con-figurations: 1. M329: U sed by the U.S. Army (USA), this all-inclusive kit contains components to sample and monitor water supplies for bio-logical agents and alpha/beta radiation. The M329 kit (NSN 6665-01-560-2158) is in-tended for personnel with no IM-263 RA - DIAC meter or the DT-695/PDR-77 beta probe. The M329 JCBRAWM is shown in Figure 3. 2. M330: This is the same kit as the M329 kit, but without the RADIAC meter and probe. This kit, the M330 is designed for use by USN personnel who are already equipped with an IM265/PDQ RADIAC meter and a DT-304/PDR Beta Probe. M330's hand-held assays (HHA), sample collection, and testing components are identical to the M329. The USN also currently utilizes M8/M9 chemi-cal contamination detector paper (not part of the JCBRAWM) to monitor for CW As on board USN ships; the M272 water monitor is utilized for shore-based activities. In keeping with USN and JF initiatives to im- prove overall safety for sea- and shore-based personnel, and to protect the warfighter from contamination after a CBR attack or an inadver - tent release of CBR contamination in close prox-imity to USN and JF commands, the JCBRAWM Figure 1.

William Tremblay/Released) Figure 2. M272 Water Testing Kit76 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemswill be operationally deployed to detect biological and radiological water contamination. The M330 JCBRAWM Water Monitor is shown in Figure 4. Radiological Detection The radiological detection component of the JCBRAWM Kit consists of a separate RADIAC meter and probe, and is used to detect and iden-tify gross alpha and beta radiation contamination in water. A sample is prepared by placing a known volume of water in a planchet (a small shallow met-al container in which a suspected radioactive sub-stance is deposited for measurement of its activity), which is then evaporated (by a heater) to eliminate the masking capability of the water. The planchet containing the evaporated sample is cooled and then tested. The probe is placed directly over the planchet, and a sample count is taken for 1 minute. Prior to testing, the RADIAC meter must be pre-pared by performing preoperational procedures, a meter response test, and a background count. If the sample count is at least 600 counts per min-ute greater than the background count, appropri-ate personnel must be notified so that mitigation procedures can be implemented. The beta probe is sensitive to beta and gamma radiations, so gamma needs to be subtracted. The type of contamination is determined by shielding the sample (using an at-tenuator) and taking another count. The difference between the unshielded count and the shielded count is the gross amount of alpha/beta radiation contamination. Biological Detection The biological detection component of the JCBRAWM is the HHA. Each immunoassay ticket consists of three important functional areas: 1. Th e Control Area 2. Th e Detection Area 3. Th e Sample Well Each provides the field capability to test two bio-logical agents in water. A water specimen is collect-ed, and several drops of the sample are dispensed into the oval-shaped sample well on the ticket. The water then flows across the paper strip inside the assay assembly. A line should form at the control area indicating that the ticket functioned correct-ly, and lines may or may not form in the detection area, depending on whether an agent has been de-tected or not. After 15 minutes, but no longer than 20 minutes, the results are interpreted by observing Figure 3. The M329 Joint Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM) Figure 4. The M330 JCBRAWM Water Monitor 77 The Joint Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM)and comparing both the control and the detection areas. HHA tickets are shown in Figure 5. Conclusion The JCBRAWM is an important joint asset. It allows a ship or shore installation to take on wa-ter in an emergency, even if on foreign soil where a terrorist attack may occur. The JCBRAWM will give USN commanders confidence that their Sailors will not fall victim to incapacitating or lethal doses of CBR agents in potable water. The current water testing kit used by the USN was designed to detect CW As and cannot be modified to detect biological or radiological contamination. The JCBRAWM will provide the USN with the capability to not only de-tect CW As, but to also detect two biological agents and gross alpha and beta radiological contamina-tion in a rapid time frame, thus giving command-ers better situational awareness. Future variants of JCBRAWM will add more chemical detection ca-pabilities and ultimately replace the existing fielded M272 Water Testing Kit. The JCBRAWM is in-tended for use by USN and JF during wartime and emergency operations. The JCBRAWM will even-tually be fielded to every USN ship, as well as to se-lect shore installations. Figure 5. HHA Tickets78 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systems79 Shipboard Installation and Integration of Chemical and Biological (CB) Detection EquipmentJoint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) JBAIDS provides positive identification and diagnostic confirmation of BW As. Essentially, the sample from JBPDS can be analyzed by JBAIDS for confirmatory purposes. Additionally, JBAIDS pro-vides H1N1 virus diagnostic capabilities, which was the principal reason for executing an acceler - ated fielding schedule. A 3-year fielding schedule for JBAIDS was accelerated to fielding all of the systems to the LHA, LHD, and CVN hulls within 1 year. Systems were to be fielded prior to the ships leaving for deployment. Nearly 95 percent of the systems (19 total) will have been installed by the conclusion of FY10. JBAIDS is shown in Figure 2. Improved Point Detection System - Life-Cycle Replacement (IPDS-LR) IPDS-LR is a fixed-site chemical warfare agent (CW A) point detector used to detect the pres- ence of chemical nerve and blister agents external to the ship. The system was designed to increase maintainability and reliability while reducing false alarms caused by common shipboard interferents. IPDS-LR will be and LSD classes through FY16. Consequently, installation and integration costs will be reduced, as IPDS-LR is a form/fit/function replacement for the currently fielded IPDS system. IPDS-LR is shown in Figure 3. Acquisition, Fielding, Maintenance, Sustainment, and Training All three of these systems are in various stages of their acquisition life cycle, which encompasses all aspects of research and development, produc-tion, fielding, and eventual sustainment or dispos-al. NSWC Dahlgren is responsible for these systems The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division's (NSWCDD's) Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Division is responsi-ble for protecting the fleet from chemical and bi-ological (CB) threats. One of its responsibilities is to perform shipboard installation and integration of CB detection equipment in support of require-ments to integrate CB detectors. Currently, the CBR Defense Division is fielding three systems to the fleet. These are the Joint Biological Point De-tection System (JBPDS), the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS), and the Improved Point Detection System - Life-Cycle Replacement (IPDS-LR). Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) JBPDS provides a 24-hour biological agent de- tection capability that detects, identifies, and warns of biological warfare agents (BW As), allowing time for warfighters to take preventative measures or apply prophylactic measures. The system has the ability to connect to navigational and meteorologi-cal equipment, detect up to 10 BW As during a mis-sion and, most importantly, can save the sample for further confirmation analysis. Through FY11, 51 of the systems have been successfully installed on a variety of ship platforms (i.e., DDG, LPD, LSD, LHA, and LHD). Installations are scheduled to continue through FY15, with a total of 88 instal-lations scheduled. The JBPDS is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. JBPDS Shipboard Installation Figure 2. JBAIDS System 80 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemsfrom \"cradle to grave. \" IPDS-LR has passed all of the testing requirements (i.e. shock, vibration and electromagnetic interference) and has shown that it will survive and operate in a combat environ-ment. The first system was installed in the fourth quarter of FY11 with 25 installations currently planned for FY12. JBAIDS is nearing the end of its fielding schedule, where the system is moving into the operational sustainment portion of its life cy-cle. Proper installation of the systems, in addition to training, underlies the success of these systems. The ability to maintain, sustain, and support the systems throughout their life cycle is equally im-portant. These responsibilities are also performed by the CBR Defense Division throughout the life of the equipment. JBPDS is currently halfway through its fielding schedule. Initial training is provided at the conclusion of each installation. Fielded systems will be maintained only to the extent that the users have been trained to perform necessary preventive maintenance. This is extremely important as life-cycle costs are reduced, and operational readiness is increased.Shipboard Installation and Integration Planning Shipboard installation and integration of CB defense systems must closely follow the processes and procedures as delineated by Technical Spec-ification (TS) 9090-310F, Alterations to Ships Ac-complished by Alteration Installation Teams . Any change that is performed to a ship is referred to as an alteration and is subjected to the preplan-ning milestones and requirements as directed by the Navy Modernization Plan. These require-ments are not optional and must be strictly fol-lowed. Ship Change Documents (SCDs) must be generated within the Navy data environment, ex-plicitly describing the alteration that will be per - formed. Technical assessment teams, integrated logistical officers, and budgetary personnel all re-view the SCDs for technical merit, schedule exe-cution, costs, and maintainability. Approval is not granted until logistical documentation, testing, and ship installation drawings (SIDs) have been generated and approved. Development of these SIDs is performed by the planning yards for in-tegration of the system on a particular hull. Close Figure 3. IPDS-LR System 81 Shipboard Installation and Integration of Chemical and Biological (CB) Detection Equipmentinteractions are made with the planning yards to answer technical questions that arise. These SIDs detail how the systems integrate with the ship and show how potential problems must be handled in order to integrate the systems properly. Interac-tions are conducted between the planning yards and the Ship's Force to affirm that there will be minimal impact to the ship. The preplanning ac-tivities are not trivial and require approximately a year of effort. Shipboard Installation and Integration Execution Initially, coordination is made with the Ship's Force to ensure that the ship is aware of the system that they will be receiving. The installation team is responsible for answering any questions or concerns that the ship may have about the system. Prior to ar - rival, a walk-through and ship check is conducted to make sure that the system will be installed as de-scribed by the SIDs. Many times, difficulties exist where slight de- viations must be made from the drawings and ac-curately reflected in the as-built configuration. The difficulty is that space on ships is very limited and some of the systems\u2014JBPDS, for example\u2014occu-py a significant amount of space in one of the ship's compartments. The Alteration Installation Team (AIT) must provide the ship a plan of actions and milestones for execution of the installation. This is provided for accountability to the planning coordinators to af-firm that the installation is progressing according to schedule. For JBPDS, each installation requires ap-proximately 3 weeks to execute. This represents the time from arrival on ship until the time when check-out is complete. Arrangements are made with the shipyard to make sure that all necessary industrial services are available. Welding and grinding are some of the principal services needed for the installations. Fi-nal items needed prior to installation initiation are the generation of a Readiness to Start (RTS) message and check-in with the designated Regional Mainte-nance Center (RMC). The RTS notifies all concerned of the arrival of the AIT and the system they will be installing. The RMCs are responsible for being aware of alterations that are occurring on a particular ship. They will not allow the installation to proceed unless all logistical documentation, drawings, and other re-quired items are complete. During installation, it is the responsibility of the AIT On-Site Installation Coordinator (OSIC) to en-sure that the system is installed according to plan and on schedule. To accomplish that, an in-brief is initially scheduled with the ship to define the scope of work and level of effort. The OSIC is responsible for performing \"go/no go\" inspections of work per - formed to make sure that the system is installed pro-fessionally and properly. Additionally, situational reports and photos are used to document the daily production. At the conclusion of the installation, there are items that must be performed prior to officially turn-ing over the system to the ship. Occasionally, small changes are made to the SIDs, which must be accu-rately reflected. These \"redlines\" are then submitted to the responsible Planning Y ard to reflect that the accurate \"as-built\" configuration is captured. This is imperative in order to make certain that the Acquisi-tion Engineering Agent responsible for sustainment possesses the most accurate data\u2014primarily for in-stances where troubleshooting might be necessary. A completion report is generated, per NAVSEA TS, to confirm that: An out brief has been scheduled Training dates are set Cable pathways have been properly performed System operational and verification testing have been performed Spares associated with the equipment have been properly turned over to the ship 1 The goal is to certify that the ship is left in the same condition as before the installation. Shipboard installation and integration of CB de- tection equipment on ships is necessary to protect ship crews from CB threats so they can perform their respective warfighting missions. By properly install-ing, integrating, and maintaining these systems\u2014in addition to training crews on the proper mainte-nance of the systems\u2014warfighters are not only saf-er, but naval readiness is enhanced.

Brown Biological weapons are armed with some of the most dangerous diseases known to man. These weapons are at the forefront of terrorist threats to world safety and peace. The Navy has chosen the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) to protect its fleet and personnel from biological threats. JBPDS is a modular suite of equipment that provides commanders with the ability to detect and presumptively identify biological warfare (BW) agents in near real time. The suite fully automates the biological detection, sample collection, and identification functions, which enables Sailors to perform oth-er critical duties. When complete, JBPDS will be installed on approximately 119 surface ships, providing commanders with the frontline knowledge necessary to effectively mit-igate the aftereffects of BW agents. The JBPDS is shown on USS The Sullivans in Figure 1. The Threat Many nations that are considered unfriendly toward the United States have the ca- pability to deliver biological weapons. In a traditional declared war, we can expect to encounter a biological threat from several potential enemies. Unfortunately, biological weapons offer a relatively cheap and effective means of offsetting U.S. military and eco-nomic power, and are thus attractive to anti-American terrorist groups. Such groups may not have the capability to deliver biological weapons on a military scale but could attempt to infect a ship, a port, a military base, or a symbolic or valuable civilian target if their desire for revenge or glory were sufficiently strong. Whether the delivery of bio-logical agents is caused by a state or a terrorist group, the need for preparedness is acute, and rapid identification is the key. Program History In 1997, the Department of Defense launched a joint program to develop and field a biological detection system, which had two primary characteristics: speed of identifi-cation and automation. In order to proceed in an orderly and manageable fashion, the program's oversight process was divided into four functional areas, each led by a uni-formed service. During the early development period, the design effort was led by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) as the designated Navy agent for this function. Test planning and oversight was an Air Force responsibility. Requirements development fell to the Army, and logistics was assigned to the Marine 83 Joint Biological Point Detection System: The Navy's Program for Biological DefenseFigure 1. JBPDS on USS The Sullivans Corps. While project management was undertak- en by an Army officer assigned to the Aberdeen Proving Ground, the chain of command was truly joint in nature since the responsible acquisition of-ficial was, and is, the Joint Program Executive Of-ficer for Biological Detection, currently an Army general officer. The first Navy JBPDS was installed on USS Com - stock in the summer of 2000. Many design flaws and performance deficiencies were found in this first variation. Consequently, the JBPDS team went back to the drawing board to engineer a more successful system. The next Navy installation occurred in the fall of 2001 with a better system but not quite ready to support a ship's mission. Over the next 3 years, from 2001 to 2004, the JBPDS went through extensive design chang-es to increase both performance and robustness. NSWCDD played a major role in this design to en-sure that unique Navy needs were addressed. As a result, the current Navy shipboard JBPDS incor - porates hardware responsive to the maritime en-vironment. Finally, Operational Evaluation was under - taken by Operational Test and Evaluation Force on board USS The Sullivans in September 2004. Following a positive evaluation, the detection system was approved for shipboard use. Installa-tions subsequently began on DDG and amphibi-ous ship classes, and today there are 38 shipboard units installed, with a total of 119 planned instal-lations. JBPDS is the first and only joint chem-ical or biological detection system to be fielded by the Navy. Installation and Local Hardware Support Installation and integration of JBPDS into the shipboard environment requires about 7 man-weeks. A supporting stand is built off-site and installed where the ship structure is suf-ficiently robust to support the total operating weight of 295 pounds (plus stand). Occasional-ly, modifications to the existing structure must be performed to ensure this robustness. Fiber optic cable is run to the two remote controllers (one in Damage Control Central and one in the Com-bat Information Center) and to the navigation system. The superstructure is pierced to accom-modate two inlet stacks and two exhaust ports, with welded brackets provided to affix the sup-porting structure for the ports. A small refriger - ator is installed to store operating consumables, inlet ducting is lagged to minimize condensation within the duct, the internal bulkheads are re- lagged, and the space is painted where necessary. Finally, the unit is connected with shipboard pow-er (120 volt) using an essential power circuit. Training and Support The Navy Program Manager for biological de- tection had the foresight to set up a team to com-pletely support such a unique system. JBPDS Team Navy provides the ship and Sailor with complete system support anywhere in the world. This sup-port includes new equipment training, predeploy-ment training, reach-back troubleshooting, repairs, and logistics. After an installation, JBPDS Team Navy pro- vides ship personnel with the required training to operate and maintain the JBPDS. This train-ing consists of 40 hours of classroom and hands-on training to include troubleshooting, operations, and preventive maintenance services. Corrective maintenance consists primarily of removing and 84 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemsreplacing any of six repairable components iden- tified by operating software fault indications. Pre-ventive maintenance involves cleaning intakes and operating the system to verify full functionality. This requires 2 hours bimonthly. A JBPDS Team Navy training session is shown in Figure 2. Both of these efforts were undertaken by the Navy JBPDS Program Manager in response to the need to augment the chemical/biological course taught at the Navy school in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Accordingly, specialized Navy repair activi- ties (equipment and labor) were established in fleet concentration areas in Norfolk and San Diego. The establishment of these repair activities is designed to provide real-time support to JBPDS-equipped platforms to increase equipment availability and decrease downtime. JBPDS Team Navy operates these activities and has personnel with specialized technical expertise. Performing system repairs at the subcomponent level saves the Navy thousands of dollars each year. Biological agents are insidious because the hu- man body does not recognize their presence un-til well after exposure. In most cases, the onset of physical symptoms will occur several days or weeks after initial contact, and by the time the dis-ease is recognized, it is well established and con-siderably past the time when medical attention is most effective. For the shipboard warfighter, the message is clear\u2014prompt identification of biolog-ical agents and associated treatment will prevent the loss of personnel and help maintain mission readiness. JBPDS is the Navy's system of choice to combat the devastation that may be caused by a bi-ological attack. Figure 2. JBPDS Team Navy accomplishes follow-on or predeployment training via tailored operator and maintainer courses using JBPDS systems installed at Naval Stations Norfolk, San Diego, and Mayport. This training is conducted when requested. Refresher training is available using course material located on the Navy Knowledge Online system. 85 Joint Biological Point Detection System: The Navy's Program for Biological Defense 85Joint Biological Point Detection System: The Navy's Program for Biological Defense Local Control SubstationCollector Identifier JBPDS Controller Assembly (JCA) CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systems87 Accelerated Fielding of the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) to Large Deck Ships The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 di- rectly impacted the missions of USS Ronald Rea - gan (CVN 76) in late spring 2009 and USS Bataan (LHD 5) and other Navy ships by summer 2009. Because of the close quarters of a shipboard en-vironment, a respiratory illness such as influenza spreads rapidly and renders personnel unable to perform their normal duties. As a result, scheduled exercises may be canceled, or deployments may be postponed until the situation is mitigated. The 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza began in March 2009 with an \"influenza-like illness\" that spread rapidly within Mexico, and a nationwide alert for Mexico was issued in April. As the illness in Mexico was confirmed to be H1N1, the first re-ported cases in the United States were announced. The H1N1 strain was anticipated to become pan-demic in a short period of time due to its infectious-ness and its exposure to a population that traveled freely to other areas of the world. As new outbreaks were anticipated, and no vaccine was available, by August 2009, Vice Admiral Gortney stated \"an ur - gent need to expedite\" and requested the accelerated fielding of the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) to provide ship medical personnel the H1N1 diagnostic capability on forward-deployed ships. The Office of the Joint Project Manager for Chem/Bio Medical Systems provided H1N1 support equipment to supplement the JBAIDS package and assisted in the acceleration process to field JBAIDS to the ships. Flu is a serious illness, as each year a number of people\u2014usually the older population or persons with pre-existing conditions\u2014die after contracting a flu virus. For seasonal influenza, 90 percent of the deaths are of persons 65 years or older. Nonethe-less, previously healthy individuals also die each year from flu and its complications. Unlike the other influenza strains, H1N1 primarily impact-ed children and younger adults. Data taken from April to July of 2009 shows the infection rate of H1N1 to be 20 times higher for the age group of 4 to 25 years compared to the age group of 65 years or older. Of patients hospitalized with H1N1 influ-enza, 41 percent of the deaths were of patients 25 to 49 years old, compared to 9 percent of patients 65 years and older. Each year, projections are made of which strains of flu are most likely to impact the popula-tion based on observations of emerging and exist-ing illnesses. Once strains are identified, a vaccine is prepared to incorporate elements of the combi-nation of strains in the annual flu shot. Over a rela-tively short period of time, however, flu strains can change and combine. Genetic material of a virus can change, or parts of different flu viruses can combine during infection in a host, and a new strain (with changed or combined genetic material) can emerge 87Accelerated Fielding of the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) to Large Deck Ships88 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemsto be transferred to the next host. That is why the flu shot is updated annually, and why a person may re-tain some immunity to a current flu from previous flu shots. The 2009 H1N1 strain contained compo-nents of human, swine, and avian flu viruses. Following the initial confirmations in Mexi- co and the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) mapped the areas of H1N1 influ-enza cases with frequent updates over the months as H1N1 rapidly spread throughout the world. The H1N1 diagnostic assay, provided by the CDC, was adapted and tested for use on JBAIDS and received Food and Drug Administration authorization for emergency use in August 2009. Concurrently, a new vaccine for H1N1 was prepared to be admin-istered in addition to the annual flu shot. Although the Navy JBAIDS fielding plan prior to 2009 did not include the delivery of medical diagnostic as-says for clinical specimens, JBAIDS does have the capability to perform a diagnostic identification of H1N1 in a clinical specimen aboard ship. JBAIDS is the program of record to meet the need for confirmatory testing of possible contam-ination by biological warfare agents aboard ship. Hand-held assays for presumptive testing of bio-logical warfare agents from environmental sam-ples are utilized to provide a quick-look result in minutes. However, these assays do not have the ac-curacy needed to justify the medical treatment of the crew. JBAIDS utilizes polymerase chain reac-tion technology, which is more accurate than the antigen-antibody-based technology utilized in the hand-held assays. JBAIDS provides confirmatory identification in a matter of a few hours. For legal and forensic purposes, a sample can also be sent away to a definitive laboratory, but this more thor - ough identification can take weeks, which is too long in order to begin implementation of protec-tive measures for the warfighter aboard ship. With contamination or infection by known biological agents, specific symptoms can be anticipated, ap-propriate medication for prophylaxis or treatment can be identified, likely course of illness or con-tamination can be anticipated, and the appropriate protective posture can be implemented. JBAIDS is shown in Figure 1. The acceleration of JBAIDS fielding required attention to several items, as the logistical, train-ing, personnel, and financial plans assumed a 3-year time frame. While the modification and testing of the H1N1 assay for use on the JBAIDS platform was underway during spring 2009, per - sonnel at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahl-gren Division (NSWCDD) responded to the possibility of accelerating the fielding by address-ing the shortest time possible to get the H1N1 di-agnostic capability with JBAIDS to the ships. This included the renegotiation of contracts to acquire Figure 1. Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) 89 Accelerated Fielding of the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) to Large Deck Shipsthe hardware and perishable consumables in a shorter time frame, the surge in training by the JBAIDS schoolhouse to accommodate additional Navy JBAIDS operators, the surge in provision of operator support, and the accelerated install pro-cess (with all the coordination and work needed to formally install a system aboard ship). After all time requirements for the different aspects of field-ing were identified, the JBAIDS fielding schedule was compressed from 3 years to 9 months. With receipt of the Vice Admiral's request to acceler - ate fielding in August 2009, NSWCDD was poised to respond immediately with the 9-month field-ing schedule. Since the initiation of the accelerated fielding of JBAIDS, an effective vaccine for H1N1 has been produced and administered. In Figure 2, a hospi-tal corpsman is shown preparing to administer an H1N1 flu vaccine aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD 5). The availability and administration of the H1N1 vaccine allayed many of the fears of the ef-fects of H1N1 globally; however, NSWCDD's ability to rapidly mobilize the H1N1 diagnostic capability to the ships emplaced an infrastructure for the next pandemic should another strain mutate or should a new biological threat present itself. Consequently, naval warfighters will be better protected from fu-ture biological threats. Figure 2. ATLANTIC OCEAN (5 December 2009) Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Eric M.

(U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Anthony Sisti/Released) 90 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsImproving Reliability of Shipboard Chemical Agent Detection By Christopher Bara and Brian Flaherty Chemical warfare agent (CW A) detection is a priority for U.S. Navy warfighters. Detecting an attack and having the capability to alert the crew to the presence of CW As is critical in saving lives and minimizing harmful exposure. Currently, the U.S. Navy uses the Improved Point Detection System (IPDS) to provide its ships with automat-ed CW A detection. IPDS uses ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as its chemical detection technology. This technology ionizes the chemical agent and then sorts the ions based on molecu-lar size and shape in an electric field in order to produce a spectrum. The algorithm compares this spectrum to reference spectra and identifies the chemical. The IPDS has components located on both port and starboard, and samples through external air in-takes in the ship's hull. The system analyzes the external air for a chemical agent. If the detector identifies a chemical agent, it sends a signal that displays an alert at both the ship's Damage Control Central (DCC) and the bridge. The system also interfaces di-rectly to the ship's chemical alarm, which broadcasts an audible shipwide alarm to alert the crew of a CW A. The current IPDS, fielded in 1999, provides automated shipboard chemical detec- tion; however, issues of obsolescence, maintainability, and the resulting increase in re-pair time drove the requirement for a replacement system. A review of the current IPDS established that it was neither technically feasible nor cost-effective to refurbish the ex-isting system. The original equipment manufacturer no longer supports the IPDS, and the current system is susceptible to false identification to many normal chemicals in the shipboard environment. Moreover, Navy analysis indicates that the current IPDS will be unsupportable by 2014, thus requiring fielding of a replacement to begin in 2011, well in advance of the Next-Generation Chemical Agent Point Detector system's initial field-ing in 2020. Consequently, the Navy's senior chemical biological defense (CBD) lead-ership requested the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO - CBD) to develop and field a life-cycle replacement to provide protection for this interim period. The Joint Project Manager for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Contamina- tion Avoidance\u2014working with the Navy's chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) Action Officer and Naval Sea Systems Command 91 Improving Reliability of Shipboard Chemical Agent Detection(NAVSEA) CBD Technical Warrant Holder\u2014have worked to select and evaluate a potential commer - cial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution to this fleet re-quest. Titled the Improved Point (Chemical Vapor) Detection - Life-Cycle Replacement (IPDS-LR) ef-fort, the joint team evaluated multiple candidates in an open competition. The joint team evaluated the candidate systems based on each system's abil-ity to meet the requirements set forth in the orig-inal IPDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD). This was supplemented with a robust per - formance specification and CW A surety detection capability using the more recent U.S. Army Cen-ter for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) information. The IPDS-LR sys-tem also needed to be able to be packaged to meet form/fit/function requirements to allow reuse of current shipboard IPDS installation foundations. Despite utilizing the same basic IMS technology, the IPDS-LR demonstrated the ability to meet the requirement for mean time between false alarms. Figure 1 shows the IPDS-LR component image compared to IPDS. IPDS-LR system testing consisted of extensive production verification testing (PVT). The PVT emphasized Navy shipboard maritime environ-ment and reliability, availability, and maintainabil-ity (RAM) events, since it was the prime program initiator. The team collected over 14,000 hours of underway and in-port test time to support the RAM analysis utilizing multiple ships (and ship classes) stationed from both Norfolk, Virginia, and San Di-ego, California, areas. Additional data collection continued aboard ships in forward-deployed lo-cations. The shipboard test data verified that the IPDS-LR had improved on the deficiency of IPDS in both RAM and shipboard mean time between false alarms. In conjunction with shipboard testing, the team conducted laboratory testing against known interferents to determine the shipboard chem-ical to false identification relationship. To date, IPDS-LR has demonstrated the ability to meet the Navy's false-alarm frequency, as well as its RAM criteria. While the current concept of operations (CONOPS) is based on short-term continuous op-eration, IPDS-LR PVT testing systems operated continually when aboard ship, as well as during op-erational service-life testing. Additionally, the cur - rent IPDS CONOPS states that IPDS should not be operated in the rain. However, to fully characterize the IPDS-LR performance and to reduce the work-load on the Sailor, the test plan dictated continu-ous system operation\u2014even during rainy weather. In the course of this test, one significant RAM issue surfaced. During rainy weather, the air sam-pling system often pulled water through the inlet nozzle (i.e., system air-sampling inlet and exhaust nozzle are part of the External Air Sampling Unit (EASU) component). The EASU is the only part of the system on the outside of the ship. All other Figure 1. IPDS/IPDS-LR Components 92 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemscomponents, including the detection units, are in- ternally located. In several cases, rainwater saturat-ed the sampling-line membrane filter. The resulting blockage of airflow would then cause the sampling pump to shut down (system self-protection mode) and require the detection unit to be offline until the water blockage was cleared (via system backflush or manual membrane drying). The self-protection mode prevented water from penetrating this mem-brane filter and damaging the pump. Nevertheless, as this issue occurred repeatedly in wet situations, the IPDS-LR team and the IPDS-LR manufacturer developed and implemented a de-sign change on the inlet nozzle. The original design consisted of four small holes, in close proximity, al-lowing blockage by water droplets running down the ship's bulkhead onto the inlet assembly. The new inlet nozzle has a large, flared opening designed to separate the water droplets, while still allowing ac-cess to collect air. Figure 2 shows a side-by-side comparison of the old and new nozzle designs. Fol-low-on shipboard testing with the new inlet noz-zle resulted in no further water ingestion problems. Additionally, airflow \"smoke\" testing validated that the new nozzle design would not negatively impact the sampling airflow getting to the detector. The team analyzed IPDS-LR shipboard PVT data to determine system performance with re-spect to false identification alarms. The IPDS ORD states that the system shall operate with an average not to exceed one false alarm per mission, where a mission is a period of continual operation lasting between 24 and 144 hours. As mission length can be variable, this analysis considered the maximum and minimum number of missions during the test periods (dividing 24 and 144 hours, respectively, into the test duration for maximum and minimum number of missions). The IPDS-LR met this spec-ification. PVT evaluations also included CW A sure- ty performance, environmental survivability, and operational service life (maritime/salt air environ-ment), as well as shipboard shock, vibration, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) qualification. 1 As the IPDS-LR is considered an essential ship-board system, the shipboard mounting must al-low it to survive and continue to operate after a dynamic impact simulating attack by large mu-nitions. This dynamic impact must not cause the mounted system to break free and become a projec-tile hazard. Follow-on operational test and evalua-tion (FOT&E) included challenging the IPDS-LR system with a CW A simulant (methyl salicylate) in an operationally relevant environment, with the ship both in port and underway. These trials oc-curred during August 2010. All PVT and FOT&E results are being reviewed, and a decision will be made regarding the procurement of additional IPDS-LR systems. Assuming IPDS-LR is deemed acceptable for fielding to the U.S. Navy, production system deliveries will occur from 2011 to 2015. Reference 1.

It was a difficult task, but the Marines were up to the challenge. The mission was complicat-ed by the enemy's use of chemical munitions in their artillery attacks. Initial indications suggest-ed it was the nerve agent VX. There were casu-alties, but the Marines were ready, trained, and equipped to fight in a chemical, biological, and ra-diological (CBR) environment. Triage and casu-alty decontamination operations were conducted on shore, and the casualties were evacuated back to the amphibious ready group for more defini-tive treatment. Once aboard the amphibious as-sault ship, the patients were processed through the ship's collective protection system (CPS) casu-alty decontamination station and into the medi-cal collective protection zone for further medical evaluation and treatment. Treatment of all Marine casualties was successful. Notwithstanding, with-out the extended CPS installed on the amphibious assault ship, the Marines in this hypothetical sce-nario might not have been so fortunate. The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) funded the installation of additional CPS capa-bility on 15 amphibious ships as part of the CPS Backfit Program. This program retrofits U.S. Navy ships with reliable CPS to protect the warf-ighter and ensure mission success despite the CBR threat from adversary nation states and ter - rorist organizations. The CPS provides areas protected from CBR contamination, called CPS zones, where the crew can continue operations unencumbered by individual protective equipment. CPS con-sists of three main components: filtration, over - pressurization, and controlled access. Filtration provides clean air\u2014free from CBR agents\u2014to the zone. Overpressurization of the zone as-sures that the clean air leaks out of the zone, preventing contaminated air from leaking in. 95U.S. Navy Ships Get Chem-Bio Protection96 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systems Controlled access is provided through decon- tamination stations and air locks, which allows decontaminated personnel to enter and exit the zone while maintaining the overpressure. Many ship classes are built with CPS already installed; however, some classes were built with limited coverage or no CPS at all. The crews of am-phibious ships, operating close to shore while re-ceiving potentially contaminated Marines, have increased risk of exposure to CBR threats. The CPS Backfit Program retrofits CPS zones onto these amphibious warfare ships in order to reduce the impact of exposure to CBR threats. The CPS Backfit Acquisition Program Manager (APM), based at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), manages the CPS Backfit Program for the Joint Project Manager for Protection, who reports directly to the JPEO - CBD. The CPS Backfit Program has developed CPS zone designs for each ship class, which protect key mission functions. The designs have been optimized to balance the amount of area protected with the intrusiveness and complexity of the system installation. The CPS Backfit APM works with the Program Executive Office (PEO) Ships, Naval Sea Systems Command and the ships' planning yards to adapt the class designs to each ship. In addition to improving performance, the APM works to reduce installation and life-cycle costs at every opportunity to ensure that the government is receiving the maximum value for its investment. 96CBRD Figure 1.

The on-site representatives resolve all technical issues and questions that arise. These on-site representatives manage the costs associated with installation prob-lems and design changes to ensure that costs are contained. Also, the on-site representatives facili-tate communication among the disparate organi-zations involved in the ship's availability, including: PEO Ships Ship's Force Naval Sea Systems Command Planning Y ards Regional Maintenance Centers Shipyard Contractors and Subcontractors The on-site representatives address any concerns Ship's Force may have with the system or its in-stallation and ensure that the ship understands the new capability, and that the crew is fully trained to use and maintain the system. The CPS Backfit alteration (Navy-speak for modifications and upgrades to existing ships) is complex and intrusive. The installation significant-ly impacts the ship's structural design; heating, ven-tilation, and air conditioning (HV AC) and electrical systems. A typical CPS Backfit alters nu-merous spaces to create the new CPS zone, which requires significant structural modifications. Leaky sheet-metal bulkheads are removed and replaced with 42,000 lb of airtight steel bulkheads to form the new CPS decontamination station and up to 13 new air locks. Additionally, sheet-metal doors are replaced with watertight steel doors along the boundary of the zone. Multiple existing fresh-air supply systems are removed and replaced with CPS filtered-air supply systems in completely new fan rooms that house the filters, fans, heaters, cool-ing coils, and other equipment needed to bring the CPS filtered air into the zone. The other ventilation systems in the zone are completely reconfigured to tie into the new fresh-air supplies. In total, over half a mile of ventilation ducting is rerouted, up to 21 fans are replaced with new fans, and numerous HV AC components are upgraded. Furthermore, 25,000 ft of electrical cable are installed to provide power to the new ventilation equipment and oth-er electrical equipment relocated in support of the new bulkheads and ventilation. The 15th and final programmed installation for the CPS Backfit Program is scheduled for com-pletion in 2015. The JPEO-CBD has invested more than $141M to provide the Navy amphibious fleet the required capabilities to continue critical opera-tions in a CBR environment. Accordingly, Marines and Navy warfighters will have the best shipborne CBR defenses available to protect them from the threat of CBR contaminants.98 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsThe Navy Shipboard Collective Protection System (CPS): Not Just for Chemical-Biological-Radiological Defense Anymore By Mike Pompeii What Is a Collective Protection System (CPS)? Most U.S. Navy ships are equipped with a special ventilation system called the Col- lective Protection System (CPS). CPSs were originally designed to protect personnel and equipment inside ships from chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) attacks. Col-lective protection works by using special filters to remove any contaminants from intake ventilation air and then providing a slight overpressure inside the CPS zone to prevent entry of contaminants through any leak paths. In a typical CPS zone on a ship, contam-inated outside air is drawn in, cleaned by special filters, and distributed throughout the zone. Air locks and special decontamination stations are used by personnel for exiting and entering the CPS zone, respectively. Figure 1 shows the layout of a typical CPS zone. The Known Roles of CPSs Without CPS, many missions would be extremely difficult or impossible to accom- plish in a CBR-contaminated environment. Imagine a crew trying to perform work while wearing cumbersome protective clothing, especially in command and control or medical areas. Moreover, collective protection is essential for missions in warm or hot weather because protective clothing can be worn only for very short periods of time. Personnel in CPS zones do not need to wear cumbersome gas masks or protective cloth-ing, which can degrade mission accomplishment. Testing has shown shipboard CPS to be very effective at protecting a ship and its crew from CBR warfare agents. 1, 2 Deadly chemical nerve agents such as sarin, soman, tabun, and VX, along with blister agents such as sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard, and lewisite are completely filtered and removed by CPS. Biological warfare agents such as anthrax, tularemia, and botulinum toxin are completely removed as well. Collective pro-tection is also very effective at removing all radioactive dirt, dust, and particles that re-sult from a nuclear blast.99 The Navy Shipboard Collective Protection System (CPS): Not Just for Chemical-Biological-Radiological Defense AnymoreThe Top Ten Generally Unrecognized Roles of CPS The roles, benefits, and costs of CPSs histor - ically have been misunderstood. In addition to its original CBR defense role, CPS has taken on many new roles over the last 15 years, as increas-ingly more ships have been outfitted with CPS and have become dependent on CPS in areas other than CBR defense. Shipboard systems and proce-dures have become dependent on CPS in different ways and for different purposes. These unforeseen and unrecognized benefits of CPS have been both direct and indirect, while providing valuable pro-tection, battle damage, and cost- and labor-saving advantages to our ships.Ship program managers need to carefully con- sider all aspects of shipboard CPS from a total ship systems-engineering viewpoint. This includes the primary and secondary benefits, other shipboard system dependencies, and the significant amount of unrealized life-cycle cost and manpower savings for U.S. Navy ships provided by CPS. The top ten generally unrecognized roles of shipboard CPS are discussed in the following para-graphs. 1. P rotection from toxic industrial chemicals (TICs)\u2014Toxic chemicals used by industry are abundant and are shipped daily in large quantities over highways, rail lines, and wa-terways. Use of these TICs by terrorists or Figure 1. Layout of a Typical Collective Protection System Zone100 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemsaccidents is very feasible, and CPS provides the ships with this needed protection. 2. P rotection from petroleum fumes \u2014Crews must also be protected from noxious pe-troleum fumes while operating in areas of major oil leaks (for example, the Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010) or sabotaged oil wells (for example, in Operation Desert Storm in 1991). CPS effectively provides this pro-tection to the ship. 3. P rotection from terrorist use of radiological dispersion devices (dirty bombs)\u2014Radioac-tive particles from dirty bombs can travel significant distances and render large areas uninhabitable for many years. Again, CPS is very effective at protecting the interior ship spaces from these types of weapons or releases. 4. P rotection from battle and smoke damage\u2014 Immediately after the terrorist attack on USS Cole (see Figure 2), the ship's CPS was responsible for limiting smoke and soot damage to just one of the ship's four CPS zones. This greatly enabled rescue and re-pair efforts and saved an estimated mil-lions of dollars in equipment, cleanup, and repair costs. Quoting from USS Cole 's Damage Control Report, \"In the blast area mostly between frame 220 and 174 damage was everywhere. Debris, trash, the smell, soot-covered bulkheads, etc. It was simply throughout. But out-side the area, if you had not known better, it looked as if it was a different ship. Bulk-heads were clean, along with just about ev-erything. \" The report went on to say:\" All the debris that covered the outside of the ship had been filtered out, and the over pressurization inside had either minimized or completely protected the unaffected ar - eas of the ship. Collective protection had worked and protected this crew in may-be a completely different faction then (sic) thought of in the beginning. \" The report also included details on how the CPS enhanced the recovery efforts that took place both immediately after the at-tack and during near- and mid-term repair and recovery efforts. 3 5. R apid de-smoking and smoke control during and after fires\u2014CPS zones can be quickly configured to use its overpressure to rapid-ly purge (in seconds) any smoke from any area within a CPS zone. For example, on a DDG-class ship, the damage control and firefighting team can simply open all in-terconnecting doors for each of the three Figure 2.

All smoke will be purged through that door or hatch in a matter of seconds. 6. P rotection from dust storms \u2014CPS rou- tinely provides protection of interior spac-es from dust and sand storms commonly encountered in the Southwest Asia area. Without CPS, the ship's crew must perform extensive clean up of interior spaces after such storms. The Damage Control Assis-tant (DCA) aboard USS Barry (DDG 52), an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile de-stroyer, when referring to a recent deploy-ment, said: \"CPS helped keep the ship clean, even in some of the worst environmental condi-tions. We shook out the prefilters after a dust storm, and continued to check them on a regular basis. I couldn't imagine going through that deployment without CPS; it would have been a nightmare to clean the s h i p.\" 4 Figure 3 shows a dust storm over the Per - sian Gulf. 7. I ncreased crew health, habitability, and comfort \u2014Since the crew is basically living and working full-time in a clean-room en-vironment, they are always breathing pu-rified air and are exposed to virtually no environmental pollutants, pollens, or dust. 8. H igher electronics reliability due to a dust- free environment\u2014It is a well-known fact that most electronics failures are caused by a dust buildup from electrostatic forc-es, causing excessive heating, short-cir - cuiting, and subsequent early failure of electronic components. 5 A ship is full of sophisticated electronics and is high-ly susceptible to dust buildup and elec-tronics failures. The CPS system provides Figure 3. Satellite View of a Typical Dust Storm Often Encountered by Navy Ships 102 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemsan almost completely dust-free environ- ment inside the ship. So without CPS, one must include a significant life-cycle cost increase to account for these higher electronics failure rates. This cost savings is complex and very difficult to quanti-fy, however, due to the number of uncon-trolled variables involved in any type of CPS/non-CPS comparison test. Figures 4 and 5 show the effects of dust buildup on electronics. 9. L ess maintenance for combat systems and electronics \u2014Excessive dust loading not only reduces the reliability of electronics, but also increases the maintenance hours required for those exposed electronics. Without CPS, one must include signifi-cant life-cycle cost and maintenance hour increases to account for the increased dust load present on any air-cooled electronics in non-CPS zones. 10. L ess general cleaning hours by the crew\u2014 Have you ever been on board a ship with CPS? If you have, it is very obvious how clean it is compared to a ship without CPS. That's because most of the dirt and dust in-side a ship comes in through the ventilation system, and the CPS filters it all. With-out CPS, one must significantly increase the crew maintenance hours required for cleaning due to the significantly increased dust load. This is especially critical for new and mandated reduced-shipboard man-ning initiatives. In addition, CPS zones require no ductwork cleaning, while non-CPS zones require extensive and time- consuming duct cleaning approximately every 2 years. Cost is significant and var - ies by ship type. How Much Does CPS Actually Cost to Install and Operate? The initial installation cost and the life-cycle cost of CPS historically has been misunderstood. A common misconception is that \"CPS is too ex-pensive\" to install on a ship when, in fact, it really is not. CPS uses much of the same ductwork, recir - culation systems, and exhaust fans that are used in non-CPS shipboard ventilation systems. The only significant difference between CPS and non-CPS ventilation systems are the filters, the filter hous-ings, high-pressure fans (versus low-pressure fans in non-CPS systems), and air locks used in CPS. Therefore, when calculating the cost of CPS, the cost estimator must subtract the cost of a complete conventional shipboard ventilation system. The true extra cost of CPS was analyzed in a 2002 report and found to be approximately $168 per cubic feet per minute (CFM) more when compared to a conventional shipboard ventilation Figure 4. Typical Dust Buildup in an Electronic System 103 The Navy Shipboard Collective Protection System (CPS): Not Just for Chemical-Biological-Radiological Defense Anymoresystem.6 For a destroyer-sized ship with two large CPS zones and two medium-sized CPS zones, this equals about $3 million in extra costs. Smaller sized ships and/or ships with fewer than four CPS zones would, of course, cost significantly less. The support and logistics cost of CPS also has been historically misunderstood. For logistics, the only consumable items that the ship needs to pur - chase are disposable prefilters. These prefilters last from 3 to 6 months, are easy to replace, and cost about $25 each ($2 thousand to $4 thousand per year for a DDG 51). The main CBR filters last 3 to 5 years, are paid for by the Office of the Chief of Na-val Operations (OPNAV), and are installed and test-ed by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). Ships, therefore, do not pay for these more expen-sive filters. Other maintenance actions required for CPS are very similar in type and numbers as com-pared to maintenance for a conventional shipboard ventilation system. The total life-cycle cost of CPS for each ship, therefore, is relatively low. Notwith-standing, these correct cost factors must be used by ship program offices to determine the true cost of installing CPS on their ships. Summary A CPS has many valuable and important ship- board benefits besides CBR protection. Accordingly, CPS provides a significant amount of unrecognized life-cycle cost and manpower savings for U.S. Navy ships. That said, a total ship systems engineering ap-proach must be used when considering CPS instal-lation and coverage on new or existing ship classes. The primary benefits, the secondary benefits, oth-er shipboard-system dependencies, and the overall reduction in life-cycle cost provided by shipboard CPS\u2014all must be considered when designing, building, and backfitting our ships. The lives of our Sailors depend on it. References 1.

Dust Buildup on a Typical Electronics Board 104 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination SystemsThe Impact of the Environment on Collective Protection Filters By Carlos Murillo Collective protection filters are utilized throughout the military for various appli- cations from naval vessels, military installations, and mobile platforms such as tanks to portable shelters like field hospitals. These filters are installed in ventilation systems to protect warfighters and civilians from chemical, biological, and radiological attacks. An area of great concern is a filtration system's ability to remove chemicals from the air - stream as the filter ages over time. Understanding environmental effects, therefore, is critical to the success of military technologies, especially in the area of filtration. The impact of pollution has become an important variable that needs to be con- sidered in the life cycle of military-relevant filtration systems. Filters don't just absorb chemical and biological warfare agents; they also filter out chemicals normally found in the atmosphere: sulfur dioxide, ammonia, paint remover, industrial solvents, partial-ly combusted diesel fuel, and more. For this reason, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) scientists analyzed filters from Navy vessels and land-based facilities that were exposed to heavy construction and pollution to identify con-taminants. Filter samples not only were evaluated for their remaining filtration capacity, but they were also analyzed to identify chemicals that had been absorbed by the carbon media over time. This analysis required an understanding of how filters function. A collective protection filter is a set comprising a High Efficiency Particle Arresting or High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter and a carbon filter collectively known as the M98 filter set. HEPA filters provide an excellent means of removing an extreme-ly high percentage of biological and particulate material (both solid and liquid) from the air. HEPA media consists of a nonwoven sheet fabricated from glass and polymer - ic fibers. The sheet is pleated to allow more filter material in a smaller space. The fibers remove particles from the air by mechanical trapping that includes sieve effects, impac-tion, interception, and diffusion processes, in addition to static charge effects. 1 The M98 filter set is shown in Figure 1. The carbon portion of the collective protection filter is made of activated coal-based carbon that has been impregnated with metallic salts. The carbon media filters the air stream by removing harmful vapors, chemical contaminants, and normal atmospher - ic pollution (e.g., sulfur dioxide). These harmful chemicals are removed by physical ad-sorption into the micropores of the carbon granules, 2 as well as by chemical reaction with impregnants deposited on the carbon media. As a guideline, chemicals that have 105 The Impact of the Environment on Collective Protection FiltersFigure 1. M98 Filters Installed in Series low vapor pressures (approximately 10 mm Hg or less) are removed by physical absorption onto the pores of the carbon media. For chemicals with high vapor pressures (greater than 10 mm Hg), purifica-tion of the airstream is accomplished by chemical reaction of the gases with the metallic salts on the carbon media. As previously mentioned, military installations and naval vessels employ carbon filters installed in their ventilation systems as a form of protection against chemical, biological, and, radiological at-tacks. However, as time progresses, the protection levels of these filters begin to degrade. 3 The main causes for diminished levels of protection include: Access to reactive sites has been blocked by adsorbed contaminants Metallic salts have reacted with acidic type pollutants Reactive salts have migrated due to moisture adsorption These causes are of great concern since na- val ships are continuously exposed to humid air and high pollution levels in ports. Consequent-ly, vessels periodically need to have their filters re-placed. Land-based facilities, too, can be exposed to high levels of humidity and pollution from various sources such as automobiles, cleaners, smokers, and construction, or when remodeling occurs. As an example, NSWCDD scientists and engi- neers removed a filter from a military installation that had been exposed to construction and pollu-tion. The carbon media was removed and analyzed. The analysis was performed using gas chromatog-raphy-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). GC-MS is a combination of two techniques that are combined to form a single method for analyzing mixtures of chemicals. GC separates the different compounds within a sample, and then MS is utilized to charac-terize each of the individual compounds. By using this technique, scientists can identify and charac-terize the chemicals that desorb off of the carbon media when it is heated to high temperatures. The chromatogram of a sample is shown in Figure 2. The x-axis is the retention time, and the y-axis is the signal intensity, which is directly related to the concentration of that compound in the sample. The values shown by the peaks are elution times\u2014the time required for the compound to exit the chro-matography column. Every chemical has a unique retention time. MS characterizes individual compounds by the mass-to-charge ratio of the individual fragments 106 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemsthat compose the molecule. As the individual com- pounds exit the GC column, they enter a mass spec-trum detector. In this detector, the chemical collides with a stream of electrons that break the molecule into fragments. The mass spectrum produced by a given chemical compound is essentially the same every time; it is a fingerprint for a molecule. Figure 3 shows a mass spectrum along with a match from the chemical library. Analysis results of the filters exposed to com- bustion and pollution showed that a significant amount of chemical was adsorbed onto the me-dia. Knowing that the filter tested was exposed directly to construction, the obvious conclusion was that these compounds represented a mixture of pollution and chemicals found in a construc-tion area, perhaps combined with some naturally occurring environmental compounds. Scientists focused on products used in construction and found in pollution, such as paint thinners, caulk-ing, and fuel byproducts. They found that the primary components of a typical brand of paint thinner include: Either naphtha or Stoddard solvent A benzene derivative, such as 1,2,4-trimethyl-benzene or xylenes (dimethyl-substituted ben-zene) Secondary components\u2014such as and ketones\u2014are found in some paint thin-ners. Fuel byproducts can be classified in two categories: tailpipe emissions and evaporative emissions. 4 Tailpipe emissions are the byproducts created in the normal operation of machines. The makeup of the emissions is dependent on the ini-tial composition of the fuel used. Byproducts of in-complete combustion must also be considered in tailpipe emissions. Evaporative emissions represent all other emissions aside from tailpipe emissions, Figure 2. A Chromatogram of a Carbon Sample From a Filter Figure 3. A mass spectrum of ethylbenzene along with the standard spectrum from a chemical library\u2014 ethylbenzene is a compound that can be found in fuel, paints, and tar.107 The Impact of the Environment on Collective Protection Filters such as resting emissions and leaks. These emis- sions usually are characterized by high content of smaller hydrocarbons. 4 The chemical composition of vehicle-related volatile organic compound emis-sions includes a large variety of compounds that were analyzed and that fit into eight basic groups: N-Alkanes Isoalkanes Cycloalkanes Alkenes Aromatics Acetylene Oxygenates Carbonyls Almost all of the chemicals found on the filter fit into one of these eight categories. Conclusions Since the capacity of the filter is based on ab- sorption volume, it can be hypothesized that pol-lution due to construction and vehicle exhaust can have a direct impact on the capacity and lifetime of a filter. This is also critical for navy vessels, as they make port calls to various locations through-out the globe. Some nations have fewer environ-mental regulations than the United States, which corresponds to an increase in exposure to toxic air pollution. Consequently, the results of this analy-sis are of significant value to the armed services be-cause these conclusions enable scientists to design solutions for longer filter life or help shape filter change-out timelines. That has the potential to save the Navy millions of dollars in material and main-tenance costs while providing warfighters with the protection they need. References 1.

Jackson and Sharon M. Parish109 Navy Chemical Decontamination: Effectively Fielding New Skin Decontamination SolutionThe Navy has used the M291 Skin Decontam- ination Kit since the early 1990s. An absorbent of chemical agents, an M291 kit contains six individ-ual pads impregnated with a charcoal-like, resin-based power. The M291 Decontamination Kit is shown in Figure 1. The Joint Service Personnel Decontamination System (JSPDS) Program launched a search for an upgraded skin decontamination system, ulti-mately selecting a commercial product\u2014Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion (RSDL). The Feder - al Drug Administration approved RSDL as a skin decontaminant, as it provides warfighters with a greater decontaminating capability than M291 for the nerve agents VX and soman (GD), and for the mustard blister agent (HD). Moreover, one appli-cation of RSDL is contained in one packet instead of two, as with M291, thus simplifying the pro-cess required for applying skin decontaminant. An opened packet of RSDL is shown in Figure 2. While RSDL provides increased capabilities, it poses sustainment challenges for the Navy. Spe-cifically, RSDL exposed to a static temperature of 120\u00b0F or greater has an operational life of 24 weeks. However, if the static operational tempera-ture is less than 120\u00b0F, the operational life of RSDL Figure 2. An opened packet of Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion (RSDL) is shown with the applicator. The applicator is used to apply the RSDL onto equipment or personnel to decontaminate chemical agents. Figure 1. M291 Decontamination Kit 110 CBRD Detection, Collective Protection, and Decontamination Systemsis 24 months. Given that typical Navy deploy- ments last longer than 24 weeks, the Naval Sea Systems Command's (NAVSEA 's) Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) was tasked to assess operational temperatures that RSDL would likely be exposed to during opera-tional deployments. The intent of this effort was to see if actual temperatures stay below 120\u00b0F and to estimate the useful operational life under actu-al fielding conditions. NSWCDD championed this effort, which em- ployed Universal Serial Bus (USB) Temperature Dataloggers from Extech Instruments Corporation to monitor operational temperatures. The temper - ature dataloggers are placed on board ships in de-contamination station areas and inside individual protective equipment kit bags for ground forces. Is-sued through the Readiness Assist Visit team and the Readiness Improvement Program, the datalog-gers provide the ability to estimate operational tem-perature exposure to RSDL if placed in these areas. Placement of dataloggers in these areas is significant because operational temperatures can vary within the course of a day for both ashore and afloat oper - ational environments. Notwithstanding, the JSPDS program used mean kinetic temperature (MKT) as a simplified way of expressing the overall effect of temperature variation once RSDL is removed from controlled temperature storage. The advantage of using the MKT is that it takes into account short temperature excursions above 120\u00b0F that may not reduce the operational life to 24 weeks. The bene-fit of a 24-month operational life for unused RSDL is that it can be reissued within the span of the 24 months, which results in a cost savings to the NAVSEA Decontamination Program. Additionally, the Joint Program Executive Of- fice for Chemical and Biological Defense has devel-oped a time temperature indicator (TTI) to include on RSDL packets when manufactured. TTIs incor - porate MKT to accurately determine the service life limits of RSDL exposed to various temperatures. TTIs, therefore, assist with RSDL management by providing visible information reflecting product quality. An example TTI is shown in Figure 3. The temperature analysis provided by NAVSEA 's Dahlgren and Carderock warfare centers will aid de-contamination support decision makers in deter - mining how much RSDL the Navy needs to procure each fiscal year, which will further aid in develop-ing a more accurate RSDL sustainment budget. More importantly, this analysis will help to ensure that warfighters afloat and ashore continue to be equipped with the most effective skin decontami-nation solution despite fluctuations in operational temperatures over time.

Brown Scientists and engineers routinely use modeling and simulation (M&S) in the course of their work. M&S provides decision makers with information in the context of mili- tary operations, and its use is becoming more frequent. Department of Defense (DoD) regulations require M&S to be verified (did we build it right?), validated (did we build the right thing?), and accredited for each intended use and environment (can we use what we built to do what we want, where we want, and by the people we want to use it?). 1 This article will describe the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and its verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&A). What Is the Joint Effects Model (JEM)? The JEM is a computer model that predicts the hazards and toxic effects that can re- sult from enemy use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons, as well as from releases involving toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) or toxic industrial materials (TIMs). JEM is the first model of its kind to be verified, validated, and accred-ited for use by DoD. Users of the JEM define or select a specific release from one of the incident source models (ISMs), and the JEM then transports the material downwind while calculating natural dispersive behavior. Once the location and amounts of haz-ardous material have been computed and stored, JEM then computes the severity of the hazard and displays it to the user. What Can JEM Be Used for? The JEM has a large number of intended uses as shown in Figure 1. Warfighters can use the JEM for operational uses\u2014defensive planning, reacting, and being aware of CBRN incidents. Warfighters can train with the JEM, too. Analytical users, who are typically DoD analysts, can use the JEM to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures while including any effects CBRN weapons might have on the numbers and kinds of military units, weapons, and/or defensive equipment needed in the future.113 Validation, Verification, and Accreditation Challenges for the Joint Effects Model (JEM)Incident Source Models (ISMs) JEM capabilities are defined by the incident types (ISMs) that can be modeled. The ISMs in JEM are: Chemical/Biological Weapon Strike (CBWS)\u2014 models the results of chemical or biological bomb, missile submunition, rocket, and ar - tillery attacks (see Figure 2). Aerosol spray-er attacks are also included. Outputs include: S urface Dosage S urface Deposition C oncentration I ntegrated Concentration P robability of Casualties P robability of Mortality P robability of Infection (biological agents only) Chemical Stored Weapon Incident (CSWI)\u2014models accidental releases at facilities where U.S. chemical weapons are stored pending disposal. Outputs are the same as for CBWS except for surface deposition. Chemical or Biological Facilities Strike (CBFS)\u2014models standard, conventional munition at-tacks on chemical or biological production or storage facilities, with three levels of fidel-ity (Quick Calculation, Damage Category, and Detailed Model). TIMs are included as \"agents\" in the damage category option. Out-puts are the same as for CBWS. Chemical-Biological High-Altitude Release (CBHAR)\u2014models bulk chemical and sub-munition theater ballistic missile payloads released at altitudes over 20.5 km. Outputs are the same as for CBWS. Radiological Dispersion Weapon Detona-tion (RDWD)\u2014models \"dirty bombs\" where radiological materials are dispersed by con-ventional explosives. Outputs include radia-tion dose, radiation concentration, radiation deposition, and surface deposition. Nuclear Weapon Detonation (NWD)\u2014 mod-els selected NWDs. Outputs include radiation dose; probability of casualties; and the effects of blast, heat, and prompt radiation (which excludes radioactive fallout). Nuclear Reactor Facility Release (NRFR)\u2014models releases by, and selected accidents in, nuclear reactors. Outputs are the same as for RDWD. Nuclear Weapon Incident (NWI)\u2014models the release of special nuclear material from a weapon that has not produced a nuclear yield. Outputs are the same as for RDWD. Analytical Release Incident (ARI)\u2014models any release, provided the necessary parame-ters are known or postulated. This ISM rep-resents JEM's ability to model nonstandard incidents. Outputs include surface dose, sur - face deposition (liquids), concentration, and integrated concentration. The JEM is to be used operationally by all U.S. military services, individually and as part of joint operational task forces, as well as by analysts working in or for the DoD. The program can re-side within an organization's unique command and Figure 1. Joint Effects Model (JEM) Intended Uses114 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S)control system, and it can also be installed on a lap- top or desktop computer with a Windows operat-ing system. VV&A in General The goal of VV&A is accreditation, which is simply a statement saying whether or not a model meets all of the acceptability criteria for the mod-el's intended uses and can be used with or without limitations. Accreditation limitations are usually the uses that could be attempted by users but should also include uses for which the model is not suitable, should only be used with caution, or should be used only by subject matter experts. The intended uses are necessary in order to develop acceptability cri-teria (defining \"good enough\"); these, in turn, are used to identify verification and validation (V&V) tasks. Validation can be broken down into data val-idation, method validation, and output validation. Figure 3 depicts a generalized VV&A process. Intended Use(s) The intended uses of any particular M&S drive the type and kind of V&V that is done; otherwise, V&V\u2014not to mention development\u2014would never end. Thus, the intended uses of a model or simula-tion are critical. The intended uses must be spe-cific, and there must be things associated with the intended uses that can be measured or counted. Figure 2. Sample JEM hazard prediction from 32 bombs each filled with 500 kg of the nerve agent Sarin. The yellow triangles show the \"old\" method of estimating the hazard. The dotted black lines show the possible uncertainty in wind direction. The colored contour plots show three different levels of Sarin toxicity predicted by JEM. 115 Validation, Verification, and Accreditation Challenges for the Joint Effects Model (JEM)At first glance, it is not obvious that the JEM's in- tended uses can be measured or counted. However, what permits each of the intended uses are predic-tions of the location and severity of some kind of physical process (a dosage, concentration, or depo-sition) leading to some toxic effect. Verification For any model, verification is the process by which bits of computer code are checked to make sure that the code is doing what the programmer intended it to do. For example, are the correct con-stants and variables being used in an equation? Is the correct equation being used to compute a par - ticular quantity? Are the correct units being used? Are unit conversions being done correctly? These are the types of questions that are asked in verifica-tion. Since JEM is also a DoD acquisition program, as well as a computer model, verification also asks if JEM meets its requirements. In response to this question, the JEM Test and Evaluation team per - formed development testing on the program to en-sure that the stated requirements were met. This served as a system-level verification of the model. Data Certification All models have input data; most models have embedded data. JEM input data falls into two cat- egories: incident specific and material specific. In-cident-specific data describes the what, where, and when of an incident. This data does not have to be certified. The material-specific data, however, does have to be certified. The material-specific data in JEM refers to the physical properties of the hazard-ous materials JEM can model. Examples of these properties include vapor pressure, density, molar Figure 3. General VV&A Process116 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S)mass, boiling point, etc. Material toxicity and how it varies with concentration and exposure time are also examples of material-specific properties that must be certified. The certification process usually involves identifying an authoritative source (e.g., a textbook or technical report) for a particular prop-erty to see if the correct value is being used. Ex-amples of embedded data include the gravitational constant (G) or the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (). Any and all uses of constants like these must be checked to determine if they are correct and consistent. Output and Method Validation Ideally, output validation\u2014where model pre- dictions and real-world data can be directly com- pared to each other\u2014is the preferred method of validation. However, when real-world data does not exist, method validation is used. This approach requires that subject matter experts go through the code to make sure that the correct equations and methods are being used. If possible, interme-diate quantities calculated by the program before displaying the final results are compared to exist-ing data. This is known as method validation. For example, one JEM output is the probability of ca-sualties from a bomb filled with nerve gas. Obvi-ously, field experiments designed to capture this kind of data are unthinkable; therefore, interme-diate data (like the amount of nerve agent depos-ited on the ground per square meter or a 10-min dosage measurement) is compared to the predict-ed values. JEM VV&A Challenges The VV&A effort for JEM was quite challeng- ing for a number of reasons and revolved around the validation. Not only does JEM predict very complicated real-world behavior (the transport and dispersion of hazardous materials), it must do so in a complex operational environment when used by nonscientists in time to provide useful in-formation to decision makers. JEM is a large pro-gram (over 1 million lines of code, including comments), with a great deal of both input and embedded data. Probably the most difficult chal-lenge faced during VV&A for JEM was the fact that for some outputs, like the probability of casualties following an attack, there was no data that can be used for output validation. Validation \"by Parts\" The nature, the JEM velop a VV&A strategy called validation \"by parts. \" Figure 4 shows the natural \"parts\" of JEM. Figure 4. JEM Parts117 Validation, Verification, and Accreditation Challenges for the Joint Effects Model (JEM) Atmospheric transport and dispersion is the key process that enables everything else and the process (in terms of what is modeled) that will have the most influence on the outputs. Thus, a sepa-rate output validation effort was conducted on the JEM atmospheric transport and dispersion engine using high-quality field trials specifically designed to test these kinds of models. The separate valida-tion of the atmospheric transport and dispersion engine allowed the examination of each ISM. Since data for all of the available outputs for the ISMs was not available, the method validation approach was used. This method compared available data to in-termediate outputs (like dosage or deposition) and relied on independent subject matter experts to en-sure that the correct science was used and to cap-ture any limitations present. Dosage and deposition data for some chemical weapons\u2014dating from the 1950s and 1960s\u2014was available, likewise for his-torical nuclear weapon tests. However, this data was not intended to be used for model validation and reiterated the need for subject matter experts. This approach was also used to validate the science behind the calculation of toxic effects. Most existing data is based on historical animal testing, which also required review by subject matter experts. Conclusion While the VV&A of JEM was extremely chal- lenging, the model was successfully accredit-ed, with limitations, for use by all of the DoD by the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO CBD) on 15 Au-gust 2007. Since then, the JEM Program Office has been providing U.S. warfighters with the JEM that they can use with confidence to predict the hazards and toxic effects that can result from enemy use of CBRN weapons, as well as from releases involving TICs or TIMs. Reference 1.

It occurred within the confines of a Navy computer laboratory at the Naval Surface War - fare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), located in Dahlgren, Virginia. NSWCDD's Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Division employs state-of-the-art computer modeling and simulation (M&S) to perform hypothetical scenarios using mathematical and scientific principles to predict what would happen in the real world. In addition to providing added safety to the warfighter and the general population, M&S saves time and money. NSWCDD scientists and engineers perform M&S in support of the Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC) Program.119 Independent Verification and Validation of MESO for the Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC) Program The Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC) Program The purpose of the TACTIC Program, man- aged by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),a is to provide the U.S. military with the capability to protect the warfighter from chemical and biological warfare agent threat clouds on the battlefield. The goal of the program is to provide a system that can rapidly detect and iden-tify the presence of a typical threat cloud and pro-vide a countermeasure to that cloud that will kill it before it reaches the intended target. 1 According- ly, TACTIC aims to develop models that accurately simulate the transport, dispersion, and interaction of threat agents and counteragent aerosols or va-por clouds on the battlefield and in urban areas. CBR Defense Division researchers, in support of the TACTIC Program, use models to predict the effectiveness of such countermeasures. They cur - rently are working to determine whether or not the Mesoscale Model (MESO) is better than tradition-al hazard prediction models. The MESO The MESO\u2014developed by ITT Industries lo- cated in Colorado Springs, Colorado\u2014is current-ly being validated by the CBR Defense Division. MESO can theoretically produce results that mod-el behavior that is closer to the real world since it takes into account the \"randomness\" of plume movement through an environment. It also has the potential to provide higher fidelity results without the need for intense resources, such as computa-tional fluid dynamics, required by other models. Other models, such as the Vapor, Liquid, and Sol-id Tracking (VLSTRACK) Computer Model, em-ploy a Gaussian-based calculation, whereas MESO employs random walk tracer particles. b In Gauss- ian-based code, the main vehicle for calculations is the center point for concentrations and its distribu-tion. With random-walk tracer-particle code, the concentration is represented more discretely with the use of individual particles. To further illustrate this difference, assume, for instance, a group of people watching a foot-ball game. We can take one person's observations 119Independent Verification and Validation of MESO for the Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC) Program120 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) into consideration and assume that they represent the observations of the group. On the other hand, we can take into consideration each individual's observations. Obviously, the more people we take into account, the higher the details of the football game observations. Going back to the models, VLSTRACK will produce a result that best describes the plume and is probably good enough for most cases. Howev-er, MESO will theoretically produce higher fideli-ty results and can take into account more factors, such as differences in terrain (hilly versus flat), 3-D wind fields, and variations in ground cover (i.e., vegetation). Figure 1 shows example output from a Gauss- ian-based puff, as produced by the VLSTRACK Computer Model. The color inside the cloud repre-sents higher concentration. The smaller cloud rep-resents the plume after 30 seconds, and the cloud on the right shows how the plume has grown in size after 5 minutes. Figure 2 is an example of MESO output show- ing how it interacts with terrain. Also, notice how each red dot represents the particle tracers and their location within a three-dimensional domain. In determining whether the MESO is better than traditional hazard prediction models, the first step is to study the procedure used to validate pre-vious models, such as VLSTRACK. Studying this procedure provides the ability to look at lessons learned and leverage existing methodologies, as well as looking back at the benchmark to see how well the new model must perform. Field trial data is then gathered and analyzed, followed by a transla-tion of this data into the model's inputs. After the in-puts are generated, the model is run, and the output is compared to the field trial reports. The last step is to take these comparisons and calculate a series of statistics, which will determine how well the model predicted a simulated incident. Subsequently, if re-searchers determine that MESO provides better pre-diction technology than existing models, then that determination serves as the basis for implementing MESO into programs such as TACTIC. The goal for TACTIC is to be able to accurately model the move-ment and interaction of clouds; the validation effort determines if MESO is the right tool for that job. Verification and Validation There are risks associated with using M&S to simulate events such as the opening scenario above. How do we know that the model will ac-curately predict the size, shape, and orientation of the mustard cloud? Does the model take into ac-count real-world factors such as weather, terrain, vegetation, etc.? To ensure that the model is behav-ing appropriately and is accurate, therefore, it has to be verified and validated using field trial data. In general, field trial data is obtained by releasing an agent or simulant in an open, unpopulated test range. Sensors are placed throughout the range and data, such as concentration amounts, are collected. This collected data indicates locations where the agent was found and in what quantities. This effort Figure 1. Gaussian Puff Example 121 Independent Verification and Validation of MESO for the Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC) Programrequires analyzing the trial data, creating and run- ning scenarios within the software that emulate the parameters in the trial, and performing a statistical analysis of the results. Using the parameters collected at the test site (e.g., wind speed and direction, temperature, time of day, agent quantities, relative humidity), a run can be performed using a mathematical comput-er model. The output from this model is compared to the data collected from the field trial. After ob-taining a series of statistics from this comparison, engineers can decide how accurate the model is in predicting the hazard. Notwithstanding, there are concerns in us- ing this method of validation. Probably the biggest concern is comparing model outputs with data that is over 50 years old. The reason data is so old is be-cause testing using live agents is prohibited. More-over, the means for collecting and processing the data were limited and crude by today's standards. One way of addressing these concerns is to use a variety of test data, including more recent field tri-als. Additionally, the statistics derived from analy-ses are averaged over the entire field trial set, which diminishes the effect of \"bad data. \" Conclusion In the future, TACTIC will be able to provide the warfighter with the capability to evaluate the ef-fectiveness of various chemical and biological \"de-feat\" mechanisms\u2014countermeasures intended to neutralize, kill, or decontaminate a chemical or biological threat. The use of M&S within the con-fines of a computer laboratory saves time and mon-ey, and potentially can save lives. State-of-the-art models, such as MESO, are being studied by the CBR Division to determine model effectiveness when predicting chemical or biological attacks. As a result, answering the question of what would hap-pen if a 155mm shell containing mustard gas ac-tually went off near populated areas may just be a matter of a few clicks of the mouse. Ultimately, warfighters will benefit by being better prepared in the face of chemical and biological threats. Endnotes a.

The MESO: Random-Walk Tracer Particles 122 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S)What if a Terrorist Attack Releases a Toxic Industrial Chemical? By Timothy J. Bauer On 6 January 2005, a train wreck in Graniteville, South Carolina, led to the rup- ture of a 90-ton chlorine railcar, resulting in the release of 54 tons of chlorine.1 Over 5,000 people in the lightly populated area were evacuated, over 500 people sought medical treatment, and 9 people died. This accident led to concern among city plan-ners, emergency responders, the transportation industry, the chemical industry, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Defense (DoD) about potential terrorist attacks on chemical railcars and tanker trucks transiting an urban area, or chemical storage tanks near an urban area. A comparison of modern hazard-assessment model predictions at the time consistently suggested that lethal concentrations from large releases of chlorine would persist within the plume of tox-ic vapor beyond 6 miles downwind. 2 As the spread of the expected plume moved rap- idly through an urban area, results indicated that hundreds of thousands of persons would need to be evacuated. Such a large evacuation effort would be impractical for emergency responders. Further, records of toxic effects from accidents like that in Graniteville suggest that the downwind hazard area is much shorter than the hazard assessment models predict. The nine deaths in Graniteville all occurred within half a mile of the accident. Like-wise, deaths during the World War I Battle of Ypres, France, on 22 April 1915 resulted from several thousand chlorine cylinders along a 4-mile-long trench and were limit-ed to within less than a half mile of the release trench. 3 Even the over 2,000 deaths in Bhopal, India, that resulted from the 3 December 1984 release of 40 tons of methyl iso-cyanate occurred within less than 2 miles; the large number of deaths were associat-ed with the high population density rather than the downwind distance of that highly toxic chemical. 4 To address the large discrepancy between recorded toxic effects and model predic- tions, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) assembled a group of subject matter experts from the chemical industry, transportation industry, national labora-tories, academia, emergency response organizations, DHS, DoD, and the intelligence community. A meeting was held on 8-9 November 2006 in McLean, Virginia, and was co-chaired by a representative from the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Divi-sion (NSWCDD). 5 Discussion focused on the release of chlorine from a 90-ton railcar 123 What if a Terrorist Attack Releases a Toxic Industrial Chemical?and the identification of knowledge gaps associat- ed with such a release. The most important knowl-edge gaps fell into three categories: 1. C haracterization of the vapor source result- ing from the liquid jet 2. H uman toxic effects 3. R eaction and removal of the chlorine vapor with surfaces and air as it travels downwind Each is discussed below. Vapor Source Characterization Survivors of the Graniteville accident report- ed that chlorine vapor remained in the release area for at least 2 hours. The chlorine vapor plume also followed the path of the valley within which Graniteville is located, which was somewhat dif-ferent from the wind direction at the time of the accident. The chlorine was thus heavily influenced by the terrain features, along with the buildings and vegetation in the release area. Conversely, hazard prediction models all assumed that the liq-uid jet would mix with passing air and be carried downwind as a long vapor plume. These modeling approaches agreed with data from field trials in-volving large releases of toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), such as ammonia; but those releases oc-curred over flat desert terrain under a fairly high wind speed. Field trials also were limited by avail-able test sites and the requirement that the wind direction remain steady and predictable for safe-ty reasons. 6 One theory addressing these additional fea- tures, developed by NSWCDD in 2008, was that large TIC masses of vapor and aerosol released over a short time period would pool into a large cloud at the release site and give off vapor into the passing air over an extended time period. 7 This pooling was likely enhanced by the presence of buildings, veg-etation, and terrain depressions in the release area. The significance of having a long-duration source of vapor instead of a short-duration plume was that the concentration of the chemical was lower and less toxic, especially when coupled with the human toxic effects described in the next section. TIC va-por plume formation versus pooling at the release site is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. TIC Vapor Plume Formation Versus Pooling at the Release Site124 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Human Toxic Effects The model predictions used to estimate the downwind hazard areas were based on chemical concentrations. The concentrations of interest were the Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs) de-veloped for the Environmental Protection Agency. 8 For a given chemical, there are AEGLs for life-threatening, serious, and irritating effects. Human toxic responses are a function of exposure (which combines concentration and duration) rather than just concentration, so there are AEGLs for a range of exposure durations ranging from 10 minutes to 8 hours. The problem with the AEGLs identified by the subject matter experts was that they are set for the most sensitive subpopulation rather than the average person. Thus, the AEGLs cannot be used to estimate expected casualties from a TIC attack or accident. An important aspect of human toxic respons- es is that, for one-time acute exposures, the human body can slowly expel or otherwise counter a tox-ic chemical. A high concentration received over a short duration, therefore, is more toxic than an equivalent exposure involving a low concentra-tion over a longer time period. This \"toxic load\" approach reveals why lowering the vapor concen-tration at the release location, as discussed above, can dramatically reduce the size and length of the downwind hazard area. Even if the TIC does trav-el downwind as a high-concentration plume, use of higher toxicity values appropriate for the aver - age person and the toxic load approach with exist-ing hazard prediction models will greatly improve model output. The importance of proper source character - ization and toxicity estimation can be demon-strated using a scenario involving the release of 2,500 pounds of hydrogen cyanide in downtown Baltimore, Maryland. 9 In this scenario, the num- ber of persons requiring medical attention ranged from 1,288 within the model contour to 22,182 if a simple circle is drawn. The length of the contour is approximately 1 mile. If the toxic load approach is then used with toxicity values for the total popula-tion distribution (as opposed to the most sensitive subpopulation), the length of the contour decreas-es to less than a quarter mile, decreasing the num-ber of persons requiring medical treatment to 32. Figure 2 shows the hazard area with an appropri-ate source characterization but using the current Figure 2. Baltimore Incident Concentration Hazard Area Estimates 125 What if a Terrorist Attack Releases a Toxic Industrial Chemical?AEGL approach. Figure 3 shows a contour with the toxic load approach with toxicity values for the total population distribution. Reaction and Removal Mechanisms The chlorine vapor at Graniteville penetrated the ground at the release site and had to be neutral-ized with large amounts of lime. As the chlorine va-por traveled downwind, it corroded exposed metal surfaces, such as doorknobs and electrical trans-formers. The vapor reaction with surface materi-als formed a different compound, pulling mass out of the vapor plume and lowering its concentration. TICs can also potentially react with water vapor or air pollutants to form less toxic compounds. Some vapor absorbed into porous materials. One issue with absorption is that once the plume has moved on, the TIC may then desorb from within the sur - face. This would result in a lower concentration but not a lower total vapor mass. Although some TIC reaction data exists, the data were generated for pollution monitoring purposes using very low TIC concentrations rather than the high concen-trations relevant to attacks and accidents. Data are still needed on how far and how fast the relevant reactions will occur to estimate how much mass is removed from the plume as it travels downwind. Current Research Efforts There are now quite a few groups that have be- come interested in TIC incidents, and NSWCDD provides subject matter expertise, as well as model-ing and analysis support to almost all of them. The TSA group of experts assembled for the November 2006 meeting mentioned earlier has held together and expanded, and holds regular teleconferences. Helping to plan chlorine and ammonia field trials has been key to maintaining the group. The follow-ing agencies and task forces are among the groups NSWCDD supports: United States The Toxic Industrial Chemical/Toxic Indus- trial Material (TIC/TIM) Task Force was es-tablished by the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense in 2007 to develop a prioritized list of TICs and then to determine the potential hazard of TICs if used in a terrorist attack against forward-deployed troops. 10 Figure 3. Baltimore Incident Final Casualty Estimate 126 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) assembled a group of subject matter experts in 2007 to determine the shortcom-ings of the TIC source module in their Haz-ard Prediction and Assessment Capability Model, and to recommend improvements. 11 The U.S. Army National Ground Intelligence Center conducted the Wild Stallion field tri-als at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) re-leasing chlorine from 1-ton tanks in October 2007; these tests were conducted in response to the terrorist attacks in Iraq employing similar 1-ton chlorine tanks. 12 Like the DoD TIC/TIM Task Force, the DHS Chemical Security Analysis Center (CSAC) developed a prioritized list of TICs of concern for terrorist use against homeland security. The Advanced Tank Car Collaborative Re-search Program involves government and industry working together to design rail tank cars that either resist puncturing or result in a greatly reduced hazard area if the TIC con-tents are released. The U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical and Bi-ological Center (ECBC) evaluated toxicity data for both the TIC/TIM Task Force prior - ity TIC list and the CSAC priority TIC list to provide toxicity values to use with the toxic load approach for both DoD and DHS haz-ard area analyses. International The Joint Industry Project is a European col-laborative effort, which began in 2001 to measure the characteristics of jets of chem-icals stored as pressurized liquid, such as chlorine. 13 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) System Analysis and Studies 061 Panel (SAS-061) was assembled in 2006 to analyze the hazards of potential terrorist ac-tions against allied troops. The scenarios eval-uated included a terrorist attack on a chlorine tanker truck outside of a NATO camp. 14 The NATO Challenge Sub-Group is now eval-uating the concentration challenge to NATO protective equipment resulting from the ter - rorist attacks defined for the TIC/TIM Task Force scenarios. The European Defense Agency is setting up a testing and model development program to address release of TICs in an urban envi-ronment. Considerable coordination and collaboration across all domestic and international groups has been established. NSWCDD is a member of most groups. Jack Rabbit Test Program The most significant effort to date to generate data necessary to improve downwind hazard area estimation was the set of field trials conducted at DPG during the period 27 April through 21 May 2010. Funding was provided by TSA and managed by ECBC; the project was operated by CSAC, and the trials were conducted by DPG. 15 The test design (Figure 4) was created by NSWCDD and the Nor - wegian Defense Research Institute (FFI). NSWCDD and FFI took advantage of an ex- isting collaborative effort to work on Project Jack Rabbit. The field trials were intended to prove or disprove the NSWCDD theory regarding pooling of chlorine (or other TICs transported as pres-surized liquids) vapor and aerosol at the release location, so the design included a circular pit de-signed to shelter chlorine and ammonia against the wind flowing over it. The test geometry was refined by FFI using computational fluid dynam-ics modeling. 16 The instrumentation was speci- fied and positioned by the TSA group of subject Figure 4. Jack Rabbit Test Design127 What if a Terrorist Attack Releases a Toxic Industrial Chemical?matter experts. Four trials each were conducted with chlorine and ammonia involving the rapid release of 2 tons of liquid directed downward into the pit. NSWCDD and FFI provided on-site mod-eling and analysis support during the trials. The trials did result in chlorine and ammonia pool-ing in the pit and releasing vapor into the pass-ing air, supporting NSWCDD's theory that large TIC masses of vapor and aerosol released over a short time period would pool into a large cloud at the release site and give off vapor into the passing air over an extended time period, suggesting that the chemical concentration would likely be lower and less toxic. As a result of this important finding, in con- junction with the extensive measurements taken during the Jack Rabbit field trials, hazard assess-ment models will be better equipped to predict or respond if a terrorist attack releases TICs, and warfighters will be much better protected from these types of attacks.

Wolski and Stephen S. Voynar Imagine if a building could defend its occupants from chemical and biological (CB) threats, using a very limited number of sensors, while not triggering false alarms every time someone arrives on the premises with an aromatic lunch or a new perfume. Giv-en the wide array of CB threats to American facilities throughout the world, sensitivity settings aside, key protection questions remain. How can military commanders plan to protect facilities from CB threats? And, how can teams of first responders respond safe-ly should an incident occur? As a hypothetical example, consider a military barracks located on a base 5 km from a nearby chemical plant processing methyl isocyanate (MIC). The proximity of this type of plant to a military installation is of great concern\u2014especially since MIC is the same chemical released from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984 that killed thou-sands of people. Figure 1 shows a chemical plant (located in West Virginia) similar to the plant in Bhopal, India. 1 Building Protection Challenges In addressing these key building protection challenges, a single, hypothetical build- ing scenario will be used in this article and presented from the perspective of the mil-itary commander. Knowing the dangers posed by MIC, the commander of the facility needs to ensure that his people are well protected. Many challenges confront the commander and other warfighters when trying to protect personnel from the unseen threats posed by CB agents. The first challenge is discovering that a chemical or biological event occurred and determining where it oc-curred. Most important is to ensure survival of the building's inhabitants. Another key challenge is having confidence in the organization's ability to perform its mission. In ad-dressing these challenges, fortunately, commanders have several powerful, effective tool-kits and modeling programs at their disposal to assess threats and courses of action to protect against or minimize the effects of a chemical or biological event. Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Tools Over the years, M&S tools have been used to assess the indoor air quality (IAQ) of buildings. IAQ includes the amount of contaminant entering and leaving a building over time. To assess IAQ, single-zone models (also known as box models) have been used, as 129 Defending Against the Unseen \u2014 Chemical and Biological Building Protection Challengeswell as multizone and full computational fluid dy- namics (CFD) codes. Each of these capabilities has benefits and drawbacks. An example of an IAQ tool is the CONTAM model developed by the National Institute of Stan-dards and Technology (NIST). CONTAM is a multizone model that can be described as a simpli-fied macro model of a building. CONTAM deter - mines airflow and contaminant movement within a building. A building can be modeled as one or more zones (boxes) of uniform temperature, pres-sure, and concentration. Each zone can represent a single room, hallway, or portion of a larger room. CONTAM calculates air pressure and airflows within each zone of a building, and then it calcu-lates the movement of contaminants between each zone. After a user configures a moderately complex building, a CONTAM simulation can be executed within a matter of minutes. When performing an analysis of a building, there are five main steps: 1. V iew the building as a system of multiple unique zones 2. Cr eate a \"model\" representation of the building 3. D etermine the important building compo- nents and create data for each component4. E xecute one or more simulations 5. A nalyze the results This analysis process seems simple and straight- forward, but each step can contain numerous chal-lenges that need to be addressed and solved. In an attempt to simplify this process, the Immune Build-ing Toolkit (IBTK) was created. IBTK is a compo-nent of the Immune Building Program, which was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Proj-ects Agency (DARPA). IBTK was integrated with CONTAM to leverage its ability to calculate move-ment of CB agents within a building. Contamina-tion from outside of the building and weather data can be supplied from other models, such as the: Advection and Dispersion of Vapor, Evapo-rating Droplets, and Solids model (ADVEDS) (a government-owned CFD model) Vapor, Liquid, and Solid Tracking (VLSTRACK) model (a government-owned Gaussian puff model) MESO-RUSTIC model (a government-sponsored building-aware Lagrangian parti-cle model) These models calculate outside contamination entering a building through leakage paths. Analy-sis tools included in the models provide detailed reports about the level of building exposure, costs Figure 1.

Output can be displayed in tabular format, in graphical charts, or 3-D displays. Challenges: Data-Driven Analysis Users might have several purposes in mind for modeling the interior of a building. They might want to assess the effectiveness of various build-ing protection strategies. They might want to esti-mate the overall building protection level and cost associated with protection strategies, or they might want to search for an optimal protective solution. Regardless of the purpose, before users can per - form any kind of analysis, data is required. Developing an internal model of any structure can be challenging, as much needed information might not be available or complete. In most cases, a building's layout is available only in two-dimen-sional computer-aided design (CAD) files or on pa-per. Consequently, without visiting the structure, analysts might not know if the building was built as originally designed, if the doors and windows leak, if air is really being supplied to each room, or if any modifications to the building have been done. IBTK attempts to address the two-dimensional challenge by implementing a capability to read the Indus-try Foundation Classes (IFC) format, which is be-coming an international standard. IFC is a standard for representing 3-D, real-world objects\u2014such as buildings\u2014and sharing that information among different software tools. Unfortunately, this stan-dard is still evolving, and not everyone in the Unit-ed States is using this file format yet. This challenge is more significant in multizone and CFD models than it is to the much simpler single-zone box mod-el. Thus, sometimes the box model is much more attractive, since all that is necessary is the bulk air exchange rate (how fast the building changes its air). Data for the hypothetical example in this ar - ticle is shown in Table 1 and is annotated on Fig-ure 2. It suggests that 10,000+ gallons of MIC from a chemical plant could pose a significant threat from a distance of 1-10 km. For comparison, data is also provided for the agents phosgene, ricin, sa-rin, and anthrax. Additional challenges are introduced with cre- ation of a \"smart building\" capable of defending itself against detected threats without assistance from humans. To protect occupants, sensors and alarms need to be smart enough to use active and passive protection systems capable of adapting to a variety of situations and threats. They also need to alert security and safety teams in a timely manner. Many of the available sensors are not able to be net-worked and used in a smart-building setup. Those that are capable would need to identify threat con-taminants efficiently and quickly without trig-gering false alarms. Most smart-building sensors are too expensive to place within every room of a building. IBTK and other tools, such as the Proba-bilistic Algorithm for Sampler Siting (PASS), offer realistic, cost-effective methods for placing sen-sors. Capabilities such as these are designed to de-fine the optimum sensor locations with a limited number of sensors to defend against a defined set of threats. In turn, this decreases response time. Another challenge involves filtering the air that feeds the building, a form of passive protection. Toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) can be damag-ing to chemical filtration. The challenge here is the amount of data available on the efficiency of mate-rial removal from the air and what happens to the material over time. IBTK developers incorporated a useful library for typical types of doors, windows, and leakage paths along openings and through wall Table 1. Example Threat Scenario Data131 Defending Against the Unseen \u2014 Chemical and Biological Building Protection Challengesmaterials; heating, ventilating, and air-condition- ing (HV AC) ducts; filtration devices; and sensors to help minimize the data challenges. Of course, when making an analysis, there are always new variables to consider. Challenges: Threat Analysis In our hypothetical building example, we know what the threat material is (MIC), approxi-mately how far away it could be, and approximate-ly how much material might be released during an event. It is actually rare for that much information to be known in advance. The remaining challenge for the analyst supporting the commander in oth-er scenarios is to determine the most likely threats to the building. This could be gleaned from intel-ligence sources or from other threat assessments. Probably the biggest challenge in understanding and conveying the threat is that\u2014unlike what we might see in a Hollywood blockbuster or an inci-dent like Bhopal\u2014material likely will be released in an unseen, unspectacular way.Analyzing model results can be somewhat complicated. One metric used by the Immune Building Program is the fraction of building ex-posed (FBE). This metric is an estimate of the amount of the building exposed beyond a speci-fied level; unfortunately, this metric can skew the perception of the severity of the situation. Another metric is the fraction of occupants exposed (FOE). This allows for a more targeted look at the build-ing, where only inhabitants are counted and not the entire building; this, too, can be misleading, as the analyst can miss areas that may need decon-tamination or may cut off a route of evacuation. Another view is to examine zone by zone, looking at the movement of material through the building. This can be done using a number of tools: NIST developed the CONTAM Results Viewer, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) developed the ContamViewer, which IBTK integrated into its 3-D view (only one lev-el at a time). There are many other ways to analyze the data beyond contamination movement. These Figure 2. Threat Scenario Locations for Hypothetical Facility 2 132 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) may include, but are not limited to, air flow, pres- sure differences, and temperature. Computer tool screen captures depicting the analysis process are shown in Figure 3. Protecting Personnel: The Ultimate Benefit As noted earlier, the hypothetical building in this example is located 5 km from a chemical plant processing MIC. An IFC file is available of the building, and basic building information has been entered into the CONTAM model. After ver - ifying the validity of the model, a baseline analysis is performed, and it is determined that over 75 per - cent of the inhabitants of the building are at risk if a release occurs. Filters are then added to the main HV AC supply system. Active sensors (that can de-tect MIC) are also added into both the exterior and interior of the building. These sensors can trigger automatic shutdown of the HV AC supply and ex-haust systems. Following the baseline, a follow-on analysis is performed, and it is determined that less than 5 percent of the inhabitants are now at risk. This analysis is presented to the base command-er to determine if he or she is willing to accept that level of risk. Changes to the building are then made. Subsequently, at some time in the future, if an accidental release of MIC occurs at the chemical plant, model results can determine if the resulting cloud is sufficiently toxic to cause injury or death to individuals outside. With protections in place, all inhabitants of the protected building would be safe. 132CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Figure 3. Computer Screen Captures Depicting an Example Analysis ProcessIBTK IFC FBEContamination by Zone (ContamViewer)CAD133 Defending Against the Unseen \u2014 Chemical and Biological Building Protection Challenges This hypothetical situation demonstrates that tools like CONTAM and IBTK provide war - fig hters with a level of confidence that person- nel in their facilities will be reasonably safe from a chemical or biological incident. Extending this capability to Navy ships is the next step. It can be (and has been) done. These tools enable analysts to examine threat scenarios from many points of view. Modeling analysis costs much less than full-scale testing and poses no health risks to anyone. Additionally, new kinds of metrics are being used to measure the effectiveness of a building's protec-tion architecture in relation to its costs and main-tenance. As a result, people within buildings will be safer against a variety of threats. First respond-ers, too, will have access to improved training tools, enabling them to develop improved proce-dures for safely handling threats. Interior modeling for CB defense continues today through efforts with the Joint Science and Technology Office at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Department of Homeland Securi-ty. As a result of these efforts, warfighters and first responders will be much safer from CB threats. References 1. U .S.

Szymczak and Harold K. Barnette Joint expeditionary forces employ two-man tents for a number of missions in areas where the adversary's use of chemical and biological agents is possible. Two-man tents for expeditionary-type missions\u2014unlike some larger, more stationary structures\u2014can-not make use of forced-air filtration systems. Consequently, to protect these forces, sci-entists and engineers from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), in partnership with the Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Division of the Naval Sur - face Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) in Dahlgren, Virginia, explored the question: Can a small tent structure be designed to provide protection against bio-logical or chemical vapor agent attacks? The Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) System Performance Model (SPM) is being developed in parallel with the JECP collection-of-shelters effort. SPM supports testing and evaluation through the use of computer modeling and simulation. The SPM brings together various computer models to simulate the threat, dispersion, airflow, filters, and components of the system. It supports modeling in a wide variety of environments and terrain, far beyond what is possible with live testing. Computa-tional fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to provide solutions to various SPM technical challenges. This article describes a methodology for treating fully coupled internal/external flow through a passively filtered structure (two-man tent). Most state-of-the-art approaches to internal/external flows involve the use of separate codes for each domain, which are weakly coupled through boundary conditions. However, these approaches cannot be used directly for passive filtration, as the internal pressure is not known, and the pres-sure drop across the filters is required to determine the internal flow. A fully coupled so-lution directly resolves these issues and provides for a more accurate model for assessing the performance of passive filter systems. System Performance Model (SPM) Approach Filtration on a tent would have to allow for a sufficient exchange of uncontaminat- ed air for respired carbon dioxide. For this effort, an analysis of a passive filter structure 135 Modeling and Simulation Supports Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) Programwas performed. The unique aspect of this analysis was that the flow surrounding, through, and inside the tent was determined simultaneously in a fully coupled computation. The methodology and anal-ysis presented here could be applied to a wide vari-ety of relevant design structures. In general, the motion of fluids is described by the Navier-Stokes equations derived in the 19th century. These equations are classified as nonlin-ear partial differential equations and are used for a wide range of flow applications, including weath-er prediction, ocean currents, the motion of stars in a galaxy, and the turbulent flow of air surround-ing shelters. However, their full analysis is very dif-ficult. The proof of the existence of solutions in three dimensions (3-D) has not been mathemati-cally determined to this day. Thus, because of the difficult nature of the equations and the complexi-ty of turbulent flows, solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are approximated using computational algorithms within CFD codes. One example of a CFD code is the Atmospher - ic Dispersion of Vapor and Evaporating Drops and Solids (ADVEDS) code developed at NRL and NSWCDD over the past 20 years. Although this code was originally used for external flows for ship defense from CBR attacks, it has been generalized for internal and fully coupled internal-external flow simulations through JECP structures. This code is ac-tually a pair of codes, namely ADVED_NS for deter - mining the Navier Stokes flow field and ADVED_T to transport particles, evaporating drops, and vapor using the predetermined flow field. A photograph of a tent and a depiction of the ADVEDS CFD grid model for the two-man tent structure is shown in Figure 1. Three Triosyn filter panels (shown in ma-genta) are embedded in the tent walls. The Triosyn panels are permeable, allowing fresh air to enter the structure and carbon dioxide to be purged, while fil-tering out contaminating agents. By determining the flow features (pressure and velocity) surround-ing and through these filters, the performance of this passively filtered system can be assessed with respect to how long a soldier could survive a biological or chemical attack if protected by such a structure. The primary technical challenges arising from flow simulations of shelters with passive filters in-clude the resolution of thin walls and filter mem-branes, and the relatively low permeability of the filter components. The walls of the material fab-ric are approximately 3 mm, while the filters are slightly thicker (5 mm). The ADVEDS code em-ploys a structured grid that must be fitted to the structure boundaries. This is done by mapping re-gions of an initially uniform grid onto the surface of the structure identified as a collection of trian-gles in a stereolithography file (STL) format. For internal/external flow, both the inside and outside of a thin structure must be described and mapped using different grid surfaces. By expressing the tent structure using separate STL files for its in-terior, exterior, and each side of the fly, a grid fit-ted to each surface of the shelter is constructed and smoothed with a structured grid generation code. Permeability is measured by maintaining a constant pressure drop across the filter membrane and measuring the resulting flow velocity. The re-lationship between a constant pressure drop and flow velocity measured in one-dimensional exper - iments on a Triosyn swath is shown in Figure 2. The lines through the data points represent least squares fits a using linear (Darcy) and quadratic (Darcy-Forchheimer) approximations. Both mod-els were implemented as drag force terms added to Figure 1. Photograph and ADVEDS Model of the Two-Man Tent Structure136 CBRD Modeling and (M&S)the Navier Stokes equations and discretized within the ADVED_NS code. For this study, only the sim-pler Darcy model was used. Three distinct technical challenges needed to be addressed before obtaining a CFD solution to this model: 1. I n order to resolve the thin-layer material of the structure, either a very large number of small grid cells or cells with high aspect ratios with one dimension representing the thickness of the fabric is required. 2. A n abrupt change in flow velocity can be ex- pected for the flow through the filter materi-al. For this example, the flow speed through the filter was over 300 times smaller than the external flow upstream. This large flow re-duction needed to be accu-rately modeled to obtain the correct internal pressures and purge rate for the system. 3. Th e model of the filter drag represented by the data shown in Figure 2 represented a very high drag coefficient, resulting in a classical numerical analy-sis difficulty, known as a \"stiff \" system of equations. With such a system, although the variable (in our case velocity) decreased to zero very quickly, the time steps required to maintain sta-bility for an explicit scheme were exceedingly small. For the first challenge, researchers simply allowed the use of distorted cells so that the tent structure could be adequately described us-ing a moderate number of grid cells. The ADVED_NS code uses algorithms that re-main stable under minimal grid restrictions. The second two challenges were each related to the filter model. These challenging problems were alleviated through the use of a carefully designed implicit method, which pro-vided stable and accurate re-sults. Flow simulations were conducted in a domain ap-proximating a wind-tunnel configuration, as displayed in Figure 3. The computations were performed with an inflow velocity of approximately 11.2 m/s (25 mph) representing a \"high\" wind-speed case. Figure 4 shows particle paths for the com- puted velocity field. These velocities were deter - mined from fluctuating velocities, which were time-averaged over a 6-s interval. In this figure, the speeds are indicated by the color palette on the right, with red being fastest (12 m/s) down to the slowest speeds in magenta and black. As can be seen in Figure 4, the wind is fastest upstream, over the top, and around the sides of the tent fly. The nearly black vortices (swirling or recirculat-ing flows) inside the tent indicate much slower Figure 2. Measured Velocity as a Function of Pressure Drop Across a Triosyn Filter Figure 3. Grid and Domain for the Two-Man Tent in a Wind Tunnel 137 Modeling and Simulation Supports Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) Programspeeds induced by flow through the filters. Path lines traveling near the ground of the inflow side can be traced under the fly and through the top of the upstream filter. A pair of large vortices are seen in the region immediately behind the tent. The effects of these flow patterns on the inter - nal/external coupling is seen in Figure 5, which shows the pressures on the filter surfaces, as well as the velocities through the filters. On the side crosswind filter (5a), a very low-pressure region is formed on the lower upwind corner due to a small recirculation region. This low pressure induc-es the largest flow rates leaving the tent. On the downwind side (5a), flow exits the filter along the top and sides where the pressures are low but en-ters the filter at the center and bottom where the pressures are slightly above the internal pressure (shown as a small green patch in the top portion of Figure 5). That is due to backflow from the re-circulation region. On the upwind panel (5b), the high pressures on the bottom of the filter are due to flow striking the face just under the fly. These pressures are roughly 80 pascal (pa) above ambi-ent, corresponding to the stagnation pressure of the inflow velocity. The velocities shown in Figure 5 can be used to determine the flow rates entering, Q in, and ex- iting, Qout, each filter region of the shelter. It is expected that these two values should be nearly equal; otherwise, the tent would tend to \"blow up\" if more air enters the tent than exits, or \"deflate\" if more air exits the tent than enters. This simple ob-servation can be used as a verification check for the computations. Table 1 lists these flow rates and the totals for the entire structure for both the high wind speed (11.2 m/s) described previously, as well as for computations with a more moderate wind speed (5.6 m/s). In each case, the differenc-es between Q in and Qout were less than 1.3 percent. The four-factor reduction in flow rates from the high to the moderate case is consistent with the expected stagnation flow pressures, which depend on the square of the inflow velocity. If a vapor (e.g., CO 2) inside the shelter remains well-mixed, (that is, maintains a nearly uniform concentration) then its mass will be purged with a fixed exponential decay rate depending on the ra-tio of the flow rate, Q in, to the volume of the tent interior. A more accurate determination of purge rates can be obtained using a transport code, which moves the vapor with the flow according to the laws of mass conservation. Figure 6 compares the remaining mass fractions of CO 2 in the high wind case using the well-mixed assumption to results computed using the transport code, ADVED_T. While the ADVED_T code was initialized with Figure 4. Top- and Side-View Particle Paths Around and Inside Tent 138 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S)Figure 5. Computed Pressures and Velocity Vectors on Filter Panels(a) Downwind and Crosswind Filter Panels (b) Upwind and Crosswind Filter Panels Table 1. Values of Flow Rates (m3/s) Through the Triosyn Filters139 Modeling and Simulation Supports Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) Programa uniform density of CO2 in the interior, changes in density were allowed to evolve according to the transport equations. The ADVED_T purge rate is slightly higher than that using the well-mixed as-sumption because it predicted lower CO 2 densities near the regions where fresh air enters, (Qin > Qout), and consequently, higher CO2 densities near re- gions where flow is exiting the tent. With a known purge rate, the accumulation of CO2 from internal sources (i.e., two people breathing) can be approximated directly using the well-mixed assumption. In this case, the steady-state volume of CO 2 within the tent is simply the ratio of the respiration rate to the purge rate. The steady-state value is simply the theoretical level value that will be attained after a sufficiently long time. For example, assuming a respiration rate for two average people, the steady-state concentra-tions of CO 2 are 934 parts per million (ppm) for the high wind case and 3472 ppm for the moder - ate wind case. Each of these cases fall below the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limit of 5000 ppm for CO 2. During a bi- ological or chemical vapor attack, the tent will be closed, and the only fresh air entering the struc-ture will flow through the filter areas (assuming no other leakage). This analysis shows that, at least in the moderate and high wind cases, there will be a sufficient supply of filtered fresh air en-tering the tent to maintain safe CO 2 levels inside the shelter. Conclusion As mentioned earlier, most state-of-the-art ap- proaches to internal/external flows involve the use of separate codes for each domain, which are weak-ly coupled through boundary conditions. A ful-ly coupled solution directly resolves this issue and provides for a more accurate model for assessing the performance of passive filter systems. In pro-viding this SPM solution, joint expeditionary forc-es in the future will likely be better protected while employing two-man tents in the event of chemical or biological attacks.

Mass Fraction Computed Using Both a Well-Mixed Assumption and the Transport Code ADVED_T140 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) The Benefits of Metamodels in CBR Defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S )Products By Harold K. Barnette Scenario (Fictitious) Pentagon planners quickly gathered in the war room to discuss the operational plan about to be executed in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. U.S. Army and Marine Corps forces and their associated equipment had been staged and readied for a planned attack slated to begin in just 12 hours. Key to the operation was the joint forces positioned on the left flank. If those forces were unable to execute, for whatever reason, the entire operation could fail. Given the importance of the left flank forces to the overall operation, one contingen- cy that war planners discussed was the possibility that the enemy could employ chem-ical, biological, or radiological weapons in an attempt to thwart the advance by U.S. forces. What they needed to know, quickly, was whether U.S. forces could survive the ef-fects of a chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) attack. Consequently, Pentagon planners urgently tasked CBR defense (CBRD) experts lo- cated at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) in Dahlgren, Virginia, to see if they could rapidly model and simulate the situation to answer the planners' critical question. Fortunately, because scientists and engineers at NSWCDD employed metamodels in their CBRD modeling and simulation (M&S) products, they could comply with the Pentagon's urgent need. Metamodel Overview The use of M&S products in CBRD applications harnesses the power of the comput- ing age to provide warfighters with the best possible resources. The benefit of any M&S product, however, is proportional to the quality of the answers it provides (fidelity) and the speed at which it provides those answers. Unfortunately, these two desired M&S traits of speed and fidelity are often diametrically opposed. Typically, an increase in fi-delity requires an increase in the amount and complexity of computations that a model performs, which, in turn, results in a slower simulation. It is this dilemma between M&S fidelity and speed that presents an opportunity for the use of metamodels. The relation-ship between fidelity and speed is shown in Figure 1.141 The Benefits of Metamodels in CBR Defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S )Products The prefix \"meta\" is used to indicate a concept that is an abstraction of another concept. In light of this, the term \"metamodel\" can be thought of as \"a model of a model\" since it provides a model of a data set derived through some systematic process. Metamodels characterize data sets by reducing them into mathematical expressions. The data sets themselves can come from different sources, such as laboratory experiments, live testing, or comput-er simulations. The primary benefit of metamodeling is in its ability to closely approximate all possible outcomes based on a limited data set of known outcomes. That is why Pentagon planners, in the fictitious opening scenario, turned to NSWCDD for quick answers concerning a set of unknowns. This benefit pro-vides a time and cost savings to the systematic pro-cess by which data is collected. Once a metamodel has been developed, it allows the user to almost in-stantaneously obtain an answer on the performance of the systematic process it represents. With respect to CBRD M&S products, meta - m odels have the potential to characterize the results of long-running simulations \u2014 s uch as those that oc- cur with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) \u2014 b y using the data set that results from a planned, strate-gic set of runs. The end result of this is a metamodel that provides good approximations to CFD simula-tions that have not yet been run. Incorporation of the metamodel into a CBRD M&S product allows the product to provide CFD fidelity without the long run times. To help illustrate the benefits of metamod- eling, consider a scenario where it is desirable to predict the time at which a peak concentration oc-curs for a relative location from a specific threat in a specific environment. Peak time predictions can be accomplished via a metamodel developed from a limited set of simulation data. An exam-ple of results for a simple metamodel that predicts peak concentration time is shown in Figure 2. In this figure, peak concentration time values, pre-dicted by the metamodel, are represented on the vertical axis and are correlated with the simulat-ed data set represented on the horizontal axis. An ideal metamodel would share a one-to-one cor - relation with the simulated data set because there would be no difference between predicted values and the data. The correlation shown in Figure 2 shows something close to a one-to-one correlation and indicates a good metamodel. The simulated data set in Figure 2 was de- rived from 19 runs that required over 300 hours of simulation time using Atmospheric Disper - sion of Vapor and Evaporating Droplets and Sol-ids (ADVEDS). a The metamodel was derived from the simulated data set and is a polynomial consist-ing of 75 terms. In this example, 99.5 percent of the peak time metamodel predictions are within 0.8 s or less of the simulated data set. Thus, addi-tional peak-time concentrations for this particular instance can now be predicted by the metamod-el almost instantaneously and reliably without the additional hours of simulation time. Metamodel Development Process The process of developing a metamodel con- sists of three primary phases: 1. D esign of Experiments (DOE) 2. D ata Collection 3. D ata Fitting Design of Experiments (DOE) Conducting a DOE essentially establishes a strategic plan for data collection that identifies fac-tor space and minimizes the number of runs. The first step in developing this strategic plan is to iden-tify factors (i.e., wind speed, temperature, etc.) that are believed to have influence on the response of the systematic process that is being modeled. The expected range limitations associated with each factor (e.g., temperature = 5\u00b0-32\u00b0C) establish the factor space boundaries. Once a factor space has been defined, the next step is to maximize cover - age throughout the factor space using a fixed num-ber of sample points. Different techniques exist for optimizing factor space coverage for a given num-ber of sample points. One technique that is often used is referred to as a \"Latin Hypercube\"\u2014a sta-tistical method developed to generate a distribu-tion of plausible collections of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. Statistical software products, such as JMP , facilitate the use of Figure 1. Relationship Between Fidelity and Speed142 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) these space-filling techniques. The DOE process is shown in Figure 3. In addition to identifying a set of sample points (from which the metamodel will be developed), a set of checkpoints should also be generated for the purpose of providing an independent assessment of metamodel error. One question that commonly arises when con- ducting a DOE is, \"How many sample points are enough?\" This is an important question since iden-tifying too few sample points could adversely affect metamodel error and identifying too many sample points might be too time-consuming and costly. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to this. One rule of thumb states 10 samples per factor. A more practical approach is to answer the question, \"How many sample points can be taken given a specified time and budget?\" Data Collection This phase consists of collecting data from the systematic process that will be represented by a metamodel. The DOE provides the road map for collecting data during this phase. Data Fitting This is the process of fitting collected sample point data to an equation where terms comprise the factors contained within the DOE. This pro-cess should begin as soon as data becomes avail-able to begin exploring ideas on how to fit the data. Some of these ideas may consist of data transfor - mations that reduce metamodel error by reshap-ing the data to a form that is easier to work with. With each metamodel iteration, error is first as-sessed by comparing the metamodel prediction to the sample point results. Upon achieving an accept-able error level with respect to the sample points, the metamodel results are compared to the check-points. Checkpoints provide an independent as-sessment of metamodel error since they were not used to develop the metamodel equation. If the er - ror level of the metamodel is acceptable with re-spect to the checkpoints, then the checkpoints may Figure 2. Peak Concentration Time Metamodel Correlation to Original Data Set 143 The Benefits of Metamodels in CBR Defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S )Productsthen be utilized, along with the sample points to develop a metamodel with even less error. Figure 4 shows aspects of the data-fitting process. Potential Metamodel Applications to the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection System Performance Model (JECP SPM) Metamodels are being explored for use within the JECP SPM (see Figure 5). JECP refers to a fam- ily of shelter systems that are intended to protect Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) and their assets by means of a versatile and transportable collective protection capability. The JECP SPM is a software tool sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Joint Science and Tech-nology Office (JSTO), and its development is currently being led by NSWCDD's Chemical, Biological, and Chemical (CBR) Defense Division in cooperation with other partners: United States Naval Research Laboratory University of North Carolina Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ITT Industries The JECP SPM models the collective protection performance of each member in the family of JECP shelters and will be used to supplement live testing. It is important that the JECP SPM provide reliable results in a timely manner, and metamodels pro-vide a possible means of achieving this goal. Some areas within the JECP SPM\u2014where meta m odels are being investigated\u2014are listed be- low, followed by a depiction of a contaminant pass-ing over a JECP shelter.

An increase in simulation speed and fidelity would result in fewer man-hours, lower costs, and an increase in analysis quantity and quality. These benefits would arm warfighters with more reliable CBRD products. Endnote a.

D\u00e4v\u00e9 The Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) Program is developing a fam- ily of transportable shelter systems that will provide collective protection to joint expe- ditionary forces and their assets. These shelter systems range from two-person, passive filtration tents to large multiperson shelter complexes that provide active filtration and internal environmental conditioning. North Carolina State University's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering personnel are collaborating with the Naval Sur - face Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) Chemical, Biological, and Radio-logical (CBR) Defense System Performance Model (SPM) team to research personnel entry into collectively protected shelters. Entry of personnel into collectively protected shelters constitutes a critical point in which system protections are necessarily breached. A typical entry event starts with the removal of possibly contaminated clothing, followed by entry into an air lock that sep-arates the area external to the shelter from the toxic-free area (TFA) inside the shelter. The air lock operates using principles of overpressure: air from the TFA or from a sep-arate heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HV AC) unit flows into the air lock, in-creasing the inside pressure to levels higher than the external air pressure. The air flow is vented out of the air lock, moving either outside or back into the HV AC unit, where it is filtered. The overpressure helps keep contaminated air from flowing into the air lock, while the vented flow drives contaminated air out of the air lock. As a person enters the air lock, two things happen. First, the overpressure is relieved as the doors are opened, causing a strong gas jet to flow outward. Second, wakes generated by the motion of the doors and the person cause a net flow of contaminated gas into the air lock. Once the doors close, the overpressure begins to build up, and the contaminated gas is purged from the air lock. The time required for a person to remain within the air lock depends on the size of the air lock, the volume flow rate of clean air into the air lock, and the desired amount of concentration reduction required. Typically, an air lock will be required to reduce the initial vapor concentration by a factor of 1000 or more, but the precise amount of reduction needed depends also upon the agent under consideration and on the allow-able dosage limit\u2014as described in the Military Exposure Guidelines (MEG)\u2014that per - sonnel can withstand. For example, 8 hours of exposure to concentration levels above 0.0038 mg/m 3 for the nerve agent VX is considered life-threatening. Air locks may be 147 Modeling of Personnel Entry Into Collectively Protected Sheltersdesigned for single-person entry (SPE) or for mul- tiple-person entry (MPE). MPE air locks are larg-er in volume and require a longer purge time for a specified level of concentration reduction. Typ-ically, a group of people enter the MPE simulta-neously, while only one person at a time enters an SPE. The design of an air lock is driven by the re-quirement to handle a specified number of person-nel entries per hour. This, along with the air-lock volume and target concentration reduction, deter - mines the required volume flow rate of clean air into the air lock. The initial agent concentration within the air lock is a function of the external agent concentra-tion: a time-dependent quantity that depends on the agent release point and on meteorological con-ditions. The transport of the agent into the air lock during entry depends on the wind speed and direc-tion in the vicinity of the unit, as well as on specific details of the entry event, such as the: Walking speed of the person(s) entering Door-opening mechanism Level of air-lock overpressure Other factors\u2014such as whether personnel re- move protective clothing and how such clothing is handled\u2014can also affect agent transport by influ-encing the amount of time that the air-lock door remains open. Other mechanisms of infiltration include surface deposition or adsorption of agent material onto clothing and its eventual resuspen-sion or desorption into the TFA over periods of time longer than the air-lock purge time. The air lock is not designed to be effective in this situation; therefore, the modeling activity described next does not yet handle this mode of infiltration. To arrive at an estimation of potential hazards for shelter occupants for a given release scenar - io, it is necessary to predict the amount of agent mass transported into the air lock and into the TFA during the course of a personnel entry event. As the entirety of such an event may last tens of min-utes, and as each stage is separated by an air-lock purge of 3 to 5 minutes, it suffices to analyze the response of a single-entry event as a function of the parameters mentioned above. The key parame-ter is the volume of air transferred per unit time (a volume flow rate, usually expressed as cubic feet/second). The product of this quantity with the ex-ternal agent concentration (mass of agent per vol-ume of air), integrated over the duration of the entry event, provides the total mass of agent trans-ported into the air lock. The external agent con-centration may be predicted by the Vapor, Liquid, and Solid Tracking (VLSTRACK), the Joint Effects Model (JEM), or similar strategies.

Agent mass can be trans-ported into the air lock over the period of time in-dicated within the blue square. A prediction of the amount of an agent trans- ported into an air lock and the TFA during entry is a required feature of the JECP SPM being de-veloped by NSWCDD's CBR Defense Division. As experimental data for personnel entry is general-ly unavailable, researchers at North Carolina State University are conducting detailed computation-al fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of air-lock entry to support the development of an air-lock- specific SPM to be integrated into the overall SPM. An outcome of the air-lock SPM is a model for computational fluid (CF) transported versus time, which can be used as described above to predict the amount of agent transported into the air lock. The computational strategy is a large-eddy simu-lation, which attempts to capture the larger turbu-lent eddies generated by the external wind field and by personnel motion. The movement of people and doors is modeled using 3ds Max rendering soft-ware, which enables the construction of sequences of computer-aided design (CAD) objects repre-senting different stages in a person's motion. These sequences are embedded into the computational domain using an immersed-boundary technique. This technique transfers the motion of the objects to the surrounding velocity field, which then drives transport of the agent material. Figure 2 shows a set of snapshots of an entry into an MPE equipped with a bump-through door. In all figures, surfac-es representing vortex cores are colored by agent Figure 2. Snapshots of Vortex Cores (Colored by Agent Concentration) During a Simulated Entry Into an Air Lock 149 Modeling of Personnel Entry Into Collectively Protected Sheltersconcentration, with red being high and blue being low. The top-right figure shows conditions just as the person enters. The release of overpressure forc-es a jet of air-lock gas outward and over the person. This response would naturally inhibit agent trans-port into the air lock, but the subsequent vacuum condition formed as the jet is released and the door closes counteracts this effect. The bottom snap-shots show the decay of the initial jet and the rees-tablishment of the prevailing wind effect. Simulations of this type have been performed for a sequence of trials generated by a Latin hyper - cube design-of-experiments (DOE) procedure de-veloped at NSWCDD. a The trials vary the: Prevailing wind speed (0 to 5 m/s) Wind direction (0 to 180 degrees) Proximity of a person from the air lock (0 to 3 m) Walking speed (1 to 1.5 m/s) The overpressure of the air lock is held fixed at 0.3 inches of water. Twenty-six individual simula-tions have been performed, with the initial stag-es of each simulation devoted to computing the air flow over the shelter (~45-60 s), and the last stages devoted to the entry event itself (~10 s). Figure 3a shows a plot of CF transported into the air lock ver - sus time for the first 16 of these simulations. The general trend is toward an increase in CF transport-ed for high wind speeds moving into the air-lock door. The fall in CF after its peak value is due to the closing of the air-lock door. A meta-modeling approach is employed to reduce the distributions shown in Figure 3a into a simpler form that cor - relates the response with the driving parameters of wind speed, wind direction, proximity, and walk-ing speed. Figure 3b presents the data normalized by the maximum CF and by a time scale associated with the duration of the entry event. Also shown is a modified Gaussian fit to the normalized data. The modeling challenge is the regression of the parame-ters of the Gaussian fit (maximum CF, standard de-viation) as functions of the driving parameters. A nonlinear regression analysis using SAS's JMP soft-ware has been used to determine the final form for the entry model. Figure 4 shows model predictions (solid lines) versus computational data (symbols) for several trials not included in the initial set. These provide checkpoints for assessing the quality of the meta-model. Figure 3. CF Transported Into Air Lock Versus Time 150 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S) This proof-of-concept exercise illustrates the potential of high-resolution CFD combined with metamodeling in developing a contaminant-trans-port model for air-lock personnel entry. The CF versus time distributions outputted are suitable for incorporation into zonal models such as CONTAM (multizone airflow and contaminant transport anal-ysis software) from the National Institute of Stan-dards and Technology (NIST) and, with refinement, may also be used to provide boundary conditions for coarse-grained CFD calculations of the flow within the air lock and TFA. 1 The techniques used in this exercise are now being applied to the actu-al JECP SPE and MPE air-lock configurations. The end product will ultimately help protect the war - fig hter from chemical and biological (CB) agents by improving the testing and evaluation process that is in place to help ensure that the best possible shelters are being produced.

D\u00e4v\u00e9 and Michael O. Kelly Overview In developing a family of transportable shelter systems, the Joint Expeditionary Col- lective Protection (JECP) Program will provide collective protection to joint expedi- tionary forces and their assets. These shelter systems range from two-person passive filtration tents to large multiperson shelters that can be complexed together to provide active filtration and internal environmental conditioning. The objective of the JECP Sys-tem Performance Model (SPM) is to model the collective protection performance of each JECP shelter and predict the level of exposure to chemical and biological (CB) agents experienced by personnel inside the toxic-free area (TFA). Exposure within the TFA can occur as a result of agent infiltration through barrier materials, air locks, clo-sures, seams, filters, and from personnel entering or exiting the TFA. The SPM will pro-vide a cost-effective method for predicting system collective protection performance while interacting within a complex environment, allowing users to create realistic op-erational scenarios. Also, the SPM will improve the test and evaluation (T&E) planning process by simulating results for testing environments that are otherwise too dangerous, complex, or expensive to physically test. This article presents an overview of the challenges being addressed in JECP SPM software development, along with the technical solutions being applied to meet SPM requirements. The approach involves rigorous physics-based representations of most components or building blocks within the JECP system, along with empirical or semi-empirical representations for others. The fidelity of the representations will be com-mensurate with the level of detail that needs to be modeled for purposes of augmenting selected portions of the normal operational T&E (OT&E) process. The results of com-ponent and system analyses using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, along with the component and system testing conducted by the JECP program, will allow for the development of: Transfer functions for use in faster-running models Metadata models (empirical and/or physical) to allow more rapid system analysis during the JECP OT&E effort153 The Next Generation of System Performance Model (SPM) for CBR DefenseProblem Statement Given recent historic events and trends, the probability of a CB attack seems likely to increase. Consequently, protective measures must be taken to preserve the lives of warfighters in the field. In response to this threat, the JECP family of trans-portable shelter systems is being developed to pro-vide protection against various types of CB attacks. However, it is critical to accurately assess the effec-tiveness of the protection provided in order to en-sure that warfighters are safe from CB attacks. The cost of physically testing the CB protection of the proposed shelters is very high. Thus, there is a strong desire to perform as much testing and evaluation as possible using modeling and simula-tion. This desire is in line with current acquisition strategies that specify modeling and simulation as a significant cost-saving tool. The JECP SPM supplements the T&E strate- gy by providing a software construct (model test bed) that will enable testers to simulate operation-al environments for JECP applications across a range of battlefield conditions. The SPM will in-tegrate several different data, component, and sys-tem modules (e.g., airflow mapping, breakthrough rate, and air filtration performance) with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and simulat-ed threats. Simulant data generated during T&E will provide a critical link between chamber per - formance data and field performance. The JECP SPM will relate test data to CB toxicological end-points and provide output data to support opera-tional system assessments. The goal of the SPM effort is to design and im- plement a collection of modeling and simulation tools that can be used to accurately test and eval-uate the various JECP shelters under a large num-ber of conditions. The SPM software will allow one or more analysts to rapidly create and execute sce-narios while specifying the conditions of a CB at-tack. Once a scenario has been executed, the SPM software will allow the user to view and analyze the resulting data in order to assess the level of perfor - mance for each shelter. Challenges The primary challenge facing SPM software development is ensuring the accuracy of the flu-id flow and dispersion models. The chemical and physical properties required to accurately model the effects of a CB attack are far from trivial. Every-thing from weather conditions to the presence of trees and rough terrain must be considered to ac-curately predict the pressures and concentrations of harmful agents in and around the JECP shelters.To meet the challenge of designing accurate models, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahl-gren Division (NSWCDD) enlisted the help of sev-eral experts in the field of CFD and dispersion. These scientists and engineers have the difficult task of researching and developing models that can accurately simulate the flow and dispersion of harmful agents from an external source into the JECP shelters. A depiction of modeled airflow over a shelter is shown in Figure 1. To gain an appreciation for the complexity of this task, consider the number of instances for which various models must be developed: Modeling the initial release from a missile, rocket, sprayer, or other munition Modeling the flow, evaporation, and disper - sion of contaminants over a variable terrain (This includes accounting for trees, build-ings, rocks, and the deposition that may oc-cur onto these surfaces.) Modeling the concentrations, pressures, tem-peratures, and accumulation of contaminants at the JECP shelter of interest Modeling the flow of contaminants through airlock doors and through airlock barrier materials Modeling the flow of contaminants through shelter doors and through shelter barrier ma-terials Modeling the concentrations and flow pro-files that result from personnel entering/ex-iting a shelter Modeling the flow and concentrations of contaminants within a shelter As can be seen from the list above, there are several places in which physical and chemical models of varying types and complexities must be employed. Each model must provide a similar de-gree of accuracy to avoid passing high-precision, but low-accuracy results to downstream models. The SPM software provides the logic for connect-ing disparate models together and ensuring that they are invoked at the correct time with the ap-propriate set of inputs. This is no small task, since much of the modeling will likely require coordi-nation of model inputs and outputs at every step. Factor in the need to model the effects of person-nel entering and exiting a particular shelter, and the problem's complexity increases. The SPM must be capable of describing scenarios that have time- dependent properties. For example, a person's posi-tion changes during the scenario as a person moves toward and eventually into a particular shelter. Sce-nario dependencies may also affect the ingress of personnel into a shelter. For instance, if entrance 154 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S)into the TFA is allowed only if airlock concentra- tions are below some threshold value, this may re-duce the expected ingress rate of personnel (due to having to wait for concentrations to drop). Another major challenge facing the develop- ment of SPM is the need for speedy performance. When it comes to CFD, the simulation run times are often on the order of hours, days, and some-times even weeks. The lengthy run times typically associated with fluid flow modeling are not accept-able for the purposes of SPM; thus, performance-enhancing measures must be taken. Because of the large number of models (internal and external) that must be executed, and the required level of accu-racy, the challenge of improving run times is very significant. There are algorithmic improvements that can be made, but the complexity of solving multiple, partial differential equations in three di-mensions is difficult to reduce without sacrificing accuracy. Thus, the developers and engineers must try to find solutions that provide an acceptable de-gree of accuracy while drastically reducing compu-tational run times. Proposed Solution As mentioned above, a major challenge fac- ing the development of SPM is the lengthy run times typically associated with computation flu-id dynamics (CFD) scenarios. Scenario execution times need to be on the order of a few minutes ver - sus a few days in order to meet SPM usage require-ments. To satisfy this requirement, the SPM team is exploring the use of \"metamodels\" as a means of maximizing performance without sacrificing accu-racy. The term metamodel refers to a simple mod-el that can be used to approximate a more complex model over a specific set of conditions. This ap-proach is analogous to approximating a small section of a nonlinear function with a linear func-tion. The objective is to design metamodels that Figure 1. Airflow Over a Shelter 155 The Next Generation of System Performance Model (SPM) for CBR Defenseclosely match high-fidelity CFD results over the conditions required for SPM simulations. Once developed, these metamodels can be intelligently applied during SPM-scenario execution, such that execution time is minimized without losing a sig-nificant degree of accuracy. From a software perspective, there are sev- eral \"best practices\" that can improve usabili-ty, maintainability, and flexibility. On the other hand, there are common mistakes that can all but ensure project failure despite the complexity of the problem domain. For the SPM development effort, the need to integrate several models that have evolving inputs, outputs, and requirements, and the desire for a flexible software approach is high. The SPM must be flexible enough to accom-modate changing models and components as the details for each computational approach become known. There are several ways for achieving \"flex-ibility\" in software, but at an architectural level, the most common approach is to employ a \"mod-ular\" approach. This modular approach refers to constructing several disjointed software compo-nents that, when loosely coupled, make up a use-ful application. The modular approach is not new and is commonly referred to in most program-ming languages. The approach taken for SPM development le- verages the open source NetBeans application plat-form. This approach allows for highly modular application development while making extensive reuse of mature software components. In develop-ing any application that has a significant number of capabilities, there are typically a large number of \"boilerplate\" features that must be implemented in order to make the domain-specific capabilities accessible by the user. Many of these application components are taken for granted by most users (i.e., menus, drag and drop, cut/paste, undo/redo, open/save) but are very time-consuming to devel-op. The NetBeans platform provides a large por - tion of these common application capabilities as reusable components. This drastically reduces the development time required to implement a new application by allowing developers to focus pri-marily on the domain specific capabilities instead of the \"boilerplate\" code. The NetBeans platform is an open-source framework that has been steadily maturing over the course of almost a decade. NetBeans is most commonly known as the host environment for the highly popular NetBeans integrated development environment (IDE) which, in many ways, outper - forms commercial IDEs, such as Microsoft's Vi-sual Studio. The platform provides a large set of reusable software components that allow for rapid development of highly modular applications. The workflow for developing applications that leverage the NetBeans platform is built into its IDE, which makes constructing new applications and mod-ules very straightforward. Because of its flexibility and maturity, SPM developers chose to implement SPM capabilities on top of the NetBeans platform, which affords a great deal of flexibility that can easily accommodate changing requirements and data structures. The various models and capabilities that need to be managed by SPM can be nicely encapsulated inside NetBeans modules. Each module has well-defined interfaces that govern which portions of the module's code are exposed to other modules. In addition, modules must specifically state depen-dencies on other application modules in order to access exposed classes. This ensures that all appli-cation dependencies can be quickly determined, thus providing better software maintainability. General Interface The user interface for SPM allows the user to arrange views in several different ways. There is a project view that resembles a \"file explorer\"-type widget. Users can navigate this project view to open files related to a project. Once located, files can be opened for viewing and editing. Encapsu-lating project components into individual \"files\" allows for greater scalability since only the por - tions of a project that are being viewed are load-ed into memory. The JECP SPM Interface is shown in Figure 2. Scenario Builder SPM must be capable of modeling CB release scenarios under various conditions. The scenar - io builder allows users to drag and drop scenario components (e.g., shelters, air locks and person-nel) onto a scenario canvas. Once added to the canvas, the user can set specific properties related to a particular object. In addition, time-dependent behavior can be described using a timeline. Once scenario properties have been specified, the sce-nario can be executed using the appropriate sce-nario executor. Model Integration Each model utilized by SPM is encapsulated in a module that can easily be added or removed from the application. Abstract services are de-fined to represent the models, which can then be implemented inside a module. The advantage is that the SPM execution logic does not need to be 156 CBRD Modeling and Simulation (M&S)aware of the details of a particular module, except that it implements a particular interface. This al-lows models to be easily switched out as require-ments evolve. It also allows capabilities to be added or removed without inadvertently affecting other portions of the application. The ability to add and remove capabilities without unwanted side effects is a huge plus when developing complex applica-tions. In most circumstances, a full regression test is necessary to ensure that seemingly minor chang-es do not \"break\" the application. With the mod-ular approach utilized by the NetBeans platform, dependencies can be traced easily, thus drastical-ly reducing the time required for regression testing. Results Visualization During scenario execution, the models gener - ate a large amount of result data. This data takes the form of flow fields, pressure profiles, and concen-trations. Depending on the complexity and length of a scenario, the amount of result data can be sev-eral gigabytes. With such a large amount of data, sophisticated visualization tools are necessary to help analysts review and comprehend the results of a scenario. For this purpose, SPM utilizes the JECP SPM 3-D graphics package. This government off-the-shelf (GOTS) tool was developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and is ca-pable of providing highly detailed visualizations of fluid flows and concentration profiles. In addition, the JMAT Visualization Package software allows analysts to \"playback\" a scenario in order to view how contaminants move externally and internal-ly. This visualization, coupled with various reports and plots, allows the user to determine the overall performance of JECP shelters, air locks, and other components when faced with a variety of attacks, configurations, and environmental conditions. A depiction from the JMAT Visualization Package is shown in Figure 3. Conclusion The development of the JECP SPM is on course to meet the challenges of complexity, speed, and fi-delity. The end product will ultimately help protect warfighters from CB agents by improving the T&E process currently in place to help ensure that the best possible shelters are produced.Figure 2.

Hornbaker and Richard C. Hodge As a warfare center within the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Enterprise, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) works with other Navy laboratories to ensure that the technical challenges facing our warfighters are met with effective and affordable solutions. Scientists and engineers (S&Es) from NSWCDD design, develop, integrate, acquire, and test technologies and systems that our nation's warfighters rely on to meet current and future combat threats. NSWCDD's Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Division is responsible for providing dis-ciplined systems engineering expertise for CBR research, development, test, and eval-uation (RDT&E) modeling, integration, acquisition, and sustainment efforts to protect naval and joint forces afloat and ashore. NSWCDD has a long history of leadership in chemical, biological, and radiologi- cal defense (CBRD) projects. During the Vietnam War, NSWCDD was named the lead Navy laboratory for chemical and biological warfare (confined to defensive counter - measures by Presidential directive). After the Vietnam War, the number of active CBRD projects waned until the use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein against Iraqi Kurds in the early 1980s brought renewed Navy interest. 1 Today, U.S. adversaries are constantly evolving their CBR methodologies and capabilities, necessitating continuous Navy research fundamental to the development of technologies and systems to counter or mitigate current and future CBR threats. Although the structure of the CBR Defense Division at NSWCDD has changed sev- eral times throughout the years, maintaining a research component has always been a top priority for the organization's leadership. This commitment to basic and applied re-search programs is made with the understanding that the research ultimately enhances warfighter, fleet, and homeland defense CBRD capabilities. Today, NSWCDD has a ro-bust CBRD research program providing a broad spectrum of support and technical so-lutions to many sponsors. Laboratory Capabilities In order to perform basic and applied scientific CBRD research, an organization must have personnel who have expertise in a variety of scientific and engineering dis-ciplines. They need experience in CBR detection, decontamination, protection, or 159 Basic and Applied Science at NSWCDD Advances CBRD Capabilities Figure 1. An engineer inside the CBR Filtration Evaluation and Support Facility demonstrates a filter change-out procedure.other specialty areas, as well as access to specialized laboratories and equipment. NSWCDD employs a diverse technical workforce, many with advanced academic credentials and security clearances, which enable them to perform CBRD research for the Navy. Research in the division is performed us-ing in-house chemical, biological, and materials testing laboratories and equipment. The CBR Defense Division's chemistry labora- tories support RDT&E for characterization of new chemistries and materials for all product areas of CBRD. These laboratories are outfitted with a full suite of state-of-the-art analytical equipment com-monly found in modern research institutions. Ma-jor focus areas for the chemistry laboratories include development of novel materials and formulations for hazard mitigation, spill cleanup, and advance-ment of detection technologies. A toxic chemistry laboratory provides hazard assessment and testing for high-hazard toxins, toxic industrial chemicals (TICS), and toxic industrial materials (TIMS). The Electrochemical Laboratory is set up to pro-vide a test and evaluation (T&E) capability to determine accurate corrosion rates for multiple types of alloys, composites, and coatings. This technical capability provides input into paths forward in terms of fielding new CBRD prod-ucts or in ship/vehicle design. The Materials Science Laboratory provides an additional ca-pability used to judge the effects of the environ-ment or CBRD products on military materials by mimicking the operational environment. The Collective Protection System Laborato- ry, the Filtration Laboratory, and the CBR Filtra-tion Evaluation and Support Facility are being used to evaluate components of the Collective Protection System (CPS), including filters, mate-rials, and closures to identify limitations of cur - rently fielded systems. Efforts are underway to develop advanced filters using engineered mul-ticomponent systems that will improve TIC pro-tection. Work in the Filtration Laboratory helps transition and field filtration systems to the war - fig hter that have been thoroughly and consis- tently evaluated against a full range of CBR threats. An engineer inside the CBR Filtration Evaluation and Support Facility demonstrating a filter change-out procedure is shown in Figure 1. The CBR Defense Division hosts a number of biology laboratories operating at various biosafety levels. Biosafety level refers to the level of the biocontainment precautions, spec-ified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), required to isolate dan-gerous biological agents in a facility. Levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety lev-el 1 to the highest at biosafety level 4. NSWCDD operates laboratories ranging from biosafety lev-el 1 through biosafety level 3. These laborato-ries host programs that identify and develop new strategies for biological agent defense and validate the claims of commercial products for utility in neutralizing biological agents. The biology labo-ratories also support work that contributes direct-ly to the understanding of low-dose exposures of various populations to biological agents. The CBR Defense Division is responsible for various shipboard equipment and systems used for Navy radiological defense. The CPS, Countermea-sure Washdown (CMWD) System, and Shipboard Personnel Decon Stations are three examples of shipboard systems that rely on the expertise of the CBR Defense Division researchers to ensure that radiation does not contaminate the inside of a ship. The Division has the appropriate permits in place 160 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabilitiesfor working with select radiological material asso- ciated with these and other systems. The Radio-logical Laboratory is used to conduct testing and repairs on fielded systems, which contain radio-logical sources as part of the detection system. The Aerosol Laboratory provides S&Es with the ca-pability to sample and fully characterize fine sol-id particles or liquid droplets suspended in gases. Chemical or biological warfare agents can be de-liberately or naturally masked by smoke, haze, or other means, making them more difficult to detect. S&Es working in the Aerosol Laboratory perform essential testing of detectors to ensure that chem-ical and biological threats are detected and that false alarms are minimized. The CBR Defense Division also maintains an Imaging and Electron Microscopy Laboratory, where state-of-the-art optical and binocular micro-scopes equipped with both digital image and video capture systems are maintained. This laboratory also houses one of the world's most powerful scanning electron microscopes, providing researchers with the capability to evaluate material and generate im-ages at the nanoscale. All of these systems are shared assets available for use by S&Es across the Division.Potomac River Test Range (PRTR) NSWCDD operates the PRTR, which is the Navy's only fully instrumented over-the-water lit-toral test range. The maritime environment pro-vides unique challenges to CBRD due to factors such as corrosive effects of sea air, reflectivity of water, and temperature extremes impacting de-ployed equipment. To characterize and overcome these challenges, the CBR Defense Division utiliz-es the PRTR to test programs designed to rapidly and accurately detect and defend against chemical or biological agents. By testing equipment and sys-tems under similar conditions those systems will see in the field, researchers are helping to ensure that deployed equipment will function as intended. An infrared (IR) sensor at the CBRD Facility over - looking the PRTR is shown in Figure 2. It is fol-lowed by a photograph of a meteorologist releasing a weather balloon prior to a test event in Figure 3. Basic Research Basic or fundamental research refers to research conducted to increase understanding of fundamen-tal principles. Carried out at the bench level, this re-search consistently advances many areas of interest Figure 2. View from the CBRD Facility overlooking the Potomac River Test Range (PRTR)\u2014This IR sensor focuses on a very narrow frequency band to detect agents and simulants by their absorption of IR energy at \"fingerprint\" wavelengths. 161 Basic and Applied Science at NSWCDD Advances CBRD Capabilitiesto the CBRD community. For example, through a unique collaboration between the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), traditional experimen-tal techniques are being coupled with novel model-ing techniques to gain a new understanding of the effects of low-dose exposure to biowarfare agents. Results are provided to warfighters, to the scientific community, and to Department of Defense (DoD) policy and decision makers to help them formulate strategies for risk assessment and for the mitigation of microbial pathogens. Spore characterization re-search is clarifying the extent to which environmen-tal factors influence spore yield and viability. This research is being used to highlight the importance of spore preparation methods on efficacy testing. Standardization of spore preparation methods im-pacts the quality of data generated at laboratories across the DoD and allows for more direct com-parison of results from different research groups. Surface chemistry research activities are leading to the development of advanced supergelators and superabsorbants, which enable small quantities of material to gel or capture large amounts of spilled chemicals for cleanup. Novel compounds prepared in NSWCDD's laboratories have achieved gelation or absorption of common chemicals at very low-weight ratios, in the range of one pound per one hundred pounds (or 1 percent by weight), which is like capturing 1 gallon of milk with 1 ounce of gellant. A researcher in the CBR Defense Division's Toxic Chemistry Laboratory is shown in Figure 4. Applied Science Applied science refers to research accessing, using, or leveraging the scientific communities' accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques for a specific purpose. NSWCDD's ap-plied technology efforts are helping to safely and effectively remove and neutralize contaminants from personnel, equipment, vehicles, and the en-vironment. NSWCDD's efforts also provide critical standards and methods to the testing community. Applied research at NSWCDD led to the devel- opment of a fieldable decontamination formulation product and a number of patents and publications. Figure 3. A meteorologist releases a weather balloon prior to a test event\u2014Weather data fed into high-resolution models is used for event prediction and for postevent analysis. 162 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing CapabilitiesUsing a Navy-centric approach focused on field- ing a solid or concentrated formulation, a decon-tamination formulation was developed that is both environmentally and logistically friendly. Materi-al and chemical compatibility tests were performed on these formulations prior to procurement to en-sure that they did not degrade the capability of the protective suits or equipment they were designed to decontaminate. Testing and the evaluation of haz-ards associated with decontamination formulations sometimes reveal incompatibilities between fielded materials and products being considered for field-ing. NSWCDD scientists routinely perform this type of testing and provide data to program manag-ers in support of milestone decisions in the acquisi-tion process. Further characterization of identified incompatibilities allows the development of guide-lines for proper storage, handling, and training in order to better ensure the safety of our warfighters. Basic and Applied Science Value-Added New threats and changing technology often create situations where new methods are need- ed or old methods become obsolete. Recently, standard methods for both biological and biotox-in decontamination testing and analysis methods were developed to ensure that the best available technology is used. These methods now repre-sent the standard for conducting efficacy testing for all DoD laboratories. Quality-control samples produced by NSWCDD are utilized by customer laboratories for proficiency tests and validation of biological detection equipment. These samples are critical to biological defense analysis efforts and ensure that both military and civilian orga-nizations monitoring the environment for release of biowarfare agents near population centers and key assets can do so with confidence. The CBR Defense Division's multidisciplinary CBR experts perform work for a broad range of projects and provide critical subject matter exper - tise in support of multiple sponsors, including pol-icy makers, program managers, partner Navy and DoD laboratories, and other government agen-cies. Subject matter expertise is critical for ensur - ing that effective CBRD systems are developed and that those systems are compatible with currently fielded technologies. Major sponsors for the orga-nization include the DTRA, the EPA, the Defense Figure 4.

The pursuit of basic and applied science en- ables researchers to discover and apply solutions important for all CBR Defense Division sponsors. Basic and applied science ultimately arms warf-ighters with technological advances that give U.S. forces the advantage where it matters most\u2014on the battlefield. Reference 1.

These agents may be pathogenic to humans, animals, or plants. Con- tainment is accomplished with a combination of safe methods, facilities, and equipment that reduce the possibility of exposure of laboratory workers, other people, and the en-vironment to potential biological hazards. Containment laboratories are described us-ing four biosafety levels (BSLs). BSLs range from BSL-1 laboratories, which have the most basic level of containment, to BSL-4 laboratories, which have the most robust containment. BSL-1 laboratories are acceptable for agents that are not usually associated with disease in healthy adults. BSL - 1 laboratories rely primarily on standard microbial practices for containment. BSL-4 laboratories are equipped to contain the world's most dangerous biological agents. Agents handled in a BSL-4 are exotic agents that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease for which no vaccine or therapy is available. Containment is accomplished with a complex system that provides complete isolation of the agents through facility design; glove box-es; full-body, positive-pressure and BSL-3 laboratories fall in between. BSL-2 laboratories are able to contain moderate-risk indigenous agents, while the BSL-3 is designed for work with in-digenous or exotic agents with the potential for serious or potentially lethal infection. Specific agents of concern are regulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention (CDC) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The agents regulated by these organizations are referred to as \"select agents. \" Select agents include Bacillus anthracis (causative agent of Anthrax), Yersinia pestis (causative agent of Plague), Ricin, and Ebola virus, to name a few. Laboratories that work with select agents may be BSL-2, -3, or -4 laboratories and must be registered with either the CDC or APHIS. Laboratories that meet the criteria to operate as BSL-3 or BSL-4 are commonly re- ferred to as high-containment laboratories. According to a 2009 Government Account-ability Office (GAO) report on high-containment laboratories, in 2008 there were 279 entities registered with the CDC and APHIS to handle select agent(s) in 1,643 BSL-3 laboratories, and 5 entities registered to operate BSL-4 laboratories. 1 Of the 279 entities with registered BSL-3 laboratories, one of those entities resides within the Naval Sur - face Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) in Dahlgren, Virginia, which has met the regulatory requirements to manipulate select agents within its BSL-3 laborato-ry. NSWCDD conducts basic and applied research focusing on Navy-specific concerns 165 High-Containment Biological Laboratoriesof detection and decontamination of biological agents. A researcher is shown in a BSL-3 labora-tory in Figure 1. Operating a BSL-3 with a select agent requires an immense commitment of time, expertise, and resources. The U.S. Navy imposes physical and per - sonnel security requirements above and beyond the CDC/APHIS regulations. Why does the Navy invest substantial resources in high-containment laboratories? The U.S. Navy's commitment to main-taining BSL-3 capability is a testament to the im-portance of these facilities and personnel necessary to keep warfighters safe. Maintaining BSL-3 capa-bility is central to meeting operational needs in a biologically threatened environment and being pre-pared for the unknown. Simulant organisms have been identified that closely mimic virulent organ-isms and are much less hazardous. However, these organisms are not identical to virulent agents. In or - der to detect biological agents and destroy them, we must understand them and challenge them to var - ious novel decontamination conditions. This can be accomplished only by working with virulent agent(s) in a secure, safe environment. NSWCDD utilizes its BSL-3 for basic research in spore characterization, decontamination challeng-es, and modeling disease progression. For example, the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis, forms a spore that can remain dormant for many years. If that spore is better understood (i.e., characterized), vulnera-bilities can be detected that could be exploited for more effective decontamination methods, and de - tection capabilities could be developed for specific spore qualities. Development of a decontamination method that is effective with a high degree of mate-rial compatibility is ideal. NSWCDD is able to test novel decontaminate methodologies on virulent agent(s) in its BSL-3. This is critical to fielding reli-able decontamination solutions. The value of maintaining BSL-3 capabilities can n ot be understated. Responsible research is nec- essary to protect warfighters and the nation from biological attack. As such, the Navy recognizes the importance of understanding select agents and the value of BSL capabilities in the quest to discover detection and decontamination solutions. By fol-lowing strict biosafety and security regulations, NSWCDD's basic and applied research is advanc-ing the Navy's understanding of biological threats and its ability to counter them. Reference 1.

BSL-3 Researcher at NSWCDD 166 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabilities Anthrax is a common name for one of the primary threats in biological warfare (BW). The disease has an important and well-known history compared to emerging dis- eases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or hantavirus pulmonary syn-drome (HPS). Anthrax is a natural disease of livestock, but it also affects humans. The historic knowledge of anthrax and its stability in the environment contributed to its de-velopment as a biological weapon. The aims of this article are to briefly describe the his-tory of anthrax, Bacillus anthracis (the bacterium that causes anthrax), microbial relatives of B. anthracis that are critical for testing, and biodefense product development. The Roman poet Virgil (70-19 BCE) wrote four works on agriculture, the third covering the topic of animal husbandry. In this volume, he gave a detailed account of a plague in the eastern Alps and described early attempts at decontamination: A terrible plague once sprang up there and raged on through the warmer part of autumn, not only destroying one flock of sheep after another, but killing ani-mals of all kinds. Nor did the victims die an easy and uncomplicated death. After a burning fever had raged through an animal's veins and shriveled its flesh, the fluids again became abundant and virtually dissolved the bones... . The steaming ox falls before the heavy plow. Blood mixed with froth issues from his mouth as he groans his last... . His sturdy flanks waste away, a heavy stupor dulls his eyes, and his head sags near the earth. Of what use to him now is all his toil in the service to man-kind? What profit has he gained by turning up the heavy soil with the plow?... .The pelts of diseased animals were useless, and neither water or fire could cleanse the taint from their flesh. The sheepmen could not shear the fleece, which was riddled with disease and corruption, nor did they dare even touch the rotting strands. If anyone wore garments made from tainted wool, his limbs were soon attacked by inflamed papules and foul exudates. 1 166CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabilities167 Basic Research in Biology Facilitates the Development of Biodefense Products In the 19th century, an anthrax epidemic de- stroyed approximately half of the sheep in Europe. From 1867 to 1870, more than 56,000 horses, cat-tle, and sheep, and 528 men perished in Russia. Inhalation anthrax became known in Victorian England as woolsorters' disease because of the fre-quency of infection in millworkers exposed to an-imal fibers contaminated with B. anthracis spores. Twenty-three cases of anthrax were recorded in the Bradford district of England, where the animal hair industry was concentrated, between Novem-ber 1879 and September 1880. 2-4 Historically, it was very difficult to deal with a disease such as anthrax because there was no ra-tional understanding of the cause of the disease. For example, a primary treatment for anthrax was to simply avoid areas where the disease occurred. This was problematic since anthrax was a world-wide disease, and it was very persistent in the environment; some areas were known to be heav-ily infected for centuries. Treatment of anthrax changed during the 1800s with the advancement of scientific knowledge. Studies by Eloy Barthe-lemy, Aloys Pollender, Casimir Davaine, Robert Koch, John H. Bell, and Louis Pasteur in France, Germany, and England between 1823 and 1881, culminated in the demonstration that B. anthra - cis was the causal agent of anthrax disease. This knowledge was critical because the focus shifted to treatments and decontamination of B. anthra - cis rather than treatment of disease symptoms or avoiding regions known to have problems with an-thrax. This knowledge also contributed to the de-velopment of anthrax vaccines and early industrial hygiene practices. 2-4 During the 20th century, incidence of anthrax decreased significantly due to vaccination and im-proved animal husbandry, as well as the process-ing of animal products. Anthrax continued to represent a worldwide presence outside the Unit-ed States, with an annual occurrence of 20,000-100,000 in the first half of the 20th century, and approximately 2,000 cases yearly during the sec-ond half. 2-4 Thus, knowledge of B. anthracis led to control of anthrax disease in developed countries. However, the stability of B. anthracis spores (spores are the dormant state of the bacterium, analogous to a plant seed) also made it a top candidate as a biological weapon for both state-sponsored pro-grams and terrorists. Today, safety, security, and costs constrain our ability to test virulent, disease-causing strains of 167Basic Research in Biology Facilitates the Development of Biodefense Products168 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabilities B. anthracis under many test conditions. Instead, biodefense testing frequently relies on relatives of B. anthracis . These relatives are often called simu- lants or surrogates. One traditional simulant has been Bacillus atrophaeus because it has not been confirmed to cause disease in livestock or humans. One important role of biodefense testing is to accumulate and compare data about different strains and species in order to develop tests that accurately and safely represent the threat from a B. anthracis (anthrax) spore attack. Collections of different Bacillus strains have greatly increased over recent decades at a number of different lab-oratories. Data comparisons, particularly genetic information, also greatly increased in the past de-cade. One goal of the Naval Surface Warfare Cen-ter, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is to study and characterize spore preparation methods and phys-ical characteristics of select strains of Bacillus spe- cies. 5 These data help design experiments that will best reflect different scenarios for anthrax attacks. They also help prepare for postattack management. Figure 1 shows electron microscope pictures of spores from four different species. The outside structure of the spore is called an exosporium. This structure exists on B. anthracis , Bacillus ce - reus, and Bacillus thuringiensis spores, but not on B. atrophaeus spores. The exosporium is a critical feature because it impacts spore hydrophobicity. The degree of hydrophobicity is related to spore stickiness, spore clumping, and spore suspension in different solutions. The traditional simulant has been B. atrophaeus spores, which do not contain the exosporium, do not clump, and are easy to sus-pend in water. B. atrophaeus spores are also pre-pared differently than B. anthracis . This suggests that B. atrophaeus may not be the best simulant for B. anthracis . Selection of simulants and spore preparation methods can impact test results. For example, there are thousands of known strains of Bacil - lus scattered throughout the world, and there are thousands of differences among strains. There are also many similarities among different strains. Detection methods must be developed based on similarities and differences in order to distinguish B. anthracis from other species. Otherwise, de- tectors may send out false alarms, i.e., false in-formation. This impacts resources in terms of responding to false alarms and the costs associat-ed with such responses. During the basic research process, multiple ob- jectives are addressed in order to develop improved biodefense test methods, improve test reproducibil-ity, decrease test time, and increase confidence in data and data analyses. Programmatic goals that are Figure 1. Transmission Electron Microscope Spores of Four Different Species\u2014Size bars are 0.5 m in size.169 Basic Research in Biology Facilitates the Development of Biodefense Products addressed include costs, performance, and schedule. Moreover, increased confidence in BW research data related to spore decontamination testing increases over time. Recent sporicidal (decontamination) test-ing at NSWCDD led to two decontamination tech-nology transitions from Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Science and Technology (S&T) to Joint Project Manager Decontamination (JPM- Decon): the transition of hot humid air for whole aircraft decontamination and electronically gener - ated chlorine dioxide for general decontamination of rugged materials. NSWCDD's basic research, therefore, ultimately leads to improved protection for warfighters.References 1. Dir ck, J.H., \"Virgil on Anthrax, \" 1981, pp. 191-195. 2.

Strauss, Wynn Vo, and Linda C. Beck The potential use of biotoxins as weapons against military and civilian targets con- stitutes an emerging threat to national security. Following the tragic terrorist attacks of September 2001 and the anthrax mailing attacks the following month, there has been heightened interest concerning the deliberate use of chemical and biological agents by terrorists. A recent report, World at Risk\u2014The Report of the Commission on the Preven-tion of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism, submitted by Senators Bob Graham and Jim Talent in December, 2008 to then-President, George W . Bush, indicated that nuclear and biological weapons \"... p ose the greatest peril. \"1 The severity of this threat was reiterated recently by Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy, who said, \"The risk of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists is the gravest threat facing the United States. \" 2 The extent of the concern about bioterror activity is highlight- ed in numerous papers, reports, and books published over the past decade. Examples are listed under the References subheading at the end of the article. 1-11 Background on Biotoxins and Their Potential Threat Biotoxins can be defined as biologically active compounds that are produced by liv- ing organisms. They can be grouped according to the organisms that produce them, in-cluding bacteria, fungi, plants, and dinoflagellates. Based on their chemical structure, it is also possible to divide biotoxins into protein and nonprotein categories. Toxins of bi-ological origin generally reflect the following attributes: Are natural, although some biotoxins can be synthesized Can be produced in large-scale or small quantities Are nonvolatile Are more toxic than chemical agents, such as sarin, soman, and VX Have legitimate medical uses Are odorless and tasteless Are capable of producing diverse toxic effects Are highly dependent on the route of exposure Are effective immunogens 171 Biotoxin Research at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) For state or non-state terrorists who lack the funding to acquire nuclear weapons, biotoxins, offer significant appeal for several reasons. First, biotoxins already have been produced for use as strategic and tactical weapons. Second, in gener - al, the source organisms for many biotoxins are readily available worldwide. Third, the extraction and purification process for many biotoxins pos-es relatively few technical challenges, especially as compared to constructing a nuclear device. Last-ly, biotoxins are endemic to much of the world and cause natural contaminations in food and water. Moreover, they may be easy to conceal. Ricin and botulinum toxin represent two pro- tein biotoxins that are of great interest as potential weapons of warfare and terrorism. Ricin is a protein produced by the castor oil plant, Ricinus commu - nis. The seeds of the plant contain the highest con- centration of the biotoxin and are used for castor oil production. As a result, ricin is one of the tox-ins that can be obtained very easily in large quanti-ties. Each year, more than one million tons of castor beans are processed to produce castor oil, and ricin can easily be separated from the castor bean waste mash, which contains 5-10 percent of the toxin by weight. Toxicity results from ricin's ability to shut down protein synthesis, which leads to cell death. Further, ricin is stable and is toxic by ingestion, injection, or by inhalation. When considering its use as a weapon of mass destruction (WMD), the quantity of ricin required for 50 percent lethality over a 100 - km2 area is estimated to be much greater than Bacillus anthracis. However, it could be used to contaminate food or water supplies, which could incapacitate many and overwhelm healthcare facil-ities. Seeds from Ricinus communis are shown in Figure 1. Also of grave concern is botulinum toxin, pro- duced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which has the distinction of being known as the most potent toxin. In contrast to ricin, which acts by inhibiting protein synthesis, botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin and acts by inhibiting the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from the nerves, resulting in paralysis. There are seven anti-genic types of botulinum toxin designated A to G, with types A, B, E, and F causing most human poi-soning. Botulinum toxin could be delivered by con-taminated food or water, but it is extremely toxic by inhalation, with estimates of 1-10 ng/kg of body mass as all that would be required for 50 percent le-thality in humans. Recently, terrorism experts have raised the possibility that terrorist organizations could obtain significant quantities of botulinum toxin from the emerging black market for counter - feit \"Botox\" from counterfeit laboratories and net-works in Russia, Eastern Europe, or China. \"Botox\" is the commercial name for botulinum toxin used in tiny amounts for legitimate medical purposes, including treating migraine headaches, facial tics and facial wrinkles. 11 The bacterium Clostridium botulinum is shown in Figure 2. Figure 1. Seeds From Ricinus communis 172 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing CapabilitiesBiotoxin Research and Experimentation Since the Herbert H. Bateman Chemical, Bio- logical, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Center at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Divi-sion (NSWCDD) in Dahlgren, Virginia, was ded-icated on 22 August 2002, one focus has been the analysis, detection, and decontamination of biotox-ins. This CBR Defense Center houses chemical and biological laboratories, with Biosafety Levels 2 and 3 (BSL-2 and BSL-3) containment facilities, quali-ty assurance and materials laboratories, collective protection and standoff detection laboratories, and high-performance computing capabilities. a Within this facility, the CBR Concepts and Experimentation Branch plans and executes research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) projects directed to-ward an improved understanding of the nature of biotoxins and how to better detect and neutral-ize them. To facilitate these studies, the Toxin Test-ing Laboratory is outfitted with dual chemical fume hoods equipped with charcoal and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and equipment for initiating projects with active biotoxins, all sci-entists and engineers undergo extensive safety and security training, and each project is rigorously re-viewed for safety and treaty compliance. A scientist working in a toxin laboratory with a powered, air-purifying respirator is shown in Figure 3.Utilizing this Navy CBR defense facility and specialized equipment, highly qualified scientists and engineers investigate biotoxin detection, de-contamination, remediation, and consequence management. To illustrate the scope of the their ef-forts, projects have included: Developing methods for determining de-contamination efficacy against biotoxins on military-relevant surfaces Investigating the effects of standard water treatments, including chemical oxidants, co-agulants, heating, and boiling on biotoxins in water samples Analyzing recovery of bioagents, including biotoxins, from dry filter units (DFUs) As part of the Joint Chemical, Biological, Ra- diological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Concept, these biotoxin projects enabled collaborations with several military (Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, Naval Medical Research Center, Naval Re-search Laboratory, and U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground) and nonmilitary agencies (Environmen-tal Protection Agency and the Lincoln Laborato-ry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)). Protecting the Navy and Our Nation John Michael McConnell, former Director of National Intelligence, stated in a speech in 2008 that, \"One of our greatest concerns continues to be that a terrorist group or some other dangerous group might acquire and employ biological agents ... t o create casualties greater than September 11. \"1 This Figure 2. Clostridium botulinum 173 Biotoxin Research at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD)concern was again confirmed by Michele Flourn- oy's more recent statement, \"... Th e thing that keeps me awake at night is a nexus between terrorism and massive destruction. \" The Navy and our nation must be prepared for these potential threats. Accordingly, scientists from NSWCDD are not only committed to biotoxin re-search, they are contributing significantly to the Navy's and our nation's ability to detect, protect, and decontaminate hazards from a biotoxin attack. Endnote a. B iosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) is appropriate for handling moderate-risk agents that cause human disease of varying severity by ingestion or through percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure. Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) is appropriate for agents with a known potential for aerosol transmission, for agents that may cause serious and poten-tially lethal infections, and for those that are indigenous or exotic in origin.

Scientist Working in a Toxin Laboratory With a Powered, Air-Purifying Respirator 174 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing CapabilitiesDevelopment of Novel Solutions for Decontaminating Warfare Agents By Claire Wells and Chris Hodge In the aftermath of a chemical or biological warfare agent attack, the inevita- ble question asked is, \"How do we clean this up?\" For chemical and biological experts and experienced naval personnel, the obvious answer is to use a decontamination so-lution, commonly called a decon. Decons currently in the field are based on oxidative chemistry employed in water-based systems. One example is the high-test hypochlo-rite (HTH) presently used by the Navy as its standard shipboard oxidizer for decontam-ination. HTH is more commonly known as a common active ingredient in swimming pool shock products. It is a reactive, corrosive, chlorinated chemical that severely cor - rodes metals and can cause serious damage to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Be-cause of its reactivity, oxidants like HTH are effective in neutralizing the threat from the warfare agents. However, for the same reason, they can also be harsh on materials, us-ers, and the environment. Decontamination Challenges It is challenging to formulate a decon that is powerful enough to neutralize the agents but gentle enough to be compatible with common military materials. How do scientists and engineers balance the reactivity required for quick agent neutralization with the sta-bility required to avoid destruction of the surface they are trying to clean? How can a de-con meant to chemically react be stable enough to have a useful shelf and pot life? The challenges don't stop there. Scientists and engineers must also solvate hydrophobic (i.e., water-hating) chemical warfare agents and hydrophilic (i.e., water-loving) oxidizers into the decon solution at the same time, under the same conditions, so the neutralization re-action has a chance to occur in the first place. Anyone who has mixed olive oil and vin-egar for their salad and wanted it to stay mixed understands the challenge. Even though solvents can help solvate the agents, their use would create additional environmental con-cerns and safety issues. To be most useful for the warfighter, a decon needs to be: Effective Compatible with common military materials Easy to use by a warfighter in protective gear A low logistical burden Nonhazardous to the user and the environment175 Development of Novel Solutions for Decontaminating Warfare AgentsTo address these challenges, a diverse team of scientists and engineers from the Chemical, Bio- logical, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Di-vision (NSWCDD), in Dahlgren, Virginia, con-ducts research and development efforts to design and test new decon formulations. In one such ef-fort, scientists and engineers utilized microemul-sions formulated from biodegradable surfactants in place of solvents to solvate the warfare agents. Microemulsions are typically mixtures of water, one or more surfactants, and an oil. In this case, the warfare agent serves as the oil. 1 A 2-D depiction of a microemulsion is shown in Figure 1. Using a particular ratio of one surfactant slight- ly soluble in the oil phase and one surfactant slight-ly soluble in the aqueous phase, the researchers Particularly effective was peracetic acid, which has been shown to achieve 100 percent neutralization of all major chemical and biological agents, while avoiding production of toxic by-products. 1 Discovering Decontamination Solutions While improved safety and compatibility were important achievements of these efforts, seeking options to reduce the logistical footprint of the developing decon was also required. This was es-pecially important for the Navy since shipboard storage space is limited. One way to achieve this is by identifying solid counterparts for the decon ingredients. The use of solid ingredients avoids the unnecessary storage and transportation of ex-tra water and allows the decon to be mixed on designed a microemulsion with high solubilization characteristics. The resulting water-based solution of surfactants formed a stable, single-phase solu-tion without the use of harmful solvents. 1 In addition to using microemulsions rather than organic solvents to solvate the chemical agents, the researchers utilized peroxygen compounds instead of harsh chlorinated oxidizers (e.g., HTH) to neu-tralize them. A wide range of peroxygen compounds was evaluated, from simple hydrogen peroxide to complex peracids. These nonchlorine-based perox-ygen compounds were of interest because of their low environmental impact, their improved mate-rials compatibility, and their relatively low toxicity. demand. However, locating a solid source of per - acetic acid proved particularly challenging. Typ-ical systems generated the peracid in situ upon mixing in water. For example, peracetic acid can be generated from the reaction of hydrogen perox-ide and tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED). 1 This approach is feasible but offers limited success par - tially because of poor solubility and a slowed re-action rate. A milestone was reached when the Dahlgren research team identified and successfully tested a novel, solid source of peracetic acid devel-oped for the commercial detergent industry. This compound\u2014with the trade name PES-Solid\u2014does not depend on in situ generation peracetic acid, Figure 1. 2-D Depiction of a Microemulsion176 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabilitiesbut releases it immediately upon dissolution in wa- ter. This makes it available for agent neutralization much more rapidly than in situ methods. 1 In nu - merous testing efforts at NSWCDD, PES-Solid has shown promise against chemical and biological agents, as well as improved materials compatibility with military materials. 1-3 A representative struc- ture of PES-Solid is shown in Figure 2. The exact structure remains unknown. Current NSWCDD decontamination develop- ment efforts utilizing PES-Solid are focused on cre-ating a product for the warfighter that is safe and user-friendly. In the course of efforts to mature the developed technology, formal collaboration with the solid oxidizer manufacturer will allow re-searchers to explore the optimization of the prod-uct for safe storage and transportation, as well as for ease of mixing. This will help to reduce the risk and workload of the operators in the field. The journey to creating a safe and effective decon that meets the needs of the warfighter is challenging because many of the desirable attri-butes of a decon formulation conflict with one another. NSWCDD scientists and engineers con-tinue to work with our Navy and joint partners to develop technologies that lead to more effective and safer decontamination methods. References 1.

Representative Structure of PES-Solid177 Development of Novel Solutions for Decontaminating Warfare Agents 177Development of Novel Solutions for Decontaminating Warfare Agents178 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing CapabilitiesThe Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) in Dahlgren, Virginia, is home to the Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Division, where one of its primary goals is to develop technologies that will neutralize or contain chemical warfare agents (CW As). This article communicates how soft-matter technolo-gies are used to accomplish this goal. What is soft matter? Soft matter refers to materials that are in-between crystalline solids and simple liquids. Examples include liquid crystals, gels, foams, and microemul-sions. These materials are found in many common commercial products. Liquid crystals, for example, are found in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) in flat-screen televisions. Jello and shaving cream are examples of gels and foams. So how do soft-matter technologies like these help to neutralize and con-tain CW As? This is where the last example, microemulsions, is really important. This article explains how microemulsions are the solution to one of the toughest problems in CW A cleanup and decontamination. To begin, consider a problem that is specific to the decon- tamination of CW As. Some CW As\u2014like the blistering agent distilled mustard\u2014are soluble in oil; other CW As\u2014like the nerve agent sarin\u2014are soluble in water. Most chemical com-pounds that neutralize CW As are soluble only in water. It is common knowledge that water and oil don't mix, as illustrat-ed in Figure 1, which shows motor oil and water in a glass. Even if shaken, the two liquids will separate. The oil remains on top since it has a lower density than water. This creates two problems: 1. H ow to get neutralizing agents, soluble in water, to re- act with oil-soluble CW As 2. H ow to make a cleaning solution that will dissolve both oil- and water-soluble CW As There is a way to make oil and water mix and solve both of the decontamination problems. Chemicals called surface ac-tive agents, commonly known as surfactants, are the key to the solution. A surfactant is a molecule that contains both Figure 1. Motor Oil and Water in a Glass 179 Soft Matter Makes Tough Technologiesparticular case shown in Figure 4, the spherical mi- celles have the hydrophilic part of the surfactant on the surface of the sphere, and the hydrophobic part Figure 2. Simple Model of a Surfactanthydrophilic (water-loving) and lipophilic (oil-lov-ing) groups. Figure 2 shows model of the surfactant octane-1-oxydiethylene glycol. Octane-1-oxydiethylene glycol is only one ex- ample of a surfactant; there are thousands of surfac-tants, if not more. They are actually very common. The phospholipids that make up the cell mem-branes in the human body are surfactants. Surfac-tants can also be found in all sorts of commercial products, including paints, detergents, shampoos, conditioners, cosmetics, inks, and insecticides, to name a few. How do surfactants cause oil and water to mix? The dual nature of surfactant molecular structure causes these molecules to reside at the interface be-tween a nonpolar solvent (like oil) and a polar sol-vent (like water). The hydrophilic group prefers to bond with water, and the lipophilic group prefers to bond with oil. A depiction of this interface is shown in Figure 3. Surfactants don't just sit at the interface. They actually self-assemble into different micro- and nano-structures depending on their specific physi-cal properties. One specific example, shown in Fig-ure 4A, are small spheres called micelles. In the Figure 3. Surfactants reside at the oil and water interface. The hydrophilic group prefers to bond with water, and the lipophilic group prefers to bond with oil. 180 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabilitiesof the micelle on the interior of the sphere, depict- ed in Figure 4B. Therefore, the water is on the out-side, and the oil is on the inside. This means that the spherical micelle encapsulates oil droplets and carries them into the water. This is how surfactants cause oil and water to mix. It is important to note that when surfactants form structures where the domains are from 10 to 100 nanometers (the diameter of a micelle sphere), the solutions are referred to as a microemulsion. These nanostructures cannot be seen with the na-ked eye and do not scatter light, making micro-emulsions transparent. The really important fact about surfactant structures that are smaller than 100 nanometers is that they are stable. In oth-er words, the oil, water, and surfactants in a mi-croemulsion do not separate over time. Figure 5 shows how microemulsions are stable, transpar - ent oil and water solutions where surfactants have formed nanostructures with 10-100 nanometer domains. Microemulsions dissolve CW As that are solu- ble in oil or in water because surfactants cause oil and water to mix. However, it is not clear how mi-croemulsions allow neutralizing agents dissolved in water to interact with CW As that are soluble only in oils. From the information presented, it would seem that a layer of surfactants would pre-vent these chemicals from coming into contact. How do neutralizing agents interact with oil- soluble CW As? Surfactant structures are not per - manent structures floating in water or oil. They are highly dynamic, falling apart and reforming many times each second. This can be compared Figure 4.

The dance has structure but is always changing. This type of dynamics in microemulsions allows neutralizing agents to bump into CW As in the oil phase, caus-ing a reaction that neutralizes the agent. Microemulsions provide an amazing capabili- ty, as they allow for the creation of a decontamina-tion solution that soaks up and neutralizes a broad spectrum of CW As. This one-size-fits-all approach saves storage capacity and money. Microemulsion-based decontamination solutions also have other advantageous properties. For example, these solu-tions are not considered to be corrosive and can be used at low temperatures; microemulsions can be designed to function below the freezing point of water. Furthermore, many of the components are already commercially available, making this ap-proach very attractive. Microemulsion decontami-nation solutions have been developed at NSWCDD and are currently being evaluated for approval for use by the military. They are also in consideration for use by nonmilitary emergency personnel, such as first responders. Figure 5.

Reticular chemistry produces materials like metal organic frameworks (MOFs) in which organic building blocks are combined with metal salts to pro-duce extended structures connected through robust bonds 1a-f (Figure 1A) and covalent organic frame- works (COFs) in which the structures are formed by connecting the organic building blocks together without the metal ions 2a-g (Figure 1B). These figures show how the simple organic building blocks on the left are connected together to make the extended in-terconnected structures on the right through chem-ical bonds. The advantages and benefits of using reticular materials to produce new CBR protection systems will be laid out in the rest of the article. Nanoscale Design One of the many advantages of MOF and COF systems is that the design of specific structures is possible. The principles of reticular chemistry in-volve simplifying organic molecules or metal com-plexes as simple geometric shapes with points of connectivity at the corners like those shown in Fig-ure 2. 1a The organic linker, shown as a simple line, is analogous to an I-beam or girder (Figure 2A, B, and D). The metal coordinates with linkers, form-ing the secondary building unit (SBU) with a specific shape similar to the joints found in con-struction (Figure 2C, E, and F). These struts and joints form an extended structure similar to the structural skeleton of a building (Figure 2G and H 3). In past publications\u2014such as the Taxonomy of periodic nets and the design of materials by Michael O'Keeffe\u2014crystal structures of many different ma-terials were analyzed, simplifying the molecules into simple geometric shapes. It was found that de-spite the wide range of materials in nature, only a small number of basic structures were present, and the structure of materials in nature could be pre-dicted if the molecules were simplified into rigid shapes. 4 These principles have been further tested and proven in many MOF and COF publications that demonstrate the ability to predict the struc-tures of materials before making them. Thus it is possible to truly design a material with a specific desirable structure through careful selection of the building blocks used. This is similar to the blue-prints used in the fabrication of buildings, where the structure is planned out with specific joints and beams. This design is important for certain CBR applications where specific pore sizes or shapes may be needed to obtain maximum protection. Us-ing reticular chemistry, the sizes and shapes of the pores in the material can be designed by changing Introduction Construction involves the combination of ar - tificial or natural components into a larger whole. There have been many advancements in the de-velopment of construction methods and building blocks used throughout history\u2014from wood-en log cabins to steel skyscrapers. This ability to manipulate and produce complex structures with specific designs, while common in the macroscale world of rivets and girders, has been, for the most part, unrealized in the microscale and nanoscale regimes of our world. Consequently, the ability to produce advanced functional materials displaying many different properties like conductivity and reactivity has been hindered by limitations in our materials science and engineering capabilities. Re-ticular chemistry is concerned with the design and controlled construction of nanoscale structures through the linking of molecular building blocks with strong bonds. More simply, this chemistry al-lows one to design and construct nanoscale mate-rials with specific properties and structures with a great deal of control. The image on the previous page represents the idea of molecular construction by illustrating a city with buildings and roads con-structed from various extended reticular materi-als using actual crystal structures. This powerful form of molecular construction could be used to build materials for any number of relevant tech-nologies including organo-electronics, catalysts, or building materials, but this article will focus on the design and synthesis of advanced, functional materials for chemical, biological, and radiologi-cal (CBR) defense applications. Fielded CBR Adsorbents Current CBR technologies utilize porous ma- terials that adsorb or trap a chemical weapon agent (CW A) and other toxic industrial chemical (TIC) threat molecules. Some of these adsorbents also con-tain reactive species that break down the threats af-ter adsorption. Currently, activated carbon materials are used in filters to adsorb the CW A/TIC threats while metal salts impregnated into the pores chemi-cally break down those threats. These carbon mate-rials have random, disordered structures and allow very little control over the sizes and shapes of the pores or spaces in the materials. While these carbon materials adsorb some threat molecules very well, some TIC threats are not as strongly adsorbed and can pose protective challenges. Reticular chemistry is concerned with the connection of simple chemi-cal building blocks into predictable structures using strong bonds to connect the building blocks. Retic-ular chemistry is well suited to improve on porous 184 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabilitiesthe shapes and lengths of the building blocks used. This capability is not possible with current porous carbon materials, where there is very little control over the structures. Functionalization Methods Functionalization refers to the ability to change or add chemical groups to a molecule or polymer. The functionalization and variability of potential building blocks is another advantage for reticular materials. This is important because cer - tain functional groups may bind or react with a desired CW A or TIC threat to give better protec-tion. Using well-known chemical reactions (Fig-ure 3a), virtually any organic molecule or metal could be incorporated into a MOF or COF ma-terial simply by producing a building block with desired functionality. These functional groups may improve adsorption, add reactive capabilities, or enhance the detection of specific CBR threats. The amazing thing about MOFs and COFs is that building blocks with these functionalities can be used to make the material without changing the overall structure. 5 This is similar to using girders made from different metals or changing the dec-orations in a building without changing the skel-eton structure. This variability makes it possible to make materials with any functional group or structure desired. This is important to CBR ap-plications because materials can be designed for specific threats where reactivity or increased sen-sitivity requires special materials. Using retic-ular chemistry, these threat-specific materials could be made without altering the basic adsor - bent material structure and properties. This func-tionalization, however, does not always need to Figure 1. Synthesis of MOFs (A) and COFs (B) showing the formation of building units from organic linkers and metal ions and the extended structures formed from these building units.185 Molecular Construction: Novel Multifunctional Adsorbents for the Next-Generation CBR Protection Systemsbe carried out on the building blocks before pro- duction of the adsorbent. Reticular chemistry has also demonstrated the ability to modify the struc-ture after synthesis of the MOF or COF. This pro-cedure, called postfunctionalization, 6a-e utilizes known organic reactions to chemically change the side groups of the building blocks without de-stroying the extended structure (Figure 3B). Re-cent discoveries have added even more options to the modification of MOF and COF materials. Researchers have shown that the linkers in MOF materials can even be exchanged without losing the original extended structure. 7 This was demon- strated by starting with the MOF shown in Figure 3C and sequentially exchanging different func-tionalized building blocks in the structure, pro-ducing a material with many different side chains present.Importance of Order The fact that MOFs and COFs are produced as crystalline materials is another advantage for these materials. A crystalline material has an ordered structure where the arrangement and position of atoms repeats itself throughout the structure. Al-though crystalline structures are not necessary for adsorption and other applications, the abili-ty to produce well-defined, ordered materials can be very useful. Crystalline MOFs and COFs have well-ordered pore structures that can be thoroughly characterized. This characterization can tell you where every atom in the structure is and reveal im-portant information about reaction, adsorption properties, or sensing mechanisms in the material. This information could then be used to design bet-ter materials and predict their behavior and perfor - mance. Even though materials like porous carbons Figure 2. Organic linker (A), which is represented as a black line (B), is analogous to an I-beam or girder (D). When this linker is reacted with a metal ion (C), the octahedral building unit (E) is formed, which is similar to the joints (F) found in modern construction. The extended structure formed by the connection of linkers and metal ions (G) is analogous to the skeletal structure of a modern building (H). 186 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing CapabilitiesFigure 3. Various methods of MOF, COF functionalization: (A) Represents direct transformation of the building block followed by synthesis of the MOF or COF, (B) Postfunctionalization involves modification of the building blocks after synthesis of the extended structure, and (C) Ligand exchange involves sequential exchange of some of the building blocks in the structure after the MOF is synthesized.187 Molecular Construction: Novel Multifunctional Adsorbents for the Next-Generation CBR Protection Systemshave been used for the last 50-100 years, we still lack complete fundamental knowledge in terms of reaction mechanisms with CW A and TIC threats. This lack of fundamental knowledge hinders our understanding of many mechanisms important to CBR applications\u2014including loss of reactivity in aged or fielded filters for collective protection sys-tems (CPSs)\u2014limiting our ability to effectively ad-dress shelf life and residual life issues. Properties of MOFs and COFs The advantages described above give MOF and COF materials certain properties that are superior to the currently fielded porous carbons. Most MOF and COF materials are extremely porous and, un-like porous carbons where the adsorption occurs in microporous branched channels, MOFs and COFs are completely open structures, allowing access to the pore structure from any direction. This is sim-ilar to a building with six entrances versus a build-ing with only one entrance, allowing much more efficient access. Consequently, MOFs and COFs exhibit much higher surface areas than porous car - bons because the open structure allows access to all the adsorption sites. This means that there is more area inside these MOF and COF materials for re-acting with or adsorbing gas molecules. Due to the strong bonding in MOFs and COFs, these mate-rials exhibit high thermal stabilities. Many MOFs and COFs have demonstrated very good chemical stability to water and even acids and bases. Most MOFs and COFs also have very low densities due to the large amounts of open space in the structures versus the volume of the structures. The author dis-covered COF-108\u2014which has the lowest densi-ty known for a crystalline material (0.17 g cm -1)2c (Figure 4)\u2014in 2007 during his doctoral work. The properties described above are common for most MOF and COF materials, but there are also materi-al-dependent properties that are very important to consider when designing MOF and COF materials for CBR and other applications. Future Applications of MOF and COF Materials As mentioned before, any organic molecule or metal could potentially be incorporated into a MOF or COF. This includes molecules that are currently used in other applications like catalysis, electronics, detection, and others. The versatile na-ture of reticular chemistry or molecular construc-tion towards enhancing warfighter capabilities is detailed in the following examples. Many organ-ic molecules are used in electronic applications to conduct electricity or signals. A newly discovered 2-D COF was tested and found to conduct electric-ity and produce electricity from light. 8 These mol - ecules could be used to construct MOFs or COFs that would be able to adsorb CBR threats and then signal through the conductivity that an attack is underway. The COF or MOF materials could even bind reactive species or incorporate reactive link-ers in the synthesis so that a multifunctional mate-rial could be produced that would capture, detect, and destroy CW A and TIC threats. This technol-ogy would be useful for collective and individu-al protection equipment applications such as CP filters and masks. The materials could also be de-veloped for protective clothing that would pro-tect the war fig hter, as well as signal him, his unit, and headquarters that the area is dangerous. Con-ducting MOFs or COFs could also be used to pro-duce standoff/remote point detection technologies by supplying new detection materials with better sensitivity and selectivity. These sensing materials could be incorporated into remote CBR sensors that could be left around the perimeter of a ship or encampment to warn against attacks. Other MOF and COF materials could also be developed to cap-ture solar energy or make more efficient batteries so that detection devices could be fielded longer with less necessary maintenance. These examples should demonstrate how new MOF and COF ma-terials could be utilized in protecting warfighters on the ship, in battle, or in the field. There are ad-ditional areas of military interest in which MOFs and COFs could be applied\u2014including armor, wa-ter filtration, gas storage, or organo-electronics\u2014that are not discussed. Current Research Many of the concepts and applications dis- cussed in this article are theoretical; however, there is research showing the effectiveness of MOF and COF materials towards CBR applications. One study tested a group of well-known MOFs against common TIC threats like ammonia and chlorine, and compared their performance to an activat-ed carbon (BPL carbon). 9 The results showed that some of the MOFs were more effective than carbon materials towards some TIC threats. Some COF and MOF materials have been synthesized and charac-terized at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahl-gren Division (NSWCDD) in Dahlgren, Virginia, and tested against TIC threats like ammonia and sulfur dioxide at the Edgewood Chemical and Bio-logical Center (ECBC) to probe the structural fea-tures and characteristics most effective against TIC and CW A protection. The MOFs and COFs test-ed showed good potential to improve TIC threat 188 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing CapabilitiesFigure 4. COF-108 shown above exhibits the lowest density (0.17 g cm-1) of any known crystalline material. 189 Molecular Construction: Novel Multifunctional Adsorbents for the Next-Generation CBR Protection Systemsprotection. NSWCDD scientists are also design- ing and researching new multifunctional MOF and COF materials with potential improvements in CBR protection capabilities against TIC threats. Conclusion Since the discovery of MOF materials in 1999, research has grown quickly, with thousands of new MOFs being reported every year. Research into COF materials has not been as extensive; however, COFs were discovered only in 2005. It is only in the last couple of years that concerted efforts were made to apply MOF and COF materials towards air pu-rification and CBR applications. Despite the infan-cy of this field of chemistry, the potential for these materials is vast. Reticular chemistry truly repre-sents molecular construction in the sense of syn-thesizing nanostructured materials in a controllable and reproducible manner. This article highlights the power of reticular chemistry to design and tai-lor adsorbents towards specific threats and appli-cations. Given the amazing potential for MOF and COF materials, the molecular construction used to construct a city like the one shown on the first page of this article may not be so unrealistic after all.References 1.

Kota and Linda C. Beck191 Investigating Natural Flavonoid Compounds as Potential Radioprotective Agents for the WarfighterFigure 1. Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) ConceptRadiological threats are a potential area of ter - rorism that has not received much attention until recently. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimated that approximately one licensed source of radiation is lost every day of the year in the Unit-ed States alone. 1 Moreover, there have been 700 in- cidents of illegal trafficking of radioactive materials worldwide, including 440 incidents in the United States, according to the International Atomic Ener - gy Agency (IAEA). 2 Radiological threats are usually found in the format of a dirty bomb, also known as a radiolog-ical dispersion device (RDD). RDDs are a combi-nation of conventional explosives and radioactive material designed to scatter dangerous amounts of radioactive material, as well as shrapnel over a gen-eral area. Terrorist use of RDDs is considered far more likely than use of a nuclear device because they require very little technical knowledge to build and deploy compared to that of a nuclear de-vice. RDDs also appeal to terrorists because certain radiological materials are used widely in medicine, agriculture, industry, and research, and are much more readily available compared to weapons-grade uranium or plutonium. Unlike a conventional ter - rorist bomb, the primary objective of an RDD is not to target warfighters or civilians directly with the explosion; rather, the explosion disperses ra-dioactive material over a wide area in an attempt to create fear and disruption. The levels of radio-active material are usually sublethal; however, they can still result in long-term, harmful effects. The concept of an RDD is shown in Figure 1.In 2005, the Radiological and Nuclear Threat Countermeasure Working Group established a pri-ority list of research goals relevant to this rising area of concern. Their top two goals were: 1. T o understand the mechanisms of radiation injury at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organism levels as a basis for development of preventative, therapeutic, and diagnostic approaches 2. T o develop new therapeutic agents that can be used to treat people who have been ex-posed to ionizing radiation (IR) Just recently, the Department of Health and Human Services reiterated the importance of this effort in a report stating that: \"...the understanding of the mechanisms of radiation damage, as well as organ system injury, damage repair, and inflammation, is necessary to develop optimal medical man-agement and medical countermeasures. \" 3 Scientists from the Naval Surface Warfare Cen- ter, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), Dahlgren, Vir - ginia, recently teamed with scientists from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia, to examine the basic scientific principles behind the damage caused by IR, as well as novel solutions to mitigate these risks. It is known that exposure to IR leads to the production of toxic free radicals and DNA damage in living cells. However, understanding the mecha-nisms behind this damage will allow researchers to 192 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabilitiesdevelop more efficient methods of protection and treatment against radiological attacks. Figure 2 de-picts a strand of DNA being damaged by an outside source of radiation. When this occurs, it begins a cascade of signaling molecules that reaches various effectors in the cells of our bodies and results in certain responses. In some cases, the DNA is able to repair itself and continue with its normal func-tion. At other times, this type of damage will lead to the arrest or inhibition of various cell cycle tran-sitions, which ultimately results in the demise of the cell. It is also possible for this exposure to result in the generation of new genes and proteins, a pro-cess known as transcription, which can initiate a variety of cellular processes. Lastly, the cell can un-dergo a protective process of cell death, referred to as apoptosis, which prevents the damage from be-ing passed on to future generations of cells. One possible mitigation method under exami- nation is the use of naturally occurring compounds known as flavonoids. Flavonoid compounds show promise as protective agents against IR-induced damage. One of the main functions of flavonoids is to act as an antioxidant to slow or prevent formation of free radicals and DNA damage following expo-sure to IR. These compounds are found ubiquitously throughout common foods in the human diet such as citrus fruit, red wine, dark chocolate, and tea. Due to their high availability, flavonoids represent an ex-tremely cost-efficient method of protection. While preliminary work with flavonoids has shown the potential to mitigate the harmful effects of radiation, specific information on effective doses and therapeutic mechanisms is still lacking. Dahl-gren scientists have begun to explore these gaps in hopes of answering the types of basic research questions that will enable development of success-ful preventative and treatment options. In initial studies, Dahlgren researchers ex- amined the effect of quercetin (QN)\u2014a flavonoid with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ef-fects\u2014on cell survival following exposure to radi-ation. In primary human skin cells, quercetin dose dependently a increases the percentage of cell sur - vival following exposure to radiation, suggesting a protective effect. Figure 3 shows skin cell survival Figure 2. Possible Effects of DNA Damage Due to Ionizing Radiation (IR)193 Investigating Natural Flavonoid Compounds as Potential Radioprotective Agents for the Warfighter resulting from pretreatment with various concen- trations of the flavonoid compound quercetin. Scientists plan to complete studies testing a full range of IR doses and quercetin concentrations to fully understand the most effective way to coun-ter radiological threats using natural sources. In addition, studies will be conducted to examine re-sponses that are occurring at the cellular level so that these mechanisms can be targeted for thera-peutic measures. Ultimately, it is hoped that this research will lead to the development of effective radioprotective agents that will keep warfighters safe from the effects of RDDs and other radiolog-ical threats.

A respirator with a lens that impairs vision would hinder a warfighter's ability to complete mission operations.Branch conducts testing to determine the com- patibility of decontaminants selected by these programs with representative military materials; selected petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL); and, where applicable, other currently fielded de-contaminants. Testing by branch personnel pro-vides a thorough assessment of the compatibility of the selected decontaminants. The testing also is designed to identify any destructive effects on materials, as well as potentially hazardous inter - actions with compounds commonly found in the operational environment. The following hypothetical field scenarios dem- onstrate the need for decontaminant testing. Hypothetical Field Scenario: Incompatible Decontaminant Solution After possible exposure to a chemical warfare agent during mission operations, soldiers perform decontamination procedures before returning to base. After doing so, they stow their respirators in their mask storage containers until the next time they need them. Unfortunately, when the respira-tors are needed again, they cannot be used because the decontaminant destroyed the masks' lenses, hindering a warfighter's ability to complete mission operations. A personnel decontamination exercise is shown in Figure 1. 195Decontaminant Material and Chemical Compatibility Testing Imagine fighting terrorists in Afghanistan, or any other strange land for that matter, and being at-tacked with a chemical warfare agent ... p retty scary. While many nations have agreed through treaties to eradicate the use of chemical, biological, and radio-logical (CBR) weapons, terrorists follow no such agreements. Fortunately, war fig hters are equipped and trained to protect themselves if this happens. The research arm of the Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Defense Division at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) in Dahlgren, Virginia, is the Concepts and Experimentation Branch. Scientists and engi-neers in this branch actively seek CBR defense solu-tions for the technical challenges and threats facing the Navy and the U.S. homeland. These skilled pro-fessionals are responsible for performing the basic and applied science supporting the research, de-velopment, testing, and evaluation of technologies necessary to defend against chemical, biological, and radiological weapons. This research enhances warfighter, fleet, and homeland CBR defensive ca-pabilities and increases fleet readiness. The Joint Program Manager for Decontami- nation (JPM-Decon), located in Stafford, Virginia, conducts testing and evaluation of decontaminants selected for acquisition programs to support sub-sequent fielding decisions. As part of these efforts, the NSWCDD Concepts and Experimentation 196 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing CapabilitiesFor materials compatibility, the primary objec- tive is to determine the extent of degradation of a material after decontamination procedures. Rep-resentative military materials include individu-al protection equipment (IPE) such as protective outer garments, respirators, gloves, and overboots. Military materials also include equipment such as weapons, tactical vehicles, etc., and the paints, metals, fabrics, and plastics that are used to make them. Prospective decontaminants need to be test-ed against these articles to ensure that the decon-taminating process does not destroy the materials and that the equipment will perform as expected. Accordingly, following the decontamination pro-cess, IPE must still be able to protect against CBR events, weapons must still fire safely, and vehicles must still start and run as expected. Hypothetical Field Scenario: Decontaminant Deadly\u2014 Gas Hazard A vehicle had a small, undetected fuel leak dur - ing decontamination, and the fuel reacted with the decontaminant. When the two mixed, a toxic and potentially deadly gas formed, endangering person-nel. Vehicle decontamination procedures are shown in Figure 2. Selected POL are tested for incompatibility, with prospective decontaminants based on pre-scribed decontamination procedures developed to prevent accident or injury due to chemical reactiv-ity. POL testing focuses on two primary issues: 1. C hemical incompatibility, resulting in haz- ardous increases in temperature or off- gassing when the decontaminant comes into contact with a POL 2. Th e potential interaction of the decontami- nant with external or topical POL that could result in a loss of lubricating properties and increased maintenance requirements Hypothetical Field Scenario: Decontaminant Fire Hazard During decontamination operations, a quanti- ty of personnel decontaminant reacts violently with a vehicle decontaminating solution when mixed in Figure 2. An odorless, colorless, toxic gas created by decontaminant/fuel incompatibility could quickly overcome this soldier. 197 Decontaminant Material and Chemical Compatibility Testing Figure 3. A potential personnel decontaminant reacts violently with a fielded decontaminant when mixed in certain ratios.certain ratios. The two are incompatible, and the reaction starts a fire. A depiction of the reaction is shown in Figure 3. Selected decontaminants are also tested against currently fielded decontaminants. For compatibility of any potential decontaminant with currently fielded decontaminants, the pri-mary objective is to identify any hazards resulting from accidental or intentional mixing. Fire, large and rapid temperature increases, hazardous off- gassing, or profound physical changes help deter - mine whether the risks of potentially hazardous consequences are worth the decontaminating po-tential of a newly deployed solution. As these realistic field scenarios demonstrate, in- troducing new decontaminants without understand-ing the potential hazards involved can be dangerous. The efforts of JPM-Decon and NSWCDD's Concepts and Experimentation Branch ensure that warfighters are protected by the latest and most effective decon-taminants and are made aware of potential hazards that can undermine their safety further ensuring that they can fight, win, and come home safely.198 CBRD Research, Applied Science, and Testing CapabilitiesTesting is Key to Maintaining an Effective Navy Fighting Capabilityin a Contaminated Environment By Tim Thomasson Nowhere else on earth can you find such an assemblage of deadly firepower, intri- cate electronics, powerful propulsion systems, and numbers of highly trained person- nel than on a U.S. Navy warship. Nor can you find a more challenging environment for testing the protective equipment designed to prevent chemical, biological, and radio-logical (CBR) threats or other toxic compounds from doing harm to these amazingly powerful vessels and their crews. The lives of the crew and the missions assigned to the Navy are too important to base the measures of effectiveness of the protective technolo-gies on laboratory testing or engineering assessments. The equipment must be placed on ships and must be tested in realistic, measurable ways. Testing on ships, however, is both challenging and complex, and requires specialized expertise\u2014expertise available thanks to scientists and engineers from the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), who have earned the title, Shipboard Testing Subject Matter Experts. The amphibious dock landing ship USS Oak Hill (LSD 51), which was recently used for ship- board testing, is shown at sea in Figure 1 and is followed by a photograph of U.S. Navy test personnel aboard USS Oak Hill in Figure 2. Shipboard Testing The Defense Acquisition Process employs a number of paths for equipment to fol- low during development, but for shipboard equipment, all end up needing some final test phase that places it on an appropriate vessel for testing and evaluation. Central to this evaluation process is subjecting the equipment to a realistic threat environment and measuring its performance. This is where the challenges of testing can actually exceed those of developing the new hardware. What is so hard about CBR shipboard testing? For one thing, the testing often needs to be done at sea underway with all the other ship systems operating. Another challenge is the need for a realistic threat in order to evaluate the performance of the protective equipment. A ship cannot be attacked with an actual chemical or biological agent, or anything that would harm the ship, the crew, or the environment. Consequently, a safe 199 Testing is Key to Maintaining an Effective Navy Fighting Capability in a Contaminated Environment Figure 2.

Helicopter Spraying Simulated Agentway to simulate the hazardous CBR threat must be found (a safe substitute), and a means of delivering it must be developed. Along with the challenges of simulating the at- tack, there is the requirement for instrumentation to measure how effective the attack was on the ship. It answers the question \"How much hit the ship?\" This measurement becomes the reference point for eval-uating the performance of the protective technology with respect to whether the equipment will protect the ship and crew, enabling them to safely perform the mission. In Figure 3, a helicopter spraying a sim-ulated agent is shown performing an area attack to determine if the shipboard detectors adequately de-tect the attack in time to protect the ship and crew. NSWCDD has been conducting CBR ship- board testing for over 25 years and has assembled the world's best expertise in taking on these chal-lenging tests. Their team includes in-house person-nel, contractors, and joint participation from other service laboratories. Testing is key to maintaining an effective Navy fighting capability in a contaminated environment. Testing ensures that our CBR systems work, that our Sailors are protected, and that our ships can contin-ue to conduct their missions in spite of CBR attacks.

In approximately 190 B.C., Hannibal of Carthage made history when, while helping the king of Bithynia, he had some earthen vessels filled with poisonous snakes, covered the pots, and set sail. As the Bithynians prepared for battle, they hurled the pots full of the poisonous snakes onto the decks of the enemy ships. The resulting confusion, fear, and chaos demonstrated the effects of a chemical or biological (CB) attack. This is per - haps the first recorded instance of a CB attack on a naval ship. Over 2,000 years later, the threat is still just as real\u2014only much more sophisticated\u2014and generates the need for a comprehensive Navy Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) defense program. Introduction A leader in the Navy CBR defense program, the CBR Defense Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) provides our warfighters with the tools and capabilities necessary to detect, protect, and if necessary, decontaminate the toxic residue resulting from a CBR attack. The CBR Defense Division has a full com-plement of capabilities to support the naval warfighter both on land and at sea, as well as throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) and Homeland Defense communities. NSWCDD has a long history of supporting CBR defense initiatives. Tracing back to the earliest ordnance-based programs and moving ahead to today's full-spectrum CBR defense support, this article provides a broad-brush historical perspective of the 203 NSWCDD's Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense (CBRD) Role - Past, Present, and FutureCBR work performed at NSWCDD in Dahlgren, Virginia, since the mid-1950s. It examines present products, capabilities, and fleet support services, and concludes with an exploration of the future on Navy CBR defense. Historical Perspective Beginning in August 1954, NSWCDD\u2014then the Naval Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia\u2014conducted a variety of work in chemical warfare (CW) research and development programs. This initial work, which was performed for the Bureau of Ordnance, focused on the simulant-filled EX 23 (Mk 94) bombs and involved fit checks, assem-bly tests, environmental testing, and ballistic char - acterization. Having its roots as a naval gunnery range, it is not surprising that NSWCDD would be the recipient of this kind of work. 1960s-1980s In the early 1960s, the CBR work performed at NSWCDD expanded from a solely chemical weap- on focus to include CW defense. At this time, the Cold War was in full throttle, and there was a real and increasing concern of CW being used against the U.S. Navy. Once again, the Navy turned to NSWCDD to meet their needs for: Information to support commanding offi-cer's decision-making capability in the event of a CW attack A centralization of the resources that were becoming available to help deal with a pos-sible attack An understanding of the complexity of CW situations As the Vietnam War progressed, the use of bi- ological and chemical warfare (BW/CW) agents against U.S. forces emerged as a significant threat. To help address this threat, NSWCDD (known then as the Naval Weapons Laboratory) construct-ed a CB devices test chamber, which consisted of a full-scale mock-up of a shipboard magazine. In this chamber, personnel safely performed exper - iments and tests using toxic materials. Tests with CW agents, if required, were performed at the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. Throughout the 1960s, the work performed at NSWCDD expand-ed to include: Toxicology research CB research, development, test, and evaluation CB detection CB decontamination In 1969, National Security Decision Memoran- dum 35 ended offensive BW programs; however, defensive programs for both BW/CW threats were still very much needed. Because the Navy deemed the work that NSWCDD performed in this area so critical, it designated NSWCDD as the lead labora-tory for BW/CW work in early 1970 and, when the Navy's Biological Laboratory facility in Oakland, California, was closed, some of its personnel were reassigned to NSWCDD. While the U.S. production of CB weapons stopped in 1969, the CBR defense work continued to grow. In the 1970s and 1980s, NSWCDD con-tinued working in CB safety, logistics, and opera-tions planning, which included the logistics and safety of binary chemical weapons and increased research and development work in the area of chemical agent detection and decontamination. NSWCDD also received new work in the area of personal and collective protection, as Dahlgren engineers provided technical support in the devel-opment of the M98 Collective Protection System (CPS) filter for shipboard applications. The collec-tive protection efforts led to the first CPS installa-tion on a U.S. Navy ship with the backfit of CPS into USS Belleau Wood (LHA 3) in 1983 (shown in Figure 1). International events would shape the fu- ture CBR efforts at NSWCDD. In the 1980s Iran-Iraq War, Iraq used chemical weapons against the Iranian army. Iraq began with the use of riot con-trol agents and progressed to the use of blister and nerve agents. As the war was coming to a close, the Iraqi government used chemical weapons against their own people, killing thousands of Kurd civil-ians (see Figure 2). During this time, it is believed that Iraqi sci- entists were also researching biological agents and nuclear weapons to add to their arsenal of mass de-struction. As these events unfolded, the emphasis on chemical and biological defense (CBD) increased. While the Iraqi government was intentional- ly using chemical weapons, in 1984, a tragic in-cident occurred that reminded us that not all CB threats are war- or terrorist-related. A Union Car - bide industrial plant in Bhopal, India, released a toxic cloud of methyl isocyanate, which killed over 3,000 people and injured tens of thousands more. This incident demonstrated the need for our na-tion to be prepared for a chemical, biological, or radiological event whether it is the result of a ter - rorist activity, war, or an accident. Having the ca-pability to protect the fleet from these kinds of scenarios was imperative. Back home, an event was taking shape that would impact the CBR defense work being per - formed at NSWCDD. In March 1986, Rear Admi-ral J.B. Mooney, Jr., Chief of Naval Research (CNR), 204 CBRD Final Thoughts formalized in a letter to the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) what would quickly become what some called the \"Panic of '86\" . 1 That short letter said: \"Budget constraints have required that the Office of Naval Technology (ONT) reduce the scope of several of its programs begin-ning in FY86 and into the out years ... . The Chemical and Biological Defense Program has not been identified in the Program Ob-jective Memorandum (POM) 88 process as a high priority technology area by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) ... . Hence, ONT intends to reduce the CBR effort starting in FY86, followed by 50 percent in FY87, with total phase-out by FY91. \" Almost immediately, the CBR defense leader - ship sought new positions for the branch personnel that would be immediately affected and by July had identified placement for some of the individuals. In August, the Commander of NSWCDD advised the Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command (COMNAVSEASYSCOM) of his intent to eliminate the Center's involvement in CBR defense matters over the next several years. 2 Other Division person- nel continued to look for and find positions across NSWCDD. In August, the Undersecretary for Defense, Re- search, and Engineering\u2014who had previously con-curred with the Navy decision to reduce the ONT CBR defense budget\u2014expressed his concerns to the Navy at the Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&T) Investment Strat-egy Review. By September, the CNO had officially expressed his concern to the Space and Naval War - fare Systems Command (SPAW AR) ... about the potential loss of the Navy's capabilities in this area, especially at a time when upgraded individual and collective protection measures are being developed and purchased for the fleet. The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (DCNO) for Surface Warfare went on to say, \"I strongly Figure 1. USS Belleau Wood (LHA 3) 205 NSWCDD's Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense (CBRD) Role - Past, Present, and Futuresupport the continuance of NAVSURFWPNCEN's role in CBR defense and request that you act expeditiously to prevent loss of core expertise. \" 3 By December, CNR was having second thoughts and recommended that CNO (OP 098) consider ad-ditional coordination with the Office of the Secre-tary of Defense (OSD). 4 In February 1987, the CNO made it clear that the Navy needed to maintain a ca-pability to support fleet needs, and SPAW AR was di-rected to develop a plan for a continuing program at NSWCDD. 5 The Division began hiring new person- nel to replace the many valuable people who had left and reorganized to fulfill the earlier CNO mandate. 1990s During Operation Desert Shield, it was feared that Iraq would once again use CB weapons, this time against U.S. and coalition forces. The use of CB weapons against ships was of particular concern to the Navy given the unique challenges associated with the sea environment. The Navy turned to NSWCDD as the Navy's leader in CBD to help prepare the Navy to operate in a maritime CB environment. To determine how effectively the Iraqi army could contaminate our ships with attacks from their shore batteries, NSWCDD developed a computer - ized CW naval simulation model. This model\u2014first called PLUME and later Vapor, Liquid, and Sol-id Tracking (VLSTRACK)\u2014simulated the attacks and tracked the vapor, liquids, and solids from the munitions based on agent type and meteorological (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind direction, and speed) conditions. The ship's commanding officer could then use the output to determine where there would be a threat of contamination. To address the threat of ships being contami- nated by CW agents, NSWCDD aggressively fielded CBD equipment and trained deploying personnel. CPS was installed on ships heading to the Persian Gulf to allow Sailors in the protected areas to oper - ate without wearing cumbersome protective cloth-ing and masks. These areas also allowed a place for Sailors to remove their protective clothing to pre-vent excessive heat stress. NSWCDD provided spe-cial protective clothing, detection and monitoring equipment, and CB warfare training to deploying Figure 2. Chemical Weapons Killed Thousands of Kerds\u2014Halabja, Iraq, March 1988 206 CBRD Final Thoughts units. In addition, they provided decontamination and casualty-handling training to fleet physicians and corpsmen. To determine the threat to personnel once a ship was exposed to CW agents, NSWCDD con-ducted extensive research and testing to determine how long agents would remain on shipboard deck surfaces and how effectively the wash-down coun-termeasure system would remove the agents. The compilation of all this information under various environmental conditions led to the publication of the Chemical Hazard Assessment Guide, which was disseminated to the fleet to aid them in conducting risk assessments. Fortunately, the Iraqis did not use any CB weapons against coalition forces; however, the les-sons learned during Operation Desert Shield/Des-ert Storm would impact the management of CBD research, development, and acquisition. Based on some of the lessons learned, Congress passed Pub-lic Law 103-160 in 1994. This law mandated that the CBD efforts of all the Services be consolidated in a single program managed under OSD. While NSWCDD had collaborated across the Services prior to this, the implementation of the law for - malized the means of collaboration. The Joint Ser - vice Materiel Development Group (JSMG) was established as the organization responsible for de-veloping and acquiring CBD equipment for all the Services. Each Service had representatives in the JSMG. NSWCDD was selected to hold two of the key positions: 1. Th e Commodity Area Manager (CAM) for Collective Protection 2. Th e CAM for Battle Management, and Mod- eling and Simulation (M&S) In addition to holding the CAM positions, NSWCDD represented the Navy on the joint Ser - vice acquisition programs and was selected to lead the ARTEMIS active standoff detection system pro-gram. The organization expanded to address the increase in workload, including new work in mod-eling, threat analysis, and decision aid development. 2000-2004 The collateral benefits of the collective protec- tion were seen in the October 2000 terrorist attack on USS Cole (DDG 67) in the Port of Aden, Y e- men. Seventeen of our Sailors were killed in this attack, and had it not been for the bravery and he-roic deeds of the crew, the ship would most like-ly have sunk. Although not a CB attack, the CPS nevertheless performed as designed and continued to provide clean filtered air to the interior of the ship where the Sailors, who were fighting for their ship's survival, could receive respite from the nox-ious fumes and resultant hazardous contaminants. The terrorist attacks in 2001 on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, as well as the an-thrax attacks, brought renewed focus on CBR defense. NSWCDD was once again called on to ex-peditiously address CBR defense shortfalls in the fleet. NSWCDD managed the procurement of CBR defense items across all commodities, including both medical and nonmedical items to ensure that our Sailors deploying to the Gulf were adequate-ly prepared to defend themselves against a CBR at-tack. Dahlgren engineers were also called upon to support the newly formed Pentagon Force Protec-tion Agency and helped design and install CBD systems throughout the Pentagon to ensure conti-nuity of operations in the event of another attack. As part of this work, Dahlgren engineers and sci-entists were involved in a project that completely upgraded the Pentagon mailroom. During the same time period, NSWCDD was also erecting a new facility to house the Center's CBR defense workforce. The Herbert H. Bateman Chemical Biological Defense Center was ded-icated by Navy officials on 22 August 2002. This facility provided the organization with a state-of-the-art research and development facility to con-tinue the research and development of new and novel technologies, methods, and equipment to protect our Sailors. In 2003, the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) was established, replacing the JSMG organization. The Navy filled two of the original seven chartered Joint Program Manager (JPM) positions: 1. JPM f or Collective Protection (JPM-ColPro) 2. JPM f or Information Systems (JPM-IS) NSWCDD was established as the office for the JPM-ColPro, while JPM-IS established its office at SPAW AR in San Diego, California. Because of the uniqueness of the naval and maritime environ-ment, NSWCDD provides support to all the JPMs, as well as to JPEO-CBD headquarters. 2004-Present In 2005, the Base Realignment and Clo- sure (BRAC) commission recommended mov- ing NSWCDD's CB research and development work to Edgewood Chemical Biological Center in Edgewood, Maryland (near the Aberdeen Prov-ing Ground). This was a challenging time for the CBR Defense Division. Because most of the Divi-sion's employees were longtime Dahlgren area res-idents, with children in schools and involvement in the local communities, many of the employees 207 NSWCDD's Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense (CBRD) Role - Past, Present, and Futurelooked for and got opportunities in other areas at Dahlgren (as many had done almost 20 years ear - lier with the \"Panic of 86\"). Before long, the Di-vision had lost about 30 percent of its employees. The good news is that the BRAC decision was overturned, and the DoD decided to keep the ca-pability at Dahlgren. This decision was primari-ly based on two factors. First, it was decided that the Navy was indeed unique, and due to the high quality and quantity of sup-port that NSWCDD provides to the fleet, it was the right place to perform this work in support to the warfighter. Sec-ondly, JPEO-CBD was intent on having an organization that was truly joint with represen-tation from all Services, and NSWCDD was the recognized lead for Navy CBR defense. The period of 2006 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and growth: rebuilding to replace the many high-quality in-dividuals who left after the initial BRAC decision was made and growth to handle the new work that came from a variety of areas, as potential sponsors saw the value of not only the qualified people in the CBR Defense Division, but the technical strength of NSWCDD as well. It was also during this time frame that NSWC, Crane, as part of its sunset strategy, decided to fo-cus on only a few major areas and divest itself of other work. One of these divestitures was the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) CB Detection work. NSWCDD is a research, development, test, and evaluation institution, and as such, the focus is not usually on the ISEA component. However, there were three reasons why this work eventually came to NSWCDD: First and foremost, the warfighter needed to have the work done. Second, the sponsor\u2014the Naval Sea Systems Command's (NAVSEA 's) SEA 05P14\u2014saw NSWCDD as the place to send this work. This decision came after conducting a LEAN val-ue stream analysis, several resultant rapid im-provement events, and several \"Just Do Its. \" Third, the decision was in sync with the Asymmetric Defense Systems Department and the CBR Defense Division's vision of making NSWCDD a Navy Center of Excel-lence for CBR defense. The transition was not without its challeng- es, but with a supporting command, dedicated personnel, and the outstanding leadership at the branch and programmatic levels, the work for the fleet continued and thrived. One of the main impacts to the Division is the increased focus on providing relevant and timely support to the Sailor at the waterfront. To improve support to the fleet, the CBR Defense Division es-tablished locations on the waterfront: first in Nor - folk, Virginia, and then in San Diego, California. (More comprehensive coverage of NSWCDD's wa- terfront support can be found in this issue's Haymes article, \"Sustaining the Navy's Chem-ical and Biological Detection Capability, \" and in the Lalonde and Roller article, \"CBRD Wa-terfront Team Improves Fleet Readiness. \") Suffice it to say that this focus on the fleet has been a huge success for the war fig hter, as every Com- manding Officer deploys with a complete knowledge of their CBR state of readi-ness, and fleet issues and concerns are fed back into research and development areas that can find fixes and improvements. Present Products, Capabilities, and Fleet Support Services The CBR Defense Division is a Navy organi- zation supporting the NAVSEA technical warrant holder in SEA 05P14 and providing CBR defense products, services, and expertise to the Navy, the DoD, and the nation in the areas of collective pro-tection, detection, decontamination, M&S, systems engineering, and S&T. The CBR Defense Division consists of over 175 talented government and con-tractor professionals with various education and experiential backgrounds, outstanding reputations at the national and international level, and a sense Mission Serve DoD and the nation as the Navy organization providing innovative, timely, and effective products, technical solutions, and expertise in chemical, biological, and radiological defense (CBRD) Facilities State-of-the-art laboratory and equipment housed in a new 54,000-ft 2 building.

The Division collaborates with the other warfare centers performing CBR work as part of the seamless warfare enterprise. Occupying a state-of-the-art research and de- velopment facility, the Division combines a strong systems engineering approach, technical compe-tence, extensive experience, modern laboratories, and a continuous-improvement attitude, with ex-tensive collaborative relationships with other Ser - vices, government, industry, and academia in order to deliver world-class, full-spectrum CBR defense solutions for the fleet, warfighters, key national assets, operational facilities, and military installations. The Division's strong S&T base ensures that new ideas are continuously being created, and that the most promising ideas are being matured into affordable technologies that can be integrated into CBR defense solutions of the future. Division per - sonnel brief their work at symposiums, confer - ences, and seminars, and learn about work being performed by other organizations. By staying on the leading edge of S&T, they can leverage the latest technologies to enhance the effectiveness and af-fordability of CBR defense solutions. See this issue's Research, Applied Science, and Testing Capabili-ties section for examples of the Division's ongoing S&T efforts. With a presence in Norfolk and San Diego, the NSWCDD CBR defense waterfront support team maintains daily, direct contact with the fleet on both the East and West coasts. This direct and ac-tive connection with the fleet helps the warfight-er and provides a wealth of valuable information for our scientists and engineers in the laboratory. This knowledge is immediately put to use as they work to create, develop, and provide updates and future solutions for our men and women in uni-form. The Readiness Assist Visit (RAV) compo-nent of the waterfront support team\u2014again, read details in Lalonde and Roller's \"CBRD Waterfront Team Improves Fleet Readiness\" article in this is - sue\u2014ensures that our ships deploy at the highest state of CBRD readiness (see RAV Feedback Re-port summary slide in Figure 3). The CBR Defense Division continues to be an integral member of the joint Service CBD commu-nity and supports key CBR defense initiatives. The Division's inherent understanding of what it takes to design and field CBR defense systems that will reliably operate in a maritime environment has helped ensure that the Navy gets the right products and services at the right time and at the right cost. The Division also uses this understanding to en-sure that the joint Service programs adequately ad-dress Navy requirements in the design of new CBR defense equipment. NSWCDD's CBR Defense Division collaborates with and supports other DoD agencies, such as the: Missile Defense Agency Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Defense Threat Reduction Agency NSWCDD's increasing national reputation in several areas of CBR defense has expanded the Di-vision's support in the national needs areas through support of other federal government agencies, such as the Coast Guard and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In ad-dition, subject matter expertise is pro-vided to local governments in support of Homeland Defense initiatives. For ex-ample, when the New Y ork City Fire De-partment (NYFD) wanted to build a new fireboat that was prepared to deal with a CB threatened or contaminated environ-ment, they came to NSWCDD for the CBR defense expertise. NYFD Fireboat Three Forty Three was recently commis-sioned and is fully prepared to deal with the CB threat. Future of NSWCDD's Role in Naval CBR Defense There will be many challenges and opportunities for the Division as the CBR defense threat continues to evolve. As such, NSWCDD will be required to ad-dress these evolving threats and ensure 209 NSWCDD's Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Defense (CBRD) Role - Past, Present, and Futurethat the Navy's unique considerations and needs are addressed and continuously met through dem-onstrating adaptability to change and responsive-ness to the fleet, as well as by applying creativity and technical expertise. The CBR Defense Division is adapting to the changes that are ongoing with the JPEO-CBD reorganization in response to new direction coming from the White House. There is more focus on medical initiatives as evidenced by the new JPM Transformational Medical Technolo-gies Initiative and the start of the Medical Coun-termeasures Initiative. The CBR Defense Division is aligning itself to support these efforts while re-maining responsive to the fleet's current needs. For example, in March 2011, NSWCDD responded to fleet requests for support as Japanese nuclear pow-er plants that were hit by a powerful tsunami were leaking radiation. The adaptability, responsiveness, creativity, and technical expertise of the naval CBR defense community will ensure that the Navy can be involved in cutting-edge products to support the fleet. Examples of these kinds of projects include: Integrated prediction models and warning systems to provide real-time warfighter de-cision support, prediction and tracking tools for CBR events, and a common operational picture for the warfighter that is integrated and seamless with other systems Improved decontamination with the creation of all-in-one decontamination products, de-contamination of threat clouds, verification that decontamination has occurred, and se-lection of the right decontaminant for the agent or toxin used Better biological and chemical standoff de-tection capability that can operate effectively in the harsh maritime environment More capable filtration systems that are lighter and smaller, last longer, and are more effective than current filters Increased use of systems engineering prin-ciples and practices to ensure that CBR de-fense is properly integrated into complex naval systems Expanded roles and responsibilities for our waterfront support team Increased collaborative relationships with government, industry, and academia Pioneering S&T efforts geared towards pro-viding highly adaptive solutions that are not only evolutionary, but revolutionary Defense funding levels and expenditures have come under intense scrutiny. All Defense orga-nizations are looking for ways to increase effi-ciencies. Fewer dollars for invention purposes demands more focus on innovation. The ability to look at how existing technologies can be used in a different way to solve a complex problem is how successful organizations will thrive in the next de-cade. This holds especially true in the area of CBR defense. Perhaps the next great \"all-in-one\" de-contaminant already exists and needs only slight modification to be used on the battlefield or on board ship. Innovation, not invention, may sup-ply the answers to some of our most vexing prob-lems and challenges. As new technologies are introduced, NSWCDD will be expected to play an integral role in assuring that the technologies per - form as promised and are integrated across multi-ple systems and platforms. NSWCDD's CBR Defense Division is poised to address the future's challenges and ensure that our Sailors can fight, win, and survive in a CBR-threatened or -contaminated environment. Suc-cess will be measured by the state of the Navy's CBR defense readiness, the confidence that the Sailors have in our detection, M&S, protection and decontamination systems, and the ability to treat any CBR attack or accident as a nuisance rather than as an ordeal. The Division's expertise, facilities, and strong fleet interaction will ensure this success.
