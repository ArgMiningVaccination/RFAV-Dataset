(July 9, 2020) - Kymera Therapeutics Inc. today announced the company has entered into a multi-program strategic collaboration with Sanofi (NASDQ: SNY) to develop and commercialize first-in-class protein degrader therapies targeting IRAK4 in patients with immune-inflammatory diseases. The companies will also partner on a second earlier stage program. Kymera will receive $150 million in cash upfront and may receive more than $2 billion in potential development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as significant royalty payments. Kymera retains the option to participate in US development and commercialization for both programs. This includes the ability to participate equally in the costs, profits and losses after opt-in, and to co-promote partnered products in the US. \"This is an important collaboration for both companies and for the field of targeted protein degradation,\" said Nello Mainolfi, Ph.D., co-founder, President and CEO of Kymera Therapeutics. \"Kymera is becoming a fully integrated biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of novel therapies with the potential to transform treatment paradigms. We are excited to partner with Sanofi, an organization with world-class drug development and commercialization capabilities, to ensure maximal patient impact from two of our programs across multiple disease indications, while enabling Kymera to invest in key strategic areas to realize the broad potential of protein degrader therapies.\" Under terms of the collaboration, Sanofi will make an upfront payment of $150 million in cash to Kymera for global rights to develop its small molecule IRAK4 protein degraders in inflammation and immunology indications, and a second earlier stage undisclosed program. IRAK4 is believed to play a key role in multiple immune-inflammatory diseases, including hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Kymera will IRAK4 program through Phase 1 clinical trials; Sanofi will assume clinical development and commercialization responsibilities thereafter. Sanofi will lead all clinical development activities for the second program. Kymera will have the option to participate in the development of both programs in the US during clinical development. Kymera will retain global rights to its IRAK4 program in oncology indications. IRAK4 is a key protein involved in inflammation mediated by the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). While TLR and IL-1R signaling via IRAK4 is involved in the normal immune response, aberrant activation of these pathways is the underlying cause of multiple immune-inflammatory conditions. In pre-clinical studies, Kymera has shown oral daily administration of an IRAK4 degrader can lead to complete knockdown of IRAK4 in skin and immune cells in higher species and is well tolerated. Data presented at the most recent annual meetings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation showed potent anti- inflammatory activity in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models.\" \"Targeted protein degrada on is an exci ng modality. Kymera has developed an incredible drug discovery engine producing protein degraders with compelling and dieren ated pharmacology against targets that, to date, have not been op mally addressed with other therapeu c modali es,\" said John Reed, Global Head of Research & Development at Sano. \"We are excited to partner with the Kymera team to advance a new genera on of rst-in-class therapies with the poten al to eliminate underlying drivers of disease.\" Aquilo Partners, L.P. acted as Financial advisor to Kymera on this transac on. # # # About Kymera Therapeutics Kymera Therapeutics is a biotechnology company pioneering a transformative new approach to treating previously untreatable diseases.

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions, statements regarding plans, objectives, intentions and expectations with respect to future financial results, events, operations, services, product development and potential, and statements regarding future performance. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"plans\" and similar expressions. Although Sanofi's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward- looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi, that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, future clinical data and analysis, including post marketing, decisions by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or the EMA, regarding whether and when to approve any drug, device or biological application that may be filed for any such product candidates as well as their decisions regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of such product candidates, the absence of guarantee that the product candidates if approved will be commercially successful, the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives, Sanofi's ability to benefit from external growth opportunities, to complete related transactions and/or obtain regulatory clearances, risks associated with intellectual property and any related pending or future litigation and the ultimate outcome of such litigation, trends in exchange rates and prevailing interest rates, volatile economic conditions, the impact of cost containment initiatives and subsequent changes thereto, the average number of shares outstanding as well as those discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi, including those listed under \"Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in Sanofi's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018. Other than as required by applicable law, Sanofi does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements. Without clinical trials, new medicine may never make it from the research lab to patients in need. These carefully designed studies can provide important data that include proper dosage, benefit to patients, and potential side effects. There is a growing challenge, however, in finding appropriate participants, especially for treatments that target highly specific conditions affecting narrower patient populations. Right now, there are more than 40,000 clinical studies recruiting patients in the U.S. alone, with some requiring thousands of participants, each of whom must meet precise criteria to join. So it's not surprising that 80% of these important studies are delayed due to recruitment problems, according to a study by the [Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation ](https://www.ciscrp.org/)(CISCRP). Unfortunately, those delays mean it can take longer for innovative new medicines to be studied and approved, leaving patients to wait years for new treatment options. To tackle this growing problem, Sanofi is taking a digital approach to clinical trials, partnering with [Science 37, ](https://www.science37.com/#reach)a clinical research services and technology company based in California. Leveraging mobile technology and telemedicine capabilities, this new approach will allow Sanofi to develop \"site-less\" or decentralized clinical trials that are more patient friendly: easier for them to access, and eliminating many of the common impediments to participation. Using digital technologies to streamline finding and retaining participants for the entire length of a study has the potential to reduce the time required for a typical trial by at least 30%, according to Science 37. \"After years invested in the lab on an innovative treatment, the clinical trials are where we finally obtain and analyze the relevant data that will let us understand how well a new treatment will benefit patients,\" said Lionel Bascles, Global Head of Clinical Sciences and Operations of Sanofi. \"With digital clinical trials we can get and analyze the data on how a new medicine works in the real world a lot sooner, which means patients get the medicines they need sooner.\" Going digital also eliminates a number of other hurdles to patient participation, including the most significant: geography. Most people are eager to participate in relevant trials - 87% of patients want to do so, the CISCRP study found. Yet, 70% of potential participants live more than two hours away from the nearest study center. Because most clinical trials require patients to travel to those centers for regular tests and observations, sometimes several times each week for the duration of the trial, this distance is another challenge to patient access. Science 37's approach allows patients to be monitored and report to researchers via an Apple iPhone equipped with the company's NORA\u00ae technology. Qualified study participants are provided with the phone, a data plan and any other sensors or connected devices needed for the trial, along with the medicines being researched. Participants can reach study staff at any time via the mobile device, while also remaining under the care of their local health care professionals. Mobile nurses are also sent to the participant's home to provide services like blood draws when needed, and nearby hospitals or clinics are engaged for scans or other tests that require specialized equipment. The patient's data are sent securely to researchers who can immediately access information that would otherwise have to be collected by medical personnel through face-to-face interactions at study centers. This platform can also remind patients to take their study medications at the proper time, and let researchers know if participants are adhering to the study requirements. \"Our decentralized clinical trial model addresses critical shortcomings of traditional clinical trials, such as enrolling and retaining appropriate patients. Whether you live near a major research institution, or in a remote area, we make participation possible,\" said Noah Craft, CEO of Science 37. \"By utilizing a patient's home in lieu of a physical trial site, we remove the burden of travel for those too sick or remote and provide access to qualified individuals who want to volunteer for a study but cannot because of geographic limitations.\" The Science 37 platform will also help engage patients who would normally not participate in clinical trials, \"so our data will much more closely track the diversity of the population,\" Bascles said. \"In addition to reducing the burden for patients, decentralized clinical trials are far more likely to keep patients engaged for the full length of the trial, increasing the relevance and the acceptability of the data by regulators.\" Sanofi's agreement with Science 37 covers use of its Metasite model and NORA technology across the U.S. with plans to expand internationally in the future. By eliminating months of searching for patients and long travel time to study sites, virtual clinical trials could reduce total trial time by as much as two years. Partnering with Science 37 is the most recent strengthening of the relationship with Sanofi, which began last October when Sanofi's venture capital fund, [Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures, ](http://www.sanofigenzymebioventures.com/)made a minority investment in Science 37. \"Science 37 has a great track record, and they are smart and forward-thinking about developing the science around clinical trials that leverage digital technologies,\" said Heather Bell, Global Head of Digital and Analytics for Sanofi. \"As part of the scope of our digital strategy, we have expanded the scope of the venture fund to include digital investments, and Science 37 was our first investment since that change and we're very excited about it.\" SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO - October 16, 2014 Immune Design Corp. (NASDAQ: IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company, today announced that it has entered into a broad collaboration for the development of a herpes simplex virus (HSV) immune therapy with Sanofi Pasteur, (EURONEXT: SAN and NYSE: [SNY](http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&Ticker=SNY)). Sanofi Pasteur and Immune Design will each contribute product candidates to the collaboration: Sanofi Pasteur will contribute HSV-529, a clinical-stage replication-defective HSV vaccine product candidate, and Immune Design will contribute G103, its preclinical trivalent vaccine product candidate. The collaboration will explore the potential of various combinations of agents, including leveraging Immune Design's GLAASTM platform, with the goal to select the best potential immune therapy for patients. The two companies will develop the products jointly through Phase 2 clinical trials, at which point Sanofi Pasteur intends to continue development of the most promising candidate and be responsible for commercialization. Sanofi Pasteur will bear the costs of all preclinical and clinical development, with Immune Design providing a specific formulation of GLA from the GLAAS platform at its cost through Phase 2 studies. Immune Design will be eligible to receive future milestone and royalty payments on any product developed from the collaboration; other financial terms of the agreement have not been disclosed. \"Instead of being limited to a single approach, the companies are joining forces and combining multiple cutting-edge technologies with the goal to develop the most effective and safe immunotherapy to address HSV infection, a significant unmet medical need,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"With other clinical and preclinical GLAAS-based product candidates in development, both with partners and internally at Immune Design, I believe this new collaboration continues to demonstrate the productivity and broad applicability of this platform.\" About G103 and GLAAS G103 is a trivalent vaccine candidate consisting of recombinantly-expressed viral proteins adjuvanted with a specific formulation from Immune Design's GLAAS platform. The combination of a novel molecular toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist with rationally selected antigens is designed to boost pre-existing T cells and trigger a broad antibody response, allowing for prophylactic and therapeutic immunization. The GLAAS platform works in vivo and is based on a small synthetic molecule called GLA, which stands for glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant. GLA selectively binds to the TLR4 receptor and causes potent activation of dendritic cells (DCs) leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines that drive a Th1-type immune response. When GLA is accompanied by an antigen and injected into a patient, the combination is taken up by DCs and leads to the production and expansion of immune cells called CD4 T helper lymphocytes with a Th1 phenotype. These CD4 T cells play a key role in boosting pre-existing cytotoxic T cells that are specific to the same antigen; and providing help to other immune cells, including B lymphocytes that are the precursor to antibodies, and natural killer cells that are also important in the overall immune response. Immune Design believes that GLAAS- based product candidates have the potential to target multiple types of cancer, as well as infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases. Product candidates leveraging GLAAS' core technology have now been evaluated in over 1000 subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. About Immune Design Immune Design (NASDAQ: IMDZ) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next- generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to create and/or expand antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, while enhancing other immune effectors, to fight cancer and other chronic diseases. Immune Design's three on-going immuno-oncology clinical programs are the product of its two synergistic discovery platforms: ZVexTMand GLAASTM, the fundamental technologies of which were licensed from the California Institute of Technology and the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI), respectively.

The incidence of food allergies is increasing worldwide in both developed and undeveloped countries, and especially in children.1 Globally, experts believe 220-250 million people may suffer from food allergies.2,3 In the United States alone, as many as 15 million people have food allergies,4 with allergic reactions resulting in an emergency room visit every three minutes and averaging more than 200,000 emergency room visits per year.5 \"This is an exciting time in the area of immunology research, and our relationship with Immune Design is a great example of how Sanofi has changed our approach to R&D,\" said Kurt Stoeckli, vice president and head of Global Bio Therapeutics Organization, Sanofi. \"With this partnership, we are able to tap into breakthrough science that holds great potential to transform how food allergies are treated, and the lives of those people affected. This kind of innovation is central to our new approach.\" Under terms of the agreement, Immune Design has granted Sanofi an exclusive license to discover, develop and commercialize products to treat a selected food allergy. The company has received an undisclosed upfront payment and will be eligible to receive development and commercialization milestones totaling US $168 million, as well as tiered royalties on sales of approved products. \"Our fourth agreement for the use of the GLAAS platform further demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach not only in cancer and infectious diseases, but now in allergic diseases as well,\" said Stephen Brady, chief business officer at Immune Design. \"Due to the immune dysfunction leading to allergic diseases, GLAAS' mechanism of action is well suited to correct the imbalance, allowing for the potential of new therapeutics in the targeted indication that currently uses century-old technologies. We are pleased that Sanofi has decided to develop products for this often life-threatening and growing food allergy.\" Under an existing collaborative research arrangement, Sanofi and Immune Design have generated a large set of preclinical data demonstrating that certain formulations within GLAAS, when given prophylactically or therapeutically, can shift the immune responses in a way that may result in significant protection and reduction from allergy symptoms.

The analysis showed an average annual cost reduction of $6,280 per MS patient and $4,600 per epilepsy patient using Medisafe to manage their therapeutic regimen.These cost reductions - which represent significant savings for patients and reduction in burden on the entire healthcare system - derived from reduced utilization of costly care services as a result of better medication management. Specifically, by using the Medisafe app to digitally manage their medication: Patients with MS experienced a 34% reduction in total medical claims - including a 63% reduction in ER visits and 34% reduction in outpatient visits. Patients with epilepsy experienced a 28% reduction in total medical claims - including a 36% reduction in ER visits and a 45% reduction in ambulance visits. \"By providing a digital health tool that helps patients manage their therapeutic regimens, their care is more well-managed, they are more engaged and their healthcare costs are reduced. As a result, providers are likely to achieve better reimbursement, payers are likely to spend less on patient care, and pharma is likely to see higher prescription rates,\" said Omri Shor, Medisafe Chief Executive Officer and co-founder. \"This data both validates the role we are already playing in reducing the burden on the healthcare ecosystem, and reinforces our mission to expand that value to more patients over time.\" The total estimated economic burden of [MS](https://pr.report/I-Jb94jt) and [epilepsy](https://pr.report/GqAQlH-t) combined is $113.4B, attributable partially to preventable utilization of high-cost acute care. For example, seizures or epilepsy [account](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9153465/#:~:text=Seizures%20or%20epilepsy%20account%20for,COVID%2D19%20pandemic%20are%20limited.) for 1% of annual emergency room visits, which [averaged](https://pr.report/Iw7VApUE) $1,150 in 2020 - [10x the rate](https://www.debt.org/medical/emergency-room-urgent-care-costs/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAn%20ER%20visit%20often%20costs,Decent%2C%20a%20health%20benefits%20company.) of an urgent care or primary care provider (PCP). For patients with MS, the [average](https://pr.report/s1mB7Ahg) excess cost of 3+ relapses requiring hospitalization is $15,079. Additionally, research shows ambulance rides [average](https://www.fairhealth.org/article/fair-health-releases-study-on-ground-ambulance-services#:~:text=The%20average%20charge%20for%20BLS,%24522%20during%20the%20same%20period.) anywhere from $940 to $1,277 depending on the level of care needed and location - with some costing more and rising each year. The analysis was conducted over a 14-month period on claims data from Medisafe users identified through patient match data from [Komodo Health](https://pr.report/b1LKY0UO). Patients were first diagnosed between 1/1/21-1/1/22 and remained active on the Medisafe app into 2023.

Contact: SOURCE: Medisafe - loss of synaptic UNC13A function; UNC13A is an essential regulator of neurotransmitter release at synapses - UNC13A mis-splicing is critical genetic alteration in neurodegenerative diseases, occurring in 58 percent of all ALS patients and up to half of all frontotemporal dementia cases CAMBRIDGE, Mass., September 6, 2023 - QurAlis Corporation, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing breakthrough precision medicines for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases with genetically validated targets, today announced it will present preclinical data showing that TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) pathology drives loss of synaptic UNC13A function in neurodegenerative diseases including ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Data also showed that an UNC13A oligonucleotide prevented cryptic exon inclusion in UNC13A transcripts, increased UNC13A protein levels, and normalized localization of UNC13A protein at the synapse. \"UNC13A is a genetically validated target in ALS and FTD and our results showed that TDP-43 pathology drives loss of synaptic UNC13A function. At QurAlis, hypothesize that ameliorating UNC13A mis- splicing using a splice-switching ASO can alleviate symptoms of ALS, FTD, and ALS/FTD spectrum disorder associated with synaptic dysfunction that underlies clinical manifestation and disease progression,\" said Daniel Elbaum, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of QurAlis. \"We recently launched our newest program that targets UNC13A mis-splicing and look forward to advancing this program along with our other programs targeting neurodegenerative diseases so that we can make a real difference in patients' lives.\" QurAlis will present these data in a poster presentation at the 1st Biennial Conference on TDP-43 Function and Dysfunction in Disease in Trieste, Italy on Thursday, September 7, 2023. About UNC13A UNC13A is an essential regulator of neurotransmitter release at synapses. In ALS and FTD, the loss of TDP- 43 causes the mis-splicing of certain pre-mRNA transcripts resulting in expression of a cryptic exon- containing transcript that interferes with appropriate protein generation. An exon is a segment of a DNA or RNA molecule containing information coding for a protein or peptide sequence. UNC13A is one of a number of pre-mRNAs that becomes mis-spliced due to loss of TDP-43 in disease. Fifty-eight percent of ALS patients and up to half of FTD patients carry a single nuclear polymorphism in the UNC13A gene or show TDP-43 pathology which greatly exacerbates UNC13A mis-splicing leading to loss of function of the UNC13A protein. There are currently no cures for ALS or FTD. Limited therapeutic options are available for ALS and FTD patients who are in desperate need for effective therapies. Incorporating its proprietary FlexASOTM Splice Modulator protein production, and reduce cryptic exons that may contribute to disease progression. The QurAlis FlexASO Splice Modulator Platform was developed to generate splice-switching ASOs with improved potency and an increased therapeutic index. In addition to UNC13A, QurAlis is currently exploring this ASO technology for multiple other disease targets. About QurAlis Corporation QurAlis is trailblazing the path to conquering amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases with genetically validated targets with next-generation precision medicines. QurAlis' proprietary platforms and unique biomarkers enable the design and development of drugs that act directly on disease-causing genetic alterations.

New and existing investors also participated in the financing including RA Capital Management, Samsara BioCapital, Sanofi Ventures, New Leaf Ventures, Pontifax, funds managed by Tekla Capital Management, LLC, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Mass General Brigham Ventures, Eurofarma, and Soleus Capital. \"Support from such a strong group of investors will allow us to complete our development programs in diseases where there are few to no treatment options available,\" said Alex Martin, Chief Executive Officer of Abcuro. \"We are very motivated by the patients we serve and are excited by the clinical data we've seen to date. We're committed to executing on our clinical trials including our registrational trial in inclusion body myositis.\" Abcuro will use the proceeds from the financing to complete a Phase 2/3 registrational clinical trial evaluating ABC008, a first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting killer cell lectin like receptor G1 (KLRG1), for the treatment of inclusion body myositis (IBM). The Company will also focus on completing a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ABC008 in T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), as well as initiating a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in T and NK cell lymphomas. \"IBM, like other autoimmune diseases, is progressive and devastating for patients. Targeting the depletion of cytotoxic T cells that express KLRG1 with ABC008 is a novel approach that has generated exciting early data in patients with IBM,\" said H. Jeffrey Wilkins, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Abcuro. \"These data are also supportive of using ABC008 in other diseases like T-LGLL in which cytotoxic T cells are pathogenic, and mature T and NK cell lymphomas in which KLRG1 expressing cells are malignant. We look forward to further advancing these programs in the clinic.\" About KLRG1 Killer cell lectin like receptor G1 (KLRG1) is an immune checkpoint cell surface receptor selectively expressed on late-differentiated effector memory (TEM) and effector (TEMRA) T cells. In autoimmune disease, highly cytotoxic T cells that drive disease progression express KLRG1. Conversely, in cancer, tumor cells expressing ligands that bind to the KLRG1 receptor inhibit effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and downregulate anti-tumor immunity. KLRG1 is, therefore, a compelling target in immune modulation in both autoimmune diseases and cancer as it enables the precise targeting of clinically relevant cytotoxic T and NK cells, while sparing na\u00efve, central memory and regulatory T cells which are required to maintain normal immune system homeostasis. About ABC008 ABC008 is a first-in-class anti-KLRG1 antibody capable of selectively depleting highly cytotoxic T cells, while sparing na\u00efve, regulatory and central memory T cells. ABC008 has been designed to treat diseases mediated by highly cytotoxic T cells, including the autoimmune muscle disease inclusion body myositis (IBM), T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), and mature T cell malignancies. ABC008 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2/3 registrational trial for inclusion body myositis (IBM) and in a Phase 1/2 trial for T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted Orphan Designation to ABC008 for the treatment of IBM. About Abcuro Abcuro, based in Newton MA, is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing first-in-class immunotherapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer through precise modulation of highly cytotoxic T and NK cells. The company is conducting two clinical trials in rare diseases: a Phase 2/3 registrational trial evaluating ABC008 in inclusion body myositis (IBM,) and a Phase 1/2 trial evaluating ABC008 in T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.

The Omada for MSK program is designed to improve timely access to high-quality MSK care. In the U.S., MSK conditions affect more than one in two adults and cost our healthcare system over $380 billion\u2014more than diabetes, heart disease, or any other chronic condition. \"Earning this Telehealth Accreditation confirms that Omada Health is meeting the high clinical standards set by URAC,\" said Omada Health Chief Medical Officer Carolyn Jasik, MD. \"Achieving this status demonstrates our commitment to clinical best practices and patient safety. It also stakes our claim as the only provider in the digital MSK market that is able to pass this bar.\" [URAC](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.urac.org%2F&esheet=53495320&newsitemid=20230801433743&lan=en-US&anchor=URAC&index=2&md5=452756ce087f81fb1487a20c2b85bf47) is the independent leader in promoting health care quality by setting high standards for clinical practice, consumer protections, performance measurement, operations infrastructure and risk management. \"Organizations that earn a Telehealth Accreditation demonstrate that they are operating at the highest standards possible in this continuously growing area of care delivery,\" said URAC President and CEO Shawn Griffin, MD. \"URAC's Telehealth Accreditation shows Omada Health's excellence at the important intersection of clinical best practices and technological safety and security.\" Many competing digital MSK care products are positioned as \"preventive\" or \"consumer wellness programs,\" as opposed to true clinical solutions. They often utilize remote monitoring with limited or no direct patient to physical therapist care. Omada for MSK, on the other hand, offers members end-to-end tele-physical therapy with licensed physical therapists; members can expect to meet directly with a licensed physical therapist for a telehealth visit within two days of signing up. Omada for MSK, like Omada's other programs, integrates high-quality, proactive behavioral health support. Omada's licensed physical therapists consult with behavioral health specialists to help address behavioral health comorbidities that pose a significant risk to people dealing with MSK disorders. In fact, 17.8% of patients with MSK disorders also reported comorbid anxiety, while 11.5% reported depression. Addressing these issues together can drive cost savings of $460 per member per month. \"As a pioneer in the digital health provider industry, Omada continues to set high clinical standards in digital health care quality, safety, and accountability,\" said Drew Contreras, PT, DPT, American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) vice president of clinical integration and innovation. \"Obtaining clinically sound accreditations such as URAC's Telehealth accreditation is in line with APTA's longtime commitment to promoting digital health transparency,\" Contreras added. After earning URAC accreditation, Omada now holds a growing roster of nationally recognized accreditations and certifications across their diverse and complementary healthcare services. In 2021, Omada became the first fully-virtual healthcare provider to earn the [National Committee for Quality Assurance](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncqa.org%2F&esheet=53495320&newsitemid=20230801433743&lan=en-US&anchor=National+Committee+for+Quality+Assurance&index=3&md5=83bcff2d7f44b89f87d3830a59935560)'s (NCQA) Population Health Program (PHP) Accreditation.

Contacts | | | | BOSTON, MA, July 11, 2023 - NodThera, a leading clinical-stage biotech developing brain-penetrant NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, today announces positive, initial data from four subjects in the elderly volunteer stage of its Phase Ib/IIa study evaluating the effects of its lead candidate NT-0796 on inflammatory and disease-specific biomarkers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Alan Watt, Chief Executive Officer of NodThera, said: \"Taken together, these initial findings represent the first unambiguous demonstration of modulation of neuroinflammation in a human population with an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. In designing our Parkinson's disease study, we deliberately chose to measure the effects of NT-0796 in an elderly volunteer population as the first stage, since age is a clear factor in increased neuroinflammation. \"Demonstrating such rapid decreases in just 7 days, across a broad range of neuroinflammatory biomarkers in the CSF, particularly NfL, is a striking result, as other drugs have required an extended timeframe of months or even years to show reduction of this biomarker. Our data provide clear validation of our strategy to take highly differentiated brain penetrant molecules into the clinic and justify our confidence in the potential of NT-0796 to treat diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.\" Professor Paul Matthews, Head of the Department of Brain Sciences in the Faculty of Medicine of Imperial College London, said: \"These data, while still very preliminary, provide promising evidence of the potential of NLRP3 inhibition to modulate the neuroinflammation associated with Parkinson's disease. This is an exciting area. Development of molecules based on this concept could lead to a step change in the treatment landscape for neurodegenerative diseases more generally.\" Significant anti-inflammatory effects in both plasma and CSF Initial data from the ongoing study confirm earlier findings from the completed first-in-human and preclinical studies with NT-0796 showing excellent pharmacokinetics with a novel capsule formulation. Subjects in the study were cannulated and CSF-sampled on Day 1 (pre-dose) and Day 7 following daily NT-0796 dosing. CSF drug levels were confirmed as consistent with previous observations and a range of inflammatory CSF biomarkers demonstrated meaningful reductions. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), exclusively synthesised in the central nervous system (CNS), decreased by approximately 25% over 7 days in the most inflamed subject and by 13% on average. NfL is now recognised by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a key biomarker of neuroaxonal damage and neurodegeneration. A full panel of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules known to be associated with neuroinflammation were determined in the CSF, with the most inflamed individuals again demonstrating the most robust reductions. As previously observed, the most inflamed subjects at baseline showed the largest decreases in key peripheral inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen. Consistent reductions in circulating levels of unstimulated IL-1, IL-18 and TNF were also seen in subjects on Day 7 compared to Day 1.

The trial is taking place at CEVAC (Centre for Vaccinology), Ghent University, Belgium. GBS is most commonly associated with pregnant women and newborn babies. However, invasive GBS disease infections in the elderly population are continuously increasing. These can have devastating consequences - particularly if the person has a serious health condition such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, or a suppressed immune system. To tackle this issue MinervaX has expanded the development pipeline of its novel GBS vaccine to include older adults, addressing the global burden and urgent need for the development of a vaccine to prevent and reduce deaths associated with GBS across the population. In pregnant women. MinervaX is currently progressing two Phase II clinical vaccine trials for the prevention of life-threatening infections in newborns. The trials are demonstrating that the vaccine has an acceptable safety profile, is highly immunogenic and gives rise to functionally active antibodies. In April 2023, the Company commenced enrolment for its Phase I clinical vaccine trial in older adults. Enrolment and administration of the first dose to all participants is now complete. Details of MinervaX's ongoing clinical trials can be found at clinicaltrials.gov under the identifiers NCT04596878, NCT05154578 and NCT05782179. The Phase I vaccine trial will investigate the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity in both healthy older adults and older adults with underlying medical conditions, i.e., diabetes and/or obesity, in an age range of 55 to 75. Two dose levels are being investigated: a lower dose level of 50 g of fusion protein, which is also used in MinervaX's two Phase II clinical trials in pregnant women, as well as a higher dose level of 125 g of fusion protein. In addition, all older adult participants will receive three doses of the vaccine. The administration of one more jab than in the Phase II clinical vaccine trial in pregnant women, as well as the investigation of a higher dose level, takes into account that older adults - especially those with comorbidities, tend to exhibit weaker immune responses. All participants have now received one dose and further dosing is progressing smoothly with first immunological read-outs anticipated in Q4, 2023. Lidia Oostvogels, Chief Medical Officer of MinervaX, said: \"The smooth completion of enrolment and dose escalation provides an indication of the overall acceptable reactogenicity profile of our novel GBS vaccine and replicates the findings in our two ongoing Phase II trials in pregnant women. This allows us to accelerate the development of this potentially lifesaving vaccine to address the global unmet medical need. I would like to thank the participants of the trial and the team at CEVAC who is being instrumental throughout the trial, and I look forward to providing initial results in Q4, 2023.\" Prof. Isabel Leroux-Roels, Principal Investigator at CEVAC, commented: \"We at CEVAC are very pleased to be contributing to this Phase I trial against this severe disease. Recruiting the many volunteers for this hugely important trial is a step forward to demonstrate that MinervaX's novel vaccine works. We are very grateful to all the volunteers involved in the trial and will be following up with each participant accordingly. We are excited to see the data reported later this year.\" For further information please contact: MinervaX Per Fischer | Chief Executive Officer Email: pbf@minervax.com Optimum Strategic Communications Mary Clark / Stephen Adams/ Bolt Email: minervax@optimumcomms.com Tel: About MinervaX MinervaX is a Danish biotechnology company, established in 2010 to develop a prophylactic vaccine against Group B Streptococcus (GBS), based on research from Lund University. MinervaX is developing a GBS vaccine for maternal immunization, and now also for vaccination of older adults, likely to have superior characteristics compared with other GBS vaccine candidates in development. The latter are based on traditional capsular polysaccharide (CPS) conjugate technology. By contrast, MinervaX's vaccine is a protein- only vaccine based on fusions of highly immunogenic and protective protein domains from selected surface proteins of GBS (the Alpha-like protein family). Given the broad distribution of proteins contained in the vaccine on GBS strains globally, it is expected that MinervaX's vaccine will confer protection against virtually 100% of all GBS isolates. [www.minervax.com](http://www.minervax.com) About Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Streptococcus agalactiae or Lancefield's Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common commensal in humans, approximately 25% of all adults will be colonised with GBS at any given time. Invasive GBS disease is normally associated with infection in pregnant women and new-born babies; however, invasive GBS disease in adults has been increasing over the last 40 years. The older adult population (>65 years of age) and adults with underlying chronic health conditions (diabetes mellitus, cancer, immune suppression, obesity) are at particular risk of invasive GBS disease. Group B Streptococcus disease in non-pregnant adults causes secondary and primary bacteraemia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, prosthetic joint infection, and necrotising myositis and fasciitis. It is apparent that outside of pregnancy and the neonatal period, GBS infection results in high morbidity and mortality rates. There is no preventative treatment, cases are managed with antibiotics when an infection is diagnosed. There is a clear unmet medical need for a preventative vaccine that could provide protection to all adults but particularly to the older adult population or those at risk of infection due to underlying medical or demographic conditions. In addition, the incidence is increasing and will probably continue to increase with an increasing older adult population and an increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes around the world. - Collaboration will leverage Unlearn's AI-powered digital twins in QurAlis' clinical trials for their leading ALS therapies CAMBRIDGE, Mass., and SAN FRANCISCO - June 27, 2023 - [QurAlis Corporation](https://quralis.com/), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing breakthrough precision medicines for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases with genetically validated targets, and [Unlearn](https://www.unlearn.ai/), a pioneering technology company innovating machine learning to revolutionize medical research, today announced they have entered into a collaboration to accelerate and optimize QurAlis' clinical program in ALS with Unlearn's advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

In the studies, both candidates were shown to clearly inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, a highly validated drug target that plays a pivotal role in controlling inflammatory diseases. The differentiated design characteristics of each candidate enabled them to penetrate different areas of the brain for optimal drug distribution in a range of NLRP3-driven diseases. Brain penetration and anti-inflammatory effects across both clinical programmes Data from the recently completed multiple-ascending dose (MAD) cohorts of NT-0249's first-in-human study confirm a for once-daily dosing. NT-0249 demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in healthy volunteers, with reductions in key inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and maintained fibrinogen, that were throughout treatment. Levels of NT-0249 measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) additionally demonstrated high levels of brain penetration. Findings from the completed first-in-human study of NT-0796, initially disclosed in September 2022, also confirm an excellent PK/PD profile, brain penetration and anti-inflammatory effects in healthy volunteers. Both candidates were well tolerated, treatment emergent effects were predominantly mild and there were no serious adverse events (SAEs). Priority development programme underway in Parkinson's disease Development of NT-0796 is now progressing in a pioneering, biomarker-rich Phase Ib/IIa study in Parkinson's disease. The study is exploring the candidate's effect on inflammatory and disease-specific biomarkers in the blood and CSF using an innovative clinical biomarker panel, designed using the preclinical profile of NT-0796 on cytokines, chemokines and markers of microgliosis and astrogliosis relevant to NLRP3 inhibition. The initial stage of the study, in healthy, elderly volunteers, is already underway, investigating a modified formulation of the drug candidate designed for use in the upcoming patient arm of the study. Alan Watt, Chief Executive Officer of NodThera, said: \"As the burden of non-communicable diseases continues to rise globally, targeting chronic low-grade inflammation, through selective modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, holds enormous potential for the treatment of these diseases. Our strategy to design highly differentiated and brain penetrant molecules, which is delivering on the promise that NLRP3 inflammasome modulation can change the treatment paradigm for chronic peripheral and neurodegenerative diseases.

Data from two of QurAlis' FlexASO programs targeting rescue of STATHMIN-2 (STMN2) and UNC13A showed up to three-fold improvement over standard ASOs in both potency and biodistribution, and significantly reduced off-target effects, often from approximately 50 to 0, in human motor neurons. In addition, QurAlis' FlexASOs were not associated with cytokine or chemokine production. Observations from both programs therefore indicate that FlexASOTM technology results in a higher therapeutic index than observed with traditional ASO. \"QurAlis' FlexASO platform is based on unique and novel insights. We designed the platform to improve ASO performance, correct mis-splicing, and optimize distribution to deeper brain regions with the goal of identifying novel precision-medicine candidates for serious neurodegenerative diseases like sporadic ALS and frontotemporal dementia,\" said Kasper Roet, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of QurAlis. \"These new preclinical data showed that our ASOs targeting restoration of STMN2 and UNC13A exhibited significantly higher potency, greater biodistribution, and reduced off-target activity over standard ASOs. We are excited by these promising data and look forward to continue advancing our programs so that we can fulfill our mission of bringing transformative disease-modifying therapies to patients with significant neurodegenerative diseases in desperate need of options.\" QurAlis will present these data in an oral presentation at the 3rd Annual Oligonucleotides for CNS Summit being held June 7-8, 2023 in Boston, MA. Daniel Elbaum, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of QurAlis, will present on June 8, 2023 at 8:00 AM ET, in a talk entitled, \"Recent Advances in the Development of Splice Diseases.\" The generate splice-switching ASOs with improved potency and an increased therapeutic index. In addition to STMN2 and UNC13A, QurAlis is currently exploring this ASO technology for multiple other disease targets. About STATHMIN-2, TDP-43, and UNC13A STATHMIN-2 (STMN2) is a well-validated protein important for neural repair and axonal stability, the expression of which is significantly decreased in nearly all ALS patients. Also known as SCG-10, STMN2 is a protein essential for the stabilization of microtubules which form an important component of the cytoskeleton of cells and axons. STMN2 is highly expressed in human motor neurons, the cells that primarily degenerate in patients suffering from ALS. In animal models, STMN2 deletion was found to cause axonal degeneration and loss of muscle innervation, which is the primary functional deficit that leads to paralysis in ALS patients. Using human neuronal stem cell models from ALS patients, QurAlis co-founder and former Harvard professor Kevin Eggan, Ph.D., discovered in 2019 that the expression of STMN2 is regulated by TDP-43. The Eggan Lab showed that loss of normal TDP-43 function leads to a highly significant decrease in expression of STMN2 and an impairment in neuronal repair which could be rescued by restoring STMN2 levels. These results were published in Nature Neuroscience. In addition to nearly all ALS patients, TDP-43 pathology is also associated with approximately 50 percent of patients with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), the second most common form of dementia; about a third of Alzheimer's Disease patients; and up to seven percent of Parkinson's disease patients. UNC13A is an essential regulator of neurotransmitter release at synapses. In ALS and FTD, TDP-43 accumulates in the cytoplasm and no longer maintains its normal function controlling RNA metabolism in the nucleus. Due to its loss, certain pre-mRNA transcripts are mis-spliced resulting in expression of a cryptic exon-containing transcript that interferes with appropriate protein generation. UNC13A is a pre- mRNA that is mis-spliced due to loss of TDP-43 in disease. Fifty-eight percent of ALS patients and up to half of FTD patients carry a single nuclear polymorphism in the UNC13A gene which greatly exacerbates UNC13A mis-splicing leading to loss of function of the UNC13A protein. There are currently no cures for ALS or FTD. Limited therapeutic options are available for ALS and FTD patients who are in desperate need for effective therapies.

About STATHMIN-2 and TDP-43 STATHMIN-2 (STMN2) is a well-validated protein important for neural repair and axonal stability, the expression of which is significantly decreased in nearly all ALS patients. Also known as SCG-10, STMN2 is a protein essential for the stabilization of microtubules which form an important component of the cytoskeleton of cells and axons. STMN2 is highly expressed in human motor neurons, the cells that primarily degenerate in patients suffering from ALS. In animal models, STMN2 deletion was found to cause axonal degeneration and loss of muscle innervation, which is the primary functional deficit that leads to paralysis in ALS patients. Using human neuronal stem cell models from ALS patients, QurAlis co-founder and former Harvard professor Kevin Eggan, Ph.D., discovered in 2019 that the expression of STMN2 is regulated by TDP-43. The Eggan Lab showed that loss of normal TDP-43 function leads to a highly significant decrease in expression of STMN2 and an impairment in neuronal repair which could be rescued by restoring STMN2 levels. These results were published in [Nature Neuroscience](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3880818-1&h=2414386389&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F30643292%2F&a=Nature+Neuroscience). In addition to nearly all ALS patients, TDP-43 pathology is also associated with approximately 50 percent of patients with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), the second most common form of dementia; about a third of Alzheimer's Disease patients; and up to seven percent of Parkinson's disease patients. There are currently no cures for ALS or FTD. Limited therapeutic options are available for ALS and FTD patients who are in desperate need for effective therapies.

Media Contact Kimberly Ha KKH Advisors 917-291-5744 NEW YORK, April 25, 2023 Aetion\u00ae, the global leader in real-world evidence (RWE) technology and analytics, is pleased to announce the culmination of the RCT-DUPLICATE demonstration project, with complete findings published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). This three-year initiative tested whether researchers asking clinical questions in real-world data (RWD) \u2014 data from patients' day-to-day interactions with the healthcare system \u2014 would obtain similar results to findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). In cases where clinical trial designs aligned with real patient care processes, the RWE studies and RCTs came to largely similar conclusions. As part of the RCT-DUPLICATE initiative, researchers created and published protocols for observational, real-world analogs to thirty completed and two ongoing RCTs, emulating each trial's design as closely as possible. They then implemented the studies principally using the Aetion Evidence Platform\u00ae (AEP), which analyzes data from the real world to produce transparent, rapid, and scientifically validated answers on the safety, effectiveness, and value of medical treatments. The results show that in about half of the cases where researchers were able to closely mimic the design of the corresponding RCT using RWD, the RWE study came to a similar conclusion as the analogous RCT. In many cases where RWE and RCTs did not come to a similar conclusion, the RCT design itself did not align with real-world clinical practice, creating a challenge for emulation of the trial using RWD. In these instances, RWE and RCTs may both be reaching meaningful conclusions, but to subtly different research questions. \"The RCT-DUPLICATE initiative further demonstrates that RWE has the potential to augment findings from RCTs and guides us to cases where RWE and RCTs may be expected to reach similar conclusions,\" said Nicolle Gatto, Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Science Officer at Aetion. \"This work is important in promoting and understanding the value of RWE for decision-making as we continue to assess RWE's uses, benefits, and limitations.\" Today's publication, alongside ongoing research like the [Coalition for the Advancement of RWE through Randomized Controlled Trial Emulation (CARE) Initiative](https://aetion.com/company/news/aetion-care-initiative/) and other demonstration projects, adds to a body of evidence that demonstrates how RWE can be relied on to broaden our understanding of the safety, effectiveness, and value of medications \u2014 complementing or extending what can be demonstrated by RCTs.

NEW YORK, April 25, 2023 -- [Click Therapeutics, Inc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clicktherapeutics.com%2F&esheet=53387326&newsitemid=20230425005726&lan=en-US&anchor=Click+Therapeutics%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=4e3cad465e06f131d67138d1df9a3f21) (\"Click\"), a leader in Digital Therapeutics as prescription medical treatments, today announced the initiation of the ReMMi-D, Reduction in Monthly Migraine Days study, a fully remote and decentralized pivotal trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of prescription digital therapeutics in reducing the number of monthly migraine days for adults diagnosed with episodic migraine. Migraine is a complex and debilitating condition that affects more than 40 million adults1,2, and is the second leading cause of disability in the United States3. Migraine is characterized by episodes of moderate-to-severe headache and generally associated with nausea and increased sensitivity to light and sound.4 Its burden is impacted by employment status, poverty, education attainment and insurance coverage.4,5 Although there are a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic acute and preventative treatments available, they are not without notable limitations, and patients often do not achieve full remission in response to pharmacotherapy alone. Migraine is a complex and debilitating condition that affects more than 40 million adults1,2, and is the second leading cause of disability in the United States3. Migraine is characterized by episodes of moderate-to-severe headache and generally associated with nausea and increased sensitivity to light and sound.4 Its burden is impacted by employment status, poverty, education attainment and insurance coverage.4,5 Although there are a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic acute and preventative treatments available, they are not without notable limitations, and patients often do not achieve full remission in response to pharmacotherapy alone. Unlike a traditional clinical trial in which a patient receives treatment at a designated clinical trial site, ReMMi-D is a completely remote study in which patients receive digital therapy through a mobile application while going through their regular daily activities and allows for a more representative patient population for enrollment. This study design is consistent with the real-world potential of prescription digital therapeutics to reduce barriers to care by enabling access to therapy for patients anywhere, irrespective of geographic location or proximity to trained specialists. \"Enrolling the first patient in our ReMMi-D pivotal study marks Click Therapeutics' continued progress toward developing first-in-class, prescription digital therapeutics for patients living with migraine,\" said Austin Speier, Chief Strategy Officer of Click Therapeutics. \"We are driven by our commitment to using digital technology to enable novel approaches that can provide additional treatment options to patients suffering with migraine, fulfilling unmet patient needs and delivering on better patient outcomes.\" The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial will enroll approximately 558 patients in the United States. Trial intervention will be delivered over 12-weeks and efficacy will be evaluated between groups as a change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine days (MMDs). \"We are pleased and excited to have launched a pivotal trial to validate new ways of helping patients with migraine,\" said Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, FAAN, Chief Medical Officer of Click Therapeutics. \"We are hoping to support not only the 40 million people with migraine, but also the extensive network of primary care providers and fellow neurologists who are at the forefront battling this disease.\" Click will present an abstract titled Positive establishment of a digital working alliance with a prescription digital therapeutic in patients with migraine at the 75th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) taking place in Boston from April 22nd to 27th. The team will be presenting Click's migraine phase 2, Clinical Learning Study (CLS) results, introducing the concept of PDTs to fellow neurologists, and sharing data on how a positive Digital Working Alliance results in robust engagement. \"Our team has worked diligently to develop this groundbreaking technology and we are excited to be at the forefront of medicine's digital revolution,\" said Han Chiu, Chief Technology Officer of Click Therapeutics. \"We believe that our platform-based approach harnessing the power of data, AI, and exceptional product design will lead to a best-in-class treatment for migraine that can improve the lives of patients worldwide.\" FDA Breakthrough Device Designation In December 2022, Click Therapeutics received Breakthrough Device Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the adjunctive preventive treatment for episodic migraine in patients aged 18 years and older.

GBS is a global unmet medical burden and can cause serious illness in people of all ages, worldwide. It is normally associated with infection in pregnant women and new-born babies; however, invasive GBS disease in adults has been increasing over the last 40 years. The older adult population (>65 years of age) and adults with underlying chronic health conditions (diabetes mellitus, cancer, immune suppression, obesity) are at particular risk of invasive GBS disease. There is currently no vaccine available. The clinical study will investigate the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels on the MinervaX novel GBS vaccine in an older adult population from 55 to 75 years of age, with and without underlying medical conditions. The trial will investigate the safety and immune response to the dose level currently under development for use in pregnant women (50 g of each fusion protein) and a higher dose of 125 g of each fusion protein. Since older adults, certainly those with comorbidities, often mount a less strong immune response than a younger population, up to three doses will be investigated in this trial [ clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier NCT05782179]. MinervaX has completed enrolment and dosing of its 2nd phase II clinical trial of its novel GBS vaccine in pregnant women across Denmark, the UK and South Africa. Details of MinervaX's ongoing clinical trials can be found at clinicaltrials.gov under the identifiers NCT04596878 and Officer of MinervaX, said: \"Expanding the development of our GBS vaccine for use in an older adult population, including people with increased risk for GBS due to underlying co- morbidities, is a very important step for MinervaX in the battle against this pathogen. This builds on our efforts and experience to develop a product to provide protection to the most vulnerable populations, i.e., neonates in our maternal immunization program, and now older adults including those with certain co- morbid conditions.\" Prof. Isabel Leroux-Roels, Principal Investigator at CEVAC, commented: \"GBS is known to cause potentially life-threatening infections in Older Adults and currently there is no vaccine available to prevent this. All the team at CEVAC are very happy to contribute to the development of this vaccine for this high-risk population.\" Prof. Paul Heath, Director of the St George's Vaccine Institute, London and Lead Investigator of MinervaX's Phase IIb study across Denmark, the UK and South Africa, remarked: \"Streptococcus agalactiae is a common commensal in humans and approximately 25% of all adults will be colonised with GBS in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts at any given time. We are aware of the considerable global burden of this invasive GBS disease in babies and pregnant women and of the urgent need for a vaccine to prevent this. More recently, we have become aware of the burden of GBS in non-pregnant adults, particularly in older adults, and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus. There is no current mechanism for preventing GBS disease in this growing population, and there is a well recognised morbidity and mortality. The need for a vaccine for this group of people is therefore urgent and the commencement of GBS vaccine trials in this population is therefore an important and welcome development.\" For further information please contact: MinervaX Per Fischer | Chief Executive Officer Email: pbf@minervax.com Optimum Strategic Communications Mary Clark / Jonathan Edwards/ Bolt Email: minervax@optimumcomms.com Tel: About MinervaX MinervaX is a Danish biotechnology company, established in 2010 to develop a prophylactic vaccine against Group B Streptococcus (GBS), based on research from Lund University. MinervaX is developing a GBS vaccine for maternal immunization, and now also for vaccination of older adults, likely to have superior characteristics compared with other GBS vaccine candidates in development. The latter are based on traditional capsular polysaccharide (CPS) conjugate technology. By contrast, MinervaX's vaccine is a protein- only vaccine based on fusions of highly immunogenic and protective protein domains from selected surface proteins of GBS (the Alpha-like protein family). Given the broad distribution of proteins contained in the vaccine on GBS strains globally, it is expected that MinervaX's vaccine will confer protection against virtually 100% of all GBS isolates. [www.minervax.com](http://www.minervax.com) About Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Streptococcus agalactiae or Lancefield's Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common commensal in humans, approximately 25% of all adults will be colonised with GBS at any given time. Invasive GBS disease is normally associated with infection in pregnant women and new-born babies; however, invasive GBS disease in adults has been increasing over the last 40 years. The older adult population (>65 years of age) and adults with underlying chronic health conditions (diabetes mellitus, cancer, immune suppression, obesity) are at particular risk of invasive GBS disease. Group B Streptococcus disease in non-pregnant adults causes secondary and primary bacteraemia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, prosthetic joint infection, and necrotising myositis and fasciitis. It is apparent that outside of pregnancy and the neonatal period, GBS infection results in high morbidity and mortality rates. There is no preventative treatment, cases are managed with antibiotics when an infection is diagnosed. There is a clear unmet medical need for a preventative vaccine that could provide protection to all adults but particularly to the older adult population or those at risk of infection due to underlying medical or demographic conditions. In addition, the incidence is increasing and will probably continue to increase with an increasing older adult population and an increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes around the world. - First patient dosed in Canada in Phase 1 ANQUR study - the first-ever clinical trial to evaluate a therapy that rescues STATHMIN-2 expression in ALS patients - STATHMIN-2 is a well-validated protein important for neural repair and axonal stability, the expression of which is significantly decreased in nearly all ALS patients CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 6, 2023 - [QurAlis Corporation](https://quralis.com/), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing breakthrough precision medicines for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases with genetically validated targets, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in its Phase 1 clinical trial of QRL-201 for the treatment of ALS (ANQUR). QRL-201 is a first-in-class therapeutic product candidate aiming to restore STATHMIN-2 (STMN2) expression in ALS patients. ANQUR is the first-ever study to evaluate a therapy that rescues STMN2 expression in ALS patients. \"STATHMIN-2 is a well-validated protein important for neural repair and axonal stability and is the most significantly regulated gene by TDP-43 exclusively in humans. Its expression is significantly decreased in nearly all ALS patients and it is the most consistently decreased gene over all sporadic ALS patient data sets. QRL-201 rescues STMN2 loss of function in QurAlis ALS patient-derived motor neuron disease models in the presence of TDP-43 pathology,\" said Angela Genge, M.D., FRCP(C), chief medical officer of QurAlis. \"QRL-201 recently entered the clinic in Canada and we are pleased to dose our first patient. We look forward to advancing the ANQUR clinical trial of QRL-201 for the treatment of ALS so that we can make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.\" The first participant in the ANQUR study was dosed at University of Montr\u00e9al Hospital Centre (CHUM)by Genevi\u00e8ve Matte, M.D.C.M., FRCP(C), assistant clinical professor, Department of Neurosciences, University of Montr\u00e9al; ALS clinic director, CHUM; principal investigator, University of Montr\u00e9al Hospital Research Centre (CRCHUM); and an ANQUR study investigator. \"ALS is a serious neurodegenerative disease with limited treatment options. There is great need for therapies that could slow disease progression and improve outcomes. This study has the potential to show QRL-201 could be such a therapy that could potentially benefit ALS patients who have a loss of STMN2 due to TDP-43 pathology,\" said Merit Cudkowicz, M.D., M.Sc., director of the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS, chief of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, director and the Julieanne Dorn Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, and member of QurAlis' Clinical Advisory Board. ANQUR randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of QRL-201 versus placebo in patients with ALS. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of QRL-201 in people living with ALS. The ANQUR clinical trial is expected to include 64 study participants with ALS across sites in Canada, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, and Ireland. Visit [www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) for more information about the ANQUR study. About STATHMIN-2 and TDP-43 STATHMIN-2 (STMN2) is a well-validated protein important for neural repair and axonal stability, the expression of which is significantly decreased in nearly all ALS patients. Also known as SCG-10, STMN2 is a protein essential for the stabilization of microtubules which form an important component of the cytoskeleton of cells and axons. STATHMIN-2 is highly expressed in human motor neurons, the cells that primarily degenerate in patients suffering from ALS. In animal models, STMN2 deletion was found to cause axonal degeneration and loss of muscle innervation, which is the primary functional deficit that leads to paralysis in ALS patients. Using human neuronal stem cell models from ALS patients, QurAlis co-founder and former Harvard professor Kevin Eggan, Ph.D., discovered in 2019 that the expression of STMN2 is regulated by TDP-43. The Eggan Lab showed that loss of normal TDP-43 function leads to a highly significant decrease in expression of STMN2 and an impairment in neuronal repair which could be rescued by restoring STMN2 levels. These results were published in [Nature Neuroscience](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30643292/). In addition to nearly all ALS patients, TDP-43 pathology is also associated with approximately 50 percent of patients with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), the second most common form of dementia; about a third of Alzheimer's Disease patients; and up to seven percent of Parkinson's disease patients. There are currently no cures for ALS or FTD.Limited therapeutic options are available for ALS and FTD patients who are in desperate need for effective therapies.

Programs target the novel HHLA2 pathway, activating anti-tumor immune responses to find and destroy cancer cells Cambridge, MA / Leverkusen, Germany - January 10, 2023 - NextPoint Therapeutics, a biotechnology company developing a new world of precision immuno-oncology, announced today that it raised $80 million in Series B financing co-led by Leaps by Bayer, the impact investment arm of Bayer AG, and Sanofi Ventures, the strategic venture capital arm for Sanofi. The financing will be used to advance NextPoint's two lead precision immuno-oncology programs into the clinic, both targeting the newly discovered HHLA2 pathway to activate anti-tumor immune responses. Additional new investors in the round include Invus, Catalio Capital Management, Sixty Degree Capital and PagodaTree Partners. Existing investors that took part in the financing include MPM Capital Management, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Binney Street Capital and NextPoint founder Gordon Freeman, PhD. As part of the financing, Rakhshita Dhar, Senior Director of Venture Investments Health at Leaps by Bayer, and Paulina Hill, Partner at Sanofi Ventures, will join the NextPoint Board of Directors. NextPoint's programs aim to deliver monotherapies for cancer patients without viable treatment options. While immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/L1 have revolutionized cancer treatments, many patients do not benefit from these medications and require novel therapeutic strategies. Similar to PD-L1, the tumor antigen HHLA2 is a member of the B7 receptor family1, is highly expressed on certain hard-to-treat cancers2, and drives avoidance of detection from the immune system. Importantly, HHLA2 is independent of PD-L1 and is often most strongly expressed in PD-L1-negative cancers. NextPoint's approach re-activates immune cells in tumors that are suppressed by HHLA2-driven immune evasion. NextPoint originated from the combined expertise of its academic founders, Gordon Freeman, PhD, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and XingXing Zang, PhD, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Drs. Freeman's and Zang's independent discovery and characterization of the HHLA2 pathway formed the basis of the NextPoint approach. The company and its founders have shown in preclinical models and with analysis of existing clinical datasets that the HHLA2 pathway is an important tumor-suppressive mechanism in many patients3,4. \"NextPoint is building a deep understanding of the HHLA2 tumor-specific immune-escape mechanism, with the ultimate goal of establishing standalone treatments in cancers with high HHLA2 expression,\" said Detlev Biniszkiewicz, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of NextPoint Therapeutics. \"The support of our new investors along with the continued commitment of our existing investors and founders emphasizes our momentum and progress in defining precision immuno-oncology for new patient segments.\" Juergen Eckhardt, MD, Head of Leaps by Bayer, commented, \"Leaps by Bayer was founded to help solve ten of the world's biggest challenges in health and agriculture, including preventing and curing cancer.

Lidia Oostvogels brings a wealth of experience in vaccine development with more than 25 years' experience in clinical development. Prior to joining MinervaX, she was Senior Vice President, Area Head, Infectious Diseases and Senior Vice President, Clinical Development, for Prophylactic Vaccines CureVac AG. Oostvogels worked for GSK plc for more than 12 years, where she was Director of Vaccine Discovery and Development, Clinical, focused on Influenza and Zoster. Prior to GSK, she spent nine years Boehringer Ingelheim in a clinical development role. She gained her medical doctor qualification from Ghent University in Belgium. Oostvogels' experience will be instrumental as MinervaX progresses its GBS vaccine towards phase III clinical development. MinervaX completed enrolment of its 2nd phase II clinical trial of its novel GBS vaccine in pregnant women across Denmark, the UK and South Africa. The randomized, multicenter trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of one and two doses of its GBS vaccine at different dosing regimens in healthy pregnant women. Details of MinervaX's clinical trials can be found at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) under the identifiers NCT04596878, NCT05154578 and NCT05005247. MinervaX's GBS vaccine has been granted Fast Track regulatory status by the US Food and Drug Administration. The process is designed to facilitate the development of investigational treatments that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs in serious or life-threatening conditions. Programs with Fast Track designation can benefit from early and frequent communication with the FDA throughout the entire drug development and review process and marketing application. This follows the European Medicines Agency's decision to award Priority Medicine (PRIME) status to the vaccine in September, an initiative that optimizes development and evaluation of medicines targeting an unmet medical need. Per Fischer, Chief Executive Officer of MinervaX, said: \"I am delighted to welcome Lidia Oostvogels to the leadership team. Her extensive track record in vaccine development will be invaluable as we continue to make significant progress with our novel GBS vaccine. We are looking forward to an exciting and pivotal year of development milestones in 2023 as we continue to advance our vaccine for the prevention of the large unmet medical need, Group B Streptococcal infections.\" Lidia Oostvogels, Chief Medical Officer of MinervaX, said: \"I am hugely excited to join MinervaX and look forward to contributing to the further development of its GBS vaccine. There is a major need for more options to prevent this disease and I am delighted to be working with the experienced team at MinervaX to bring this important vaccine to populations at risk.\" ENDS MinervaX ApS, Ole Maal\u00f8es Vej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark VAT no.

MinervaX is developing a GBS vaccine for maternal immunization, likely to have superior characteristics compared with other GBS vaccine candidates in development. The latter are based on traditional capsular polysaccharide (CPS) conjugate technology. By contrast, MinervaX's vaccine is a protein-only vaccine based on fusions of highly immunogenic and protective protein domains from selected surface proteins of GBS (the Alpha-like protein family). Given the broad distribution of proteins contained in the vaccine on GBS strains globally, it is expected that MinervaX's vaccine will confer protection against virtually 100% of all GBS isolates. [www.minervax.com](http://www.minervax.com/) About Group B Streptococcus (GBS) GBS is responsible for nearly 50% of all life-threatening infections in newborns. At any given time, some 15- 25% of women are spontaneously colonized with GBS, and they run the risk of transmitting the bacteria to their child in the womb, during birth and/or during the first months of life. GBS colonization may lead to late abortions, premature delivery, or stillbirth and, in the newborn child, may result in sepsis, pneumonia or meningitis, all of which carry a significant risk of severe morbidity, long- term disability or death. Currently, the only preventative strategy available involves the use of intravenously delivered prophylactic antibiotics which do not comprehensively prevent GBS infection in utero or protect against late-onset infection in newborns. Not only is this approach expensive and logistically challenging, it fails to cover all, including the most severe cases in the US and Europe, and is rarely available in resource- limited settings. The development of a GBS vaccine is also endorsed by Group B Strep Support and Group B Strep International, and GBS has been prioritized by a number of public health organizations. Both increased uptake of immunization among pregnant women and greater awareness of the implications of GBS suggest that a safe and effective vaccine targeting GBS would be well suited to address this unmet need. - Medisafe achieves major milestone with appropriate registrations, anticipating the dynamic needs of the healthcare industry BOSTON, Jan. 4, 2023 -- [Medisafe](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3747732-1&h=1621776145&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medisafe.com%2F&a=Medisafe), a leading digital therapeutics company specializing in medication engagement, is pleased to announce its Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) technology.

The companies will collaborate to develop and commercialize a novel mobile application, which combines multiple clinically validated therapeutic interventions for use alone and in combination with pharmaceutical therapy to help people with schizophrenia achieve positive clinical outcomes. The partnership aims to provide additional treatment options to those living with schizophrenia, where there remains a significant unmet need due to lack of access to psychosocial intervention therapies. Schizophrenia is one of the 15 leading causes of disability worldwide, with approximately half of all patients exhibiting co-occurring mental and/or behavioral health disorders.1 It is a serious mental health condition that alters a person's perception of reality and impacts how they think, feel, and behave, and people diagnosed with schizophrenia can remain functionally impaired due to insufficiently treated negative symptoms, including cognitive deficits and limited social functioning.2 Treatment guidelines recommend tailored psychosocial intervention therapies, however, access to these interventions is limited. 2,3 Providing novel, digital therapeutic options has the potential to significantly improve treatment and positively impact health and patient's quality of life. The additional prescription digital therapeutic under this expanded collaboration builds on development and clinical successes together with key patient insights gained under the companies' existing collaboration, which has been in effect since September 2020. The CT-155 program has achieved all development milestones to-date and generated supportive data across clinical learning studies in advance of an upcoming pivotal registration study. The companies are pursuing this new therapy after recognizing that a comprehensive treatment strategy for schizophrenia would benefit from a multi-product approach. Click Therapeutics will receive an upfront payment, funding for research and development activities as well as clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments up to a total of USD 460 million, plus tiered royalties. \"We are very excited to expand our collaboration with Click Therapeutics and further tap into their expertise in developing efficacious and engaging digital therapeutics. This brings us an important step closer to our aim of developing holistic mental health solutions for patients in need. It opens new horizons on our journey toward advancing mental healthcare by combining pharmacotherapies with newly emerging digital technologies,\" said Nedim Pipic, MD, Corporate Vice President, Therapeutic Area Head CNS, Retinopathies & Emerging Areas, Boehringer Ingelheim. \"Our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim offers significant potential to bring new digital treatment options to a currently underserved patient population,\" said David Benshoof Klein, CEO, Click Therapeutics. \"Our teams share a passion to pursue new, groundbreaking approaches to treatment and a mission to make a difference for patients. We are thrilled to expand our relationship with Boehringer Ingelheim to additional treatments within schizophrenia.\" \"With this new project we are addressing symptoms of patients for which no scalable treatment approaches exist today. Seeing the pipeline of PDTs growing reflects our commitment to mental health. We are excited to realize the potential of complementing pharmacological therapy with digital solutions to transform the lives of patients,\" added Cornelia Dorner-Ciossek, Ph.D., Digital Health Lead at Boehringer Ingelheim. \"Expanding our successful partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim enables our team to build on the experience and insights gathered with CT-155 and further expand the scope of our digital therapeutics platform,\" said Austin Speier, Chief Strategy Officer, Click Therapeutics. \"This growing collaboration is a testament to the progress we have achieved so far working together and creates the inspiring opportunity to expand CT-155 into a seamless digital therapy suite that can deliver meaningful outcomes to people living with schizophrenia.\" About Boehringer Ingelheim Boehringer Ingelheim is working on breakthrough therapies that improve the lives of humans and animals.

The equity financing of 22 million EUR was co-led by new investors Trill Impact Ventures and Pureos Bioventures and includes existing investors REPAIR Impact Fund (Novo Holdings), Sunstone Life Science Ventures, LF Investment, Wellington Partners, Sanofi Ventures, Adjuvant Capital and Industrifonden. In addition to the equity financing, the European Investment Bank provided a 50 million EUR loan facility. MinervaX has had an exciting year of clinical development for its novel GBS vaccine. The Company commenced enrolment of pregnant women in its Phase 2 clinical trial in Denmark, the UK, and South Africa and completed the dosing of healthy adult women, previously dosed with its GBS vaccine, in a Phase 1 booster clinical trial in the UK. The financing will enable MinervaX to advance the late-stage development of its GBS vaccine candidate in preparation for a Phase 3 clinical trial. The vaccine candidate was recently awarded PRIME status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) due to its potential to prevent life-threatening infections in newborn babies. MinervaX also aims to expand its clinical development team and evaluate the Phase 2 clinical data for efficacy and safety ahead of publication next year. Per Fischer, Chief Executive Officer of MinervaX, said: \"We are delighted to announce this financing, which gives us the firepower to accelerate the development of our novel GBS vaccine. GBS can be life-threatening for newborn babies and there is no approved, universally available vaccine to date. I would like to thank the investors and the MinervaX team who have worked very hard on our vaccine candidate in preparation for the final stage of clinical development.\" In conjunction with the financing, Bita Sehat, Senior Director at Trill Impact Ventures, and Veronica Gambillara, Partner of Pureos Bioventures, will join the Board of Directors. Veronica Gambillara, Partner at Pureos Bioventures, commented: \"We are excited to join the MinervaX team and support the development of this vaccine which could protect against one of the leading causes of neonatal and infant sepsis. We are impressed with the clinical data previously generated and the dedication of the leadership team. This financing will expedite the development of a product that has the potential to drastically improve the options available to address GBS infections.\" Bita Sehat, Senior Investment Director at Trill Impact Ventures, added: \"MinervaX's GBS vaccine holds great promise to address a large unmet medical need globally by preventing serious infections in both newborns and pregnant women. Its successful development will not only save lives, it will also contribute to combatting antimicrobial resistance. We are happy to join forces with a strong shareholder base and an excellent management team to support turning this promise into reality.

ENDS For further information please contact: MinervaX Per Fischer | Chief Executive Officer Email: [pbf@minervax.com](mailto:pbf@minervax.com) Optimum Strategic Communications Mary Clark / Manel Richard Staines/ About MinervaX MinervaX is a Danish biotechnology company, established in 2010 to develop a prophylactic vaccine against Group B Streptococcus (GBS), based on research from Lund University. MinervaX is developing a GBS vaccine for maternal immunization, likely to have superior characteristics compared with other GBS vaccine candidates in development. The latter are based on traditional capsular polysaccharide (CPS) conjugate technology. By contrast, MinervaX's vaccine is a protein-only vaccine based on fusions of highly immunogenic and protective protein domains from selected surface proteins of GBS (the Alpha-like protein family). Given the broad distribution of proteins contained in the vaccine on GBS strains globally, it is expected that MinervaX's vaccine will confer protection against virtually 100% of all GBS isolates. [www.minervax.com](http://www.minervax.com/) About Group B Streptococcus (GBS) GBS is responsible for nearly 50% of all life-threatening infections in newborns. At any given time, some 15- 25% of women are spontaneously colonized with GBS, and they run the risk of transmitting the bacteria to their child in the womb, during birth and/or during the first months of life. GBS colonization may lead to late abortions, premature delivery, or stillbirth and, in the newborn child, may result in sepsis, pneumonia or meningitis, all of which carry a significant risk of severe morbidity, long- term disability or death. Currently, the only preventative strategy available involves the use of intravenously delivered prophylactic antibiotics which do not comprehensively prevent GBS infection in utero or protect against late-onset infection in newborns. Not only is this approach expensive and logistically challenging, it fails to cover all, including the most severe cases in the US and Europe, and is rarely available in resource- limited settings. The development of a GBS vaccine is also endorsed by Group B Strep Support and Group B Strep International, and GBS has been prioritized by a number of public health organizations. Both increased uptake of immunization among pregnant women and greater awareness of the implications of GBS suggest that a safe and effective vaccine targeting GBS would be well suited to address this unmet need.

In this publication, the authors demonstrate how native MS can be used to investigate the pharmacology of GPCRs using 1AR as a model system. Being able to combine the sensitivity and near atomic mass resolution of the mass spectrometer, whilst preserving the receptor-G protein interactions, allowed the authors to monitor, with high sensitivity, the full spectrum of receptor pharmacology in vitro. Due to mass differences between different G proteins, the authors were also able to distinguish if a ligand is able to promote biased signalling towards a specific pathway. The authors also discovered an endogenous zinc molecule associated with the receptor. This cation was shown to be a positive allosteric modulator of 1AR and demonstrates the potential for native MS to uncover novel insights that may be important for drug discovery. As an example, the regulation of zinc binding or mimicking its mechanism with a small molecule may provide a new avenue for modulating the kinetics or signalling of 1AR for therapeutic purposes. These examples highlight two key benefits of utilizing native MS within drug discovery, namely: reconnecting the two fundamental drivers of pharmacology, binding and function; and interrogation of a native ecosystem with high precision. Professor Dame Carol Robinson, co-founder of OMass Therapeutics and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board said: \"Our findings demonstrate that native MS can be used to reconnect the two fundamental drivers of pharmacology, binding and function. From a practical viewpoint, GPCRs had represented a major challenge for native MS. Overcoming these difficulties has allowed us to monitor attenuated G-protein coupling, driven by a wide range of ligands, highlighting the sensitivity and robustness of our approach. I am also delighted that despite the fact that 1AR is a well-studied receptor, we were able to ;find a previously unknown endogenous zinc molecule associated with the receptor, which could have implications for the design of new allosteric modulators.\" Originally spun out of Oxford University, OMass has commercialised Professor Dame Carol Robinson's research in native MS to develop its proprietary drug discovery platform, OdyssION. The platform integrates novel biochemistry techniques, next-generation native mass spectrometry, and custom chemistry, to allow for the interrogation of protein interactions in its native ecosystem while avoiding the confounding complexity of the cell. This latest publication demonstrates some of the key benefits that OMass' OdyssION platform offers in the search for new drugs against inadequately drugged or previously intractable targets. OMass is advancing a pipeline of small molecule therapeutics in rare diseases and immunological conditions that target GPCRs, solute carriers and complex-bound proteins. Co-author Ali Jazayeri PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of OMass added: \"GPCRs represent one of the most important target class of proteins for drug discovery, with more than 30% of clinically marketed drugs active against this receptor family. But, despite their prevalence as therapeutic targets, challenges remain in drugging these receptors. We believe our native MS platform, as demonstrated with this latest publication, opens new possibilities to develop drugs against new GPCR targets, as well as other target classes such as solute carriers and complex-bound proteins.\" 1.

Follow us on Company's medicines target unprecedented mechanisms that free the body's normal immunity against cancer Immuno-oncology discovery engine based on ongoing academic-biotech research from the Lieping Chen lab at Yale School of Medicine First pipeline programs focused on novel mechanisms of tumor T-cell exclusion Boston, Mass., and West Haven, Conn. - October 25, 2022 - [Normunity, Inc](http://www.normunity.com/)., a biotechnology company creating novel precision anti-cancer immunotherapies, today announced its launch and Series A financing of $65 million. The Series A was led by Canaan Ventures and included participation by Sanofi Ventures, Taiho Ventures and Osage University Partners. Normunity's new class of agents, called immune normalizers, target previously undiscovered mechanisms of immune disruption in cancer. The company's pipeline is drawn from the ongoing and interactive academic-biotech research taking place at Yale School of Medicine, leveraging proprietary discovery platforms from the lab of Dr. Lieping Chen, an immuno-oncology luminary who identified PD-L1 (B7-H1) among other seminal contributions to the field. \"The normal immune system is a powerful anti-cancer force, and effective immune-stimulating strategies can result in long-lasting cancer remissions, even cures. Yet, today's immunotherapies don't capitalize on the full anti-cancer potential of the normal immune system, and most cancer patients do not respond to available treatment options. This leaves an untapped immune biology that we have begun to uncover,\" said Lieping Chen, MD, PhD, scientific founder of Normunity and UTC Professor in Cancer Research and Professor of Immunobiology, of Dermatology and of Medicine (Medical Oncology) at Yale School of Medicine. \"Working together with Normunity, we are finding previously hidden mechanisms of tumor-dependent immune disruption and we aim to usher in a new era of drug discovery for precision immuno-oncology with medicines that normalize immune function.\" The Series A financing will enable Normunity to advance its emerging pipeline of immune normalizers into the clinic. The company's initial pipeline programs target mechanisms that drive the exclusion of T cells into immune-sensitive tumors and aim to deliver an active and effective immune system into 'cold' tumors. Proceeds from the financing will also be used to build on multiple discovery platforms in the Lieping Chen lab to pursue additional mechanisms that block normal anti-cancer immunity. \"It is so clear to everyone involved in launching Normunity that there is remarkable potential to translate the Lieping Chen lab's leading-edge discoveries into breakthrough cancer immunotherapies. We have built the right team and the right seamless collaboration between Normunity and the Lieping Chen lab to rapidly cultivate scientific discovery, jointly share expertise, and advance a novel class of drugs that can potentially set a new standard in the immuno-oncology landscape,\" said Tim Shannon, MD, General Partner at Canaan Ventures and Chair of Normunity's Board of Directors. The company's unique model is a collaborative and iterative workflow between the Lieping Chen lab and Normunity to identify novel immuno-oncology mechanisms through proprietary platforms, interrogate and validate the emerging targets together pre-clinically and clinically. This academic-biotech alliance leverages world-class scientists with deeply experienced drug designers and developers in a new way. \"Normunity is leading the way in establishing a new roadmap for I-O drug discovery with a simple and powerful premise: to free the immune system to work with maximal potential against cancer. With our scientific approach, we are pioneering novel mechanisms where there is unexplored potential for new medicines. With our R&D model, we have established a first-of-a-kind collaboration with the Lieping Chen lab that has already been prolific in identifying and validating novel targets,\" said Rachel Humphrey, MD, founding Chief Executive Officer. \"We have strong momentum advancing our pipeline of immune normalizers as we translate groundbreaking biology into life-changing medicines for cancer patients.\" Leadership in immuno-oncology Leading the academic-biotech teams that are harnessing the potential of the Lieping Chen lab's proprietary platforms and Normunity's drug development are Rachel Humphrey, MD, Normunity's Chief Executive Officer, and Lieping Chen, MD, PhD, whose lab is responsible for many important discoveries in immuno-oncology pathways.

NT-0796 has completed its Phase 1 study confirming brain penetration with excellent pharmacokinetic (PK) & pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles and NT-0249 has completed dosing of the Phase 1 single ascending dose cohorts confirming a potentially best-in-class PK/PD profile and the potential for once-a-day dosing. The results collectively support further development and clinical evaluation in a range of CNS and peripheral inflammatory diseases. \"We are delighted that NT-0796 continues to demonstrate an exceptional and differentiated clinical profile,\" said Adam Keeney, Chief Executive Officer at NodThera. \"Neurological and neurodegenerative diseases are a significant and growing burden to patients and society. This is the first clinical demonstration of a brain penetrant inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which represents a major milestone for addressing this urgent medical challenge.\" NT-0796 is a novel chemotype, designed as an orally bioavailable, brain penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor. The Phase 1 study showed exposures of NT-0796 and its bioactive metabolite NDT-19795 increased linearly with dose. A dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effect was also observed through inhibition of stimulated IL-1 and IL-18 in ex vivo blood samples, which translated into an anti-inflammatory effect via reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood-brain barrier penetration of NT-0796 was verified with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug concentrations in excess of anti-inflammatory free blood concentrations. Overall, NT-0796 was safe and well tolerated and no drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnormalities were observed. NodThera's second clinical compound, NT-0249, is a peripherally restricted NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor that has successfully completed its Phase 1 single ascending dose study. NT-0249 was safe and well tolerated with proportional increases in drug exposure with increasing dose. This profile has the potential to be best-in-class as a peripheral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, demonstrating pharmacokinetics consistent with a once-a-day therapy and pharmacodynamics confirming a low clinical dose for efficacy. \"From design to development, the success of our Phase 1 data represents a breakthrough in targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome both peripherally and in the CNS\" said Alan Watt, NodThera's CSO and President of R&D. \"Delivery of NT-0796 into the CNS and the positive interim data for NT-0249 continues to reinforce NodThera's leadership in the NLRP3 inflammasome field.\" About NodThera NodThera is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of potent and selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors for the treatment of diseases driven by chronic inflammation. Led by an experienced management team, NodThera is leveraging new insights into inflammasome biology and chemistry to build a clinically advanced portfolio of highly differentiated small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors.

NodThera's lead candidate, NT-0796, demonstrated positive interim results from its Phase 1 single-ascending dose (SAD) study. Additionally, the company has commenced first-in-human dosing in the Phase 1 study of its second lead candidate, NT-0249, and announced the selection of its third pipeline candidate, NT-0527 - a brain- penetrant NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor from a novel chemotype. The positive interim results from the SAD portion of the Phase 1 trial with NT-0796 represent early clinical proof-of-mechanism for NT-0796 as a potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. Across all dosing cohorts, NT-0796 was safe and well tolerated and shown to be orally bioavailable with a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. This portion of the study also showed a dose-dependent pharmacodynamic (PD) effect through the ability to lower IL-1 and IL-18 levels in an ex vivo NLRP3-stimulation assay. These results confirm the criteria to advance NT-0796 further in development and continue the ongoing multiple- ascending dose (MAD) portion of the Phase 1 study to assess brain exposure through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling. \"NT-0796 has demonstrated robust proof of mechanism and translation from preclinical studies to humans, both validating and further de-risking the development of NT-0796 as a potentially best-in-class, oral, small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor,\" said NodThera's Chief Executive Officer, Adam Keeney. \"We are encouraged by these first-in-human results as we work to progress NT-0796 in inflammatory diseases impacting millions of patients, many with limited to no treatment options.\" Building on successful clinical progress with NT-0796, NodThera has also initiated dosing of the first healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 trial of the company's second lead candidate, NT-0249. NT-0249 is a potent inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome with favorable development characteristics supporting advancement to treat chronic inflammatory diseases of the body. The primary objective of this study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of NT-0249, with secondary objectives to assess the PK and PD (ability to lower IL- 1 and IL-18 levels) after single and multiple ascending doses. In addition to advancing two novel candidates into clinical trials, NodThera is further expanding its diverse portfolio with the announcement of NT-0527 as the third oral small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor from a novel chemotype to be added to its pipeline. NT-0527 is uniquely designed to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in the brain, with potential to treat a broad range of neuroinflammatory diseases. \"Each of NodThera's three portfolio candidates feature unique chemotypes that are distinct from one another, offering specific benefits that can be collectively used to cover a range of inflammatory diseases of the brain and body\" shares NodThera's Chief Scientific Officer, Alan Watt. \"With the recent addition of NT-0527 as the third candidate in our growing pipeline, NodThera is now advancing novel CNS-penetrant and peripherally-restricted NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with differentiated chemistry unlike any other portfolio in the field.\" About NodThera NodThera is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of potent and selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors for the treatment of diseases driven by chronic inflammation.

Media Contact Ali Nix omadahealth@highwirepr.com (339) 227-0583 Completed enrolment of all pregnant women in a Phase 2 study in South Africa and Uganda Following clearance from the US FDA, Danish Medicines Agency and UK MRHA, started enrolment of pregnant women in a Phase 2 study in Denmark and the UK Completed enrolment of a Phase 1 booster study in the UK Copenhagen, Denmark, 14 February 2022 - MinervaX, a privately held Danish biotechnology company developing a novel vaccine against Group B Streptococcus (GBS), today announces significant clinical progress on its maternal GBS vaccine. MinervaX is developing a maternal vaccine for the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes and life- threating infections caused by Group B streptococcus . GBS is responsible for nearly half of all life-threatening infections in newborns during the first 3 months of life as well as a portion of late-term abortions, premature deliveries, or stillbirths during pregnancy. As current preventive strategies are insufficient, there is an urgent need for a maternal vaccine to reduce the burden of GBS globally. MinervaX's maternal GBS vaccine is based on adjuvanted protein antigens covering close to 100% of clinical GBS isolates. MinervaX announces today that the enrolment of all 200 pregnant women in a Phase 2 study in South Africa and Uganda has been completed. Furthermore, all babies in the South Africa study population have been delivered and no product related serious adverse events have been reported to date. The study is sponsored by the European Developing Countries Trial Partnership and is listed on clinicaltrials.gov under NCT04596878. Furthermore, MinervaX announces today that it has started enrolment of 270 pregnant women in a Phase 2 study in Denmark and the United Kingdom. The study is run under an open US FDA IND and is listed on clinicaltrials.gov under NCT05154578. Finally, MinervaX has also completed dosing healthy adult women previously receiving the company's GBS vaccine in a Phase 1 booster study in the United Kingdom. The study is listed on clinicaltrials.gov under NCT05005247. Commenting on the announcement, Per Fischer, Chief Executive Officer of MinervaX, said: \"We are very pleased to have completed enrolment of all subjects in our Phase 2 study in Africa, and to have received positive feedback from the US FDA resulting in IND clearance and enrolment for the Phase 2 in Denmark and the UK, and to have completed dosing of the Phase 1 booster study in the UK. The vaccine has, to date, demonstrated high immune responses even in individuals with low levels of preexisting immunity to GBS who are most at risk of invasive disease. The vaccine has also demonstrated a very promising safety profile in both non-pregnant and pregnant women in past and ongoing clinical studies. The progress represents a significant advancement towards initiating Phase 3 clinical studies.\" Gerd Zettlmeissl, Chairman of MinervaX Board of Directors said: \"I would also like to congratulate, on behalf of my Board colleagues, the MinervaX team for this outstanding progress towards a potential future GBS vaccine. We are convinced that our vaccine candidate could provide a major global contribution to the health of pregnant women and newborns.\" Enquiries For more information on MinervaX, please contact: Per Fischer, CEO: pbf@minervax.com About MinervaX MinervaX is a Danish biotechnology company, established in 2010 to develop a prophylactic vaccine against Group B Streptococcus (GBS), based on research from Lund University. MinervaX is developing a GBS vaccine for maternal immunization, likely to have superior characteristics compared with other GBS vaccine candidates in development. The latter are based on traditional capsular polysaccharide (CPS) conjugate technology. By contrast, MinervaX's vaccine is a protein-only vaccine based on fusions of highly immunogenic and protective protein domains from selected surface proteins of GBS (the Alpha-like protein family). Given the broad distribution of proteins contained in the vaccine on GBS strains globally, it is expected that MinervaX's vaccine will confer protection against virtually 100% of all GBS isolates. [www.minervax.com](https://www.minervax.com/) About Group B Streptococcus (GBS) GBS is responsible for nearly 50% of all life-threatening infections in newborns. At any given time, some 15- 25% of women are spontaneously colonized with GBS, and they run the risk of transmitting the bacteria to their child in the womb, during birth and/or during the first months of life. GBS colonization may lead to late abortions, premature delivery, or stillbirth and, in the newborn child, may result in sepsis, pneumonia or meningitis, all of which carry a significant risk of severe morbidity, long- term disability or death. Currently, the only preventative strategy available involves the use of intravenously delivered prophylactic antibiotics which does not comprehensively prevent GBS infection in utero or protect against late-onset infection in newborns. Not only is this approach expensive and logistically challenging, it fails to cover all, including the most severe cases in the US and Europe, and is rarely available in resource- limited settings. The development of a GBS vaccine is also endorsed by Group B Strep Support and Group B Strep International, and GBS has been prioritized by a number of public health organizations. Both increased uptake of immunization among pregnant women and greater awareness of the implications of G S suggest that a safe and effective vaccine targeting GBS would be well suited to address this unmet need. Phase 1 Ready Program Targeting mTORC1 to be Pursued for Potential Use in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and other Indications CAMBRIDGE, Mass., February 2, 2022 -Today, privately held Navitor Pharmaceuticals, LLC (\"Navitor\"), announced that Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Janssen\"), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson has acquired Anakuria Therapeutics, Inc., (\"Anakuria\"), a company recently formed by Navitor to advance its novel class of selective rapamycin analog mTORC1 inhibitors. Anakuria's lead Phase 1 ready program, AT-20494 provides Janssen with a first-in-class opportunity in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, or ADPKD. This deal was facilitated by Johnson & Johnson Innovation. Under the terms of the agreement, Janssen has acquired all outstanding shares of Anakuria, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Janssen. Tom Hughes, president and chief executive officer of Navitor Pharmaceuticals LLC commented, \"We are thrilled that the potential value and substantially differentiated profile of Anakuria's mTORC1 inhibitor program can be explored with Janssen. With decades of experience in developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative therapies for patients suffering from a broad range of diseases and conditions, Janssen is ideally positioned to rapidly advance our program in the clinic. We also are very pleased that the program has come full circle within the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies: Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc., the strategic venture arm of Johnson & Johnson, was one of Navitor's founding investors and the company also [was one of the initial ]startups incubated in JLABS @ LabCentral, Cambridge, MA.\" Goodwin Proctor LLP acted as legal advisor to Navitor on this transaction. About AT-20494 AT-20494 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectively inhibits activity of mTORC1, the master modulator of cellular metabolism, which is overactive in multiple chronic diseases including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney diseases. AT-20494 is a member of a novel class of rapamycin analogs discovered by Navitor scientists, and will be the first fully selective inhibitor of mTORC1 to be studied in humans. Preclinical studies of AT-20494 have shown that it reduces the burden of cysts and kidney volume in mice carrying mutations in the PKD1 gene, and also reduces signatures of fibrosis and inflammation upon chronic administration. About mTORC1 Complex 1 of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) activity governs the pace and ability of the cell to synthesize protein and other cellular components. Increased mTORC1 activity contributes to a broad array of diseases of aging by increasing protein misfolding and driving cellular stress, inflammation, and fibrosis.

GLM101 is a mannose-1-phosphate replacement therapy in development to treat phosphomannomutase 2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG), previously known as CDG Type Ia. PMM2-CDG is the most prevalent congenital disease of glycosylation but has no FDA-approved treatments. \"The initiation of this clinical study is an important milestone for Glycomine and for PMM2-CDG patients and their families,\" said Peter McWilliams, Ph.D., CEO of Glycomine. \"We have demonstrated in preclinical studies that GLM101 can restore the glycosylation pathway that is disrupted in PMM2-CDG, and we look forward to advancing our clinical studies to confirm the potential of GLM101 as an important disease-modifying therapy for PMM2-CDG patients.\" \"PMM2-CDG is a serious rare disease with no therapeutic options and represents a critical unmet medical need,\" said Horacio Plotkin, M.D., FAAP, Chief Medical Officer of Glycomine. \"Glycomine has developed a proprietary approach to delivering mannose-1-phosphate intracellularly to overcome the deficiency that leads to PMM2-CDG. The open-label Phase 1 study will evaluate safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers. With successful completion, we look forward to opening enrollment for patients, which is planned for the second half of 2022.\" About GLM101, a Potential Treatment for PMM2-CDG (CDG-Ia) Glycomine's GLM101 is a mannose-1-phosphate replacement therapy in development to treat PMM2-CDG. PMM2-CDG is a severe multisystem disorder with symptoms such as coagulopathies, endocrinopathies, hypotonia, stroke-like episodes, as well as immune and nervous system disfunctions, and resulting mortality of 20% in the early years of life. PMM2-CDG is caused by genetic mutations that lead to a deficiency of the enzyme phosphomannomutase 2 (encoded by the PMM2 gene). PMM2 converts mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, which is an essential sugar molecule in the N-glycosylation pathway and is crucially important for proper glycoprotein structure and function. GLM101 is designed to deliver mannose-1-phosphate directly into cells and thereby bypass the PMM2 enzyme deficiency and address all disease-causing PMM2 mutations to restore pathway function. GLM101 has received Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and Europe and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in the U.S. About Glycomine, Inc. Glycomine is developing orphan drugs for serious rare disorders of metabolism and protein misfolding for which no other therapeutic options exist. The company's approach is to use replacement therapies - substrates, enzymes, or proteins - and to target those molecules to clinically relevant cellular compartments. The company is based in San Carlos, California and supported by leading international life sciences investors.

NT-0796 is a small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor with differentiated novel chemistry that provides unprecedented potency and potential for prolonged pharmacodynamic (PD) effect, with the ability to cross the blood brain barrier in preclinical species. NT-0796 selectively inhibits NLRP3, the upstream regulator of the body's inflammation response, to reduce levels of both IL-1 and IL-18 - pro-inflammatory cytokines known to play a role in chronic inflammation underlying a wide range of chronic diseases. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and PD data from an ex vivo IL-1/IL-18 stimulation assay and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling in the Phase 1 study will inform further clinical development. \"The recent convergence of key insights into innate immunity, IL-1/IL-18 and the NLRP3 inflammasome have revolutionized our understanding of chronic disease,\" said Adam Keeney, Ph.D., CEO of NodThera. \"As one of the first companies to recognize the importance of NLRP3 in the inflammation cascade, we look forward to gathering important human data from the Phase 1 clinical study of our lead candidate NT-0796 so we can accelerate innovation for patients with limited treatment options.\" The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of NT-0796, while secondary objectives include assessment of PK and PD (ability to lower IL-1 and IL-18 levels) and CSF sampling to assess NLRP3 target engagement and compound exposure after single and multiple ascending doses. \"NT-0796 leverages novel chemistry that is unlike any other NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor in the field. It is designed to deliver key advantages in PK and PD, with the potential to cross the blood brain barrier,\" said Donald Johns, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of NodThera. \"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key driver of diseases that span different parts of the body, from common ailments such as osteoarthritis, to cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, and beyond. Unlocking this treatment potential provides the opportunity to impact many patients whose quality of life is negatively affected by chronic inflammatory disease.\" About NodThera NodThera is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of potent and selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors for the treatment of diseases driven by chronic inflammation.

MinervaX is developing a maternal vaccine for the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes and life- threating infections caused by Group B streptococcus (GBS). GBS is responsible for nearly half of all life- threatening infections in newborns during the first 3 months of life as well as a portion of late-term abortions, premature deliveries, or stillbirths during pregnancy. Current preventative strategy is insufficient, and great medical needs exist, which may be addressed by a maternal GBS vaccine. MinervaX's maternal GBS vaccine is based on adjuvanted proteins antigens covering close to 100% of clinical GBS isolates. Clinical Update: MinervaX announces today completed enrolment of 150 pregnant women in a Phase 2 study in South Africa, sponsored by the European Developing Countries Trial Partnership. Dosing of an additional 50 pregnant women in the same study has started in Uganda. The study is listed on clinicaltrials.gov under NCT04596878. MinervaX has also started dosing healthy adult women previously receiving the Company's GBS vaccine in a Phase 1 booster study in the United Kingdom. The study is listed on clinicaltrials.gov under NCT05005247. Finally, MinervaX has received regulatory approval from the Danish Medicines Agency and UK MHRA to initiate a Phase 2 study in 270 pregnant women in Denmark and the United Kingdom. Corporate Update: Gerd Zettlmeissl joins MinervaX as new Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Cormorant Asset Management led the financing with participation from new investors Westlake Village BioPartners, Surveyor Capital (a Citadel company) and Logos Capital as well as Series A investors RA Capital Management, 5AM Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Sanofi Ventures and Novartis Venture Fund. Proceeds from the financing will be used to advance the company's small molecule RNA platform (SMiRNA) to identify clinical candidates in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and various tauopathies. \"Drugging RNA with small molecules has the potential to dramatically transform the lives of patients and we are excited to be supported by world-class investors who share our commitment to patients and our vision to develop innovative therapies to treat severe RNA-mediated diseases, including neurodegenerative and neurological disorders,\" said Renato Skerlj, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Expansion Therapeutics. \"This financing milestone demonstrates significant investor confidence in the leadership team, the science and our mission to accelerate the preclinical and clinical development of our novel medicines utilizing our proprietary approach.\" Expansion focuses on structured RNA targets that are evolutionarily conserved or genetically demonstrated to cause disease. Disease-driving RNA structures amenable to ligand binding are identified by combining patient genetics with deep informatic analysis and then screened against Expansion's proprietary RNA-focused libraries for small molecules that modulate the RNA target in a functionally relevant manner. Expansion's novel structural biology SMiRNA platform is then utilized for the design and advancement of lead-like chemical matter that ultimately delivers an oral medicine to treat disease. Expansion is focused on neurological diseases where few treatment options are available for patients such as DM1 which is a system wide disorder affecting muscle, cardiac and brain function. A small molecule medicine that treats all aspects of the disease offers patients a significant benefit. \"Recent advances in understanding RNA structure and the science of targeting RNA with small molecules offer tremendous opportunities to transform the way RNA-mediated diseases are treated. We believe Expansion's established focus on structured RNA targets position them as leaders in this emerging space,\" said Andy Phillips, Ph.D., Managing Director at Cormorant. \"We're extremely enthusiastic about the promise that the SMiRNA platform holds to deliverdisease-modifying therapies for a wide range of devastating neurological disorders, particularly neurodegenerativediseases,\" added Raymond J. Kelleher, M.D., Ph.D., also Managing Director at Cormorant. \"The progression of Expansion's lead programs, broad therapeutic potential of the platform, and the leadership team'sdemonstrated track record in the field of neuroscience compelled us to partner with this exceptionally strong group of drugdevelopers, as well as Cormorant and the rest of the investor syndicate,\" said Andrew Levin, M.D., Ph.D., ManagingDirector at RA Capital Management. \"We are confident in Expansion's ability to leverage its differentiated platform topositively impact the lives of patients suffering from severe and debilitating neurological diseases who currently havelimited or no treatment options,\" added Laura Tadvalkar Ph.D., Principal at RA Capital Management. As part of its initiative to broaden its portfolio of small molecule medicines, Expansion also recently in-licensed two newresearch programs from Scripps Research, including a program targeting tau, an important driver of dementia disorders.The tau program builds on the observation that defective pre-mRNA encoding the production of tau protein is involved inthe formation of neurofibrillary tangles and has been linked to tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporaldementias, progressive supranuclear palsy and other neurodegenerative diseases. Most recently, Expansion's scientific founder, Matthew D. Disney, Ph.D. and colleague, Alicia Angelbello, Ph.D., wererecipients of the American Chemical Society's Nobel Laureate Signature award for their pioneering work developing RNA-targeting medications for genetic diseases, including DM1.

In addition, new investors Sanofi Ventures, Casdin Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Alexandria Venture Investments participated in the round, alongside existing investors ARCH Ventures, GV and Mass General Brigham Ventures (formerly Partners Innovation Fund). Concurrent with the financing, Steven J. Kafka, Ph.D., managing partner at Section 32, and Jim Trenkle, Ph.D., head of investments at Sanofi Ventures, were appointed to ROME's Board of Directors. ROME's mission is to harness the power of the repeatome - the roughly 60% of the human genome consisting of repetitive sequences of nucleic acids, known as repeats - to discover powerful new classes of medicines for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Repeats have long been considered part of the \"dark genome,\" but recent discoveries have demonstrated that the repeatome has pathological consequences in cancer, autoimmune disease and other therapeutic areas. Since launching in April 2020, ROME has identified multiple repeatome-derived targets and created an internal data science platform, called repeatomics, to analyze vast quantities of data available through the repeatome. \"In the short time since our founding, ROME has made significant progress uncovering the role and mechanism of the repeatome in cancer and autoimmune disease, which has led to our foundational repeatomics platform and identification of multiple tractable targets for drug discovery,\" said Rosana Kapeller, M.D., Ph.D., president, chief executive officer and co-founder of ROME. \"With the support of this group of premier investors, we are well-capitalized and resourced to continue advancing our lead programs into the clinic, expanding our pipeline of repeatome-derived programs and enhancing our repeatomics platform, as we seek to revolutionize the way cancer and autoimmune diseases are treated.\" \"Traditional genomics has transformed how we think about drug development, diagnosis and treatment; however, for too long we have been unable to extend this approach to the 'dark genome,'\" said Dr. Kafka. \"Leveraging the deep insights garnered by ROME's experienced team of drug hunters and data scientists, ROME has developed innovative tools and techniques to generate novel insights from the repeatome in order to bring forward an entirely new and important class of disease-modifying medicines.\" About New Directors Steven J.

In this study, the levels of morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were measured in a cohort of patients and found to be significantly below normal, indicating PMM2-CDG patients are at risk for secondary adrenal insufficiency. These data provide key insights to improve standard of care, as early recognition of adrenal insufficiency and initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy and stress dosing could be lifesaving. The authors conclude that morning cortisol and ACTH levels should be evaluated at least annually for all patients with PMM2-CDG. If abnormal, a low dose ACTH stimulation test should follow to evaluate the hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal (HPA) axis. \"Endocrinopathies in PMM2-CDG have not received the attention they deserve, especially considering that glycoproteins are involved in virtually every endocrine axis,\" said Kyriakie Sarafoglou, M.D., Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at University of Minnesota and lead author of the paper. \"Through an international collaboration, this study was the first to identify that patients with PMM2-CDG are at risk for secondary adrenal insufficiency and to suggest that morning cortisol and ACTH monitoring should become part of standard care in these patients.\" The natural history study completed enrollment with 139 PMM2-CDG patients at 11 sites around the world (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03173300). Morning serum cortisol and ACTH levels were simultaneously measured in a cohort of 43 patients. In this cohort, 11 patients (25.6%) had cortisol below 5 g/dl and low to normal levels, suggestive of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Secondary adrenal insufficiency has a prevalence of 1.5 to 2.8 in 10,000 (< 0.03%) in the general population. Since this finding, two of the 11 patients have been confirmed to have central adrenal insufficiency after low dose ACTH stimulation test results and are on hydrocortisone replacement and/or stress dosing during illness. \"We initiated this natural history study, which is the largest longitudinal study ever undertaken for this disease, to learn more about how PMM2-CDG affects patients and inform the design of our clinical trials for GLM101,\" said Horacio Plotkin, M.D., FAAP, Chief Medical Officer of Glycomine. \"Through thoughtfully and scientifically studying the clinical presentation and biochemistry of PMM2-CDG, our investigators have uncovered a significant risk factor that is often masked by other co-morbidities of the disease. We thank the investigators and the patients and families who participated in this study for their time and support as we advance into clinical trials GLM101. Good things happen when patients and families, investigators, and companies work together.\" \"Even before we have started our first interventional clinical trial, we have uncovered a potential life-saving therapeutic intervention,\" said Peter McWilliams, Ph.D., CEO of Glycomine. \"While cortisol/ACTH monitoring and glucocorticoid therapy have the potential to be lifesaving for PMM2-CDG patients during stress or illness, they are still only addressing the symptoms of the disease. We look forward to initiating later this year our interventional clinical trials for GLM101 that has the potential to restore the deficiency in mannose-1-phosphate that causes PMM2-CDG.\" The research entitled, \"Should patients with Phosphomannomutase 2-CDG (PMM2-CDG) be screened for adrenal insufficiency?\" is available at this link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2021.06.003. SAN CARLOS, Calif., June 23, 2021 - Glycomine, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on developing new therapies for orphan diseases, today announced that it has closed a $68 million Series B financing. The proceeds of the financing will be used to advance Glycomine's lead drug candidate, GLM101, through initial clinical trials in patients. GLM101 is a novel substrate replacement therapy in development to treat phosphomannomutase 2- congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG), a rare disease representing a critical unmet medical need. The Series B financing includes $35 million of new funds in addition to the $33 million announced in August 2019. Today's financing was led by new investors, Abingworth and Sanofi Ventures, and joined by RiverVest Venture Partners and Remiges Ventures. In addition, all previous Series B investors - Novo Holdings A/S, Asahi Kasei Pharma Ventures, Mission BioCapital, Sanderling Ventures, participated. Glycomine's CEO, Peter McWilliams, Ph.D., said, \"We are delighted to have expanded our syndicate with these high-quality, experienced life science investors. We have demonstrated in preclinical studies that GLM101 can restore the glycosylation pathways that are disrupted in PMM2-CDG. This additional funding will enable us to confirm in the clinic the potential of GLM101 as a therapy for all PMM2-CDG patients, regardless of genotype, and we are looking forward to executing on our clinical program with this new infusion of capital.\" PMM2-CDG is the most prevalent congenital disease of glycosylation but has no FDA-approved treatments. Glycomine's GLM101 is a mannose-1-phosphate replacement therapy in development to treat PMM2-CDG, a disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2). PMM2 converts mannose-6- phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate, which is an essential sugar molecule in the N-glycosylation pathway and is crucially important for proper glycoprotein structure and function. GLM101 is designed to deliver mannose-1- phosphate directly into cells and thereby bypass the PMM2 enzyme deficiency and address all disease-causing PMM2 mutations to restore pathway function. GLM101 has received Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and Europe and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in the U.S. \"Glycomine's novel and scientifically informed approach shows the potential of GLM101 to be a significant disease-modifying treatment,\" added Bali Muralidhar, M.D., Ph.D., Managing Partner with Abingworth. \"Glycomine has developed a proprietary approach to delivering mannose-1-phosphate intracellularly to replace the missing sugar molecule. Initial clinical studies of GLM101 will be an important proof-of-concept, and we are excited to support the company at this pivotal stage.\" \"PMM2-CDG is an important unmet need with no therapeutic option,\" added Jim Trenkle, Ph.D., US Head of Investments at Sanofi Ventures. \"We are enthusiastic to support Glycomine's work to advance transformative therapies for PMM2-CDG patients and their families and caregivers.\" In connection with the financing, Dr. Muralidhar, Dr. Trenkle, and Niall O'Donnell, Ph.D., Managing Director of RiverVest, have been appointed to Glycomine's Board of Directors.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif, May 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Therini Bio, Inc. announced it has completed an oversubscribed Seed Extension round of nancing. The capital will accelerate the development of Therini's lead program - a monoclonal antibody against brin - towards the clinic for patients with inammatory conditions associated with vascular damage. Therini Bio was co-founded by Dr. Katerina Akassoglou, PhD, based upon discoveries from her laboratory at Gladstone Institutes and also UC San Francisco that a cryptic epitope on brin, a blood-clotting factor, drives toxic chronic inammation in the brain and the invention of an antibody to selectively target this brin cryptic epitope. This mechanism is believed to underlie damage in multiple neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Multiple Sclerosis, in addition to peripheral inammatory conditions like colitis and kidney disease. The scientic team at Therini led by Chief Scientic Ofcer Dr. Jeff Stavenhagen, PhD, has advanced this pioneering work and developed an optimized therapeutic antibody appropriate for human use that attenuates brin-induced inammation without affecting critical clotting functions. In addition, Therini also has developed a suite of antibodies that could be utilized as imaging agents for diagnosis and clinical trial selection and has also discovered a broad set of novel human therapeutic antibody candidates that it is proling for potential use in a wide range of inammatory diseases. The Company is using the capital from this nancing for antibody manufacturing and IND enabling studies in anticipation of initiating human clinical trials in 2022. \"The upsized nancing validates the progress made by Therini's research team and reveals the signicant excitement that exists around the breadth and depth of the science behind this new biological approach to inammation.

Media Contact Gina Nugent Ten Bridge Communications (617) 460-3579 gina@tenbridgecommunications.com - On the back of highly promising Phase Ib data, MinervaX has raised financing from leading investors to accelerate development of its novel vaccine through the end of Phase II trials and preparations for Phase III pivotal trials - Sanofi Ventures, Wellington Partners, Adjuvant Capital, and Industrifonden join existing investors Novo Holdings REPAIR Impact Fund, Sunstone Life Science Ventures and LF Investment - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is one of the leading causes of stillbirth and infant mortality representing a significant unmet need globally, including in the US and Europe; nearly one in five women globally are colonized by GBS Copenhagen, Denmark, 15 December 2020 - MinervaX, a privately held Danish biotechnology company developing a novel vaccine against Group B Streptococcus (GBS), announced today that it has raised an upsized EUR 47.4 million Series B financing. The round included new investors Sanofi Ventures, Wellington Partners, Adjuvant Capital, and Industrifonden, along with existing investors Novo Holdings REPAIR Impact Fund, Sunstone Life Science Ventures, and LF Investment. Proceeds will advance the clinical development of MinervaX's novel GBS vaccine through Phase II clinical trials, as well as manufacturing and regulatory preparation for Phase III. Concurrent with the financing, Christopher Gagliardi from Sanofi Ventures, Karl N\u00e4gler from Wellington Partners, Kabeer Aziz from Adjuvant Capital and Bita Sehat from Industrifonden will join MinervaX's board of directors. GBS is responsible for nearly half of all life-threatening infections in newborns. MinervaX's protein-only GBS vaccine targets pregnant women for the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes and life-threatening neonatal infections associated with GBS. Globally, 15-25% of women are colonized with GBS, and they run the risk of transmitting the bacteria to their child in utero, during birth and / or during their first months of life. GBS colonization may lead to late-term abortions, premature delivery or stillbirth; and in newborn children may result in sepsis, pneumonia or meningitis, all of which carry a significant risk of severe morbidity, long-term disability or death. Currently, the only preventative strategy available involves the use of intravenously delivered prophylactic antibiotics, which does not comprehensively prevent GBS infection in utero or protect against late-onset infection in newborns. As this approach is expensive and logistically challenging, it fails to cover all, including the most severe cases in the US and Europe, nor is it available in resource-limited settings. Commenting on the financing, Per Fischer, CEO of MinervaX, said: \"Prevention of GBS infections in pregnant women and newborns represents a large unmet medical need. The current preventive strategy is insufficient and involves excessive use of prophylactic antibiotics, which has resulted in the emergence of wide-spread antibiotic resistance. \"We are pleased to have received funding from such a strong investment syndicate. It is a significant endorsement of the potential of our vaccine. We look forward to advancing our novel vaccine candidate through Phase II clinical trials to develop a new standard of care in preventing GBS infections.\" Commenting on the investment, Christopher Gagliardi, Director of Investments at Sanofi Ventures, said: \"Sanofi Ventures is tremendously excited by the first and best in class potential of MinervaX's GBS vaccine. We are thrilled to invest alongside a top-tier investor syndicate while supporting Sanofi's strategic goals and commitment to early stage companies advancing global public health.\" Karl N\u00e4gler, Managing Partner at Wellington Partners said: \"We are proud and excited to back MinervaX's GBS program that will address an unmet high medical need and represents a blockbuster commercial opportunity. Beyond prevention of GBS infections in newborns, we are eager to explore important further indications for this much needed vaccine.\" Emmanuelle Coutanceau, Partner at Novo Seeds and Board Member at MinervaX, added: \"MinervaX is developing an important vaccine against a potentially fatal pathogen and, in doing so, is furthering the battle against antimicrobial resistance. This is a landmark for the Novo Holdings REPAIR Impact Fund with the first company in the fund moving to Phase II. We are also delighted to help bring together such a strong syndicate in a company where Novo was one of the first investors.\" MinervaX has completed Phase I studies across 300 healthy female subjects, generating compelling data to support advancing its novel vaccine candidate to Phase II trials. Studies to date have demonstrated a favourable safety profile, while generating high levels of long-lasting antibodies, which are capable of mobilizing the immune system against GBS bacteria and preventing invasion of epithelial and endothelial cell barriers. The development of MinervaX's novel GBS vaccine candidate is also endorsed by Group B Strep Support and Group B Strep International, and GBS has been prioritised by a number of public health organisations. Both increased uptake of immunisation among pregnant women and greater awareness of the implications of GBS suggest that a safe and effective vaccine targeting GBS would be well suited to address this unmet need. Enquiries For more information on MinervaX, please contact: Optimum Strategic 687 2223 minervax@optimumcomms.com About MinervaX MinervaX is a Danish biotechnology company, established in 2010 in order to develop a prophylactic vaccine against Group B Streptococcus (GBS), based on research from Lund University. MinervaX is developing a GBS vaccine for maternal immunization, likely to have superior characteristics compared with other GBS vaccine candidates in development. The latter are based on traditional capsular polysaccharide (CPS) conjugate technology. By contrast, MinervaX's vaccine is a protein-only vaccine based on fusions of highly immunogenic and protective protein domains from selected surface proteins of GBS (the Alpha-like protein family). Given the broad distribution of proteins contained in the vaccine on GBS strains globally, it is expected that MinervaX's vaccine will confer protection against virtually 100% of all GBS isolates. www.minervax.com About Group B Streptococcus (GBS) GBS is responsible for nearly 50% of all life-threatening infections in newborns. At any given time, some 15-25% of women are spontaneously colonized with GBS, and they run the risk of transmitting the bacteria to their child in the womb, during birth and/or during the first months of life. GBS colonization may lead to late abortions, premature delivery or stillbirth and, in the newborn child, may result in sepsis, pneumonia or meningitis, all of which carry a significant risk of severe morbidity, long-term disability or death.

Icosavax also announced that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has provided a $10 million grant to support the company's COVID-19 vaccine program through the first in human Phase 1 clinical trial in young and older adults, expected to initiate in mid-2021. In addition, Icosavax received $6.5 million from Open Philanthropy to support development of the company's vaccine platform technology and COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The company is currently advancing the necessary studies to support regulatory filings and has initiated GMP manufacturing. To enable rapid progress of the company's COVID-19 vaccine candidate to the clinic, Amgen has agreed to manufacture a key intermediate for initial clinical studies. \"This is truly a great example of the scientific community coming together in a time of exceptional need to fight this pandemic. We are grateful to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Open Philanthropy for their financial support and to Amgen for the supply of a key intermediate for manufacturing,\" said Adam Simpson, Chief Executive Officer of Icosavax. \"The team at Icosavax is dedicated to advancing vaccines against severe life-threatening respiratory diseases to protect our most at-risk populations. Because VLP vaccines have the potential to induce high-neutralizing antibody titers, our COVID-19 VLP vaccine candidate could be especially important for older adults with age-related declines in immunity.\" Developed by scientists at the University of Washington School of Medicine using structure-based vaccine design techniques invented at the Institute for Protein Design (IPD) at the UW Medicine, IVX-411, the lead vaccine candidate for COVID-19, is a self-assembling protein nanoparticle that displays 60 copies of the SARSCoV- 2 spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain in a highly immunogenic array. Preclinical data from UW researchers and their collaborators show IVX-411 induces high neutralizing antibody titers in mice after a single administration and further improvement after a second administration (Cell 2020). Titers after the second administration were ten-fold higher than those seen with the soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that forms the basis of many other vaccine candidates. The data also show a strong B-cell response after immunization, critical for immune memory and a durable vaccine effect, with antibodies that target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting potential protection from escape mutations. \"These data highlight that while our VLP-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may not be first to market, it has the potential to be a best-in-class vaccine that safely delivers potent and durable immune protection,\" said Icosavax co-founder Neil King, Ph.D. Dr. King is also inventor of the computationally designed VLP technology at the Institute for Protein Design, and assistant professor of biochemistry at the UW School of Medicine. \"This technology is designed to drive higher neutralizing antibody titers than soluble protein approaches and to create safe, stable, and effective VLP vaccines with simple and scalable manufacturing.\" \"It's clear that we will need a variety of vaccine approaches to effectively fight this novel coronavirus,\" said Jean-Paul Prieels, Ph.D., former Senior Vice President of Research and Development at GSK Vaccines and member of the scientific advisory board of Icosavax. \"That's why it's important to advance not just the fastest but the best vaccine technologies that can deliver safe, effective, and durable protection.\" VLPs enable high-density, multivalent display of antigens in a manner that closely resembles viruses, with an important difference. VLPs contain no genetic material, so they are non-infectious and can provide a safer alternative to live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. Icosavax has a worldwide license with an exclusive option for IVX-411 in North America and Europe from the University of Washington. About Icosavax Icosavax is focused on developing safe and effective vaccines against infectious diseases that cause severe, life-threatening respiratory illnesses. In addition to the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Icosavax is also advancing IVX-121 into clinical trials as a potential vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for older adults.

(July 9, 2020) - Kymera Therapeutics Inc. today announced the company has entered into a multi-program strategic collaboration with Sanofi (NASDQ: SNY) to develop and commercialize first-in-class protein degrader therapies targeting IRAK4 in patients with immune-inflammatory diseases. The companies will also partner on a second earlier stage program. Kymera will receive $150 million in cash upfront and may receive more than $2 billion in potential development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as significant royalty payments. Kymera retains the option to participate in US development and commercialization for both programs. This includes the ability to participate equally in the costs, profits and losses after opt-in, and to co-promote partnered products in the US. \"This is an important collaboration for both companies and for the field of targeted protein degradation,\" said Nello Mainolfi, Ph.D., co-founder, President and CEO of Kymera Therapeutics. \"Kymera is becoming a fully integrated biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of novel therapies with the potential to transform treatment paradigms. We are excited to partner with Sanofi, an organization with world-class drug development and commercialization capabilities, to ensure maximal patient impact from two of our programs across multiple disease indications, while enabling Kymera to invest in key strategic areas to realize the broad potential of protein degrader therapies.\" Under terms of the collaboration, Sanofi will make an upfront payment of $150 million in cash to Kymera for global rights to develop its small molecule IRAK4 protein degraders in inflammation and immunology indications, and a second earlier stage undisclosed program. IRAK4 is believed to play a key role in multiple immune-inflammatory diseases, including hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Kymera will IRAK4 program through Phase 1 clinical trials; Sanofi will assume clinical development and commercialization responsibilities thereafter. Sanofi will lead all clinical development activities for the second program. Kymera will have the option to participate in the development of both programs in the US during clinical development. Kymera will retain global rights to its IRAK4 program in oncology indications. IRAK4 is a key protein involved in inflammation mediated by the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). While TLR and IL-1R signaling via IRAK4 is involved in the normal immune response, aberrant activation of these pathways is the underlying cause of multiple immune-inflammatory conditions. In pre-clinical studies, Kymera has shown oral daily administration of an IRAK4 degrader can lead to complete knockdown of IRAK4 in skin and immune cells in higher species and is well tolerated. Data presented at the most recent annual meetings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation showed potent anti- inflammatory activity in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models.\" \"Targeted protein degrada on is an exci ng modality. Kymera has developed an incredible drug discovery engine producing protein degraders with compelling and dieren ated pharmacology against targets that, to date, have not been op mally addressed with other therapeu c modali es,\" said John Reed, Global Head of Research & Development at Sano. \"We are excited to partner with the Kymera team to advance a new genera on of rst-in-class therapies with the poten al to eliminate underlying drivers of disease.\" Aquilo Partners, L.P. acted as Financial advisor to Kymera on this transac on. # # # About Kymera Therapeutics Kymera Therapeutics is a biotechnology company pioneering a transformative new approach to treating previously untreatable diseases.

The Evidation platform will analyze behavior, including sleep and activity patterns, alongside self-reported symptoms for 300 people at high risk of developing COVID-19. This builds on Evidation's current, ongoing 150,000-person nationwide initiative tracking people's health and attitudes during the pandemic, COVID-19 Pulse. \"Many infected individuals are asymptomatic but still able to spread the virus, making efforts to prevent and slow transmission of COVID-19 difficult,\" said Luca Foschini, Ph.D., Evidation's co-founder and chief data scientist. \"This initiative will use novel behavioral and physiological data to more effectively identify when and where people may contract COVID-19 and can potentially enable real-time interventions to limit spread and monitor outcomes.\" The analysis, performed in collaboration with non-profit 4YouandMe, will use de-identified data generated by self-reporting and wearable devices to track symptoms of COVID-19 in those at particularly high risk, including health care workers and other first responders, in order to better understand susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. One potential outcome of this work is an early warning algorithm to help individuals better understand and monitor their respiratory disease symptoms and take precautions against their spread. \"The ability to self-monitor and be informed of health status will empower Americans in their decisions to help slow the spread of this pandemic and improve health outcomes for people with COVID-19,\" said BARDA Acting Director, Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. \"This pilot study is not only an early step in demonstrating the utility of models developed using person-generated health data but also may provide data to better understand the varied symptoms of COVID-19.\" This program follows Evidation's work with BARDA to monitor individuals for respiratory infections, such as influenza. Evidation's existing research on influenza utilizes person-generated health data and population-based models with the goal of improving real-time respiratory infection monitoring at the individual and population level. BARDA is contributing a $720,000 award as part of BARDA's COVID-19 Rapidly Deployable Capabilities program to identify and pilot near-term innovative solutions for COVID-19. Support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is from the $250 million the foundation has committed to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

Media Contact press@evidation.com - Proprietary tissue-targeted complement platform and best-in-class IL-7R antibody technology to treat patients with severe autoimmune and inflammatory disease; clinical trials begin in 2020 - Previously closed $46M Series A led by Atlas Venture included OrbiMed Advisors, Abingworth, and Sanofi Ventures - Company appoints Michael Broxson as CEO; co-founder Shelia Violette as Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research Cambridge, Mass. (May 27, 2020) - Q32 Bio, a biotechnology company developing biologics to restore healthy immune regulation, today announced the company's pipeline and plans to enter the clinic this year with its lead candidate. Enabled by a $46M Series A financing led by Atlas Venture, and a world class team and Scientific Advisory Board, Q32 Bio is advancing a portfolio of biologics targeting the body's innate and adaptive immune systems. The company has a robust product pipeline including a monoclonal antibody antagonist of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R), and a complement therapeutics platform that has generated fusion proteins that downregulate complement activity specifically in disease-affected tissues. The company is led by industry veterans Michael Broxson as Chief Executive Officer, and co-founder, Shelia Violette, Ph.D., as Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research. Q32 Bio was seeded and incubated by Atlas Venture with foundational science from renowned researchers in immunology Michael Holers, M.D. and Joshua Thurman, M.D., both from the University of Colorado, and Steven Tomlinson, Ph.D. from the Medical University of South Carolina. Dr. Holers serves as chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board, which is comprised of distinguished global experts in autoimmune and inflammatory disease. The subsequent Series A financing included Atlas Venture, OrbiMed Advisors, Abingworth, Sanofi Ventures, University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado Center for Innovation. \"Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are driven by dysregulation of the immune response,\" said Mr. Broxson. \"Q32 Bio has a preeminent team with expertise in both innate and adaptive immunity, a board of directors and scientific advisory board made up of leaders in our field, and a syndicate of blue-chip investors. This gives us a running start in developing therapies that may improve and save lives. I am thrilled to join Q32 Bio and look forward to advancing our first two immune-regulating therapies into first-in-human studies planned for 2020 and 2021.\" Integrated Approach to Restoring Healthy Immune Regulation Q32 Bio's most advanced program, ADX-914, is a fully human anti-IL-7R antibody licensed from Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) that re-regulates adaptive immune function. The cytokine IL-7 has demonstrated the ability to drive several T-cell mediated pathological processes. It stimulates T-effector and T-memory cells, lowering the threshold-response to disease related antigens; inhibits the immunosuppressive function of T-regulatory cells; and promotes pathogenic autoantibody production. Inhibition of IL-7R signaling has the potential to durably and safely restore healthy immune regulation in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Q32 Bio is advancing plans for the first-in-human trial of ADX-914 while continuing to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 on clinical operations. Pending confirmation that trial sites are able to operate and enroll patients safely, a biomarker-guided ADX-914 Phase 1 trial is planned to start in late 2020. Q32 Bio is developing ADX-914 (formerly known as BMS-986265) as part of an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb. Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol Myers Squibb received an upfront payment and became a minority shareholder of Q32 Bio. Bristol Myers Squibb has the potential to earn additional milestone payments subject to the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as tiered annual net sales royalties. Q32 Bio is solely responsible for all future development and commercialization costs of ADX-914. Q32 Bio's lead program in innate immunity, ADX-097, is based on a groundbreaking platform providing tissue-targeted regulation of the complement system. Complement is an integral component of the innate immune system that provides a first line of defense for clearing pathogens and removing damaged cells. In a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases the complement system becomes hyperactivated, causing the immune system to attack and damage otherwise healthy tissue. Q32 Bio's proprietary and unique platform has yielded a pipeline of novel protein therapeutics that provide potent inhibition of complement in diseased tissues without long-term systemic blockade - a key differentiator versus current complement therapeutics. Q32 Bio has initiated IND-enabling activities for dosing is planned for 2H 2021. \"Given their broad roles in mediating immunity, the complement system and IL-7 signaling pathways are high potential arenas for drug development,\" said Dave Grayzel, MD, Partner, Atlas Venture and chairman of the Q32 Bio Board of Directors. \"With a best-in-class IL-7R antibody and fusion proteins designed to target the complement system at sites of activation in a unique and differentiated manner, Q32 Bio is well positioned to make a meaningful impact for patients with serious inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\" Experienced Leadership Team Michael Broxson brings over 20 years of industry experience to Q32 Bio.

YTX-7739 represents a novel, first-in-class, potentially disease-modifying therapy Data from Phase 1 study expected in the first quarter of 2020 CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - October 7, 2019 - Yumanity Therapeutics, a company focused on protecting the vitality of the mind by discovering and developing transformative brain-penetrating small molecule drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that the first subject cohort has been dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of YTX-7739 in healthy volunteers. YTX-7739, the company's lead investigational therapy, is designed to inhibit Stearoyl-CoA-Desaturase (SCD), a validated biologic target that has recently shown potential in neurodegenerative diseases by protecting cells from a-synuclein toxicity, a major driver of Parkinson's disease. \"Developing effective therapies for patients with devastating neurodegenerative diseases has been challenging because too few hypotheses and novel targets have been explored,\" said Kenneth Rhodes, Ph.D., chief scientific officer \"We advanced YTX-7739, an orally-active SCD inhibitor, into development because of recent evidence established at Yumanity Therapeutics demonstrating its promise to protect cells from a-synuclein toxicity. We look forward to fully characterizing the potential clinical use of YTX-7739, which is clearly differentiated from currently available Parkinson's disease therapies that only address the symptoms, not the underlying causes.\" The double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, crossover study is intended to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of YTX-7739 in adult healthy volunteers. A second study, exploring multiple ascending doses in adult healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson's, will follow. Approximately 40 participants will be enrolled in this Phase 1 single ascending dose study. Following completion of the Phase 1 studies, Yumanity Therapeutics expects to advance YTX-7739 into a Phase 1b proof-of-concept clinical trial in the second half of 2020. \"Since Yumanity Therapeutics' inception, our goal has been to uncover novel pathways and targets to tackle significant medical challenges,\" said Richard Peters, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer of Yumanity Therapeutics. \"Moving from target identification of SCD to initial clinical development of YTX-7739 in just three years is a testament to the enormous potential of our discovery platform to reproducibly identify previously unexplored biology and new, druggable targets that have the potential to protect cells from neurodegeneration. This Phase 1 trial will provide important validation for the broad application of our technology to help address arguably the most important therapeutic challenges of our time.\" About YTX-7739 YTX-7739 is Yumanity Therapeutics' proprietary lead investigational therapy designed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the activity of a novel target that plays an important and previously unrecognized role in the neurotoxicity caused by the a-synuclein protein, a major driver of Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. Misfolding and aggregation of the a-synuclein protein triggers a cascade of events, ultimately resulting in neurotoxicity and the subsequent disorders in movement and cognition that affect patients living with these diseases. YTX-7739 has been shown to inhibit many of the key aspects of a-synuclein toxicity and the company is assessing its potential utility in Parkinson's disease. About Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system and impacts both motor and non-motor functions. It is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases, affecting an estimated 0.5 to 1 percent of people 65 to 69 years of age, rising to 1 to 3 percent of the population over the age of 80.1 Symptom severity and disease progression differ between individuals, but typically include slowness of movement (bradykinesia), trembling in the extremities (tremors), stiffness (rigidity), cognitive or behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbances and sensory dysfunction.2 There is no laboratory or blood test for Parkinson's disease, so diagnosis is made based on clinical observation.3 Currently, there is no cure and available treatments only address the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, not the underlying causes. About Yumanity Therapeutics Yumanity Therapeutics is transforming drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding. Formed in 2014 by renowned biotech industry leader, Tony Coles, M.D., and protein folding science pioneer, Susan Lindquist, Ph.D., the company is focused on discovering disease-modifying therapies for patients with Parkinson's disease and related disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease. Leveraging its proprietary discovery engine, Yumanity Therapeutics' innovative new approach to drug discovery and development concentrates on reversing the cellular phenotypes and disease pathologies caused by protein misfolding.

The company was founded on computationally designed self-assembling virus-like particle (VLP) technology developed at the Institute for Protein Design (IPD) at University of Washington School of Medicine (Cell 2019, Preview). The proceeds of the financing will be used to advance the company's first vaccine candidate, IVX-121, for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for older adults through Phase 1b clinical studies. Icosavax also announced today its leadership team, board of directors and key scientific advisors. \"Working closely with the Institute for Protein Design, we started Icosavax with seed funding from its philanthropic supporters,\" said Adam Simpson, Chief Executive Officer of Icosavax. \"This support allowed us to assemble a world-class team and to help translate the scientific insights from IPD into IVX-121, our lead candidate for RSV. We are thrilled with the quality of the investor syndicate we have built who provide both significant expertise and financial support to enable advancement of IVX-121 into the clinic and the application of our VLP technology to a whole class of vaccine targets with significant unmet medical needs.\" VLPs enable high-density, multivalent display of antigens in a manner that closely resembles viruses, with an important difference. VLPs contain no genetic material, so they are non-infectious and can provide a safer alternative to live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines. Naturally occurring VLPs have delivered successful vaccines, including Gardasil\u00ae and Cervarix\u00ae against human papillomavirus (HPV) and Engerix-B\u00ae and Recombivax HB\u00ae against Hepatitis B. However, VLPs have been difficult to use for the display of complex heterologous antigens, like in the case of RSV. Mark McDade, who is managing partner of Qiming Venture Partners USA and was previously a founder, COO and director of Corixa Corporation (sold to GSK), said \"We were extremely impressed with this novel approach using computational protein design to create VLP-based vaccines that have improved efficacy and are simple to manufacture. Our investment in Icosavax supports the value of science and technology to improve public health and our belief that preventing infection is preferable to treating illness.\" \"Icosavax's vaccine technology solves the problem of constructing and manufacturing VLPs displaying complex antigens by utilizing computationally designed proteins that separate the folding of individual protein subunits from the assembly of the final macromolecular structure. The individual proteins are expressed and purified using traditional recombinant technologies, and then self-assemble into VLPs when mixed together,\" said Icosavax co-founder Neil King, Ph.D. VLPs are known to induce superior immunological responses compared to traditional soluble antigens, eliciting protective immune responses while reducing the need for strong adjuvants, which in some instances have been associated with side effects. The company's RSV vaccine candidate, IVX-121, incorporates a stabilized prefusion F antigen licensed from NIAID/NIH (DS-Cav1; Science 2019). Extensive preclinical studies conducted at IPD and Icosavax suggest that IVX-121 could increase the protective immunogenicity of RSV F compared to the DS-Cav1 antigen alone. Tadataka (Tachi) Yamada, M.D., chair of Icosavax's board of directors explained, \"RSV can cause a life-threatening respiratory infection with consequences as severe as those associated with influenza in older adults. An effective RSV vaccine could have an impact on the lives of millions of people around the world.\" Tachi previously served as chief medical and scientific officer of Takeda Pharmaceuticals, where he was responsible for the acquisitions of Inviragen (dengue vaccine) and LigoCyte (norovirus vaccine). The board of directors also includes Terry Gould, a partner and head of Growth Equity Investments, Adams Street Partners; Jason Hafler, the U.S. Head of Investments at Sanofi Ventures; Eric Moessinger, a partner of NanoDimension, Mark McDade, and Adam Simpson.

The funding was led by the JDRF T1D Fund, Sanofi Ventures, and the VTC Innovation and VTC Seed Fund, with participation from the Maryland Momentum Fund, the University of Vermont Health Network and TEDCO. Veralox is headquartered in Maryland and founded in 2017 by Drs. Jeffrey Strovel, David Maloney, and Matthew Boxer, three industry veterans with a track record of successful drug discovery and development. The company is currently developing therapeutics targeting 12- lipoxygenase (12-LOX). The new funding will be used to support the pre-clinical development of therapeutics to block the 12-LOX enzyme for several indications, including the rare hematological indication heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Veralox's lead candidate, VLX-1005, was discovered and developed in collaboration with University of California Santa Cruz, Thomas Jefferson University, NIH, and Eastern Virginia Medical School. \"We are excited to fuel our mission to advance the development of therapeutics for immunemediated disorders such as HITT and T1D,\" said Jeffrey Strovel, CEO of Veralox Therapeutics. \"With the support of the T1D Fund, Sanofi Ventures, and our other investors, we are well positioned to broaden the potential indications for our technology while ensuring sufficient capital to prepare for clinical studies in patients.\" \"Beta cell therapies are a key strategic area of focus for the T1D Fund and we believe Veralox's innovative approach to inhibiting beta cell stress has the potential to create a first-in-class drug targeting a novel pathway to address type 1 diabetes,\" said Katie Ellias, Managing Director at the JDRF T1D Fund. \"JDRF was an early supporter of work on this pathway, and we look forward to supporting the company and collaborating with Sanofi and the other investors to accelerate the development of this promising therapy.\" \"Veralox fits within our strategic investing mandate and we are excited by the potential for 12-LOX inhibition in both T1D and HITT.

NV-5138 is a first-in-class, orally-active small molecule that directly activates mTORC1, the gatekeeper of cellular metabolism and renewal, which is suppressed in the brain of people suffering from depression. \"NV-5138's direct activation of mTORC1 may deliver significant advantages over antidepressants that only indirectly activate this master metabolic control switch, offering the potential for rapid-acting antidepressant benefits without the psychotomimetic side effects and abuse potential observed with many N-methyl-D-aspartic-acid (NMDA) receptor targeted therapeutics,\" said Thomas E. Hughes, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Navitor. \"The positive results from the single ascending dose portion of our Phase 1 clinical study of NV-5138 in healthy volunteers support advancement into Part B, and we are now evaluating a single dose of the compound in patients suffering with TRD. We look forward to the initial top-line data from this study in the middle of 2019.\" The Phase 1, multicenter, two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NV-5138 in up to 88 subjects, including healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with TRD. In Part A, the single-ascending-dose portion of the study, up to 48 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment in six cohorts. In Part B of the study, approximately 40 subjects diagnosed with TRD are being randomized to receive either a single dose of NV-5138 or placebo. Secondary efficacy outcome measures for Part B include standard depression rating and symptomology scores such as the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). \"In multiple standard preclinical models of depressive behavior and cognition, we have shown that a single dose of NV-5138 stimulates mTORC1, enhances protein expression within hours, and increases synaptic growth in key, relevant brain regions, resulting in sustained antidepressant behavioral responses,\" stated George P. Vlasuk, Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Navitor. \"These behavioral changes and increases in synaptogenesis were consistent with the effects of NMDA receptor modulators such as ketamine; however, NV-5138 works through direct, post-synaptic activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and may therefore offer the potential for an improved safety and tolerability profile. Part B of our Phase 1 trial will offer important insights on the candidate's potential in this difficult-to-treat patient population.\" About NV-5138 NV-5138 is an orally bioavailable, small molecule that directly and transiently activates mTORC1, the master modulator of cellular metabolism, which is often suppressed in the brain of patients suffering from depression. NV-5138 binds to and modulates sestrin, a newly discovered cellular sensor protein for the amino acid leucine, a potent natural activator of mTORC1. As opposed to many other organ systems like skeletal muscle, leucine is a poor activator of mTORC1 in the brain since it is principally used as a metabolic precursor for neurotransmitter and protein synthesis. NV-5138 was designed to avoid the metabolic fate of leucine in the brain and thus serves as an effective activator of mTORC1 in this tissue. Results from preclinical models demonstrate that oral administration of NV-5138 produces rapid upregulation of key synaptic proteins, synaptic remodeling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, sustained antidepressant behavioral responses, cognitive improvements and compound-specific spectral power changes, as measured by quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). Navitor's strong intellectual property portfolio includes composition of matter patent protection for NV-5138 and related compounds. About mTORC1 mTORC1, or Complex 1 of the mechanistic target of rapamycin, activity governs the pace and ability of the cell to synthesize protein and other cellular components. Increased mTORC1 activity contributes to a broad array of diseases of aging by increasing protein misfolding and driving cellular stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. In other disease states such as severe depression, inadequate mTORC1 activity contributes to disease pathology by limiting energy utilization and protein synthesis, leading to impaired function. Multiple preclinical studies have shown that mTORC1 activation is required for the efficacy of many rapid-acting antidepressant compounds, including but not limited to modulators of the N-methyl-D-aspartic-acid (NMDA)-mediated signaling pathway like ketamine.1 About Navitor Navitor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is the leader in the development of mTORC1-targeted therapeutics designed to help patients live longer and healthier lives. The Company's proprietary platform enables true modulation of mTORC1, the gatekeeper of cellular metabolism and renewal, with the first-ever absolutely selective mTORC1 inhibition and the unique ability for mTORC1 activation. Navitor's lead clinical-stage candidate, NV-5138, is a small molecule that directly activates mTORC1 and is being developed for treatment-resistant depression, with additional opportunities in cognition and memory. The Company's NValog program, which provides unprecedented selectivity in mTORC1 inhibition, is initially targeting chronic kidney disease and has broad potential application for age-related diseases.

Contact: Lissette Steele Verge Scientific Communications 202.930.4762 lsteele@vergescientific.c NEW YORK, Oct. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ovid Therapeutics Inc.(NASDAQ: OVID), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines that transform the lives of people with rare neurological diseases, today announced it has received the 2018 CDKL5 Forum Company Making a Difference Award for initiation of the Phase 2 ARCADE trial with OV935/TAK- 935, and its commitment to the CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) patient community. The award was announced today in London, UK at the CDKL5 Forum, the largest annual conference on the advancement of science and therapeutic development for CDD. CDD is a rare, severe, neurological disorder that causes frequent, treatmentresistent seizures in the first few months of life. CDD results in a constellation of severe challenges, including developmental delay and intellectual disability, movement disorder, difficulty sleeping, scoliosis, visual impairment, microcephaly and various gastrointestinal difficulties. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for CDD. \"We hand out the Company Making a Difference Award annually to recognize industry partners for their commitment and support, and this year we are pleased to recognize the team at Ovid Therapeutics,\" said Ana Mingorance, Ph.D., chief development officer of Loulou Foundation. \"Since the day Ovid selected CDD as a condition to pursue, they have shown amazing support and care for our community, and we are excited to partner with such a humancentric organization.\" The ARCADE trial is a Phase 2 multi-center, open-label, pilot study designed to evaluate the treatment of OV935 in pediatric patients with epileptic seizures associated with CDD or Duplication 15q (Dup15q) syndrome. The first patients have already been enrolled into ARCADE. This study is part of a global collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. \"We are honored to be recognized for our dedication and efforts to bring a novel treatment option to the clinic for those with CDD and other rare epilepsies,\" said Amit Rakhit, M.D., MBA, chief medical and portfolio management officer of Ovid Therapeutics. \"It was important to everyone at Ovid that I travel to London to accept this award to show our unwavering support and partnership with the CDD community. We thank LouLou Foundation and the community and look forward to providing updates on our progress with the ARCADE study.\" The CDKL5 Forum is a unique community of collaboration and knowledge exchange, made up of leading scientists, clinicians and company representatives from around the world, united in the mission of better understanding the CDKL5 gene and disorder. The objective is to share current research on CDKL5 and to stimulate peer-group discussion and brainstorming around existing and future avenues of research and therapeutic approaches, in order to accelerate treatments and ultimately find cures for this neuro-genetic disorder. Now in its fourth year, the Forum represents the flagship annual event of the CDKL5 Program of Excellence, established by the Loulou Foundation and the Orphan Disease Center of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. About the ARCADE Trial ARCADE is a Phase 2, multi-center, open-label, pilot study that will evaluate the treatment of OV935 in pediatric patients, aged 2 to 17 years old, with epileptic seizures associated with CDD or Dup15q syndrome. The primary endpoint is the change in motor seizure frequency in patients treated with OV935 by disorder (CDD and Dup15q). The key secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, including percentage of participants considered treatment responders, change in CGI-S/C and correlation of OV935 concentration and plasma 24HC levels. ARCADE is expected to enroll approximately 15 children with each condition at clinical trial sites in the United States. This study consists of a four to six week screening period to establish baseline seizure frequency followed by a 12-week treatment period (2-week dose titration and 10-week maintenance period.) To learn more about ARCADE visit clinicaltrials.gov or www.arcadestudy.com. At the end of treatment, eligible patients can roll over into the ENDYMION study. Additional details on the ENDYMION clinical trial can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov. About Cyclin-Dependent 5 (CDKL5) Deficiency Disorder (CDD) 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder, also known as CDD, is a rare, severe, neurological disorder caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene on the X-chromosome. The CDKL5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal brain and neuron development, and may play a role in regulating the activity of other genes. CDD causes early onset and treatment resistant epilepsy in the first few months of life. Other common features of CDD include severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, poor fine motor skills, difficulty sleeping, scoliosis, visual impairment, microcephaly and various gastrointestinal difficulties. About Duplication (Dup15q) Syndrome Duplication 15q syndrome, also known as Dup15q syndrome, is a rare, severe, neurological disorder that results from duplications of chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1. In most cases, the chromosome mutation is not inherited but occurs during formation of reproductive cells or during embryonic development. Those with Dup15q syndrome experience seizures, hypotonia (poor muscle tone), developmental delays and intellectual disability. Difficult to control seizures are the most devastating symptom of Dup15qii. The severity of Dup15q and associated symptoms varies based on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. There is insufficient demographic data to determine the prevalence of Dup15q in the general population. About Investigational OV935/TAK-935 OV935/TAK-935 is a potent, highly-selective, first-in-class inhibitor of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H) being investigated as an anti-epileptic drug (AED). CH24H is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis. CH24H converts cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol (24HC), which then exits the brain into the blood plasma circulation. Glutamate is one of the main neurotransmitters in the brain and has been shown to play a role in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. Recent literature indicates CH24H is involved in over-activation of the glutamatergic pathway through modulation of the NMDA channel, implying its potential role in central nervous system diseases such as epilepsy. Ovid and Takeda believe that OV935's novel mechanism of action may potentially treat rare epilepsies by inhibiting CH24H to decrease 24HC levels, effectively decreasing glutamate hyperactivity. To Ovid and Takeda's knowledge, OV935 is the only molecule with this mechanism of action in clinical development. OV935 is an investigational drug, not approved for commercial use. OV935 has successfully completed four Phase 1 clinical studies, which have assessed tolerability, PK and target engagement at doses believed to be therapeutically relevant. In preclinical models, a novel proprietary PET ligand was used to determine target occupancy of OV935 in the brain. OV935 is being co-developed by Ovid and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to OV935 for the treatment of both Dravet syndrome and LGS. About Ovid Therapeutics Ovid Therapeutics (NASDAQ: OVID) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company using its BoldMedicine approach to develop medicines that transform the lives of patients with rare neurological disorders. Ovid has a broad pipeline of potential first-in-class medicines. The company's lead investigational medicine, OV101, is currently in development for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome.

We expect these and future data to support selection of an ACTR product candidate to progress into potential registration trials in patients with r/r NHL.\" Enrollment and ACTR707 dosing in the second dose cohort (60x106 ACTR+ T cells) of the ATTCK-20-03 trial has been completed and dose escalation is proceeding. The Company expects to present additional data from this study later this year. Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of ACTR707, Autologous T Lymphocytes Expressing an Antibody-Coupled T Cell Receptor, in Combination with Rituximab in Subjects with Relapsed or Sunday, September 30, 2018, 11:45am - 2:15pm Location: New York Marriott Marquis, Westside Ballroom ATTCK-20-03 is a Phase I, multi-center, open label, single arm clinical trial evaluating ACTR707 in combination with rituximab in patients with r/r NHL. Eligible patients for enrollment must have, among other criteria, received adequate prior anti-lymphoma therapy, including rituximab and chemotherapy, for their CD20-positive r/r NHL. Key eligibility criteria include: pre-specified eligible NHL subtypes, including DLBCL, disease progression following immediate prior therapy, adequate organ function and performance status, and measurable disease. The trial design includes a dose escalation phase using an adaptive design, followed by a cohort expansion phase. Primary study objectives are to characterize the safety of ACTR707 in combination with rituximab and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and proposed recommended Phase 2 dose. Secondary study objectives include: assessment of the anti-lymphoma activity of the combination, ACTR707 persistence, rituximab pharmacokinetics, and inflammatory markers and cytokine levels. Following leukapheresis, each patient receives lymphodepletion followed by the first infusion of rituximab and then a single infusion of ACTR707. Rituximab infusions continue on a regular, pre-specified schedule. Data in the first cohort of the trial demonstrate complete responses at the first response assessment in 3/6 patients treated with ACTR707 in combination with rituximab, two of which remained ongoing at the time of the most recent data cut off. There were no serious or severe adverse events of cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or autoimmune events. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were mostly hematologic were detectable in all subjects and ACTR+ T cells persisted in the presence of continued rituximab administration. These results support the continued dose escalation of ACTR707 in combination with rituximab.

About ACTR707 ACTR707 is an investigational drug that may represent an important construct not only for adult patients with CD20+ r/r NHL, when used in combination with rituximab, but also for patients with other cancer types when used in combination with other antibodies. ACTR707 was identified through a comprehensive high-throughput screening effort aimed at identifying receptors with improved functional characteristics across several dimensions. In preclinical testing, ACTR707 demonstrated potent activity against a wide range of hematologic and solid tumor cancers. Given the challenges of the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment, Unum believes that ACTR707's increased activity may be particularly important in addressing solid tumor cancers. ACTR707 is currently being tested in combination with rituximab in patients with r/r NHL in a Phase I multi-center open label clinical trial, ATTCK-20-03. Testing is expected to be initiated later in 2018 in ATTCK-34-01, a Phase I multi-center open label clinical trial exploring the combination of ACTR707 with trastuzumab in patients with HER2+ advanced Therapeutics Unum Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel immunotherapy products designed to harness the power of a patient's immune system to cure cancer. Unum's novel proprietary technology, antibody-coupled T cell receptor (ACTR) is a universal, engineered cell therapy intended to be used in combination with a wide range of tumor-specific antibodies to target different tumor types. ACTR087 and ACTR707, each used in combination with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, are Unum's two most advanced product candidates, currently in Phase I clinical testing in adult patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL). The Company has an additional product candidate in Phase I clinical testing: ACTR087 used in combination with the novel antibody SEA-BCMA in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Finally, the Company has an active investigational new drug application (IND) for ACTR707 used in combination with trastuzumab, an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody, to treat patients with HER2+ advanced cancer. This Phase I trial is expected to be initiated by the end of 2018. The Company is headquartered in Cambridge, MA. Forward looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements.

Share on LinkedIn Twitter ---- Deborah Kilpatrick, Ph.D. CEO Evidation Health | www.evidation.com 650.906.7641 - Poster presentation of STARS topline data: the first clinical trial to show a positive clinical benefit on overall Angelman syndrome impairments - NEW YORK, Aug. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ovid Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: OVID), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines that transform the lives of people with rare neurological diseases, today announced that an abstract on OV101 was accepted for poster presentation at the 65th American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) Annual Meeting taking place in Seattle, Wash., October 22 to 27, 2018. AACAP is the largest international gathering of child and adolescent psychiatrists. Angelman syndrome is a rare, lifelong, genetic disorder that affects 1 in 15,000 people in the general population. It is characterized by severe impairment in behavior, learning, verbal communication, motor skills, and sleep, and there are no FDA-approved medicines or an established treatment paradigm for this condition. If approved, OV101 could be the first medicine to specifically target a key underlying neurological dysfunction of Angelman syndrome: impaired tonic inhibition, which is most commonly caused by a disruption of the ubiquitin protein ligase (UBE3A) gene. Poster presentation details Title: Topline Results from a Phase 2 Adult and Adolescent Angelman Syndrome Clinical Trial: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Safety and Efficacy Study of Gaboxadol (OV101) Session: New Research Poster Session 3 Date and Time: Thursday, October 25, 2018, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. ET Topline data from the STARS trial were announced on August 6, 2018. About OV101 OV101 (gaboxadol) is believed to be the only delta ()-selective GABAA receptor agonist in development and the first investigational drug to specifically target the disruption of tonic inhibition, a central physiological process of the brain that is thought to be the underlying cause of certain neurodevelopmental disorders. OV101 has been demonstrated in laboratory studies and animal models to selectively activate the -subunit of GABAA receptors, which are found in the extrasynaptic space (outside of the synapse), and thereby impact neuronal activity through tonic inhibition. Ovid is developing OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome to potentially restore tonic inhibition and relieve several of the symptoms of these disorders. In preclinical studies, it was observed that OV101 improved symptoms of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. This compound has also previously been tested in over 4,000 patients (over 1,000 patient-years of exposure) and was observed to have favorable safety and bioavailability profiles. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for OV101 for both the treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted Ovid patents directed to methods of treating Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome using OV101. The issued patents expire in 2035. About Ovid Therapeutics Ovid Therapeutics (NASDAQ: OVID) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company using its BoldMedicine approach to develop medicines that transform the lives of patients with rare neurological disorders. Ovid has a broad pipeline of first-in-class medicines. The company's lead investigational medicine, OV101, is currently in development for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. Ovid is also developing OV935/TAK-935 in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the treatment of rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE).

He holds a Ph.D. in nutritional biochemistry from Tufts University, an M.S. in zoology from Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University and a B.A. in biology from Franklin and Marshall College. About NV5138 NV5138 is an orally bioavailable, small molecule that is designed to directly and transiently activate mTORC1 activity by binding to and modulating a newly discovered cellular sensor protein for the amino acid leucine, which is a potent natural activator of mTORC1. Unlike leucine, oral administration of NV5138 results in significant mTORC1 pathway activation in the brain since it is not broken down or incorporated into new proteins. These properties make NV5138 a unique agent with which to evaluate the role of mTORC1 in brain disorders, such as depression, where mTORC1 activity is often suppressed. Results from preclinical models demonstrate that NV5138 produces rapid upregulation of key synaptic proteins, synaptogenesis and sustained antidepressant behavioral responses via the transient and direct activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Since NV5138 does not directly modulate the NMDA receptor pathway, it may not have the side effects and abuse potential observed with several NMDA receptor therapeutics currently in development. NV 5138 is currently being clinically studied for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with an initial focus on treatmentresistant depression (TRD). About Navitor Navitor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.is realizing the potential of modulating mTORC1, the master regulator of cellular function, to develop a pipeline of therapeutics that help patients live longer and healthier lives. Our industry leading team is unlocking the promise of recent discoveries in mTORC1 biology to address a broad range of chronic diseases. Our initial clinical application is a firstinclass drug to address unmet needs in depression. For more information, please visit www.navitorpharma.com. Contact: The Yates Network Kathryn Morris, 9142046412 kathryn@theyatesnetwork.com Launches First, Purpose-Built Data Platform to Measure and Better Understand How Everyday Behavior Data, Medical Conditions, and Symptoms Interact SAN MATEO, CALIF., August 1, 2018 - Evidation Health, a health and measurement company that helps life sciences and health care companies understand how everyday behaviors and health interact, announced today that it has raised $30 million in Series C funding. The round was co-led by SV Health Investors, a new investor, and existing investor B Capital Group. It included participation from existing investors GE Ventures and Sanofi Ventures. With this funding, Evidation has raised a total of $61 million. Evidation also announced that it launched a new data platform to enable its customers to analyze and process large-scale sensor and behavior data in clinically meaningful ways. \"Our new data platform makes it easier for statisticians and data scientists at life sciences and health care companies to take everyday behavior and health care data, analyze it, and create a new understanding of health,\" said Evidation Health CEO Deborah Kilpatrick, Ph.D. \"This will help Evidation speed a transformation in real world research and knowledge, so we can better treat, diagnose, and predict the onset of disease.\" By linking real world data from smartphones and connected sensors \u2014 including wearables and medical devices \u2014 with traditional medical data, Evidation measures how behaviors outside of the doctor's office or hospital relate to health and impact outcomes. The new data platform \u2014 which has been battle tested in a pilot program with a leading, global pharmaceutical company \u2014 can ingest individually-permissioned data from more than 100 sources ranging from Apple Health to Fitbit, Epic, Blue Button, and Dexcom. The platform marries this information with traditional data from insurance claims, electronic health records, and diagnostic reports, alongside patient-reported outcomes collected directly through Evidation's platform. This provides a new opportunity to analyze individual behavior and health in real time, not just when someone checks in with a physician or stops to record what they did or felt. \"Evidation's data platform is opening up exciting new possibilities in medical research and the way we treat and prevent disease,\" said P. Murali Doraiswamy, M.D., professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University Health System, and an advisor to Evidation. \"With its unique analytics and methods, Evidation is transforming data into the kind of findings that traditional clinical trials may need substantially longer time frames, maybe even decades, to achieve. This will help identify health risks earlier and better treat the kinds of chronic diseases that scientists are working to cure.\" The secure, private platform currently processes more than 1 trillion data points each year across millions of individuals. It is built to manage the scale of high volume, continuous data streams and eliminates the need for infrastructure, data, and feature engineering on the part of Evidation customers, allowing them to focus entirely on analytics. Already, the platform is being used to invent new ways to measure health across diabetes and cognitive decline. This complements the work that the company is performing with partners across multiple therapeutic areas ranging from cardiovascular disease to chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, depression and anxiety, fatigue, heart failure, and asthma \u2014 to name a few. In addition to supporting the new data platform, the funding will be used to develop partnerships, adding to Evidation's vast array of real world data sources, and to launch novel research studies to better understand and measure how everyday behavior and health interact. \"We're excited to deepen our partnership with Evidation Health and continue supporting the team as they build the leading platform to generate clinical relevance from everyday behavior data in real world populations.

INZ-701, the Company's lead therapeutic candidate, is in pre-clinical development for the treatment of patients with ENPP1 Deficiency, a serious and life-threatening calcification disorder that manifests as generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) in infants and hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 (ARHR2) post-infancy. \"Orphan Drug Designation, both in the United States and the European Union, is an important regulatory milestone for Inozyme as we continue our quest to develop INZ-701 for patients with rare and life-threatening calcification disorders,\" said Axel Bolte, co-founder and chief executive officer of Inozyme. \"The dual designations from the FDA and EMA provide crucial momentum for INZ-701, putting us in an excellent position to rapidly advance the clinical development program for this novel enzyme replacement therapy.\" The FDA and EMA respectively grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended for safe and effective treatment of rare, life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States or fewer than one in 2,000 individuals in Europe. By receiving Orphan Drug Designation, Inozyme qualifies for certain regulatory and financial incentives, including scientific assistance, fee reductions, tax credits and seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S., as well as 10 years of market exclusivity post-authorization in the European Union. About ENPP1 Deficiency The ENPP1 gene produces a critical enzyme pyrophosphatase/ phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), which regulates inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels in plasma. PPi is essential for preventing harmful soft tissue calcification and for regulating normal bone mineralization. ENPP1 Deficiency manifests as either generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) type 1 or autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 (ARHR2). GACI type 1 is a devastating and often fatal disease affecting infants and is characterized by calcification and narrowing of large and medium-sized arteries, resulting in heart failure and death in about half of patients within the first six months of life. ARHR2 manifests in the post-infancy stage and causes rickets, weakened bones, repeated bone fractures, skeletal deformities, short stature, muscle weakness, fatigue, and bone pain. About INZ-701 INZ-701 is an enzyme replacement therapy under development with the intention to be used for the treatment of calcification disorders of the circulatory system, bones, and kidneys. In pre-clinical studies, the experimental therapy has shown potential to generate plasma pyrophosphate (PPi) and to restore it to appropriate physiological levels, thereby preventing calcification in the vasculature and kidneys and normalizing bone. Inozyme is developing INZ-701 for certain rare, life-threatening and devastating genetic disorders such as ENPP1 Deficiency (GACI and ARHR2) and pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) in which PPi levels are below the normal physiological levels.

NV5138 is a novel small molecule that directly activates mTORC1, a master cellular regulator that has recently been shown to be a central signaling pathway required for the efficacy of several rapid acting antidepressants. NV5138 is initially being evaluated in TRD but may offer future potential for the treatment in the broader disease category of major depressive disorder (MDD.) \"We are enthusiastic about initiating clinical development with NV5138 for major depressive disorder, as we believe this novel activator of mTORC1 has the potential to offer a unique approach to meeting many of the unmet needs of this serious and chronic disease. Millions of patients with depression do not adequately respond to standard pharmacological therapies which can take weeks or months before patients experience their effects, if at all, \"said George P. Vlasuk, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Navitor. \"We see the development of NV5138 in MDD/TRD as a pioneering advance toward realizing the therapeutic potential of modulating the mTORC1 signaling pathway to treat a wide range of chronic human diseases.\" The Phase 1, multicenter, twopart, doubleblind, placebocontrolled study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NV5138 in up to 88 subjects, including healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with TRD. In Part A, the singleascendingdose portion of the study, up to 48 healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to doubleblind treatment in six dosagelevel cohorts. Within each cohort, six subjects will be randomized to receive NV5138 and two subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. In Part B of the study, approximately 40 subjects diagnosed with TRD will be randomly assigned to doubleblind treatment at a single dosage level that will be established based on data from Part A of the study. Other prespecified outcome measures to be evaluated in Part B include standard depression rating and symptomology scores such as the Montgomery\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). \"Initiation of this clinical study is supported by preclinical studies demonstrating the potential of NV5138 as an oral treatment for depression through activation of mTORC1, a cellular pathway that appears to underlie the beneficial effects of several in a new class of rapidly acting antidepressants,\" said Maurizio Fava, MD, Director of the Division of Clinical Research of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Research Institute and member of the Navitor Clinical Advisory Board. Previously, Navitor has presented preclinical results on the efficacy of NV5138 in multiple models of depressionlike behavior, which demonstrated that NV5138 produced behavioral responses and concomitant increases in new synapses (synaptogenesis) consistent with a rapidacting antidepressant through transient, direct activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway in the brain. Navitor leveraged multiple preclinical observations that have shown mTORC1 activation is required for the efficacy of many rapidacting antidepressant compounds including several modulators of the NMDA (NmethylDaspartic acid)mediated signaling pathway like ketamine, which is an active area of innovative drug development for depression. About Treatment Resistant Depression and Treatment Options Treatmentresistant depression (TRD) is a subset of major depressive disorder (MDD) that refers to depressive episodes that are not adequately controlled by standard antidepressant therapy. Several studies including a postmortem analysis of healthy and severely depressed patients as well as multiple preclinical settings have suggested an association between the activity of mTORC1 pathway signaling and depression. Standard antidepressant therapies, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are only modestly effective and have a very slow onset typically taking 68 weeks to show efficacy. Newer drugs that antagonize or otherwise modulate the presynaptic glutamate NmethylDaspartic acid (NMDA) receptor, have demonstrated the potential for improved efficacy with a rapid onset of antidepressant effects (days as opposed to weeks) and today there are several NMDA modulators in clinical development for depression, including ketamine and related agents. Unfortunately, presynaptic NMDA receptor modulation can cause significant side effects including dissociation (hallucination) and has abuse potential. About Rapid Acting Antidepressants and mTORC1 Activity New antidepressant drugs that modulate the presynaptic glutamate NmethylDaspartic acid (NMDA) receptor, have demonstrated the potential for improved efficacy with a rapid onset of antidepressant effects (days as opposed to weeks) and today there are several NMDA modulators in clinical development for depression, including ketamine and related agents. Since the initial observations connecting NMDA receptor modulation and depression, scientists have demonstrated that these agents increase production of key synaptic signaling proteins resulting in synaptogenesis and have also elucidated the mechanism that underlies the therapeutic antidepressant benefit seen with these agents in specific preclinical settings. This new research demonstrates that presynaptic NMDA receptor modulation transiently activates the postsynaptic mTORC1 signaling pathway and this activation is required to initiate the cellular processes like protein synthesis that lead to the synaptogenesis and antidepressant effects of these agents. Although the initial target engagement of these agents occurs within a short time frame of a few hours, this transient activation of mTORC1 results in sustained, longlasting synaptic and behavioral effects that persist for days to even weeks after a single treatment. About NV5138 NV5138 is an orally bioavailable, small molecule that is designed to directly and transiently activate mTORC1 activity by binding to and modulating a newly discovered cellular sensor protein for the amino acid leucine, which is a potent natural activator of mTORC1. Unlike leucine, oral administration of NV5138 results in significant mTORC1 pathway activation in the brain since it is not broken down or incorporated into new proteins. These properties make NV5138 a unique agent with which to evaluate the role of mTORC1 in brain disorders, such as depression, where mTORC1 activity is often suppressed. Results from preclinical models demonstrate that NV5138 produces rapid upregulation of key synaptic proteins, synaptogenesis and sustained antidepressant behavioral responses via the transient and direct activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Since NV5138 does not directly modulate the NMDA receptor pathway, it may not have the side effects and abuse potential observed with several NMDA receptor therapeutics currently in development. NV 5138 is currently being clinically studied for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with an initial focus on treatmentresistant depression (TRD). About Navitor Navitor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is realizing the potential of modulating mTORC1, the master regulator of cellular function, to develop a pipeline of therapeutics that help patients live longer and healthier lives. Our industry leading team is unlocking the promise of recent discoveries in mTORC1 biology to address a broad range of chronic diseases.

Conway, mary@sternir.com Media Contact: Paul Kidwell, 617-680-1088 paul.kidwell@unumrx.com - G100 directly targets and modifies TLR4 expressing malignant B cells making them more visible to the anti-tumor immune response- SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., June 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), an immunotherapy company focused on novel therapies in oncology, today announced preclinical and translational data that support the mechanism of action of G100 in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin Follicular lymphomas (FL). These data were presented at the Inaugural AACR International Meeting Advances in Malignant Lymphoma: Maximizing the Basic-Translational Interface for Clinical Application 2018 in Boston. The research presented was designed to understand why high TLR 4 expression in patient's samples correlated with clinical responses to G100 treatment. By analyzing patient samples, cell lines and mouse lymphoma models the following was observed: - Murine and human B-lymphoma cell lines express TLR4 and respond in vitro to G100 stimulation with upregulation of MHC-II and co-stimulatory markers CD40 and CD80, typical of the activation of antigen-presenting function of B-cells; - In vivo murine tumors of lymphoma models respond to treatment with G100 in injected tumors as well as distal, untreated tumors showing local and abscopal tumor control, mediated by systemic T-cell response; - Approximately 70% of follicular lymphoma patients in a Phase 1/2 study express TLR4 in >50% of tumor cells in baseline biopsies. TLR4 expression ranging from 10%-100% of tumor cells was also detected in biopsies of patients with marginal zone lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; and - In an ongoing Phase 2 trial of G100 with low dose radiation and pembrolizumab, almost all patients with an objective tumor response (\u00b350% tumor shrinkage) showed TLR4 expression in >50% of tumor cells. \"These data illustrate that in addition to the known activation by G100 of dendritic cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, G100 can also act directly on malignant B cells expressing TLR4. G100 treated malignant B cells may become more visible to the anti-tumor immune response, which correlates with clinical responses following intratumoral therapy with G100.\" said Jan ter Meulen, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Immune Design. \"In FL patients, a strong correlation was observed between expression of TLR4 in more than 50% of tumor cells and objective responses following G100 therapy. This discovery potentially allows for a TLR4 biomarker-targeted G100 therapy of other tumor types, independent of histology.\" The full poster presentation can be accessed from the publications page of the Immune Design website. About G100 G100 is a product candidate from Immune Design's internal discovery platforms and contains a potent synthetic small molecule toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA). G100 leverages the activation of both innate and adaptive immunity in the tumor microenvironment to create an immune response against the tumor's preexisting diverse set of antigens. A growing set of clinical and preclinical data have demonstrated the ability of G100 to activate tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, and promote antigen-presentation and the recruitment of T cells to the tumor. The ensuing induction of local and systemic immune responses has been shown to result in local and abscopal (shrinking of tumors outside the scope of the localized treatment) tumor control. G100 was evaluated in a Phase 1 study in Merkel cell carcinoma patients and produced a 50% overall response rate per protocol and a favorable safety profile. Currently, G100 is being evaluated as both a monotherapy (with local radiation) and in combination with Merck's anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, pursuant to a clinical collaboration with Merck, in a randomized Phase 1/2 trial in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma. About Immune Design Immune Design is a late-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to generate and/or expand antigen-specific cytotoxic immune cells to fight cancer and other chronic diseases. CMB305 and G100, the leading product candidates with broad potential in oncology, are based on the company's two technology platforms that are potent stimulators of the immune system - ZVex \u00ae and GLAAS\u00ae - the fundamental technologies of which were licensed from the California Institute of Technology and the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI), respectively.

Contact Information: Adam Brickman (914) 548-3748 13, 2018 - Inozyme Pharma (Inozyme), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing treatments for rare and debilitating diseases, today introduced a no-cost, third-party genetic testing program designed to improve detection and understanding of two rare calcification disorders. Offered globally and in partnership with PreventionGenetics, the Inozyme program tests eligible participants for mutations in the ENPP1 and ABCC6 genes. Both of these genes are implicated in rare, severe calcification disorders, known as ENPP1 deficiency and ABCC6 deficiency, respectively, (sometimes called generalized arterial calcification of infancy and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 [ARHR2]). \"The genetic testing program introduced today will help to enhance our understanding of ENPP1 deficiency and ABCC6 deficiency, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis and developing effective treatments,\" said Axel Bolte, co-founder and chief executive officer of Inozyme. \"We urge people with a family history of calcification disorders and their physicians to seek more information about the genetic testing program. Over time and through ongoing research, we hope to alleviate the life-limiting and life-threatening impact of these severe diseases.\" Inozyme created the genetic testing program to increase disease awareness, reduce barriers to genetic testing, and help people and their healthcare providers make more informed decisions about these rare conditions. \"The Inozyme genetic testing program will provide an early diagnostic testing measure for ENPP1 and ABCC6 deficiencies, which are indicators of serious calcification disorders that sometimes take years to diagnose accurately,\" said James Weber, president of PreventionGenetics. \"Access to reliable genetic testing may help shorten the diagnostic journey for patients, potentially lifting a significant emotional burden and paving the way for more timely and effective intervention. We are excited to work with Inozyme as we make the test available to physicians and their patients.\" The no-cost program offered by Inozyme and PreventionGenetics provides genetic testing to those who qualify. Although genetic testing can confirm a suspected diagnosis of a calcification disorder linked to ENPP1 or ABCC6 gene mutations, the absence of a genetic alteration does not preclude diagnosis of such a disease. For more information about the genetic testing program, please visit: www.inozyme.com/genetic-testing/. About ENPP1 Deficiency The ENPP1 gene pyrophosphatase/ phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), which regulates inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels in plasma. PPi is essential for preventing harmful soft tissue calcification and for regulating normal bone mineralization. ENPP1 deficiency manifests as either generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) type 1 or autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 (ARHR2). GACI type 1 is a devastating and often fatal disease affecting infants and is characterized by calcification and narrowing of large and medium-sized arteries, resulting in heart failure and death in about half of patients within the first six months of life. ARHR2 usually manifests in the post-infancy stage, though it can occur in patients without prior GACI. ARHR2 causes rickets, weakened bones, repeated bone fractures, skeletal deformities, short stature, muscle weakness, fatigue and bone pain. About ABCC6 Deficiency Defects in the ABCC6 gene (ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 6) lead to a decrease in plasma PPi and consequently to soft tissue calcification, and in rare circumstances cause GACI type 2 in infants.

Clinical sites will soon be open for enrollment initially in the US, with information available at www.synovatestudy.com. \"Patients with advanced synovial sarcoma often have few systemic treatment options immediately after they complete first line chemotherapy. Clinically, we often give them a break from therapy, following closely with the hope that they will not progress in the relatively short time period that is unfortunately common in this disease,\" said William D. Tap, M.D., Medical Oncology and Chief, Sarcoma Medical Oncology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. \"It is our hope that CMB305 may offer a new option for patients to receive a potentially beneficial therapy that will defer the need for subsequent therapy.\" SYNOVATE is a randomized, global Phase 3 clinical trial that will evaluate CMB305 monotherapy versus placebo in 248 patients 12 years of age and older with NY-ESO-1 positive, unresectable, locally-advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma. Patients who are responding to a first-line therapy can become eligible for SYNOVATE following completion of their chemotherapy. SYNOVATE will be opened and recruiting patients in cancer centers throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. \"We are very pleased to be working with high quality clinical groups around the country and internationally to launch the SYNOVATE study to explore CMB305 immunotherapy in patients with synovial sarcoma,\" said Sergey Yurasov, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Immune Design. \"SYNOVATE is the first randomized, global Phase 3 trial of an immunotherapy focused in synovial sarcoma, and we hope it results in a new, approved therapy for these patients.\" Patient and Health Care Provider Resouces for SYNOVATE Study Information can be found on the SYNOVATE website at www.synovatestudy.com and on the NIH clinical trial registry www.clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03520959). About Synovial Sarcoma Soft tissue sarcomas are malignancies that arise from the soft tissues of the body, such as tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures including muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and the lining of joints. Synovial sarcoma is a sub type of soft tissue sarcoma where 70% of diagnoses occur in patients under 40 years old, is associated with a high risk of recurrence, and has been shown to have high expression of the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen. The primary treatment for patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma typically consists of an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen administered alone or in combination with other agents. Following disease progression after first line systemic therapy, treatment options are limited and median overall survival rates have been reported to be approximately 12 months. In connection with the planned Phase 3 study for CMB305 monotherapy, the FDA has agreed with Immune Design that synovial sarcoma patients constitute an unmet medical need. About CMB305 CMB305 is a prime-boost cancer vaccine targeting NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors. NY-ESO-1 is a cellular protein that is typically found only in certain cancer cells and is often frequently expressed in synovial sarcomas. CMB305 is administered to participants by injection and is designed to provide clinical benefit by generating an anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response by activating a participant's antigen-presenting dendritic cells. About Immune Design Immune Design is a late-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to generate and/or expand antigen-specific cytotoxic immune cells to fight cancer and other chronic diseases.

Mathews, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Rochester - Michael Zuker, Ph.D., of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute About RNA Targeted Small Molecule Medicines Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is a biomolecule that was once thought to be a simple messenger between DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, and protein. Recent advances in biology, however, have shown that RNA plays a much greater role than previously appreciated. This includes control of gene expression via long non-coding RNAs, RNA stability via small interfering RNAs, RNA translation via transfer RNAs and microRNAs, and even cellular communication (RNA exosomes). RNA can form higher order structures that form the basis of \"druggable\" surfaces and pockets that can be targeted by small molecule therapeutics. The best examples of RNA targeted small molecule medicines include several FDA approved classes of antibiotics that bind and inactivate key structures in bacterial RNAs. About Myotonic Dystrophy Type I Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) affects at least 1 in 8,000 people, or 40,000 individuals in the U.S. alone, and is the most frequent cause of adult onset muscular dystrophy. DM1 is caused by a toxic expansion in RNA, which leads to multi-systemic symptoms including muscular, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and central nervous system defects. This genetic disease often affects entire families, with progressively worsening disease across generations, and there are no effective treatment options available for DM1.

(NASDAQ:OVID), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines that transform the lives of people with rare neurological diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. \"This designation is an important milestone for both Ovid and the Angelman community as it enables increased dialog with the FDA, speeding our ability to bring this potential therapeutic option to people living with Angelman syndrome. We believe that OV101, with its novel mechanism of action, has the potential to be an innovative and impactful therapy,\" said Amit Rakhit, M.D., MBA, chief medical and portfolio management officer of Ovid Therapeutics. \"In addition to the regulatory milestones of orphan drug and Fast Track designations for Angelman syndrome, we achieved significant clinical progress with our OV101 program. As a result of positive Phase 1 data, we were recently able to expand our ongoing Phase 2 STARS clinical trial to include both adults and adolescents with Angelman syndrome. We look forward to data from the STARS trial in the second half of 2018.\" OV101 is a delta ()-selective GABAA receptor agonist that targets the disruption of tonic inhibition, a central physiological process of the brain that is thought to be the underlying cause of Angelman syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Ovid is currently studying OV101 in its Phase 2 STARS clinical trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the safety and efficacy of OV101 in patients with Angelman syndrome. Upon successful completion of a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study showing that OV101 has a similar PK profile in adolescents as in adults, Ovid recently amended the STARS protocol to include patients aged 13 years and older. The FDA's Fast Track process is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs used to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation enables the company to have early and frequent communication with the FDA throughout the drug development and review process, often leading to faster drug approval and patient access. About OV101 OV101 (gaboxadol) is believed to be the only delta ()-selective GABAA receptor agonist in development and the first investigational drug to specifically target the disruption of tonic inhibition, a central physiological process of the brain that is thought to be the underlying cause of certain neurodevelopmental disorders. OV101 has been demonstrated in laboratory studies and animal models to selectively activate the -subunit of GABAA receptors, which are found in the extrasynaptic space (outside of the synapse), and thereby impact neuronal activity through tonic inhibition. Ovid is developing OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome to potentially restore tonic inhibition and relieve several of the symptoms of these disorders. In preclinical studies, it was observed that OV101 improved symptoms of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. Gaboxadol has previously been tested in over 4,000 patients (approximately 950 patient-years of exposure) and was observed to have favorable safety and bioavailability profiles. The FDA has granted orphan drug and Fast Track designations for OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and orphan drug designation for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted Ovid patents directed to methods of treating Angelman syndrome using OV101. The issued patents expire in 2035 for Angelman syndrome. About Angelman Syndrome Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that is characterized by a variety of signs and symptoms. Characteristic features of this disorder include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, problems with movement and balance, seizures, sleep disorders and anxiety. The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is the disruption of a gene that codes for ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). Angelman syndrome affects approximately 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people in the U.S. There are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. Angelman syndrome is associated with a reduction in tonic inhibition, a function of the delta ()-selective GABAA receptor that allows a human brain to decipher excitatory and inhibitory neurological signals correctly without being overloaded. If tonic inhibition is reduced, the brain becomes inundated with signals and loses the ability to separate background noise from critical information. About Ovid Therapeutics Ovid Therapeutics (NASDAQ:OVID) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company using its BoldMedicine approach to develop therapies that transform the lives of patients with rare neurological disorders. Ovid's drug candidate, OV101, is currently in development for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. Ovid initiated the Phase 2 STARS trial of OV101 in people with Angelman syndrome in 2017 and completed a Phase 1 trial in adolescents with Angelman syndrome or Fragile X syndrome. Ovid is also developing OV935 in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the treatment of epileptic encephalopathies and in August 2017 initiated a Phase 1b/2a trial of OV935.

(NASDAQ:OVID), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines that transform the lives of people with rare neurological diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to TAK-935/OV935 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a severe and rare form of childhood epilepsy that typically presents during the first year of life. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and Ovid formed a global collaboration to develop and commercialize TAK-935/OV935 for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies in January 2017. Dravet syndrome is classified as a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, a group of rare epilepsies that cause significant morbidities and can worsen over time. Children with Dravet syndrome experience frequent seizures, loss of muscle control, cognitive deficits and, in approximately 10 percent of cases, death before the age of 12 years. Moreover, in those who survive into adulthood, their long-term intellectual development and seizure outcomes are typically extremely poor. \"We are pleased by the FDA's decision to grant orphan drug designation to TAK-935/OV935 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a severe and debilitating disease,\" said Dr. Emiliangelo Ratti, head of Takeda's Neuroscience Therapeutic Area Unit. \"This designation is a significant step forward in researching a potential treatment option for people living with Dravet syndrome for whom therapeutic options are severely limited, and an important milestone for this investigational molecule.\" TAK-935/OV935 is a potent, highly-selective, first-in-class inhibitor of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H). It is believed that CH24H is involved in over-activation of the glutamatergic pathway, which has been shown to play a role in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. To Ovid and Takeda's knowledge, TAK-935/OV935 is the only molecule with this mechanism of action in clinical development. \"We believe that TAK-935/OV935, with its novel mechanism of action, has the potential to be an innovative treatment for people with rare epilepsies, such as Dravet syndrome,\" said Matthew During M.D., DSc, FACP, FRACP, president and chief scientific officer of Ovid Therapeutics. \"We have rapidly advanced this program into a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and anticipate data in 2018. We look forward to continuing our work with Takeda to bring this potentially transformative therapy to patients.\" Orphan drug designation is intended to facilitate and expedite drug development for rare diseases for which there are no current treatments available. It also provides substantial benefits to the sponsor, including the potential for tax credits for clinical development costs, study-design assistance, and several years of market exclusivity for the product upon regulatory approval. About Dravet Syndrome Dravet syndrome is a severe form of childhood epilepsy that typically presents during the first year of life. It is believed to be largely caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene. Children experience frequent seizures, loss of muscle control, cognitive deficits and, in approximately 10 percent of cases, death before the age of 12 years. While some patients may survive into adulthood, their long-term intellectual development and seizure outcomes are typically extremely poor. The incidence of Dravet syndrome in the United States ranges from 1 in 15,700 to 1 in 20,900 births. Patients are frequently treated with combinations of classic anti-epileptic drugs, none of which are particularly effective. No drugs have been approved specifically for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in the United States and only one drug, the anticonvulsant stiripentol, has been approved in Europe. Dravet syndrome is one of several disorders which together are designated as developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. This group includes epilepsy syndromes associated with severe cognitive and behavioral disturbances. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines an epileptic encephalopathy as a condition in which \"the epileptiform EEG abnormalities themselves are believed to contribute to a progressive disturbance in cerebral function.\" These epilepsies cause significant morbidities for patients beyond what might be expected from the known underlying pathology alone and can worsen over time. Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies typically present early in life and are often associated with severe cognitive and developmental impairment in addition to frequent treatment-resistant seizures throughout the person's lifetime. These disorders vary in age of onset, developmental outcomes, etiologies, neuropsychological deficits, electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns, seizure types and prognosis. About TAK-935/OV935 TAK-935/OV935, which is being studied in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, is a potent, highly-selective, first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H). CH24H is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis. CH24H converts cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC), which then exits the brain into the blood plasma circulation. Glutamate is one of the main neurotransmitters in the brain and has been shown to play a role in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. Recent literature indicates 24HC is involved in over-activation of the glutamatergic pathway through modulation of the NMDA channel, implying its potential role in central nervous system diseases such as epilepsy. To Ovid and Takeda's knowledge, TAK-935/OV935 is the only molecule with this mechanism of action in clinical development. TAK-935/OV935 has been tested in preclinical models to provide data to support the advancement of the drug into human clinical studies in patients suffering from rare epilepsy syndromes. A novel proprietary PET ligand, developed by Takeda and Molecular Neuroimaging, LLC (MNI), has been used to determine target enzyme occupancy of TAK-935/OV935 in the brain. In addition, the effect of TAK-935/OV935 on CH24H enzyme activity in the brain has been assessed by following measurable reductions in the plasma concentration of 24HC. TAK-935/OV935 has completed four Phase 1 clinical studies, which have assessed tolerability and target engagement at doses believed to be therapeutically relevant.

MEDIA CONTACT: Lauren Barbiero W2Opure lbarbiero@w2ogroup.com +1 (646) 564-2156 SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on oncology, today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation for G100, Immune Design's investigational intratumoral therapy, for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The EMA orphan drug designation is assigned to products targeting the treatment of rare diseases, which are defined as having a prevalence of not more than 5 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU). This designation provides the sponsor with certain benefits, including protocol assistance, reduced fees for regulatory activities and up to 10 years of market exclusivity in the EU upon marketing approval for the designated indication. G100 has also been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. G100 is a product candidate from Immune Design's GLAAS\u00ae discovery platform. It contains a potent synthetic small molecule toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA), and is the lead product candidate in Immune Design's Antigen Agnostic approach. G100 activates innate and adaptive immunity in the tumor microenvironment to generate an immune response against the tumor's preexisting diverse set of antigens. A growing set of clinical and preclinical data have demonstrated the ability of G100 to activate tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, and promote antigen-presentation and the recruitment of T cells to the tumor. The induction of local and systemic immune responses has been shown in preclinical studies to result in local and abscopal (shrinking of tumors outside the scope of the localized treatment) tumor control. Currently, G100 is being evaluated as both a monotherapy (with local radiation) and in combination with Merck's anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, pursuant to a clinical collaboration with Merck, in a randomized Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. About Immune Design Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to generate and/or expand antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, while also enhancing other immune effectors, to fight cancer and other chronic diseases. CMB305 and G100, the two leading product candidates focused in cancer immunotherapy, are the first products from Immune Design's two separate discovery platforms targeting dendritic cells in vivo, ZVex\u00ae and GLAAS\u00ae. Both ZVex and GLAAS also have potential applications in infectious disease and allergy as demonstrated by ongoing pharmaceutical collaborations. Immune Design has offices in Seattle and South San Francisco. For more information, please visit www.immunedesign.com. Media Contact Julie Rathbun Rathbun 650-888-0902 YORK, Oct. 16, (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ovid Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:OVID), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines for patients with rare neurological diseases, today announced new positive preclinical data on OV101 that shows normalization of behavioral abnormalities that resemble those seen in people with Fragile X syndrome. The improvements seen with OV101, a novel agonist of the extrasynaptic GABA receptor, were consistent across multiple behavioral measures in a model of Fragile X syndrome. The data were presented at the 18th International Fragile X and Related Neurodevelopmental Disorders Workshop. \"Treatment with OV101 results in significant behavioral improvements that are consistent across all behavioral endpoints tested,\" said Matthew During, M.D., DSc, FACP, FRACP, president and chief scientific officer of Ovid Therapeutics. \"We designed this study to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of action and potential benefit of OV101 to treat patients with Fragile X syndrome.\" In the study, researchers demonstrated that acute administration of 0.5 mg/kg of OV101 to Fmr1 knockout mice fully normalized behavioral abnormalities relevant to Fragile X syndrome (hyperactivity, anxiety, irritability and aggression, and restricted and repetitive behaviors). All effects were highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). It is believed that symptoms of Fragile X syndrome are a result of disrupted tonic inhibition, the key to the brain's ability to discriminate signal from noise. The results presented indicate that by specifically targeting the delta ()-subset of GABA receptors, OV101 may be able to alleviate symptoms of Fragile X syndrome by modulating the GABA pathway and restoring tonic inhibition. \"We have built a strong foundation in scientific analysis, translational medicine, drug development and regulatory capabilities. This study builds upon this foundation and underscores the potential role of OV101 in modulating tonic inhibition, an important underlying mechanism in certain neurodevelopmental disorders,\" said Amit Rakhit M.D., MBA, chief medical and portfolio officer of Ovid Therapeutics. \"Together with the recent FDA orphan drug designation for OV101 for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome, this data is another important step in our disciplined strategy to develop OV101 as a potential first in class compound for Fragile X syndrome.\" About OV101 OV101 (gaboxadol) is believed to be the only delta ()-selective GABAA receptor agonist in development and the first investigational drug to specifically target the disruption of tonic inhibition that is thought to be the underlying cause of certain neurodevelopmental disorders. OV101 has been demonstrated in laboratory studies and animal models to selectively activate the -subunit of GABAA receptors, which are found in the extrasynaptic space (outside of the synapse), and thereby impact neuronal activity through tonic inhibition. Ovid is developing OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome to potentially restore tonic inhibition and relieve several of the symptoms of these disorders. In preclinical studies, it was observed that OV101 improved symptoms of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. To date, gaboxadol has been tested in over 4,000 patients (approximately 950 patient-years of exposure) and was observed to have favorable safety and bioavailability profiles. The FDA granted orphan drug designation for OV101 for the treatment of both Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted Ovid two patents directed to methods of treating Angelman syndrome using OV101. The issued patents expire in 2035, without regulatory extensions. About Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism, with a prevalence of 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males and 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females in the United States. Individuals with Fragile X syndrome often have a range of behavioral challenges, such as cognitive impairment, anxiety, mood swings, hyperactivity, attention deficit, poor sleep, self-injury and heightened sensitivity to various stimuli, such as sound. Additionally, individuals with Fragile X syndrome are prone to comorbid medical issues including seizures and sleep disturbance. Fragile X syndrome results from mutations in the FMR1 gene, which blocks expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an important protein in GABA synthesis. There are no FDA-approved therapies for Fragile X syndrome, and treatment primarily consists of behavioral interventions and pharmacologic management of symptoms. In studies of individuals with Fragile X syndrome and in experimental models, extrasynaptic GABA levels are abnormally reduced, and there is also dysregulation of GABA receptors. This ultimately contributes to a decrease in tonic inhibition, causing the brain to become inundated with signals and lose the ability to separate background noise from critical information.

The randomized Phase 3 trial will evaluate CMB305 monotherapy vs. placebo in patients with NY-ESO-1+ locally advanced unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma, a sub type of soft tissue sarcoma, who have no evidence of progression after first-line chemotherapy. Immune Design intends to start the study in mid-2018 and enroll 248 patients aged twelve and older. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either CMB305 monotherapy or placebo. The trial will have progression free survival (PFS) followed by overall survival (OS) as co-primary endpoints. If the PFS endpoint is successful, the FDA offered that it may support full approval of CMB305. Depending on the rate of events, final PFS analysis may occur as early as 24 months from the first patient dosed. About Synovial Sarcoma Soft tissue sarcomas are malignancies that arise from the soft tissues of the body, such as tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures including muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and the lining of joints. Synovial sarcoma is a sub type of soft tissue sarcoma where 70% of diagnoses occur in patients under 40 years old, is associated with a high risk of recurrence, and has been shown to have high expression of the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen. The primary treatment for patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma typically consists of an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen administered alone or in combination with other agents. Following disease progression after first line systemic therapy, treatment options are limited and median overall survival rates have been reported to be approximately 12 months. In connection with the planned Phase 3 study for CMB305 monotherapy, the FDA has agreed with Immune Design that synovial sarcoma patients constitute an unmet medical need. About CMB305 CMB305 is an investigational prime-boost vaccine approach against NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors, designed to generate an integrated, anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in vivo via a targeted, specific interaction with dendritic cells, a mechanism of action Immune Design believes differs from traditional cancer vaccines. CMB305 is being evaluated in soft tissue sarcoma patients in ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy and Phase 2 combination studies. Immune Design has received Orphan Drug Designation for CMB305 from the FDA for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, as well as from the FDA and European Commission for each of the components of CMB305 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.

The data will be presented in a poster discussion session at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2017 Congress, September 8-12, 2017 in Madrid, Spain. This fully enrolled trial is evaluating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of CMB305 in combination with atezolizumab (C+A, n=45), or atezolizumab alone (A, n=43), in a total of 88 patients with locally advanced, relapsed, or metastatic NY-ESO-1+ synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma. Data to be presented at ESMO summarize patients evaluated in an interim analysis in a data cut as of July 21, 2017, with analysis divided into two groups: pre-specified interim analysis (n=36) and full study population (n=88). Patient Characteristics: Patients receiving CMB305 plus atezolizumab have more advanced disease than those receiving alone, including: - Metastatic Disease: 98% (C+A) vs. 79% of systemic anti-cancer therapy: 61% (C+A) vs. 49% (A) - 2 lesions at time of study entry: 96% (C+A) vs. 84% (A) - Grade 3 disease at diagnosis: 47% (C+A) vs. 33% (A) Greater Clinical Benefit with Combination of CMB305 and Atezolizumab: Interim analysis data (n=36) show that patients receiving CMB305 plus atezolizumab experienced greater clinical benefit than those receiving atezolizumab alone. - Disease Control Rate (Partial Responses (PR) + Stable Disease (SD)): 61%, including 1 PR (C+A) vs. 28% with no PRs (A) - Median Progression Free Survival (PFS): 2.6 months (C+A) vs. 1.4 months (A) - Time to Next Treatment (TTNT): 9 months (C+A) vs. 6.3 months (A) - Overall survival: as of the collection date, overall survival data are immature (median duration of observation is less than six months); Immune Design intends to present survival data in 2018 once all patients approach at least one year of follow up. In the full study population (n=88), the trend of greater clinical benefit on the combination arm remains consistent for the entire patient population: - Disease Control Rate: 57% (3 PRs total, 1 unconfirmed) (C+A) vs. 38% (0 responses) (A) More Robust Immune Response with Combination of CMB305 and Atezolizumab: Patients in the full study population (n=88) who received the combination of CMB305 and atezolizumab demonstrated stronger anti-NY-ESO-1 immune responses compared to those receiving atezolizumab alone (samples evaluable from (n=60/88)), (C+A) vs. 0% (A) Biomarker Analysis Shows Continued Link Between Induced Immune Response and Clinical Benefit: In an exploratory analysis, a trend towards improved overall survival was observed in patients with an induced immune response (T cells or antibodies) who received CMB305 plus atezolizumab. - Induced anti-NY-ESO-1 T cells: 78% reduction in mortality rate, as compared to patients without induced T cells [HR=0.22, log-rank p value=0.043] - Induced anti-NY-ESO-1 antibodies: 87% reduction in mortality rate, as compared to patients without induced antibodies [HR=0.13, log-rank p value=0.025] - This trend of improved overall survival in patients with induced immune response was not observed in the atezolizumab-only arm. In addition, pretreatment tumor biopsies available from 70 patients show both an absent or very low level of PD-L1 expression and CD8 T cell infiltration, further supporting that these subtypes of STS are \"cold\" tumors. Positive Safety Profile with Combination of CMB305 and Atezolizumab: This combination was observed to be well tolerated, and there were no new safety signals in either arm. \"We believe the greater clinical benefit and more robust immune response shown in the combination study arm supports the hypothesis that the combination of an appropriately-designed, next-generation cancer vaccine such as CMB305 with a checkpoint inhibitor is important to produce clinical benefit in a cold tumor such as STS, where checkpoint inhibitors otherwise may have limited efficacy,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"In addition, we are pleased to observe the trend towards longer overall survival in patients with an induced anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response, further supporting the positive CMB305 monotherapy data we presented at ASCO in June.\" Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody being developed by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, and is designed to target and bind to a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death ligand-1).

Katie Engleman, 910-509-3977 katie@purecommunicationsinc.com - Interim data analysis shows greater clinical benefit and immune response with CMB305+atezolizumab than with atezolizumab alone SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Aug. 30, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on oncology, today announced positive topline data from its interim analysis of the ongoing, randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating CMB305 in combination with atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ\u00ae) or atezolizumab alone in 88 soft tissue sarcoma patients. The data will be presented in a poster discussion session at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2017 Congress, September 8-12, 2017 in Madrid, Spain. \"The two main goals of this study are (1) to determine whether combining a next-generation vaccine like CMB305 with a checkpoint inhibitor (such as an anti-PD-L1 antibody) provides improved clinical benefit compared to that of the checkpoint inhibitor alone, particularly in a PD-L1-low or -negative tumor, and (2) in a randomized setting, to determine the biological activity of CMB305,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"We believe these interim data constitute the first steps towards answering both questions in a favorable manner.\" Data to be presented at ESMO build upon those data on the first 36 patients summarized in the abstract, and include a greater number of patients enrolled. - Clinical Benefit: Data from the larger patient population show that patients receiving CMB305 and atezolizumab experienced greater clinical benefit in the form of Disease Control Rate (including objective responses), Progression Free Survival and Time to Next Treatment than those receiving atezolizumab alone. - Immune Response: Patients who received the combination of CMB305 and atezolizumab demonstrated an increased frequency of induced immune responses to NY-ESO-1, including NY-ESO-1-specific T cells, NY-ESO-1 antibodies, and antigen spreading, in comparison to patients who received atezolizumab alone - Biomarkers: In an exploratory analysis, a trend towards improved overall survival was observed in patients in the CMB305 and atezolizumab combination arm who had pre-existing and treatment-induced anti-NY-ESO-1 immunity, compared to the atezolizumab alone arm. Pre-treatment tumor biopsy analysis showed negligible levels of PD-L1 expression. - Safety: No new safety signals have been observed in either arm. The fully enrolled trial is evaluating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of CMB305 in combination with atezolizumab, or atezolizumab alone, in a total of 88 patients with locally advanced, relapsed, or metastatic NY-ESO-1+ synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to target and bind to a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death ligand-1) and is being developed by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. The trial is being conducted pursuant to a clinical collaboration with Genentech. Immune Design intends to present survival data in 2018 once all patients have at least one year of follow up (current data are preliminary: median duration of observation <six months). The ESMO Poster Discussion session presentation details are as follows: A Phase 2 Study of CMB305 and Atezolizumab in NY-ESO-1+ Soft Tissue Sarcoma: Interim Analysis of Immunogenicity, Tumor Control and Survival Abstract # 1480PD Session Title: Sarcoma Poster Discussion Session Date: Monday, Sept. 11, 2017 Time: 11 a.m. - CMB305 is a prime-boost vaccine approach against NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors, designed to generate an integrated, anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in vivo via a targeted, specific interaction with dendritic cells, a mechanism of action Immune Design believes differs from traditional cancer vaccines.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is publishing three abstracts today relating to these new data. A broader set of data will be presented at the ASCO 2017 Annual Meeting, providing further clinical validation of the company's lead product candidates and discovery platforms. CMB305 Monotherapy in Patients with Soft Tissue Sarcoma - l Most recent patient survival data meaningfully exceed published survival outcomes for standard of care therapy in comparable soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with recurrent metastatic disease. 1. With a median follow up exceeding 18 and 11 months for LV305 and CMB305, respectively, median overall survival (mOS) has not yet been reached in recurrent metastatic STS patients. - Durable disease control was observed in more than half of STS patients, including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression prior to CMB305 therapy. - CMB305's safety profile consisted mostly of mild to moderate adverse events, with therapy being well tolerated by patients. - Anti-NY-ESO-1 immune biomarkers identify cancer patients who may be more likely to have prolonged survival following therapy with CMB305 - Anti-NY-ESO-1 immune responses were observed in more than half of the patients who received CMB305 therapy. - Induction of anti-NY-ESO-1 immunity in patients treated with CMB305 or LV305 was associated with better clinical outcomes, including survival. - Immune biomarkers pre-treatment may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to respond to CMB305 therapy. G100 Intratumoral Monotherapy with Radiation in Patients with Low-grade Follicular NHL (FL) - More than 40% of the FL patients experienced objective responses based on WHO criteria (at least a 50% tumor reduction), including substantial tumor shrinkage in untreated, unirradiated distal (abscopal) lesions. - Safety profile remains favorable at higher doses than those previously reported in Merkel cell carcinoma patients. - G100 resulted in favorable tumor microenvironment changes. 1. An increased intratumoral expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, T cell infiltration, and an increased frequency of clonal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, were observed. \"The ability to identify patients who are likely to benefit from antigen-targeted immunotherapy has been an elusive goal. We believe the results highlighted here should be considered as we aim to maximize the chance of success of these novel modalities, including CMB305 and future product candidates from our ZVex platform.\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"During the second half of the year, we hope to have the opportunity to build on these positive clinical and biomarker data for CMB305 and G100 monotherapy with the results from ongoing trials evaluating each agent in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.\" Presentations at American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting Data underlying the topline releases above were published online today by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in abstracts accepted for presentation at ASCO's 2017 Annual Meeting in June (presentation information set forth below). The abstracts reflect an analysis performed on or before February 2017; additional data will be presented at the Annual Meeting.

(April 25, 2017) - Science 37, a trailblazing company focused on \"site-less\" clinical trials, announced today $29 million in Series C funding led by Glynn Capital Management with participation from GV. The round included new strategic investments from Amgen Ventures, as well as participation from all existing investors Lux Capital, Redmile Group, dRx Capital (a Qualcomm and Novartis joint investment company), and Sanofi Ventures. Total invested capital since inception is now nearly $67 million. \"We've seen great success thus far in the model we developed. It has not only increased the number of people able to participate in clinical trials, but also reduced the time it takes to recruit by nearly 50 percent in some cases,\" said Noah Craft, MD, PhD, and co-founder and CEO of Science 37. \"The new funding will help us drive continued expansion and recruit top talent from both the technology and from the clinical trial industries. The round will also allow us to expand into new therapeutic areas and to introduce these trials to a much broader set of demographics, including those with limited access to major medical facilities where these trials are typically offered.\" Science 37's core offering is focused on making clinical trials better for patients. The company is also directly working to address the lack of diversity represented in traditional trials. Currently only five percent of minorities are represented in all clinical trials and the percentage involved in cancer trials can be below two percent. Statistics such as these were a major driving force in Science 37's focus on creating a metasite to carry out telemedicine-based clinical research. The metasite or \"siteless\" clinical trial model enables them to bridge the geographic gap that exists between many patients and research focused medical facilities. Science 37 uses their proprietary metasite and technology platform, the Network Oriented Research Assistant (NORA\u00ae) to make clinical trials easier for patients to access from the comfort of their homes. The metasite decentralizes trials, enabling patients to participate regardless of their geographical location using their mobile devices and telemedicine services, and includes Virtual Trial Specialists, mobile nursing companies, and study monitors to execute end-to-end clinical trial services for sponsors. \"Science 37 has shown rapid growth since forming in September, 2014,\" said Scott Jordon, Managing Director at Glynn Capital Management. \"We believe the advances being made will fundamentally alter the landscape of research in the medical field and help drive more positive outcomes for all constituents.\" \"Science 37 has developed a novel, decentralized framework for running clinical trials,\" said Krishna Yeshwant, General Partner at GV. \"The company has completed clinical trials with impressive early results, and has a great combination of operational expertise in clinical research, coupled with software sensibilities.\" The new funding will help speed additional development of the proprietary Science 37 NORA\u00ae software platform, to scale the clinical operations teams to meet the tremendous demand for upcoming trials, to help expand into new innovative markets and therapeutic areas, and to prepare for international expansion in the coming years. \"Many new drug candidates never get developed as a direct result of the long timelines and costs required to complete a traditional study,\" said Belinda Tan, MD, PhD, and co-founder and chief medical officer of Science 37. \"The long recruitment process for trials alone is one of the biggest drivers of these drug development costs. By streamlining that process we hope to help bring new cures to patients faster.\" About Science 37 Science 37 is a Los Angeles-based technology-enabled clinical research company. They created a new clinical trial operating model - the metasite - that unlocks access so researchers can find the right patients, and patients can find the right trials. Their Network Orientated Research Assistant, NORA\u00ae, is the cloud-based patient-centric mobile research platform that connects everyone - safely and securely.

OV101 (gaboxadol), a delta ()-selective GABAA receptor agonist, is believed to be the first investigational drug to target the disruption of tonic inhibition, a key mechanism that allows a healthy human brain to decipher excitatory and inhibitory neurological signals correctly without being overloaded. Tonic inhibition is believed to play a significant role in the neurodevelopmental symptoms characteristic of disorders such as Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. \"Those with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome are affected from birth. Our goal is to provide medicines to these individuals at all ages. The initiation of this trial represents the first step in our strategy to develop OV101 for an adolescent population. This is an important step because having access to medicines at a younger age has the potential to have a transformative effect on the lives of these patients and their families,\" said Amit Rakhit, M.D., MBA, chief medical and portfolio officer of Ovid Therapeutics. \"We look forward to continuing to partner with the Angelman and Fragile X syndrome communities as we work to develop therapies that can have the greatest impact on the challenges they face every day.\" The Phase 1 single dose, single-arm, open-label, clinical trial of OV101 will measure PK parameters. The trial is expected to enroll adolescent patients, ages 13 to 17, who have been diagnosed with either Angelman syndrome or Fragile X syndrome. Additional details on the Phase 1 clinical trial can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov. In addition to this clinical trial in adolescents, Ovid is planning to initiate clinical development in a pediatric population upon completing the required preclinical testing. About Angelman Syndrome Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by a variety of signs and symptoms. Characteristic features of this disorder include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, problems with movement and balance, seizures, sleep disorders and anxiety. The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is the disruption of a gene that codes for ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). Angelman syndrome affects approximately 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people in the United States. There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. Angelman syndrome is associated with a reduction in tonic inhibition, a function of the delta ()-selective GABAA receptor that allows a human brain to decipher excitatory and inhibitory neurological signals correctly without being overloaded. If tonic inhibition is reduced, the brain becomes inundated with signals and loses the ability to separate background noise from critical information. About Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism, with a prevalence of 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males and 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females in the United States. Individuals with Fragile X syndrome often have a range of behavioral challenges, such as cognitive impairment, anxiety, mood swings, hyperactivity, attention deficit, poor sleep, self-injury and heightened sensitivity to various stimuli, such as sound. Additionally, individuals with Fragile X syndrome are prone to comorbid medical issues including seizures and sleep disturbance. Fragile X syndrome results from mutations in the FMR1 gene, which blocks expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an important protein in GABA synthesis. There are no FDA-approved therapies for Fragile X syndrome, and treatment primarily consists of behavioral interventions and pharmacologic management of symptoms. In studies of individuals with Fragile X syndrome and in experimental models, extrasynaptic GABA levels are abnormally reduced, and there is also dysregulation of GABA receptors. This ultimately contributes to a decrease in tonic inhibition, causing the brain to become inundated with signals and lose the ability to separate background noise from critical information. About OV101 OV101 (gaboxadol) is a delta ()-selective GABAA receptor agonist and is believed to be the first investigational drug to target the disruption of tonic inhibition. In preclinical models, OV101 has been able to selectively activate the -subunit of GABAA receptors, which are found in the extrasynaptic space (outside of the synapse), and help regulate neuronal activity through tonic inhibition. Ovid is developing OV101 for use in both Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome to potentially restore tonic inhibition and relieve several of the symptoms of these disorders. In preclinical studies, it was observed that OV101 improved symptoms of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. In September 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted Ovid two patents directed to methods of treating Angelman syndrome using THIP (OV101). The issued patents expire in 2035, without regulatory extensions. About Ovid Therapeutics Ovid Therapeutics is a privately held, New York-based, biopharmaceutical company using its BoldMedicineTM approach to develop therapies that transform the lives of patients with rare neurological diseases. Ovid's drug candidate, OV101, is currently in development for the treatment of symptoms of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. Ovid has initiated the Phase 2 STARS trial of OV101 in adults with Angelman syndrome and a Phase 1 trial in adolescents with Angelman syndrome or Fragile X syndrome. Ovid is also developing OV935 in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the treatment of rare epileptic encephalopathies.

Contacts Investors: Burns McClellan Steve Klass, 212-213-0006 Sklass@burnsmc.com GlycoMimetics, Inc. (NASDAQ:GLYC) today announced that the first of two patient cohorts in its Phase 2 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) trial of GMI-1271 has completed enrollment. This cohort is comprised of 25 patients 60 years of age or older with newly diagnosed AML. The study is designed to evaluate the potential of GMI- 1271, GlycoMimetics' E-selectin antagonist drug candidate, in combination with chemotherapy, as a treatment for patients with both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML. Enrollment in the study's second arm is expected to complete in the middle of this year. The two arms combined will enroll a total of about 90 patients. \"At the ASH meeting in December, we showed that GMI-1271 was well-tolerated and demonstrated a high remission rate among the patient volunteers who were enrolled early in the study,\" said Helen Thackray, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of GlycoMimetics. \"We are enthusiastic about that data, and as such, we look forward to opportunities later in the year to report initial treatment outcomes for this study.\" GMI-1271 data were presented in 2016 at meetings of the European Hematology Association (EHA) and the American Society of Hematology (ASH), showing high remission rates and lower than expected 30- and 60-day mortality rates in early evaluations of patients with relapsed/refractory AML. In addition to the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, clinical investigators are currently evaluating GMI-1271 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in multiple myeloma. Preclinical data supporting the multiple myeloma study is scheduled to be shared in an oral presentation at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2017 in April. Specifically, the newly announced preclinical results show a strong effect on cancer cells in combination with chemotherapy and are supportive of the ongoing Phase 1 clinical studies of GMI-1271 in multiple myeloma. About AML Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Each year in the United States, about 19,900 people (usually older than 45 years of age) are diagnosed, and about 10,400 people die from all forms of the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. Unlike other cancers that start in an organ and spread to the bone marrow, AML is known for rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that gather in the bone marrow, getting in the way of normal blood cell production. The lack of normal blood cells can cause some of the symptoms of AML, including anemia (shortage of red blood cells resulting in tiredness and weakness), neutropenia (shortage of white blood cells that may lead to increased infections), and thrombocytopenia (shortage of platelets in the blood that may lead to excessive bleeding).

News Provided by Acquire Media Preclinical Data Demonstrates Tumor Eradication with \"Prime-Pull\" Immunotherapy Approach Combining a ZVex\u00ae vector and G100 \u2014 ZVex Causes Potent Activation of Dendritic Cells \u2014 SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on oncology, today announced that new preclinical data showing the broad anti-tumor activity on its \"prime-pull\" approach, as well as the ability of its ZVex vectors to activate dendritic cells potently, will be presented at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2017 Annual Meeting, being held from April 1-5, 2017 in Washington D.C. \"These AACR data illustrate the significant local and systemic immune responses that the combination of ZVex vectors with G100 may generate. We observed complete eradication of large, established B16 tumors in animal models, which previously has been achieved only with complex regimens,\" said Jan ter Meulen, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Immune Design. \"In addition, we will present additional data supporting the ability of ZVex vectors to generate potent activation of human dendritic cells.\" Immune Design will present data showing the \"Prime-Pull\" concept that involves the (i) intradermal administration of the dendritic cell (DC)-targeting ZVex vector expressing a tumor-associated antigen and (ii) intratumoral injection of G100, a formulated, potent synthetic toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) agonist, CD8 T-cells are induced (\"primed\") by a ZVex vector, and subsequent injection of G100 leads to pro-inflammatory changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which induces the trafficking of T-cells into the tumor (the \"pull\"). This inflamed TME and recruitment of ZVex-induced CD8 T cells eradicated large, established B16 tumors. Also importantly, treated mice rejected re-challenge with a tumor lacking the antigen used for immunization, indicating antigen spreading induced by the immunotherapeutic regimen. Immune Design is evaluating this immunotherapy approach in an ongoing Phase 1 trial in patients with soft tissue sarcoma who are receiving G100 and CMB305, its prime-boost approach that is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials as both a monotherapy and in combination with atezolizumab, Genentech's anti-PDL1 antibody. In addition, Immune Design will present separate data highlighting the ability of its ZVex vectors to induce potent, innate immune activation in human DCs. Company researchers studied the effect of human DC transduction with ZVex vectors by gene expression profiling. Human DCs transduced with ZVex vectors displayed statistically significant up-regulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and anti-viral defense pathways, highlighting that ZVex is sufficient to activate transduced DCs and facilitate antigen presentation to T cells. The details for the poster presentations are as follows: Large established B16 tumors in mice are eradicated increasing tumor-infiltrating effector T and inducing antigen spreading Abstract #: 5673 Session Category: Clinical Research Session Title: Innate Immunity to Generate Adaptive Immunity Date and Time: Wednesday, April 5, 2017, 8:00 a.m. \u2014 12:00 p.m. Location: Convention Center, Halls A-C, Poster Section 28 Poster Board: 27 Authors: Tina C.

About ZVex ZVex is Immune Design's discovery platform designed to activate and expand the immune system's natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in vivo. ZVex uses a re-engineered virus to carry genetic information of a tumor antigen selectively to dendritic cells in the skin or lymph nodes. This ultimately results in the creation of CTLs designed to kill tumor cells bearing that same specific tumor antigen. ZVex is also designed to carry the genetic information for, and therefore potentially cause dendritic cells to express, multiple antigens and/or selected epitopes of interest (including neoantigens), as well as cytokines or other immunomodulatory molecules. About G100 G100 is a product candidate from Immune Design's GLAAS\u00ae discovery platform. It contains a potent synthetic small molecule toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA), and is the lead product candidate in Immune Design's Antigen Agnostic approach. It leverages the activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, including Dendritic Cells, in the tumor microenvironment to create an immune response against the tumor's preexisting diverse set of antigens. A growing set of clinical and preclinical data have demonstrated the ability of G100 to activate tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, and promote antigen-presentation and the recruitment of T cells to the tumor. The ensuing induction of local and systemic immune responses has been shown to result in local and abscopal (shrinking of tumors outside the scope of the localized treatment) tumor control in preclinical studies. G100 was evaluated in a Phase 1 study in Merkel cell carcinoma patients and produced a 50% overall response rate per protocol and a favorable safety profile. Currently, G100 is being evaluated as both a monotherapy with local radiation and in combination with Merck's anti- PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, pursuant to a clinical collaboration with Merck, in a randomized Phase 1/2 trial in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma. About Immune Design Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to generate and/or expand antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, while also enhancing other immune effectors, to fight cancer and other chronic diseases. CMB305 and G100, the primary foci of Immune Design's ongoing immunooncology clinical programs, are products of its two synergistic discovery platforms, ZVex and GLAAS, the fundamental technologies of which were licensed from the California Institute of Technology and the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI), respectively.

Media Contact Julie Rathbun Rathbun Communications sannes@annesassociates.com 650-888-0902 Without clinical trials, new medicine may never make it from the research lab to patients in need. These carefully designed studies can provide important data that include proper dosage, benefit to patients, and potential side effects. There is a growing challenge, however, in finding appropriate participants, especially for treatments that target highly specific conditions affecting narrower patient populations. Right now, there are more than 40,000 clinical studies recruiting patients in the U.S. alone, with some requiring thousands of participants, each of whom must meet precise criteria to join. So it's not surprising that 80% of these important studies are delayed due to recruitment problems, according to a study by the [Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation ](https://www.ciscrp.org/)(CISCRP). Unfortunately, those delays mean it can take longer for innovative new medicines to be studied and approved, leaving patients to wait years for new treatment options. To tackle this growing problem, Sanofi is taking a digital approach to clinical trials, partnering with [Science 37, ](https://www.science37.com/#reach)a clinical research services and technology company based in California. Leveraging mobile technology and telemedicine capabilities, this new approach will allow Sanofi to develop \"site-less\" or decentralized clinical trials that are more patient friendly: easier for them to access, and eliminating many of the common impediments to participation. Using digital technologies to streamline finding and retaining participants for the entire length of a study has the potential to reduce the time required for a typical trial by at least 30%, according to Science 37. \"After years invested in the lab on an innovative treatment, the clinical trials are where we finally obtain and analyze the relevant data that will let us understand how well a new treatment will benefit patients,\" said Lionel Bascles, Global Head of Clinical Sciences and Operations of Sanofi. \"With digital clinical trials we can get and analyze the data on how a new medicine works in the real world a lot sooner, which means patients get the medicines they need sooner.\" Going digital also eliminates a number of other hurdles to patient participation, including the most significant: geography. Most people are eager to participate in relevant trials - 87% of patients want to do so, the CISCRP study found. Yet, 70% of potential participants live more than two hours away from the nearest study center. Because most clinical trials require patients to travel to those centers for regular tests and observations, sometimes several times each week for the duration of the trial, this distance is another challenge to patient access. Science 37's approach allows patients to be monitored and report to researchers via an Apple iPhone equipped with the company's NORA\u00ae technology. Qualified study participants are provided with the phone, a data plan and any other sensors or connected devices needed for the trial, along with the medicines being researched. Participants can reach study staff at any time via the mobile device, while also remaining under the care of their local health care professionals. Mobile nurses are also sent to the participant's home to provide services like blood draws when needed, and nearby hospitals or clinics are engaged for scans or other tests that require specialized equipment. The patient's data are sent securely to researchers who can immediately access information that would otherwise have to be collected by medical personnel through face-to-face interactions at study centers. This platform can also remind patients to take their study medications at the proper time, and let researchers know if participants are adhering to the study requirements. \"Our decentralized clinical trial model addresses critical shortcomings of traditional clinical trials, such as enrolling and retaining appropriate patients. Whether you live near a major research institution, or in a remote area, we make participation possible,\" said Noah Craft, CEO of Science 37. \"By utilizing a patient's home in lieu of a physical trial site, we remove the burden of travel for those too sick or remote and provide access to qualified individuals who want to volunteer for a study but cannot because of geographic limitations.\" The Science 37 platform will also help engage patients who would normally not participate in clinical trials, \"so our data will much more closely track the diversity of the population,\" Bascles said. \"In addition to reducing the burden for patients, decentralized clinical trials are far more likely to keep patients engaged for the full length of the trial, increasing the relevance and the acceptability of the data by regulators.\" Sanofi's agreement with Science 37 covers use of its Metasite model and NORA technology across the U.S. with plans to expand internationally in the future. By eliminating months of searching for patients and long travel time to study sites, virtual clinical trials could reduce total trial time by as much as two years. Partnering with Science 37 is the most recent strengthening of the relationship with Sanofi, which began last October when Sanofi's venture capital fund, [Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures, ](http://www.sanofigenzymebioventures.com/)made a minority investment in Science 37. \"Science 37 has a great track record, and they are smart and forward-thinking about developing the science around clinical trials that leverage digital technologies,\" said Heather Bell, Global Head of Digital and Analytics for Sanofi. \"As part of the scope of our digital strategy, we have expanded the scope of the venture fund to include digital investments, and Science 37 was our first investment since that change and we're very excited about it.\" SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Feb. 22, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on oncology, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation for its investigational intratumoral therapy, G100, for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Orphan Drug Designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Drug Products to products that treat rare diseases. The FDA defines rare diseases as those affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan Drug Designation provides the sponsor certain benefits and incentives, including a period of marketing exclusivity for the first marketing application, if regulatory approval is received for the designated indication, potential tax credits for certain activities and waiver of certain administrative fees.

Media Contact Julie Rathbun Rathbun Communications is the first industry-sponsored clinical trial for Angelman syndrome NEW YORK, Feb. 09, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ovid Therapeutics, a privately held biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines that transform the lives of people with rare neurological disorders, today announced it has randomized the first patient in its STARS trial - a Phase 2 clinical trial of OV101 in adults with Angelman syndrome. OV101 (gaboxadol), a delta ()-selective GABAA receptor agonist, is believed to be the first investigational drug to target the disruption of tonic inhibition, a key mechanism that allows a healthy human brain to decipher excitatory and inhibitory neurological signals correctly without being overloaded. Tonic inhibition is believed to play a significant role in the developmental and neurological symptoms characteristic of disorders such as Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. \"Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder associated with a broad spectrum of symptoms such as development delay, seizures, balance problems and sleep disturbance, resulting in the need for life-long care,\" said Lynne Bird, M.D., principal investigator and professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of California San Diego and Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego. \"There are currently no FDA approved therapies for the treatment of Angelman Syndrome. The standard of care provides limited treatment options for Angelman syndrome, most of which are general supportive therapies that are used for many other disorders and don't address the specific pathophysiology of Angelman syndrome. I believe the STARS trial will be the first trial to study an investigative drug that may have the opportunity to address several symptoms that characterize the disorder and that OV101 has the potential to offer a meaningful clinical benefit for people with Angelman syndrome.\" \"We are proud to have partnered with the Angelman syndrome community in the design of the STARS trial and thrilled that we have taken an important step in advancing the development of a potential treatment for Angelman syndrome that may benefit the families and individuals living with this disorder,\" said Amit Rakhit, M.D., MBA, chief medical and portfolio management officer of Ovid Therapeutics. \"OV101 highlights our commitment to developing transformative therapies for people and their families living with rare disorders of the brain.\" About the Phase 2 STARS Trial The STARS trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of OV101 that was designed in consultation with the Angelman syndrome community. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 75 adults in the United States aged 18-49 years with a confirmed diagnosis of Angelman syndrome. The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of OV101. Additionally, the trial has several exploratory endpoints to evaluate measures of gross and fine motor skills, maladaptive behavior, sleep, clinical global impression and health-related quality of life questionnaires. Learn more about the STARS trial at www.clinicaltrials.gov. About Angelman Syndrome Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by a variety of signs and symptoms. Characteristic features of this disorder include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, problems with movement and balance, seizures, sleep disorders and anxiety. The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is the disruption of a gene that codes for ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). Angelman syndrome affects approximately 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people in the United States. There are currently no FDA approved therapies for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. Angelman syndrome is associated with a reduction in tonic inhibition, a function of the delta ()-selective GABAA receptor that allows a human brain to decipher excitatory and inhibitory neurological signals correctly without being overloaded. If tonic inhibition is reduced, the brain becomes inundated with signals and loses the ability to separate background noise from critical information. About OV101 OV101 (gaboxadol) is a delta ()-selective GABAA receptor agonist and is believed to be the first investigational drug to target the disruption of tonic inhibition, a key mechanism that allows a healthy human brain to decipher excitatory and inhibitory neurological signals correctly without being overloaded. Loss of tonic inhibition is implicated in a host of rare neurological disorders and is established in genetic models. In preclinical models, OV101 has been able to selectively activate the -subunit of GABAA receptors, which are found in the extrasynaptic space (outside of the synapse), and helped regulate neuronal activity through tonic inhibition. Ovid is developing OV101 for use in both Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome to potentially restore tonic inhibition and relieve several of the symptoms of these disorders. In preclinical studies, it was observed that OV101 improved symptoms of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. In September 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted orphan drug designation for OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted Ovid two patents directed to methods of treating Angelman syndrome using THIP (OV101). The issued patents expire in 2035, without regulatory extensions. About Ovid Therapeutics Ovid Therapeutics is a privately held, New York-based, biopharmaceutical company using its BoldMedicineTM approach to develop therapies that transform the lives of patients with rare neurological disorders. Ovid's drug candidate, OV101, is currently in development for the treatment of symptoms of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. Ovid is also developing OV935 in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the treatment of rare epileptic encephalopathies. Ovid has initiated a Phase 2 STARS trial of OV101 in adults with Angelman syndrome and Ovid intends to commence a Phase 1 trial in adolescents with Angelman syndrome or Fragile X syndrome. OV935 is expected to commence a Phase 1b/2a trial in rare epileptic encephalopathies in 2017. For more information, visit http://www.ovidrx.com.

Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by a variety of signs and symptoms, including delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, problems with movement and balance, seizures, sleep disorders and anxiety. Like many other neurological disorders, symptoms and response to treatments vary widely from person to person. \"With the initiation of the STARS trial and this collaboration, we are making important progress in better understanding Angelman syndrome and developing much needed treatment options. The metabolic profile of this syndrome is not well understood, and we believe this biomarker study will produce critical data to fill this gap and inform us about the impact of OV101 as a potential treatment option,\" said Matthew During, M.D., DSc, FACP, FRACP, president and chief scientific officer of Ovid. \"This collaboration is the first step in Ovid's broader rare neurological disorder biomarker strategy to identify molecular markers of treatment responders and guide enrollment of participants in our clinical trials.\" \"We are excited to partner with Ovid Therapeutics on this biomarker collaboration, particularly as it furthers our mission to improve the lives of people impacted by neurological disorders by identifying biomarkers that can improve diagnosis and inform more precise treatment strategies,\" said Elizabeth Donley, chief executive officer of NeuroPointDX. NeuroPointDX uses its metabolomics platform technology to identify differences in children with autism spectrum disorders compared to typically-developing children and between subgroups of children on the spectrum for earlier diagnosis and more precise treatment. The collaboration will leverage NeuroPointDX's expertise in metabolomics in an effort to identify biomarkers associated with Angelman syndrome. Metabolomics is a process that allows comprehensive exploration of changes in small molecules present in the metabolism of patients to provide insight into the physiology of a disease and the response to treatment. In the STARS trial, this analysis is designed to provide molecular insights into disease mechanism and assess the potential response to OV101 to help understand the physiological impact of the compound in people with Angelman syndrome. This study may help identify the individuals that are most likely to respond to treatment.

Katie Engleman, 910-509-3977 katie@purecommunicationsinc.com New investment will enable Science 37 to scale business operations and enhance technology platform LOS ANGELES, October 18, 2016 - Science 37 (http://www.science37.com), a technology-enabled clinical research company, today announced that it has completed a $31 million Series B financing. Science 37 is reimagining clinical research by bringing clinical trials to people's homes, which unlocks access to those beyond a geographical barrier. The investment will help the company grow operations, further development of its novel technology platform that helps accelerate clinical trial research and continue to expand into new therapeutic areas. The Series B financing was led by Redmile Group, with further funding from Series A lead investors Lux Capital and dRx Capital, as well as a strategic investment from Sanofi Genzyme BioVentures. In addition to financial backing, Sanofi will provide Science 37 with world class technical and strategic guidance through interactions with their international development teams and their affiliates working in the clinical trial ecosystem. As part of the financing, Rob Faulkner, Managing Director at Redmile Group, will join the Science 37 Board of Directors. Science 37 offers end-to-end decentralized clinical trial services, allowing sponsors and researchers to streamline trial setup, increase the speed of recruitment, improve patient retention and offer exceptional data quality. Science 37 aims to reduce the time and cost of running clinical trials by using technology to improve the patient experience and simplify patient recruitment and retention. Today, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries spend approximately $50 billion annually on clinical trials. Up to 90 percent of these trials face cost overruns and delays. On average, clinical trials can take 6-9 years to complete and represent as much as 40 percent of total therapy development costs. Bottlenecks include identification of investigation sites, trial site start-up, and patient recruitment. Nearly 50 percent of research sites underperform on patient enrollment targets, causing trial delays or even failure. \"The clinical trial process represents significant cost and risk in the development cycle for new therapeutics and medical devices,\" said incoming director, Rob Faulkner at Redmile Group. \"Science 37 brings a revolutionary approach to the clinical trial process and our investment underscores our confidence in the company's ability to deliver faster and less expensive clinical trials.\" Introducing a new model to streamline clinical trials Today's clinical trial model is built around trial sites, each of which draws from a local geographic area. Up to 70 percent of potential patients live outside of these local areas. Science 37 replaces physical sites with a single \"metasite\" and brings the clinical trial directly to the patient's home. This means that the patient is allowed to retain their existing doctor while benefiting from reduced travel time and access to quality healthcare via telemedicine or doctor home visits when appropriate. Patients with rare diseases or those eligible for precision medicine can gain access to the same trials as those close to traditional sites. This accelerates biomedical discovery and reduces clinical trial costs. The metasite is powered by a cloud-based mobile research platform called Network Oriented Research Assistant, (NORA), that connects investigators and patients, safely and securely. \"Our first investment in Science 37 proved it possible to transform clinical trials and partner with top pharma, biotech and med device companies,\" said Adam Goulburn, Ph.D., partner at Lux Capital. \"Now we're thrilled to deepen our commitment, putting patients first and using technology to speed life-saving discoveries and cut wasteful costs out of what is today an unquestioned, archaic process.\" \"Science 37 has demonstrated that its new approach to clinical trial management can drive dramatic improvements for the biomedical industry,\" said Lucian Iancovici, M.D., partner at dRx Capital. \"With our continued investment, Science 37 will have greater capacity to pursue new partnerships and help organizations increase the likelihood of successful clinical trials to find new cures faster.\" \"We are excited to expand our investment mandate in the digital health space and to start this new initiative with Science 37, a leading company applying transformative digital techniques to clinical trial design and enrollment,\" said Bernard Davitian, Managing Director at SGBV. \"This investment is fully aligned with Sanofi's digital strategy and provides an opportunity for us to play an active role in this area of the digital revolution.\" The availability of technology is empowering patients with more information, increasing their role in decision making and reshaping their expectations from healthcare companies. \"We started with the simple question, 'What is best for patients?' and built our technology and new clinical trial operating model around the answers. With this latest Series B funding, we will be able to create an even greater impact and achieve our mission of unlocking patient access to clinical trials. Our investors understand how we fit into the larger digital revolution that is forcing healthcare companies to think big, learn fast, adapt successfully, and enable patients to take a more proactive role in their own health,\" said Noah Craft, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science 37. \"Our early successes last year demonstrated an exponential acceleration of trial speed that has led to incredible demand from biotech and pharmaceutical sponsors. We all share the common goal of bringing new cures to patients faster and this investment will allow us to scale to meet the needs of our clients, while expanding into new therapeutic areas.\" About Science 37 Science 37 is a Los Angeles-based technology-enabled clinical research company. The company has created a new clinical trial operating model - the metasite - that unlocks access so researchers can find the right patients, and patients can find the right trials.

Media Sanofi commences dosing in peanut allergy Phase 1 trial leveraging GLAAS SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Sept. 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on cancer, today announced the application of its GLAAS discovery platform in Sanofi's Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of peanut allergy. The trial follows an exclusive license agreement with Immune Design to discover, develop and commercialize products to treat a peanut allergy utilizing the company's GLAASTM discovery platform. Sanofi's Phase 1 trial is designed to evaluate the safety of the product candidate in healthy volunteers. Under a previous collaborative research arrangement, Sanofi and IMDZ generated significant preclinical data demonstrating that certain formulations of GLA, the core of the GLAAS platform, when given prophylactically or therapeutically, can shift the immune responses in a way that may result in significant protection and reduction from allergy symptoms. Immune Design has received an undisclosed milestone payment for start of the trial, and is eligible to receive future development and commercialization milestones, as well as tiered royalties on sales of approved products. \"This is the first expansion of the GLAAS platform into allergic diseases, adding to the existing clinical programs in cancer and infectious diseases,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"The GLAAS mechanism of action is designed to help correct imbalances related to immune dysfunction that leads to allergic diseases. The progress of this program into clinical development and GLAAS' robust preclinical data package supports the potential to leverage GLAAS in additional programs in other allergic disease indications.\" About Food and Peanut Allergy The incidence of food allergies is increasing worldwide in both developed and undeveloped countries, and especially in children.1 Globally, experts believe 220-250 million people may suffer from food allergies.1 In the United States alone, as many as 15 million people have food allergies,2 with allergic reactions resulting in an emergency room visit every three minutes and averaging more than 200,000 emergency room visits per year.3 Peanut allergen is the most prevalent, representing approximately 25% amongst food-allergic children in the U.S.4 About GLAAS Immune Design's GLAAS platform works in vivo and is based on a small synthetic molecule called GLA, or glucopyranosyl lipid A. GLA selectively binds to the TLR4 receptor and causes potent activation of dendritic cells (DCs) leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines that drive a Th1-type immune response. When GLA is accompanied by an antigen and injected into a patient, the combination is taken up by DCs and leads to the production and expansion of immune cells called CD4 T helper lymphocytes with a Th1 phenotype. These CD4 T cells play a key role in boosting pre-existing CTLs that are specific to the same antigen, neutralize a Th2 phenotype, and provide help to other immune cells and natural killer cells that are also important in the overall immune response. GLA can also be used to induce local and systemic immune responses against cancer by directly injecting it into tumors, where it induces a pro-inflammatory state of the tumor microenvironment. Immune Design believes that GLAAS product candidates have the potential to target multiple types of cancer, as well as infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases. GLAAS-based product candidates have now been evaluated in over 1400 subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials demonstrating an acceptable safety profile. About Immune Design Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to generate and/or expand antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, while also enhancing other immune effectors, to fight cancer and other chronic diseases. CMB305 and G100, the two-pronged focus of Immune Design's ongoing immunooncology clinical programs, are the product of its two synergistic discovery platforms, ZVex\u00ae and GLAASTM, the fundamental technologies of which were licensed from the California Institute of Technology and the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI), respectively.

Media a privately held biopharmaceutical company based in New York City, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted orphan drug designation to OV101 for the treatment of patients with Angelman syndrome. OV101 is the first potential therapy to target the disruption of tonic inhibition, a key mechanism that allows the brain to fine-tune neurological signaling and accurately decipher excitatory from inhibitory signals, seen in this disorder. \"Angelman syndrome is a rare, genetic neurological disorder that causes profound developmental and neurologic disabilities. OV101 is the first potential therapy that may address several of the clinical symptoms of Angelman syndrome, such as gait and movement disturbance, anxiety and disrupted sleep patterns,\" said Dr. Jeremy Levin, chairman and CEO of Ovid Therapeutics. \"The granting of orphan drug designation is a significant milestone for the OV101 clinical development program and highlights the high unmet medical need for new therapies that may transform the lives of patients with Angelman syndrome and their families.\" Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development provides special status and incentives to encourage the development of drugs for diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan drug designation conveys up to seven years of marketing exclusivity if the compound receives regulatory approval from the FDA and offers various development incentives, including tax credits related to clinical trial expenses, an exemption from the FDA-user fee and FDA assistance in clinical trial design. The granting of orphan designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements, timing and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. About Angelman Syndrome Angelman syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder that causes developmental disabilities and neurologic problems, such as difficulty speaking, balancing and walking, as well as other symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances and seizures. The most common, genetic cause is a deletion of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene located on chromosome 15. The first signs of Angelman syndrome are usually developmental delays, such as lack of crawling or walking, seen between the ages of 6-12 months. Patients with Angelman syndrome lack a key mechanism of the brain known as tonic inhibition, which fine-tunes neurological signals to allow a healthy human brain to clearly conduct messages from one nerve to another and thus maintain a normal balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals without the system being overloaded. Tonic inhibition, a function of the delta ()-selective GABA-A receptor, functions to maintain tight control over the level and amount of signaling. When tonic inhibition is \"on high,\" the brain can decipher signals correctly without being overloaded, but as the level of tonic inhibition is reduced, the brain becomes inundated with signals and loses its deciphering capability. About OV101 We believe OV101 is the only clinically tested delta ()-selective GABA-A receptor agonist and is being developed to help restore tonic inhibition in patients living with Angelman syndrome. OV101 has the potential to enhance neuronal function to address the pathophysiology of disease. OV101 has been shown in pre-clinical models to normalize tonic inhibition and influence sleep, motor control and cognition, increasing the possibility of improved outcomes for patients. The STARS trial, a Phase 2, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of OV101 in adults with Angelman syndrome, is currently being initiated in the U.S. in order to assess safety parameters and exploratory efficacy endpoints.

Results from these studies were highlighted at the 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAI) Annual Meeting in Los Angeles. Immune Design presented data highlighting the ability of GLA, a synthetic TLR4 agonist and the core of the GLAAS platform, to modify the abnormal allergic immune response observed in peripheral blood from patients with pollen allergies. Specifically, the research demonstrated that GLA significantly decreased the level of Th2 cytokines, IL-5 and IL-13, and increased the level cytokines, IFN and IL-12, to grass pollen allergen in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from allergic donors. Th2 cytokines promote the development of an allergic inflammatory response in people with allergies. Th1 cytokines can counterbalance Th2 immune responses and potentially aid in the treatment of allergic diseases. Abstracts for the 2016 AAAAI Annual Meeting are available online at http://www.jacionline.org/issue/S0091-6749%2815% 29X0003-0 (search \"GLA\" by article title). \"These presentations add to the large and growing body of data supporting the potential of the GLAAS platform for the treatment of chronic diseases beyond cancer, where Immune Design is focused, including allergy,\" said Jan ter Meulen, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Immune Design. \"Investigational agents leveraging GLAAS in oncology are currently in clinical development in randomized Phase 2 studies in soft tissue sarcoma and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Via selective external collaborations and licenses, we are expanding its development in other novel diseases such as peanut food allergy and infectious diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus.\" About GLAAS Immune Design's GLAAS platform works in vivo and is based on a small synthetic molecule called GLA, or glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant. GLA selectively binds to the TLR4 receptor and causes potent activation of dendritic cells (DCs) leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines that drive a Th1-type immune response. When GLA is accompanied by an antigen and injected into a patient, the combination is taken up by DCs and leads to the production and expansion of immune cells called CD4 T helper lymphocytes with a Th1 phenotype. These CD4 T cells play a key role in boosting preexisting CTLs that are specific to the same antigen, neutralize a Th2 phenotype; and provide help to other immune cells and natural killer cells that are also important in the overall immune response. GLA can also be used to induce local and systemic immune responses against cancer by directly injecting it into tumors, where it induces a pro-inflammatory state of the tumor microenvironment. Immune Design believes that GLAAS product candidates have the potential to target multiple types of cancer, as well as infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases. GLAAS-based product candidates have now been evaluated in over 1400 subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.

Formed in 2014 by renowned biotech industry leader, Tony Coles, M.D., and protein folding science pioneer, Susan Lindquist, Ph.D., the company is initially focused on discovering disease-modifying therapies for patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Leveraging its three integrated platforms, Yumanity's innovative new approach to drug discovery and development concentrates on reversing the cellular phenotypes and disease pathologies caused by protein misfolding. For more information, please visit yumanity.com. About Protein Misfolding DNA is the foundational code for all proteins. The linear information in DNA is first \"decoded\" into linear strands of amino acids. These strands must then fold in a very precise, highly complex way to form proteins with distinct shapes and functions. When this folding goes awry, critical functions are lost and, even worse, renegade proteins can set off cascades of destruction, causing brain cells to malfunction and die. Protein misfolding plays a major role in virtually all neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and ALS. While the proteins that misfold in each of these diseases are different, they share this general problem. The cellular stresses caused by protein misfolding lead to aggregation, or clumping of proteins which forms sticky deposits in the brain cells themselves, or in brain tissue, resulting in nerve cell damage and, ultimately, cell death. However, for each of the diseases, as the various \"culprit proteins\" misfold, they damage nerve cells in very different ways, interacting with different cellular components and causing distinct pathways of cell destruction. - UBS, Alzheimer's Report, July 2014; Industry Research. - Alzheimer's Disease International, World Alzheimer Report 2015 - Parkinson's Disease Foundation. http://www.pdf.org/en/parkinson_statistics CONTACTS: Yumanity Therapeutics Dan Budwick Pure Communications (973) 271-6085 dan@purecommunicationsinc.com New Data Support the Continued Development of Both CMB305 and G100 SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Feb. 09, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on oncology, today reported positive topline data from three ongoing Phase 1 oncology studies that support continued development of its two primary in vivo immuno-oncology product completed first-in-human dose-escalation study and an early subset of patients from an expansion study of CMB305 as a single agent in patients with cancers expressing the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen revealed: - CMB305 was safe, without dose-limiting toxicities, as reviewed by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB); - A significant subset of CMB305-treated patients had NY-ESO-1-specific CD8 T cell responses that were generated or increased after therapy; - Patients who did respond immunologically had a greater degree of antigen-specific T cell response than that previously reported in a Phase 1 study of LV305 alone, which is consistent with the intent of the prime-boost approach; and - Preliminary clinical benefit in the form of progression-free rate (PFR) was observed in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. LV305: Novel Vector Delivering NY-ESO-1 RNA Specifically to Dendritic Cells in vivo Maintains Safety and Immunogenicity with Improved Clinical Benefit Profile Data from the expansion study following the previously-reported dose escalation study of LV305 in patients with tumors expressing NY-ESO-1 revealed: - A consistently favorable safety profile, as reviewed by an independent DSMB; - A consistent immune response rate; and - An improved clinical benefit profile. G100: Intratumoral Administration of aTLR4 Agonist Significantly Modifies the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) and Maintains Clinical Benefit New data from the completed pilot trial of G100 with local radiation in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma revealed: - Safety was consistent with that originally reported, demonstrating an acceptable profile alone or in combination with local radiation; - G100 significantly altered the TME, causing inflammation and transforming tumors to a \"hot\" state in G100 responding patients; and - Clinical benefit remained constant with the full patient set. Abstracts for each of these three Phase 1 studies have been submitted for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (June 3-7, 2016). If afforded the opportunity to present, it is the company's intent to work with the Principal Investigator for each product candidate to present a more complete data set at the Conference. \"The accumulating data, including this new set, clearly supports proceeding with the clinical development of our two first products, CMB305 and G100, each activating the anti-tumor immune response by targeting a predefined tumor antigen or neo-antigens, respectively,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D, President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"The initiation of randomized studies in which we are combining our two products with inhibitors of the PD-1/L1 axis through our collaborations with Genentech and Merck will provide the evidence as to how novel products that activate the immune system and aim to make tumors \"hot\" add or synergize with check-point inhibitors.\" Additional Information on Immune Design's Distinct Immuno-oncology Approaches About CMB305 CMB305 is an immuno-oncology product candidate that involves the sequential dosing of two active agents, LV305 and G305. LV305 is a hybrid vector from the ZVex discovery platform that specifically targets dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo and delivers the RNA for NY-ESO-1, enabling the DCs to express the entire tumor antigen and potentially induce a diverse set of CTLs targeting NY-ESO-1 in tumors. G305, in contrast, is designed to boost the CTL response via the induction of antigenspecific CD4 \"helper\" T cells. G305 consists of recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein formulated with a proprietary synthetic small molecule called glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA), the novel TLR4 agonist at the core of the GLAAS platform. CMB305 is intended to be an \"off-the shelf\" therapy that does not require patient-specific manufacturing or ex vivo manipulation of patient samples. Immune Design has conducted prior studies to establish the safety and individual immunologic activity of LV305 and G305. CMB305 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1B trial in patients with locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic solid cancers whose tumors express NY-ESO-1 and a randomized Phase 2 trial of CMB305 combined with Genentech's investigational cancer immunotherapy, atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, pursuant to a collaboration with Genentech. About G100 G100 is Immune Design's intratumoral Immune Activation approach to treating cancer and is expected to directly activate dendritic and other antigen presenting cells near the tumor, which may enhance the function of pre-existing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and create both a local and systemic immune response against neo-antigens. G100 is a product of the company's GLAAS platform and recently completed a Phase 1 study in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. G100 also has potential therapeutic utility in any accessible tumor and will be investigated in combination with local radiation and Merck's anti-PD-1 agent, KEYTRUDA\u00ae, in a randomized study in patients with follicular Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pursuant to a collaboration with Merck.

Media Contact Julie Rathbun Rathbun Communications Will Accelerate Advancement of Lead mTORC1 Modulator Program Into Clinical Evaluation CAMBRIDGE, Mass., December 18, 2015 - Navitor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines targeting the activation of mTORC1, today announced the completion of a $33 million Series B financing. Proceeds from the financing will be used to accelerate the development of Navitor's pipeline of first-in-class selective modulators of the mTORC1 pathway that plays a key role in a range of chronic diseases of aging as well as rare disorders. The Series B funding will enable Navitor to advance a lead program into clinical trials with the objective of demonstrating initial efficacy and safety. The company will also continue to develop additional pipeline candidates and augment its proprietary drug discovery platform. The Series B round was led by new investor Brace Pharma Capital, LLC, a strategic investment company formed by EMS S.A., the largest pharmaceutical company in Brazil, and high net worth biotech investors, and includes participation by new investors Remeditex Ventures, Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures, and an undisclosed individual investor. Existing investors Polaris Partners, Atlas Venture, Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. and SR One, Ltd. also participated in the financing. \"We are excited to welcome three exceptional new investors to our syndicate and have the continued support of our existing key investor group. We believe this financing reflects excitement for our innovative therapeutic approach of selectively targeting mTORC1 and recognizes our significant progress over the past year in advancing our lead small molecule programs,\" said George P. Vlasuk, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Navitor. \"As we move forward with discovering first-in-class medicines, we are delivering on our mission to create next generation therapies that significantly improve the lives of patients affected by chronic diseases of aging and other disorders associated with dysregulation of mTORC1 activation. The additional capital from this financing gives Navitor the necessary resources to advance our drug discovery efforts toward the demonstration of clinical efficacy.\" The Series B financing will enable the advancement of Navitor's pipeline of novel drug compounds that target the mTORC1 activation pathway towards the demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety, opening up the potential for expanded therapeutic opportunities characterized by mTORC1 dysregulation that are currently underserved by available treatments. The pipeline includes novel therapeutics that have the potential to either \"turn up\" or \"turn down\" nutrient and growth factor-responsive cellular pathways to restore normal mTORC1 function. By selectively targeting and controlling aberrant cellular signaling mediated by the mTORC1 pathway, Navitor's therapeutics are designed to rebalance these signals and restore normal function and impact the underlying biology of multiple diseases that are the result of mTORC1 dysregulation, including metabolic, neurodegenerative, immune/autoimmune and musculoskeletal diseases, as well as several rare disorders. In conjunction with the financing, Vinzenz Ploerer, President & CEO of Brace Pharma Capital, will join the Navitor Board of Directors. Mr. Ploerer stated \"Navitor has assembled an outstanding team and is executing a sound strategy that has yielded promising results against multiple unprecedented targets leading to the dysregulation of mTORC1 activity.\" Raymond Schinazi, PhD, DSc, the Founder of Pharmasset and a member of both the Board of Directors and the Scientific Advisory Board of Brace Pharma Capital, commented further \"Selective modulation of mTORC1 activation has the potential to generate first-in-class innovative therapeutics for multiple indications with significant unmet need.

Navitor matches this profile completely.\" About mTORC1 The mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) kinase exists in two multiprotein complexes within the cell, called mTORC1 and mTORC2. Both complexes are critical signaling nodes that regulate multiple cellular functions including metabolism, growth and response to changes in the cell's environment. mTORC1 responds to and integrates the cell's response to nutrient availability and growth factors and plays a key role in protein synthesis and cellular growth. As a critical regulatory pathway, mTORC1 is often dysregulated in multiple diseases across several important therapeutic areas. While several approved drugs (rapamycin and related allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors) target the broad mTOR pathway for certain specific disease applications, the use of these first generation drugs has been limited since they inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, leading to undesirable side effects when used chronically. Navitor's therapeutics are designed to selectively modulate the cellular signals that are aberrant in disease processes caused by the dysregulation of mTORC1 activity without inhibiting mTORC2. About Navitor Navitor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines by targeting cellular nutrient signaling pathways. The company's proprietary drug discovery platform targets mTORC1, which responds to and integrates the cell's response to nutrient availability and plays a key role in protein synthesis and cellular growth. Navitor's therapeutics are designed to selectively modulate the cellular signals that are aberrant in disease processes caused by the dysregulation of mTORC1 activation to address a wide range of diseases, including metabolic, neurodegenerative, autoimmune and musculoskeletal diseases, as well as age-related immune suppression and several rare disorders. The company's founding intellectual property is based on the groundbreaking discoveries related to the mTORC1 pathway and nutrient signaling mechanisms by Dr. David Sabatini at The Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.

About Proteostasis Therapeutics Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (PTI) is developing disease-modifying therapeutics for diseases of protein processing. By combining the DRT platform, a phenotypic screening approach based on the use of functionally pertinent cellular assays and disease relevant models, PTI identifies highly selective drug candidates that modulate the proteostasis imbalance in the cell. In addition to its multiple wholly-owned programs in cystic fibrosis, PTI has formed collaborations with Biogen New Ventures Inc. to research and identify therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative disease and with Astellas Pharma Inc. to research and identify therapies targeting the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway. http://www.proteostasis.com/ Contact: Janet Smart Media | 20, 2015 - Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (PTI), acompany developing small molecule therapeutics to treat diseases caused by defects in protein processing, announced today the expansion of its cystic fibrosis (CF) drug candidate pipeline to include the addition of a novel triple combination therapy of PTI's own CFTR amplifiers, correctors and potentiators. PTI's testing has shown that a triple combination comprising a proprietary corrector and potentiator, currently in late lead optimization stage, and one of PTI's CFTR amplifiers, can restore the activity of mutant F508del CFTR protein to 80% of normal activity in Ussing chamber assays. The components of the triple combination were developed internally using the Company's proprietary Disease-Relevant Translation, or DRT, platform. The screening assay was optimized to identify novel CFTR modulators that show functional synergy with the Company's lead drug candidate, PTI-428, which belongs to a novel class of CFTR modulators the Company refers to as \"amplifiers\", while restoring chloride currents above levels achieved by existing commercially available products. In Ussing chamber assays, one PTI potentiator, ivacaftor, and did not cause F508del CFTR protein destabilization under chronic administration conditions when combined with a PTI corrector. Also in Ussing chamber assays, one PTI corrector, PTI-C1811, has been shown to restore at least 140% of CFTR functional levels relative to Vertex's corrector lumacaftor, which is currently marketed together with ivacaftor as Orkambi. Based on the data generated in the human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells homozygous for the F508del mutation, the Company believes that the combined use of the three molecules has the potential to restore mutant CFTR function in CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation to approximately 80% of normal activity. Further, PTI-C1811 and PTI-P271 combined have demonstrated higher levels of CFTR function in vitro than Orkambi. \"The unique screening set-up allowed us to identify novel chemical moieties with corrector and potentiator properties that act synergistically with our CFTR amplifiers across several CFTR mutation classes\" said Meenu Chhabra, President and Chief Executive Officer of PTI. \"We are very pleased with the rapid advancement of all of our CF programs, and are confident that we will continue to build on our promising amplifier program to expand the range of treatment options for most CF patients.\" PTI is advancing its CFTR amplifier PTI-428 as its lead clinical development candidate for the treatment of CF and expects to file an IND with the FDA by the end of 2015. The PTI correctors and potentiators are expected to enter clinical development by the middle of 2017. About Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 70,000 to 100,000 people worldwide. Improvement in disease management protocols and approval of new drugs to treat the symptoms have extended the life expectancy for CF patients. However, CF remains an incurable disease that leads to death. About Proteostasis Therapeutics Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (PTI) is developing disease-modifying therapeutics for diseases of protein processing. By combining the DRT platform, a phenotypic screening approach based on the use of functionally pertinent cellular assays, with state of the art medicinal chemistry tools, PTI generates highly selective drug candidates that modulate the proteostasis imbalance in the cell. In addition to its multiple wholly-owned programs in CF, PTI has formed collaborations with Biogen Inc. to research and identify therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative disease and with Astellas Pharma Inc. to research and identify therapies targeting the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway. Investor Contact: Janet Smart Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. 617-225-0096 Ext. 2128 [Janet.Smart@proteostasis.com](mailto:Janet.Smart@proteostasis.com) of Immune Design's CMB305 and Genentech's Atezolizumab SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 11, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on oncology, today announced the start of a randomized Phase 2 trial of CMB305, the company's \"prime boost\" cancer immunotherapy cancer immunotherapy, atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; anti-PD-L1) in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. The open label trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CMB305 in combination with atezolizumab versus atezolizumab alone in up to 80 patients with locally advanced, relapsed, or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma expressing the NY-ESO-1 cancer testis antigen. The trial is being conducted pursuant to a clinical collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, which will provide atezolizumab for the trial. CMB305 is a \"prime-boost\" cancer immunotherapy product designed to synergistically induce and expand in vivo cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) targeting NY-ESO-1 which is found in a broad set of tumors. Specifically, synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma tend to express NY-ESO-1 broadly, which should make them good indications for clinical studies of this antigen-specific immune therapy. Atezolizumab is designed to target PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumorinfiltrating immune cells, preventing it from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 on the surface of T cells. By inhibiting PD-L1, atezolizumab may enable the activation of T cells.. \"This trial provides our first opportunity to validate the fundamental hypothesis that combining cutting-edge technologies designed to trigger in vivo anti-tumor CTLs with antagonists of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis should be additive, if not synergistic, and thus could enhance the potential therapeutic benefit to patients,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"We are excited to work with leading sarcoma investigators to advance CMB305 into its first randomized Phase 2 trial and to explore the potential of these two approaches.\" About CMB305 CMB305 is a cancer immunotherapy product candidate combining two potentially synergistic agents, LV305 and G305. LV305 is a hybrid vector from the ZVex discovery platform that specifically targets dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo and delivers the RNA for NY-ESO-1, enabling the DCs to express the entire tumor antigen and potentially induce a diverse set of CTLs targeting NYESO- 1 in tumors. G305, in contrast, is designed to boost the CTL response via the induction of antigen-specific CD4 \"helper\" T cells. G305 consists of recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein formulated with a proprietary synthetic small molecule called glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA), the novel TLR4 agonist at the core of the GLAAS platform. CMB305 is intended to be an \"offthe shelf\" therapy that does not require patient-specific manufacturing or ex vivo manipulation of patient samples. Having established the safety and individual immunologic activity of LV305 and G305 in prior studies, Immune Design initiated a new Phase 1B study of the product candidate CMB305 earlier this year. About Soft Tissue Sarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS) are malignancies that arise from the soft tissues of the body, such as tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures including muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and the lining of joints.1 In the United States, nearly 12,000 people will be diagnosed and approximately 4,870 are expected to die of STS in 2015.2 There are approximately 50 different types of STS including Liposarcomas and Synovial Sarcomas, which are subtypes affecting fat tissue and tissue around the joints, respectively.3 Myxoid/round cell is a type of liposarcoma that accounts for approximately 30% of all liposarcoma cases.4 Myxoid and round cell liposarcoma and synovial sarcomas have been shown to have high expression of NY-ESO-1, approximately 90% and approximately 60%, respectively.5 About Immune Design Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to generate and/or expand antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, while also enhancing other immune effectors, to fight cancer and other chronic diseases. CMB305 and G100, the primary focus of Immune Design's ongoing immuno-oncology clinical programs, are products of its two synergistic discovery platforms, ZVexand GLAAS, the fundamental technologies of which were licensed from the California Institute of Technology and the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI), respectively.

Available at: Accessed: 650-888-0902 Source: Immune Design News Provided by Acquire Media Demonstrates Potential of \"Prime-Pull\" Immunotherapy Approach SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Nov. 3, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on oncology, today announced new preclinical data showing that a dendriticcell targeting lentiviral vector from its ZVex immunotherapy platform administered with G100, which contains a potent synthetic TLR4 agonist, synergize with immune check point inhibitors and demonstrate potent local and systemic anti-tumor activity in cancer models. These data are being presented at the 30th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Conference, National Harbor, Maryland, November 4-8, 2015. \"These findings further illustrate the potential of ZVex-based product candidates and G100 to play an important role in the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy, especially in potential combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\" said Jan ter Meulen, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Immune Design. \"Mechanistically, it is generally believed that the generation of tumor-specific CD8 T-cells can improve the clinical efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors, especially in patients with insufficient T-cell responses. These preclinical data provide a strong rationale for our ongoing and planned clinical trials which combine LV305, CMB305 and G100, agents from our ZVex and GLAAS discovery platforms, with KEYTRUDA and Atezolizumab.\" In the presentations, Immune Design scientists present data showing that in the murine B16 melanoma model, intratumoral injection of ZVex-induced antigen-specific CD8 T-cells into tumors and induces systemic antitumor immunity mediated by antigen spreading. This discovery that Immune Design's two platforms appear to \"pull\" T cells (G100) that were \"primed\" (ZVex agent) into the tumor potentially opens up new possibilities of enhancing the immunotherapy of solid tumors by changing the tumor microenvironment. In addition, combining G100 or a ZVex agent with both anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 antibodies demonstrated increased efficacy in this experiment. The presentations are entitled \"Intratumoral Injections of G100 (synthetic TLR4 agonist) Increases Trafficking of Vector-induced to the Tumor Microenvironment\" \"Checkpoint Inhibitors Synergize with Therapeutic Platforms, ZVex Tumor-specific Immunity and Adjuvant-mediated Anti-tumor Efficacy.\" These abstracts will be published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy for Cancer on November 4, 2015, and the posters will be posted on the publications page of the Immune Design website following presentation at the conference. About G100 G100 is a product candidate generated from the company's GLAASTM discovery platform, and includes a specific formulation of Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA), a synthetic, toll-like immune activation, or 'Endogenous Antigen' approach to treating cancer, which leverages the activation of dendritic cells, T cells and other immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to potentially create a robust immune response against the tumor's preexisting diverse set of antigens. Preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated the ability of G100 to activate dendritic cells in tumors and to increase antigen-dependent systemic humoral and cellular Th1 immune responses. A Phase 1 study of G100 in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) recently completed enrollment, and Immune Design presented data at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. In the first eight patients in MCC study, G100 had an acceptable safety profile and the combined therapy of G100 followed by radiation and/or surgery resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 50%. A second Phase 1 trial is planned to examine intratumoral administration of G100 with intravenous administration of patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving local radiation. In addition to an evaluation of the safety of the combination, the study will assess the response in both injected and non-injected lesions. About ZVex ZVex is Immune Design's discovery platform designed to activate and expand the immune system's natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in vivo. The ZVex delivery system uses a re-engineered virus to carry genetic information of a tumor antigen selectively to dendritic cells (DCs) in the skin. This ultimately results in the creation of CTLs designed to kill tumor cells bearing that same specific tumor antigen.

CONTACT: Contact for Immune Design: Media Contact Julie sannes@annesassociates.com 650-888-0902 SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 29, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on oncology, today highlighted the application of its GLAASTM discovery platform in MedImmune's Phase 2 clinical trial of MEDI7510. MEDI7510 is an investigational agent for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) under development by MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca. MEDI7510 is composed of MedImmune's RSV sF antigen plus GLA, a synthetic molecule licensed from Immune Design's GLAAS discovery platform. This stems from an existing agreement in which Immune Design granted MedImmune an exclusive license to use the GLAAS platform to develop and commercialize vaccines in two different infectious disease indications, one of which is RSV. The Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (NCT02508194) is designed to assess the efficacy of MEDI7510 for the prevention of acute RSV-associated respiratory illness in older adults. The study will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MEDI7510 or placebo and immune response to MEDI7510 in Season 1 and Season 2. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 1,900 adult subjects, 60 years or older, globally. \"It's rewarding to see MEDI7510 continue to advance through clinical development,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Immune Design. \"The field of RSV vaccines has been challenging. A small molecule that activates TLR4 and drives a Th1-type of immune response should be ideally suited to overcome the Th2-prone activity of RSV antigens, which can result in severe lung pathology. We are hopeful of the potential benefit MEDI7510 may bring to older adults.\" ABOUT RSV Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common virus that can cause upper and lower respiratory infections, including colds, bronchitis and pneumonia. RSV is increasingly recognized as an important cause of respiratory infections in adults, particularly affecting the elderly, immunocompromised, and those with underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease. For example, RSV is estimated to infect 5%-10% of nursing home residents per year, with rates of pneumonia and death of 10%-20% and 2%-5%, respectively (Falsy, Clin Microbiol Rev 2000). Currently no vaccine is available for RSV and induction of a Th1 type immune response is viewed as an important feature for any successful vaccine candidate. About GLAAS Immune Design's GLAAS platform works in vivo and is based on a small synthetic molecule called GLA, which stands for glucopyranosyl lipid A. GLA selectively binds to the TLR4 receptor and causes potent activation of dendritic cells (DCs). When GLA is accompanied by an antigen and injected into a patient, the combination is taken up by DCs and leads to the production and expansion of immune cells called CD4 T helper lymphocytes. These CD4 cells play a key role in boosting the anti-tumor immune response by expanding the number and function of existing CTLs that are specific to the same antigen and providing help to other immune cells, including B lymphocytes that are the precursor to antibodies and natural killer cells that are also important in the overall immune response. In addition to infectious diseases, Immune Design believes that GLAAS product candidates have the potential to target multiple types of cancer and allergic diseases. About Immune Design Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to generate and/or expand antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, while also enhancing other immune effectors, to fight cancer and other chronic diseases.

CAMBRIDGE, MA--(Marketwired - Oct 8, 2015) - Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (PTI), a company developing novel therapeutics to treat diseases caused by defects in protein processing, today announced the presentation of data on the Company's CFTR amplifier program and its potential for use in combination therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) at the 29th Annual North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. In the Company's oral presentation titled \"CFTR Amplifiers Are a New Class of CFTR Modulators\", PTI reported an observed increase in cystic conductance regulator (CFTR) modulating activity in human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells, when its compounds were used as stand-alone treatment, and evidence that these compounds can further enhance CFTR mediated current when used in combination with existing clinical-stage correctors. Because mutations in the CFTR gene cause CF, CFTR amplifiers can represent a new class of CFTR modulating agents with potential therapeutic use in the treatment of this severe and incurable condition. CFTR amplifiers enhance the effect of existing CFTR modulators, such as potentiators and correctors. The CFTR amplifiers have demonstrated potential to be effective across CFTR mutation classes in preclinical studies and such results form the basis for PTI's strategy to develop a broad-acting combination therapy able to serve CF patients. \"We are very pleased with the clinical potential of the CFTR amplifier compounds that double the activity of the most effective combination of clinical-stage correctors in the gold-standard HBE cell assay, not only for the most common mutation, F508del/F508del, but in other mutations found in the cystic fibrosis population as well,\" said Meenu Chhabra, President and Chief Executive Officer of PTI. \"We are confident that we will continue to build on our promising preclinical results to advance our products toward clinical trials.\" The Company is developing PTI-428 as a new CFTR amplifier for the treatment of CF. PTI-428 has demonstrated pharmacologic properties amenable to oral dosing. A twenty-eight day, non-GLP preclinical toxicology study testing multiple dose groups of PTI-428 in non-human primates demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile for clinical development. PTI will advance PTI-428 as its lead clinical development candidate for the treatment of CF and expects to file an IND with the FDA by the end of 2015. Additionally, PTI has initiated a new preclinical program in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with another one of its CFTR amplifiers, PTI-130. COPD is characterized by shortness of breath, coughing and increased mucus formation, which can be a significant contributor to morbidity. PTI-130 may represent a novel treatment approach due to its ability to increase CFTR-mediated ion transport in non-CF hBE cells. Targeting CFTR function may potentially improve hydration and restore mucus formation to normal physiological levels in the airway. PTI's CFTR amplifiers are wholly-owned by PTI and were internally discovered through the company's proprietary Disease-Relevant Translation, or DRT platform. PTI-428 and PTI-130 are results of medicinal chemistry optimization of internally discovered active compounds. In tests using HBE cell Ussing functional assays, both drug candidates increased CFTR function and nearly doubled the efficacy of CFTR modulating agents such as correctors and potentiators. These data provide a basis for the clinical exploration of the use of PTI-428 as an add-on therapy to the emerging standard of care (corrector/potentiator combination) to deliver greater benefit to CF patients, and the use of PTI-130 to enhance non-mutant CFTR function in COPD. About Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 70,000 to 100,000 people worldwide. Improvement in disease management protocols and approval of new drugs to treat the symptoms have extended the life expectancy for CF patients. However, CF remains an incurable disease that leads to death. About Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a type of chronic progressive lung disease characterized by poor airflow. COPD is a leading cause of death worldwide. The main symptoms include shortness of breath, cough and sputum production. There is no known cure for COPD. The current standard of care is therapeutic intervention to alleviate symptoms and delay progression of the disease. About Proteostasis Therapeutics Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (PTI) is developing disease-modifying therapeutics for diseases of protein processing. By combining the DRT platform, a phenotypic screening approach based on the use of functionally pertinent cellular assays, with state of the art medicinal chemistry tools, PTI generates highly selective drug candidates that modulate the proteostasis imbalance in the cell. In addition to its multiple wholly-owned programs in CF and COPD, PTI has formed collaborations with Biogen Inc. to research and identify therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative disease and with Astellas Pharma Inc. to research and identify therapies targeting the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway.

The first clinical trial will examine intratumoral administration of G100 with intravenous administration of KEYTRUDA in patients with follicular NHL receiving local radiation. In addition to an evaluation of the safety of the combination, the study will assess the response in both injected and non-injected lesions. The second clinical trial in melanoma will evaluate safety and response to the combination of LV305 and KEYTRUDA in patients who have not yet responded to treatment with KEYTRUDA alone after three months of treatment. Immune Design's G100 and LV305 investigational agents are designed to work in vivo and activate the immune system via the induction and/or expansion of anti-tumor CD8 T cells. They are intended to be \"off-the-shelf\" therapies, in contrast to other Tcell approaches that require individualized ex vivo manipulation. G100 is a potent toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) agonist designed to generate a robust anti-tumor immune response when administered directly to the tumor micro-environment. LV305, in contrast, is designed to activate the immune system through the in vivo generation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), initially against a specific tumor-associated antigen, NY-ESO-1. Immune Design is studying LV305 primarily as part of CMB305, a prime boost approach currently in a Phase 1 expansion trial. \"There is great potential to expand the potential of immunotherapy through combination approaches that will stimulate and enhance the immune system in order to mount the strongest response against cancer,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D, President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"Immune Design has two distinct approaches in oncology, and we look forward to collaborating with Merck to evaluate the potential of combining each of G100 and LV305 with KEYTRUDA in these areas of medical need.\" \"Our understanding of the immune system's role and its impact in the treatment of cancer continues to grow,\" said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. \"This collaboration with Immune Design adds to a broad clinical program designed to explore the role of KEYTRUDA in innovative immuno-oncology combinations - and underscores our commitment to advance the care of patients with cancer.\" About G100 G100 is a product candidate generated from the company's GLAASTM discovery platform, and includes a specific formulation of Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA), a synthetic, toll-like immune activation, or 'Endogenous Antigen' approach to treating cancer, which leverages the activation of dendritic cells, T cells and other immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to potentially create a robust immune response against the tumor's preexisting diverse set of antigens. Preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated the ability of G100 to activate dendritic cells in tumors and to increase antigen-dependent systemic humoral and cellular Th1 immune responses. In addition to the study planned under this collaboration, a Phase 1 study of G100 in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) recently completed enrollment, and Immune Design presented data at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, the poster for which can be accessed on the company's website. In the first eight patients in MCC study, G100 has an acceptable safety profile and a fifty percent (50%) objective response rate per protocol. About LV305 LV305, generated from Immune Design's ZVexTM platform, is designed to activate the immune system through the in vivo generation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) initially against a specific tumor-associated antigen, NY-ESO-1. LV305 is part of Immune Design's 'Specific Antigen' approach, which drives the in vivo generation of a strong, antigen-specific CTL response against selected antigens present in a tumor. Preclinical tests have demonstrated the ability of LV305 to reduce tumor growth of NYESO- 1-expressing tumors, increase production of antigen-specific CD8 cells, and significantly improve the survival of tumor bearing animals. LV305 is the first step in Immune Design's novel prime-boost approach to immuno-oncology, which includes combination with G305, generated from the GLAAS platform, to expand CTLs and potentially generate a potent, durable immune response. Immune Design announced positive data from a Phase 1 study of LV305 at the 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting, the poster for which can be accessed on the company's website. In that study, LV305 caused either a de novo or statisticallysignificant increase in antigen-specific CD8 T cells in 80% of the six evaluable mid- and high-dose patients. Immune Design is primarily studying LV305 as part of CMB305, a prime boost approach. About KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. By binding to the PD-1 receptor and blocking the interaction with the receptor ligands, KEYTRUDA releases the PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. KEYTRUDA is indicated in the United States at a dose of 2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Merck is advancing a broad and fast-growing clinical development program for KEYTRUDA with more than 100 clinical trials - across more than 30 tumor types and over 16,000 patients - both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Pneumonitis occurred in 12 (2.9%) of 411 patients with advanced melanoma receiving KEYTRUDA (the approved indication in the United States), including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 8 (1.9%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively.

Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 patients, including a Grade 3 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving KEYTRUDA. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 3 or greater hyperthyroidism. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 hyperthyroidism. Isolated hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia and other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA in cases of severe hyperglycemia until metabolic control is achieved. Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients receiving KEYTRUDA, consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis (0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade 3 and one Grade 4. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in patients treated with KEYTRUDA: exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma, severe dermatitis including bullous optic neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement of the adverse reaction to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Restart KEYTRUDA if the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any severe or Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. Infusion-related reactions, including severe and life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritis, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For severe or life-threatening reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. For the treatment of advanced melanoma, KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of 411 patients across all doses studied. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse drug reactions reported in 2% or more of patients were renal failure, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cellulitis. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (47%), cough (30%), The recommended of KEYTRUDA is 2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with KEYTRUDA. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk.

(NYSE: PFE) has dosed the first patient in the RESET (Rivipansel: Evaluating Safety, Efficacy and Time to Discharge) study - a Phase 3 clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of rivipansel for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in patients hospitalized with sickle cell disease who are six years of age or older. The start of this trial triggered the second of two milestone payments from Pfizer to GlycoMimetics totaling $35 million for Phase 3 initiation. GlycoMimetics received a $15 million milestone payment from Pfizer in May 2014. According to Rachel King, Chief Executive Officer of GlycoMimetics, \"The initiation of the Phase 3 trial is important progress toward our vision for an effective therapy for people experiencing sickle cell crisis. It's rewarding for the GlycoMimetics team to see this milestone reached.\" This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study is planning to enroll at least 350 individuals with sickle cell disease, aged six and older who are hospitalized for a vaso-occlusive crisis, and will evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with rivipansel. Trial participants must be receiving treatment with intravenous opioids for their vaso-occlusive crisis and must be able to receive the first dose of study drug within 24 hours of initiation of intravenous opioid therapy. The primary endpoint for the study will be time to readiness-for-discharge. Key secondary endpoints will include time to discharge, cumulative IV opioid consumption and time to discontinuation of IV opioids. For additional information about the RESET Trial and to learn more about eligibility, patients can visit www.resetsicklecell.com. In July 2014, GlycoMimetics announced that Pfizer had reached agreement with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), under a special protocol assessment (SPA), for the Phase 3 clinical trial of rivipansel. The SPA serves as an agreement between Pfizer and the FDA regarding the design, endpoints and statistical analysis approach of a Phase 3 clinical trial, results from which could potentially support approval of a New Drug Application (NDA). This includes specific agreement on the approvable composite primary endpoint, time to readiness-for-discharge, and the key secondary endpoints (time to discharge, cumulative IV opioid consumption, and time to discontinuation of IV opioids) considered supportive but not sufficient for approval individually. GlycoMimetics reported top line data from the Phase 2 trial of rivipansel in April 2013 and presented full data from the clinical trial in two oral presentations and one poster presentation at the December 2013 meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH). The oral presentations were selected as \"Best of ASH.\" In the Phase 2 trial, patients treated with rivipansel experienced meaningful reductions in time to reach resolution of VOC, length of hospital stay and use of opioid analgesics for pain management, in each case as compared to patients receiving placebo. In 2011, Pfizer and GlycoMimetics entered into a worldwide license agreement for the development and, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities, commercialization of rivipansel. GlycoMimetics was responsible for development through the Phase 2 clinical trial and Pfizer is now responsible for all future clinical development of rivipansel. Rivipansel has previously received both Orphan Drug and Fast Track status for the treatment of VOC from the FDA, and Orphan Product status in the European Union. About Sickle Cell Disease and VOC Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease affecting 90,000 to 100,000 people in the United States, predominantly of African descent. One of the most severe complications of sickle cell disease is vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). VOC is typically characterized by excruciating, debilitating pain that occurs periodically throughout the life of a person with sickle cell disease. VOC is responsible for more than 73,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States with an average hospital stay of approximately six days. The current standard of care for VOC consists of supportive therapy, primarily in the form of hydration and pain management, typically requiring extended hospitalization. About GlycoMimetics, Inc. GlycoMimetics is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel glycomimetic drugs to address unmet medical needs resulting from diseases in which carbohydrate biology plays a key role. Pfizer is the company's development partner for rivipansel, a GlycoMimetics-discovered investigational therapy for pain crisis associated with sickle cell disease, and is conducting a Phase 3 clinical study. A GlycoMimetics wholly-owned candidate therapy (GMI- 1271) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other blood disorders is also in clinical trials. Glycomimetics are molecules that mimic the structure of carbohydrates involved in important biological processes. Using its expertise in carbohydrate chemistry and knowledge of carbohydrate biology, GlycoMimetics is developing a pipeline of glycomimetic drug candidates that inhibit disease-related functions of carbohydrates, such as the roles they play in inflammation, cancer and infection.

(Nasdaq:FATE) announced today that it has entered into a two-year sponsored research agreement with Boston Children's Hospital to accelerate the development of an adoptive immunoregulatory cell therapy to treat autoimmune diseases. The collaboration seeks to assess the potential of Fate's PD-L1 programmed CD34+ cellular therapeutic as a transformative treatment for type 1 diabetes. The Company's adoptive immunoregulatory cell therapy is currently undergoing preclinical testing across a range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The research program will be led by Paolo Fiorina, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Under the agreement, Dr. Fiorina will investigate the potential of Fate's PD-L1 programmed CD34+ cellular therapeutic to abrogate autoimmune activity responsible for the destruction of pancreatic beta cells and the development of type 1 diabetes. Preclinical data from the Fiorina laboratory presented today at the American Diabetes Association's 75th Scientific Sessions in Boston, Mass., shows that genetically engineered PD-L1+ hematopoietic cells adoptively transferred into hyperglycemic mice traffic to the pancreas, reduce aberrant T cell activity and revert hyperglycemia in a well-established murine model of type 1 diabetes. \"Our research revealed that human CD34+ cells from individuals with type 1 diabetes have reduced expression levels of PDL1, and that genetically engineered hematopoietic cells can induce anergy of auto-reactive T cells in vivo by leveraging the immunosuppressive properties of the PD-L1 / PD-1 pathway,\" said Dr. Fiorina. \"Fate's clinically validated ex vivo cell programming platform offers a promising approach to therapeutically harness these exciting preclinical proof-of-concept data, and we look forward to evaluating the potential of the Company's adoptive immunoregulatory cell therapy to transform the treatment of type 1 diabetes.\" Dr. Fiorina and his team have extensively studied the cellular mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in the autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells that result in insulin deficiency and onset of type 1 diabetes. While life-long daily insulin treatment allows for chronic management of type 1 diabetes, there remains a large unmet need for disease-modifying treatments that directly address the autoimmune etiology of the disease. Each year, more than 15,000 children and 15,000 adults \u2014approximately 80 people per day \u2014are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the US alone. Adoptive immunoregulatory cell therapy represents a novel approach to restoring immune homeostasis and inducing long-term tolerance in patients with type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune disorders. The partnership brings together Boston Children's pioneering research on the immunoregulatory properties of hematopoietic cells and Fate's innovative platform for programming the in vivo biological activity and therapeutic potential of hematopoietic cellular therapeutics. Using its platform, Fate Therapeutics discovered a combination of pharmacologic modulators to promote rapid and supra-physiologic activation of PD-L1 on the surface of human CD34+ hematopoietic cells. The Company has shown that these programmed CD34+ cells recognize and significantly reduce the proliferation rates of activated T cells in vitro as compared to unmodulated human CD34+ hematopoietic cells. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Fate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of programmed cellular therapeutics for the treatment of severe, life-threatening diseases. The Company's approach utilizes established pharmacologic modalities, such as small molecules, to program the fate and function of cells ex vivo. The Company's lead product candidate, PROHEMA\u00ae, is an ex vivo programmed hematopoietic cellular therapeutic, which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The Company is also using its proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell platform to develop ex vivo reprogrammed hematopoietic and myogenic cellular therapeutics.

About Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) Technology Juno's chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology genetically engineers T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. Juno's CAR T cell technology inserts a gene for a particular CAR into the T cell, enabling it to recognize cancer cells based on the expression of a specific protein located on the cell surface. When the engineered T cell engages the target protein on the cancer cell, it initiates a cell-killing response against the cancer cell. About Cell Programming Since its founding, Fate Therapeutics has been dedicated to programming the function of cells ex vivo to improve their therapeutic potential. Using advanced molecular characterization tools and technologies, Fate's platform enables the identification of small molecule or biologic modulators that promote rapid and supra-physiologic activation or inhibition of therapeutically-relevant genes and cell-surface proteins, such as those involved in the homing, proliferation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells or those involved in the persistence, proliferation and reactivity of immunological cells. Fate utilizes its deep understanding of the hematopoietic system to rapidly assess and quantify the therapeutic potential of programmed hematopoietic cells in vivo, and applies its modulators to maximize the safety and efficacy of hematopoietic cellular therapeutics.

CONTACT: Media Contact Julie Rathbun Rathbun sannes@annesassociates.com 650-888-0902 SEATTLE and SAN FRANCISCO, March 31, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on cancer, reported today that analyses of data from three ongoing Phase 1 studies support continued development of its two primary product candidates, CMB305 and G100. CMB305 and G100 represent Immune Design's two distinct approaches to fighting cancer via the in vivo induction and/or expansion of anti-tumor CD8 T cells. CMB305 belongs within the Specific Antigen approach and is a \"first-in-class\" prime-boost therapy containing two potentially synergistic agents, LV305 and G305. CMB305 targets the tumor antigen, NY-ESO-1, which is expressed in a wide range of tumors. In contrast, G100 belongs within the Endogenous Antigen, or intra-tumoral immune activation, approach and relies on activating an anti-tumor immune response by its administration directly into the tumor. G100 is expected to directly activate dendritic and other antigen presenting cells near the tumor, which may enhance the function of pre-existing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and create an immune response against neo-antigens. Both are designed to work in vivo and provide a potential \"off the shelf\" therapy, in contrast to other, ex vivo T cell approaches. CMB305 CMB305's \"prime\" and \"boost\" components, LV305 and G305, were well tolerated and demonstrated specific and selective immunogenicity in two parallel Phase 1 studies to meet the company's guidelines to progress CMB305 into development: - After reviewing the safety data from each of the two studies, the DSMBs for each study voted that each agent was safe without dose-limiting toxicities; - A significant subset of LV305 treated patients had NY-ESO-1-specific CD8 T cell responses that were generated or increased after therapy; - A significant subset of G305 patients had a combination of NY-ESO-1-specific CD4 T cells and antibody responses that were generated or increased after therapy; and - Clinical benefit in the form of stable disease was observed in a number of patients. G100 - l e ongoing safety analysis demonstrates an acceptable profile alone or in combination with local radiation; and - In addition to the initial complete response previous reported, we have observed additional evidence of clinical efficacy. Abstracts for each of these three Phase 1 studies have been submitted for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (May 29-June 2, 2015). If afforded the opportunity to present, it is the company's intent to work with the Principal Investigator for each product candidate to present a more complete data set at the Conference. \"We are very encouraged by the data produced thus far in all three Phase 1 studies,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D, President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"The data from the dose escalation Phase 1 studies of LV305 and G305 met our internal requirements for demonstrating that each of these two 'building blocks' of CMB305 selectively activates different arms of the immune response against NY-ESO-1, thus providing a strong rationale for their combination into the unique 'primeboost' approach intended to generate in vivo anti-NY-ESO-1 CTLs in our recently announced Phase 1b trial of CMB305. Likewise, the continued evidence of the therapeutic effects of G100 alone or in combination with radiation further supports the development of G100 under the 'intra-tumoral immune activation' approach.\" About CMB305 CMB305 is an immuno-oncology candidate combining two potentially synergistic agents, LV305 and G305, and is part of Immune Design's Specific Antigen approach to treating cancer and is a product of the ZVexTM discovery platform. This approach is designed to deliver specific tumor antigens in RNA form directly to cancer patients' dendritic cells using a cuttingedge gene delivery vector specific for a subset of skin dendritic cells. CMB305 is designed to target NY-ESO-1-expressing cancers and is intended to be an \"off-the shelf\" therapy that does not require patient-specific manufacturing or ex vivo manipulation of patient samples. The NY-ESO-1 protein is provided by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. CMB305 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b open label, dose escalation, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical efficacy of CMB305 in patients with any of four solid tumor types that are locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic and express NY-ESO-1. About G100 G100 is intended for intra-tumoral injection and is part of Immune Design's intra-tumoral Immune Activation/Endogenous Antigen approach to treating cancer, which leverages an intra-tumoral activation of dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment to potentially create a robust local and systemic anti-tumor immune response. G100 is a product of the company's GLAASTM platform, and is currently being studied in two separate pilot Phase 1 studies: one in patients with Merkel Cell Carcinoma, or MCC; and one via an investigator-sponsored trial in sarcoma patients in combination with local radiation.

CMB305 is the first product candidate of Immune Design's Specific Antigen approach, which is one of the company's two distinct approaches to fighting cancer. CMB305 is a novel combination product that involves the sequential dosing of two complementary agents, LV305 and G305, and designed to synergistically induce anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to target tumors that express NY-ESO-1, a tumor antigen found in a broad set of tumors. \"CMB305's prime-boost approach leverages the activation of two separate arms of the patient's immune system, that when combined under this novel approach, are designed to induce a strong and long lasting anti-tumor CD8 T cell response, as well as activate other complementary immune effectors that may help to fight cancer,\" said Carlos V. Paya, MD, PhD, chief executive officer of Immune Design. The Phase 1b open label, multi-center trial (NCT02387125) is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical efficacy of CMB305 in patients with locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic solid cancers expressing NY-ESO-1. The study is divided into two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study in up to 12 patients. Part 2 will be an expansion study of the optimal dose in approximately 27 patients. About CMB305 CMB305 is an immuno-oncology product candidate combining two potentially synergistic agents. The first agent, LV305, is a hybrid vector from the ZVex platform that specifically targets dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo and delivers the RNA for NY-ESO-1, enabling the DCs to express the entire tumor antigen to potentially induce a diverse set of CTLs. G305 is the second agent and is designed to boost the CTL response via the induction of antigen-specific CD4 \"helper\" T cells. G305 consists of recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein formulated with a proprietary synthetic small molecule called glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA), the novel TLR4 agonist at the core of the GLAAS platform. CMB305 is intended to be an \"off-the shelf\" therapy that does not require patient-specific manufacturing or ex vivo manipulation of patient samples.

CONTACT: Renee Leck, Stern Investor Relations, Inc. 212.362.1200, renee@sternir.com Investigator-Sponsored Trial to Evaluate Combination of G100 With Local Radiation Therapy in Patients With Sarcoma SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinicalstage immunotherapy company, today announced the start of a Phase 1 clinical trial of G100 in combination with radiation therapy in patients with metastatic sarcoma. G100 is an investigational immuno-oncology agent designed to generate a robust anti-tumor immune response when administered directly to the tumor micro-environment. The investigator-sponsored trial is being conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. \"We look forward to investigating the potential of G100 in combination with radiation therapy to induce an immune response in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, an aggressive disease with limited treatment options,\" said Seth Pollack, M.D., Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and principal investigator. \"G100 is designed to activate antigen presenting cells (APCs) and boost pre-existing anti-tumor cytotoxic T cells or CTLS. In addition, radiation therapy can lead to lysis of tumor cells that release tumor antigens that can be recognized by APCs. The combination of intra-tumoral G100 with local radiation is expected to boost the immune system's response to tumor antigens in the tumor microenvironment and lead to a broad, systemic anti-tumor response.\" The Phase 1 open label trial is designed to evaluate the safety, clinical efficacy and immunogenicity of intra-tumoral G100 in combination with palliative radiation therapy in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Per protocol, patients will receive treatment with G100 weekly starting prior to the radiation therapy and continuing for eight weeks, and efficacy will be evaluated based on radiographic response in metastatic lesions. \"We are pleased that intra-tumoral administration of G100 is now being actively studied in two indications - metastatic soft tissue sarcoma and Merkel cell carcinoma - both alone and in combination with local radiation,\" said Richard Kenney, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Immune Design. \"The key component of G100, GLA, has been evaluated in more than 1,000 subjects and has demonstrated the ability to stimulate both the innate and adaptive immune system while being well tolerated.\" About G100 and the Endogenous Antigen Approach G100 is an investigational agent that is a product of the company's GLAASTM discovery platform and includes a specific formulation of Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA), a synthetic, Toll-like Antigen\" approach to treating cancer, which leverages the activation of dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment, potentially to create a robust immune response against the tumor's preexisting diverse set of antigens. Preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated the ability of G100 to activate dendritic cells in tumors and to increase antigendependent systemic humoral and cellular Th1 immune responses. A Phase 1 study of G100 in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma is also currently underway and a Phase 1 study of G100 in combination with local radiation in patients with non- Hodgkin lymphoma is planned for the second quarter of this year.

(PTI), a company developing novel therapeutics to treat diseases of protein folding, trafficking and clearance, today unveiled a new class of agents, CFTR AMPLIFIERS, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR amplifiers represent a new drug class able to enhance the effect of known cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulating agents, such as potentiators and correctors. The amplifiers are effective across CFTR mutation classes and form the basis for Proteostasis' strategy to develop a broad acting combination therapy able to serve CF patients with most mutations. Proteostasis Therapeutics also announced today that it has nominated PTI130 as a clinical development candidate for the treatment of CF. PTI130, an amplifier, was found to have excellent pharmacologic properties amenable for oral dosing. Fourteen-day, non-GLP preclinical toxicology studies testing multiple dose groups of PTI130 in two different animal species demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile for clinical development. PTI130 is fully owned by Proteostasis Therapeutics and was internally discovered through the Company's proprietary Disease-Relevant Translation, DRT platform. DRT utilizes functionally pertinent phenotypic assays and disease relevant models to identify highly translatable therapies associated with the modulation of protein homeostasis pathways within the cell. PTI130 was derived from medicinal chemistry optimization of hits from the Company's internal compound library based on its impressive ability to double the efficacy of CFTR modulating agents such as correctors and potentiators, in the HBE (human bronchial epithelial) cell Ussing functional assay. These data provide a basis for the clinical exploration of adding PTI130 on to the emerging standard of care (corrector/potentiator combination) to deliver even greater benefit to CF patients. The discovery of PTI130 was partially funded by research grants from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Inc., the nonprofit affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Proteostasis Therapeutics is expected to file an IND for PTI130 with the US FDA and the molecule will enter the clinic in phase I trials by the end of 2015. \"We are proud of our drug discovery platform that has allowed us to identify molecules with novel mechanisms of action such as CFTR amplifiers,\" said Meenu Chhabra, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe that PTI130 places amplifiers on the vanguard of the rapidly evolving CF treatment paradigm and may prove to be the lynchpin for maximizing benefit for all CF patients regardless of the underlying CFTR mutation class.\" About Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetic disorder affecting approximately 70,000 people worldwide. Improvement in disease management protocols and approval of new drugs to treat the symptoms have extended the life expectancy for CF patients and is now approaching 40 years of age. However, CF remains an incurable disease that leads to death. Recently, CFTR mutation specific disease modulators such as correctors and potentiators, have shown the ability to restore CFTR function in selected genotypes. About Proteostasis Therapeutics Proteostasis Therapeutics is developing disease-modifying therapeutics for diseases of protein folding, trafficking and clearance. By combining the DRT platform with state of the art medicinal chemistry tools, PTI generates highly selective drug candidates. The Company's proprietary Disease-Relevant Translation, DRT platform utilizes functionally pertinent phenotypic assays and disease relevant models to identify highly translatable therapies associated with the modulation of proteostasis pathways within the cell. PTI has multiple wholly owned programs in cystic fibrosis. PTI collaborates with Biogen Idec to research and develop therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative disease based on the inhibition of Usp14, which may result in total payments of up to $200M plus royalties. In addition, PTI has a collaboration with Astellas Inc. based on the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway where PTI is eligible to earn up to $1.2B in development milestones.

(LTI), a company leveraging its expertise in lysosomal biology to develop novel small molecules for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, announced today it has raised $20 million in Series A financing. This internal round consisted of expanded funding commitments from its existing investors: Atlas Venture, Hatteras Venture Partners, Lilly Ventures, Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures, Roche Venture Fund, Partners Innovation Fund and several original angel investors, including Orion Equity Partners, LLC, and LTI co-founders Henri Termeer and Bob Carpenter. The proceeds will fund ongoing compound optimization and preclinical development of a glucocerebrosidase (GCase) lysosomal enzyme activator candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In addition, the funding will support a biomarker initiative, for which LTI has previously received grant funding from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. This biomarker effort will help LTI select patients for future clinical trials and predict drug response. LTI will also initiate new research programs based on the genetic links that exist between other lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. \"LTI succeeded in meeting its initial, seed-stage goal - to generate a compelling lead-stage molecule within its GCase program,\" said Bruce Booth, Ph.D., partner at Atlas Venture, the lead investor of LTI's Series A financing. \"With the syndicate's participation in this Series A round, we are not only supporting further development of LTI's breakthrough therapeutic mechanism for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but we are also enabling LTI to expand beyond Parkinson's disease and build out a platform around additional novel targets implicated in underserved orphan and neurodegenerative disorders.\" To help guide LTI's platform expansion and partnering strategy, the company has hired Darren Braccia as vice president of business development. Braccia brings to LTI's team more than 16 years of business and corporate development experience: He has worked in progressive business development roles for private and public companies, including Biogen Idec, Magellan Biosciences and most recently, at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as senior director of business development. Braccia is a graduate of the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University and holds a bachelor's degree from Washington and Lee University. \"Our work to date has affirmed our theory that rare diseases, like Gaucher disease, can be used as model systems for developing therapeutics for common neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease,\" said Kees Been, LTI's founding president and chief executive officer. \"With the continued support of our investors and through the expansion of our team, we will advance our Parkinson's disease therapeutic candidate to a clinical start and also grow our target-rich biology platform by exploring the known relationships between other lysosomal storage and neurodegenerative disorders.\" About the Implications of Lysosomal Storage Disorders on Neurodegenerative Diseases Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of approximately 60 known genetically inherited diseases characterized by a deficiency of various vital enzymes. All LSDs consist of neurological components, but Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common LSD, occurring when the gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is mutated and unable to effectively break down its substrate, glucosylceramide. This results in a build-up of lipids in patients' cells, causing serious health issues. Recent genetic research suggests that GCase mutations may also cause a predisposition to Parkinson's disease (PD). The manifestation of the neurotoxic aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein, also known as Lewy bodies, is the hallmark symptom of PD. Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc.'s (LTI) initial research shows that restoring lysosomal function in human neurons of GD and PD patients may normalize the otherwise-elevated levels of alpha-synuclein. The company is currently developing small molecules that cross the blood-brain barrier and increase GCase activity to potentially treat the root cause - not only the symptoms - of PD. In addition to its work with GD and PD, LTI is investigating other lysosomal enzyme deficiencies and their respective genetic links to common neurodegenerative diseases. About Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc. Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc. (LTI) is dedicated to innovative small-molecule research and development in the field of neurodegeneration, yielding new treatment options for patients with severe neurological diseases. Our strategy leverages the clinically validated link between lysosome-based genetic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases to establish a unique and effective molecular platform for novel drug discovery.

(Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of programmed cellular therapeutics for the treatment of severe, life-threatening diseases, today announced key pipeline objectives for 2015. \"Building upon our solid progress in 2014, we are poised to reach multiple clinical data read-outs throughout 2015 and establish the disease-transforming potential of PROHEMA\u00ae across a wide range of blood cancers and rare genetic disorders,\" said Christian Weyer, M.D., M.A.S., President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \"In late 2014, we reported favorable interim clinical data from our ongoing Phase 2 PUMA study and exciting preclinical findings with our newly-discovered small molecule modulator combination, further strengthening our conviction in the therapeutic potential of ex vivo programmed hematopoietic cells. Continuing this momentum, we have begun to advance a programmed mobilized peripheral blood candidate towards a planned 2015 IND filing, and are actively researching novel mechanisms to enhance the immunotherapeutic potential of CD34+ and T cells. We believe we are well-positioned in the coming year to expand our programmed hematopoietic cellular therapeutics pipeline and to leverage our ex vivo programming approach to pursue significant therapeutic opportunities.\" Key 2015 Pipeline Objectives - Report Full Data on the Primary Efficacy Endpoint in mid-2015 from the Phase 2 PUMA Study of PROHEMA. Fate Therapeutics is currently enrolling adult subjects in its Phase 2 PUMA study of PROHEMA, an ex vivo programmed hematopoietic cellular therapeutic derived from umbilical cord blood. The PUMA study is a randomized, controlled, openlabel clinical trial designed to enroll 60 adult subjects undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplantation for the treatment of blood cancers. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate neutrophil engraftment, which is essential for the successful reconstitution of a new blood and immune system. The study will also assess other key clinical endpoints that contribute to the overall morbidity and mortality of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) including platelet engraftment, disease, relapse, non-relapse mortality and disease-free survival. The Company expects to report full data on the primary endpoint in mid-2015. - Report Topline Data in 2015 from the Phase 1b PROVIDE Study of PROHEMA. Fate Therapeutics is currently initiating the clinical investigation of PROHEMA as a cellular enzyme replacement therapy for pediatric patients with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). The Company's Phase 1b PROVIDE study is an open-label clinical trial designed to enroll 12 pediatric subjects undergoing single umbilical cord blood transplantation. Sixteen different types of lysosomal and peroxisomal storage diseases, such as Hurler and Hunter syndromes, Krabbe disease and various other leukodystrophies, qualify for treatment under the study's inclusion criteria. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate neutrophil engraftment. The study will also include a series of neuro-imaging and neuro-cognitive assessments to explore the potential of the programmed hematopoietic cells to provide long-term replacement of an otherwise deficient enzyme to the central nervous system through a process known as cross-correction. In in vivo murine models of allogeneic HSC transplantation, Fate Therapeutics has demonstrated that the use of programmed CD34+ cells, as compared to unmodulated cells, led to a significant increase both in the engraftment of donor HSCs and in the donorderived expression of enzyme in the brain. The Company expects to report topline data from the PROVIDE study in 2015. - Report Full Data on the Primary Efficacy Endpoint in mid-2015 from the Phase 1b PROMPT Study of PROHEMA. The Company is currently enrolling pediatric subjects in its Phase 1b PROMPT study of PROHEMA. The PROMPT study is an open-label clinical trial designed to enroll 18 pediatric subjects undergoing single umbilical cord blood transplantation for the treatment of blood cancers. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate neutrophil engraftment. The Company expects to report full data on the primary endpoint in mid-2015. - File an Investigational New Drug Application in 2015 for an Ex Vivo Programmed Mobilized Peripheral Blood Candidate. Preclinical data presented by company scientists at the 56 th Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Society of Hematology in December 2014 showed that the newly-identified small molecule modulator combination of FT1050 and FT4145 enhances the biological properties and the in vivo therapeutic potential of mobilized peripheral blood. The programming of CD34+ cells with FT1050 and FT4145 resulted in a 60-fold increase in CXCR4 gene expression levels and a statistically significant increase in engraftment as compared to unmodulated cells, and T-cells programmed with FT1050 and FT4145 were found to have a 66% reduction of cell-surface protein expression of ICOS, a key T-cell activation marker, and a statistically significant reduction in proliferation rates relative to unmodulated cells. Fate Therapeutics expects to file an Investigational New Drug application in 2015 to assess the safety and efficacy of programmed mobilized peripheral blood in subjects undergoing allogeneic HSCT for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. - Advance Preclinical Pipeline of Programmed Cellular Therapeutics. Through internal research efforts, Fate Therapeutics continues to target biological mechanisms that are therapeutically-relevant for modulation and to pursue several attractive opportunities for programmed cellular candidates with disease-transforming potential, including programmed CD34+ cells and programmed T-cells for the regulation of the immune system. In 2015, Fate Therapeutics aims to nominate at least one programmed hematopoietic cellular candidate for further development. Fate Therapeutics to Present at 7th Annual Biotech Showcase Dr. Weyer will present today an overview of the Company's programs at the 7th Annual Biotech Showcase conference at 11:30 am PST in San Francisco, California. A live webcast of the presentation can be accessed under \"Events & Presentations\" in the Investors and Media section of the Company's website at www.fatetherapeutics.com. An archived replay of the webcast will be available on the Company's website for 30 days after the conference. About PROHEMA\u00ae PROHEMA\u00ae is an ex vivo programmed hematopoietic cellular therapeutic derived from umbilical cord blood. PROHEMA is produced by modulating the biological properties of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and T-cells of umbilical cord blood ex vivo using the small molecule FT1050 (16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2, or dmPGE2). The proprietary modulation process induces rapid activation of genes involved in the homing, proliferation and survival of HSCs and the cell cycle, immune tolerance and anti-viral properties of T-cells. PROHEMA is currently being developed as a donor-derived source of hematopoietic cells for use in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to treat severe, life-threatening hematologic malignancies and inherited metabolic disorders. In 2010, the FDA granted PROHEMA orphan designation for the enhancement of HSC engraftment in patients undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation. About Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established procedure performed with curative intent in patients with a wide range of hematologic malignancies and inherited immune and blood disorders. The procedure involves transferring donor-derived hematopoietic cells, including stem cells and T-cells, to a patient following the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and T-cells each play an essential role in allogeneic HSCT - HSCs reconstitute and replace the patient's blood and immune system, and T-cells act as an immunotherapeutic to eliminate residual malignancy. More than 20,000 allogeneic HSCTs are performed annually worldwide in an effort to achieve long-term disease-free remission and/or functional cures. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Fate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of programmed cellular therapeutics for the treatment of severe, life-threatening diseases. The Company's approach utilizes established pharmacologic modalities, such as small molecules, to program the fate and function of cells ex vivo. The Company's lead product candidate, PROHEMA\u00ae, is an ex vivo programmed hematopoietic cellular therapeutic, which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The Company is also using its proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell platform to develop ex vivo reprogrammed hematopoietic and myogenic cellular therapeutics.

CONTACT: Renee Leck, Stern Investor Relations, Inc. 212.362.1200, renee@sternir.com NOVATO, Calif., Jan. 12, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced its intent to file a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) seeking conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the use of six grams per day of sialic acid extended-release (SA-ER; UX001) tablets in the treatment of hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM; also known as GNE myopathy). SA-ER is designed to replace the deficient sialic acid substrate in patients with HIBM, a rare, progressive muscle-wasting disease. Based on Scientific Advice recently received from the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the company intends to file an MAA in the second half of 2015 for stabilization of upper extremity muscle strength. \"HIBM is a devastating disease that can lead to severe progressive and irreversible muscle damage,\" said Sunil Agarwal, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Ultragenyx. \"Based on the Phase 2 data demonstrating slowing of disease progression, we are pursuing conditional approval of SA-ER in the European Union in order to accelerate access to this therapy for patients who otherwise have no approved treatment options.\" The EMA may grant conditional marketing authorization when the potential treatment addresses a severely debilitating disease with an unmet medical need, has a positive benefit to risk profile, and the benefits to public health of its immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Ongoing or new studies must be completed with the objective of confirming that the benefit to risk balance is positive. The approval is renewed on an annual basis until all obligations have been fulfilled, at which point a full approval may be granted. In order to satisfy the EMA's requirement for additional controlled data, Ultragenyx plans to initiate a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of six grams per day of SA-ER in patients with HIBM in mid-2015. A composite of upper extremity muscle strength (UEC) will be the primary endpoint. Key secondary endpoints include GNE myopathyfunctional activity scale (GNEM-FAS) (including patient-reported outcome scores of mobility and upper extremity function), and several measures of lower extremity muscle strength including the lower extremity muscle strength composite (LEC). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted this same Phase 3 study design as pivotal, including the primary endpoint of UEC. About Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is also known as GNE myopathy. HIBM is a rare, severe, progressive, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for sialic acid, with onset in the late teens or twenties. The body's failure to produce enough sialic acid causes muscles to slowly waste away and can lead to very severe disability, with patients typically becoming wheelchair bound and losing most major muscle function within ten to 20 years from onset. There are approximately 2,000 HIBM patients in the developed world, and there is currently no approved therapy. About SA-ER Treatment in Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy A Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with SA-ER has been completed. The data showed a statistically significant difference in the upper extremity composite of muscle strength at 48 weeks with a higher dose group compared to a lower dose group. SA-ER appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated with no serious adverse events observed to date. Over an approximate two-year treatment period in the Phase 2 study and long-term extension, SA-ER appeared to slow the progression of upper extremity disease when compared to the 24-week placebo group extrapolated out to two years. About Ultragenyx Ultragenyx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing to market novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases, with a focus on serious, debilitating genetic diseases.

CONTACT: Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. 844-758-7273 For Media, Bee Nguyen For Investors, Robert Anstey NOVATO, Calif., Jan. 7, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced a license agreement with Inserm Transfert SA and Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle Epiniere (ICM) for intellectual property related to the treatment of Huntington's disease with triheptanoin (UX007). \"Huntington's is a severe and lethal rare genetic disease,\" commented Emil D. Kakkis, Ph.D., M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. \"Energy deficiency is believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease, and we are encouraged by data from a small pilot study suggesting improvement in brain energy metabolism after treatment with triheptanoin.\" \"This pilot study, as well as previous metabolic studies that we performed, indicate that brain energy deficit is a realistic therapeutic target in Huntington's disease,\" said Fanny Mochel, M.D., Ph.D., principal investigator of the study at ICM. Ultragenyx is supporting a second investigator-sponsored clinical study being planned by ICM to evaluate the safety and efficacy of triheptanoin in patients with Huntington's disease. About Huntington's Disease Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement disorders (chorea), behavioral and psychiatric disturbances, dementia, and death. The clinical features of the disease usually emerge between 30 and 50 years of age. The only approved therapy is indicated for the treatment of chorea associated with the disease. There are an estimated 30,000 patients with Huntington's disease in the U.S. A pilot study was completed in ten patients with early stage Huntington's disease in which triheptanoin appeared to impact brain energy metabolism and the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor score. Results from the study were published in the January 7, 2015 online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. About Triheptanoin Triheptanoin, also known as UX007, is a purified, pharmaceutical-grade, specially designed synthetic triglyceride compound created via a multi-step chemical process. Ultragenyx is currently evaluating triheptanoin in two clinical programs. The first program is studying the genetic seizure disorder Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS). This disease is caused by a genetic defect in the transport of glucose into the brain and affects an estimated 3,000 to 7,000 patients in the U.S. Glut1 DS is characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorder. Triheptanoin is metabolized to heptanoate, which can diffuse across the blood-brain barrier and be converted into glucose. Heptanoate can also be further metabolized in the liver to four- and five-carbon ketone bodies that also cross the blood-brain-barrier. Both are intended to provide patients with an additional energy source to the brain. Heptanoate and five-carbon ketone bodies can also regenerate new glucose in the brain, which is deficient in these patients. Ultragenyx is conducting a Phase 2 study in the U.S. and Europe to evaluate the potential of triheptanoin to treat Glut1 DS patients who are not on or who have failed the ketogenic diet and continue to have seizures. The second program is studying long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD), a set of rare metabolic diseases caused by the inability to convert fat into energy, leading to low blood sugar, muscle rupture, and heart and liver disease. Triheptanoin is intended to provide patients with medium-length, odd-chain fatty acids that can be metabolized to increase intermediate substrates in the Krebs cycle, a key energy-generating process. Unlike typical even-chain fatty acids, triheptanoin can be converted to new glucose through the Krebs cycle, potentially providing an important added therapeutic effect, particularly when glucose levels are too low. Ultragenyx is conducting a Phase 2 study to evaluate the potential of triheptanoin to treat LCFAOD.

(Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators to treat orphan diseases, today reported initial data from the first 12 subjects administered PROHEMA\u00ae in the Company's ongoing Phase 2 PUMA study and announced that the study's independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) supported continuation of the clinical trial following a second planned interim safety review. These early data showed that subjects administered PROHEMA, the Company's lead ex vivo programmed hematopoietic cellular therapeutic derived from umbilical cord blood, had an improved median time of neutrophil engraftment and an increased incidence of early neutrophil engraftment. \"Our evaluation of these initial data from 12 subjects shows that small molecule-based programming of hematopoietic stem cells and T cells ex vivo can positively affect the biological activity of these cells in vivo. Given that many of the complications contributing to the 25-30% early mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are tied to the function of donor-derived HSCs and T cells, we believe our ex vivo programming paradigm can meaningfully improve outcomes of this potentially curative procedure,\" said Christian Weyer, M.D., M.A.S., President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \"In 2015, we expect to report on multiple clinical milestones in our PROHEMA development program, including full results on the primary and secondary endpoints of this PUMA study, as well as clinical data read-outs from our PROMPT and PROVIDE studies in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies and inherited metabolic disorders, respectively.\" PROHEMA is derived by programming the biological properties of allogeneic hematopoietic cells ex vivo using a small molecule pharmacologic modulator, optimizing their in vivo therapeutic potential. Of the first 12 subjects administered PROHEMA in the Phase 2 PUMA study, 10 subjects received myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and two subjects received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). Eight of 10 PROHEMA subjects receiving MAC achieved neutrophil engraftment, with a median time of engraftment of 20 days. One of two PROHEMA subjects receiving RIC achieved neutrophil engraftment, which was reached on Day 14. Historical median times of neutrophil engraftment are approximately 26 days for patients receiving MAC and 21 days for patients receiving RIC based on multi-center reports published in the literature of adult patients undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplantation in the United States. Six of the nine engrafting subjects administered PROHEMA in the PUMA study achieved neutrophil engraftment prior to these historical median times. The engraftment of donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is essential for the successful reconstitution of a new blood and immune system. Complications from delayed or failed neutrophil engraftment following allogeneic HSCT are a leading contributor to non-relapse mortality, and this risk increases by 2.5-fold in patients with delayed neutrophil recovery. The PUMA study is designed to evaluate the effect of PROHEMA on hematopoietic reconstitution and immune-mediated outcomes across multiple clinical endpoints that contribute significantly to the overall morbidity and mortality of allogeneic HSCT. These include time to and incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, engraftment failure, bacterial infections, viral reactivation, graft versus host disease, relapse of underlying disease and overall and disease-free survival. On December 16, 2014, the PUMA study's iDMC conducted its second of two scheduled interim safety reviews of PROHEMA. A total of 20 subjects, including 12 subjects that received PROHEMA plus an unmanipulated cord blood unit and eight control subjects that received two unmanipulated cord blood units, were included in the interim review, which assessed safety, time to engraftment, rates of graft failure, early mortality, infection and graft versus host disease. Two early deaths prior to engraftment, which were both attributed to the toxicity of the conditioning regimen received by the subjects, were reported in the PROHEMA arm, and one subject administered PROHEMA failed to achieve neutrophil engraftment. Based on its consideration of the data available on the first 20 subjects as well as historical outcomes reported from multi-center clinical experiences, the iDMC determined that PROHEMA had met established safety criteria and supported continuation of the PUMA study. The Company believes that data from its Phase 2 control subjects are consistent with expected outcomes of patients undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplantation published in the literature, including historical median times of neutrophil engraftment. \"There are an estimated 15,000 patients in need of a donor-derived transplant each year, and up to 40 percent of these patients do not have access to a matched donor source. Given its rapid accessibility and less stringent HLA matching requirements, as well as the significantly lower rates of relapse reported following its clinical use, umbilical cord blood is an advantageous source of hematopoietic cells for allogeneic transplantation,\" said Pratik Multani, M.D., Chief Officer of Therapeutics. \"Initial data on neutrophil engraftment from the PUMA study provide encouragement that PROHEMA may address delayed hematopoietic reconstitution, which is the most significant barrier to umbilical cord blood's broad clinical use as a potentially curative treatment for patients with hematologic malignancies and severe inherited blood and immune disorders.\" In addition to its conduct of the PUMA study, Fate Therapeutics is currently investigating the therapeutic potential of PROHEMA in a Phase 1b clinical trial in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies (PROMPT), and plans to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial of PROHEMA in pediatric patients with inherited metabolic disorders (PROVIDE). About PROHEMA\u00ae PROHEMA\u00ae is an ex vivo programmed hematopoietic cellular therapeutic derived from umbilical cord blood. PROHEMA is produced through a proprietary, two-hour programming process, where the biological properties of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and T cells of umbilical cord blood are modulated ex vivo using a small molecule pharmacologic modulator to optimize these cells' therapeutic potential in vivo. The programming process, which uses the small molecule pharmacologic modulator FT1050 (16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2, or dmPGE2), induces rapid activation of genes involved in the homing, proliferation and survival of HSCs and the cell cycle, immune tolerance and anti-viral properties of T cells. PROHEMA is currently being developed as a donor source of hematopoietic cells for use in allogeneic HSCT for the treatment of a wide range of hematologic malignancies in adult and pediatric patients and for the treatment of a wide range of inherited metabolic disorders in pediatric patients. In 2010, the FDA granted PROHEMA orphan designation for the enhancement of HSC engraftment in patients undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation. About the Phase 2 PUMA Study The PUMA (PROHEMA\u00ae in UMbilical cord blood transplant in Adults) study is a randomized, controlled, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of PROHEMA in adult subjects undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplantation for the treatment of hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Multiple clinical endpoints that contribute significantly to the overall morbidity and mortality of allogeneic HSCT are being investigated in the PUMA study to inform and support potential registrational strategies. These clinical endpoints include key measures of the hematopoietic reconstitution and immunotherapeutic potential of PROHEMA including time to and incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, engraftment failure, bacterial infections, viral reactivation, graft versus host disease, relapse of underlying disease and overall and disease-free survival. The Phase 2 PUMA study is designed to enroll 60 subjects. Eligible subjects are randomized, at a ratio of 2:1, with approximately 40 subjects intended to receive PROHEMA plus an unmanipulated cord blood unit, and approximately 20 subjects intended to receive two unmanipulated cord blood units. Based upon physician choice, subjects are treated with one of two conditioning regimens, an intense myeloablative regimen or a reduced-intensity regimen, to destroy malignant cells and to prevent rejection of the donor hematopoietic cells. Randomization will be stratified by conditioning regimen. An independent Data Monitoring Committee is providing safety oversight during the conduct of the PUMA study. The primary endpoint of the 60-subject Phase 2 PUMA study is based on a categorical analysis of neutrophil engraftment, and the clinical trial is powered to show with statistical significance that 70% of subjects with neutrophil engraftment in the PROHEMA treatment arm engraft prior to a pre-specified control day of neutrophil engraftment. The pre-specified control day of neutrophil engraftment, which is dependent on the conditioning regimen received by the subject, has been established as 26 days for subjects receiving myeloablative conditioning and 21 days for subjects receiving reduced-intensity conditioning. These pre-specified values are based on multi-center reports published in the literature of historical median times to neutrophil engraftment in adult patients undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplantation in the United States (Brunstein, Blood. 2010;116(22): 4693-4699; Cutler, Bone Marrow Transplantation. 2011;46(5): 659-67). The Phase 2 PUMA study utilizes the concurrent control arm to validate the pre-specified values of neutrophil engraftment and to provide context for interpretation of other clinical outcomes. Full data on the primary efficacy endpoint from the Phase 2 PUMA study are expected in mid-2015. About Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established procedure performed with curative intent in patients with a wide range of hematologic malignancies and life-threatening inherited immune and blood disorders. More than 20,000 allogeneic HSCTs are performed annually worldwide to achieve long-term disease-free remission and/or functional cures. The majority of HSCTs are performed in adults for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and in children for the treatment of inherited disorders. Disease-free survival rates of approximately 40-50% at two- and five-years following HSCT have been reported in multi-center clinical experiences for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The procedure involves transferring donor-derived hematopoietic cells, including stem cells and T cells, from mobilized peripheral blood, bone marrow or umbilical cord blood to a patient following the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and T cells each play an essential role in allogeneic HSCT - donor HSCs traffic to and engraft in the bone marrow, replacing the patient's blood and immune system, and T cells traffic to and engage cancer cells, acting as an immunotherapeutic to eliminate residual malignancy. Delay or failure of HSC engraftment leaves a patient severely immuno-compromised and exposes the patient to significant risk of early mortality. Additionally, while the donor T cells impart a critical immunotherapeutic effect, the reactivity of donor T cells can result in a serious complication known as graft versus host disease, where donor T cells recognize antigens on patient's cells as foreign and attack the patient's cells. While allogeneic HSCT holds curative potential, the majority of relapse and non-relapse mortality occurs within the initial months of the procedure, where the rate of relapse and non-relapse mortality is approximately 25-30% at Day 100 following HSCT.

CONTACT: Renee Leck, Stern Investor Relations, Inc. 212.362.1200, renee@sternir.com Agreement Reached With Both FDA and EMA on Pivotal Trial Design NOVATO, Calif., Dec. 15, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced the dosing of the first patient in the pivotal Phase 3 study of recombinant human beta-glucuronidase (rhGUS, UX003), an investigational therapy for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome). \"We are pleased to have reached alignment with both the FDA and EMA on our single pivotal study design for this devastating disease,\" commented Sunil Agarwal, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Ultragenyx. \"This is an important step forward for these patients who have no approved treatment options. It is also an important milestone for Ultragenyx as it is the start of our first Phase 3 program.\" The Phase 3 global, randomized, placebo-controlled, blind-start clinical study will assess the efficacy and safety of rhGUS in 12 patients between 5 and 35 years of age. Patients will be randomized to one of four groups. One cohort begins rhGUS therapy immediately, while the other three start on placebo and cross over to rhGUS at different predefined time points in a blinded manner. This novel trial design generates treatment data from all 12 patients, improving the statistical power of the study relative to a traditional parallel-group design. Based on data from the Phase 1/2 study, patients will be dosed with 4 mg/kg of rhGUS every other week for up to a total of 48 weeks, and all groups will receive a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment with rhGUS. The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of rhGUS as determined by the reduction in urinary GAG excretion after 24 weeks of treatment. The Phase 3 study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of rhGUS, pulmonary function, walking, stair climb, shoulder flexion, fine and gross motor function, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiac size and function, visual acuity, patient and caregiver assessment of most significant clinical problems, global impressions of change, a multidomain responder index, and other endpoints. Agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was reached that their evaluation of the pivotal Phase 3 study will be based on the totality of the data on a patient-by-patient basis. FDA advised against the declaration of a primary clinical endpoint in order to allow for more flexibility in the overall efficacy evaluation, appreciating the heterogeneous and rare nature of this disease. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has already agreed that approval under exceptional circumstances could be possible based upon a single positive Phase 3 study using urinary GAG excretion as the primary endpoint with a trend toward improvement in the most important clinical endpoints (six-minute walk test, forced expiratory volume, spleen/liver volume). Data from the Phase 3 study is expected in the first half of 2016. Longer-term 36-week data from the Phase 1/2 study is expected to be presented at the Lysosomal Disease Network's 11th Annual World Symposium in February 2015. Two additional patients continue to be treated under emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) applications. About MPS 7 Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome), originally described in 1973 by William Sly, M.D., is a rare genetic, metabolic disorder and is one of 11 different MPS disorders. MPS 7 is caused by the deficiency of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme required for the breakdown of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. These complex GAG carbohydrates are a critical component of many tissues. The inability to properly break down GAGs leads to a progressive accumulation in many tissues and results in a multi-system disease. While its clinical manifestations are similar to MPS 1 and MPS 2, MPS 7 is one of the rarest among the MPS disorders. MPS 7 has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and can present as early as at birth. There are no approved therapies for MPS 7 today. The use of enzyme replacement therapy as a potential treatment is based on 20 years of research work in murine models of the disease. Enzyme replacement as a strategy is well established in the MPS field as there are currently four approved enzyme replacement therapies for other MPS disorders: MPS 1 MPS 2 (Elaprase\u00ae, Ultragenyx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing to market novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases, with a focus on serious, debilitating metabolic genetic diseases.

This study entitled \"A Chaperome Sub-Network Safeguards Proteostasis in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease\" was published in the Nov 6 issue of Cell Reports. Aging is the most significant and universal risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. This risk increases disproportionately with age, but no one really knows why. Now a team of scientists from Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc., Northwestern University and Harvard University has uncovered some clues. The researchers are the first to find that the quality of protective genes called molecular chaperones declines dramatically in the brains of older humans, both healthy and not, and that the decline is further accelerated in humans with neurodegenerative disease. Chaperones are a class of proteins encoded by a special set of highly conserved genes that watch over cells, keeping them, and the entire organism, healthy by preventing protein damage. If this critical system declines it leads to misfolded and damaged proteins, eventually leading to tissue damage and death. In keeping the chaperones healthy, we may be able to keep a person healthier, even in old age. The researchers specifically found a decline in 100 genes, corresponding to approximately one-third of all human molecular chaperone genes. Then, with additional studies, they winnowed that number down to 28 human genes specifically involved in age-associated neurodegeneration. These critical genes provide a basis for a biomarker, an early indicator of disease and a target for new therapeutics. To zero in on the subnetwork of 28 key genes, the scientists combined genomic analysis of human brain tissue, from both healthy individuals and those with neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's), with functional studies of C. elegans, a transparent roundworm. (The worm is a popular research tool in neurobiology and has provided many insights into human disease.) Meenu Chhabra, President and CEO of Proteostasis Therapeutics commented that \"this pioneering work is particularly notable because it has been able to distill out only 28 key genes from the vast human genome of 25,000 genes and elegantly demonstrate their connection with the aging process. Using our expertise in protein biology we will now be able to delve into the molecular basis for the decline in the encoded chaperones proteins, with the long term goal of developing chaperone targeted therapies to prevent their age associated decline. Preventing or reversing age related neurodegenerative processes is one of the highest unmet medical needs and this research brings us one step closer to the solution and we thank all the scientists involved in this study for their dedication and groundbreaking work.\" The primary co-authors of this study are Drs. Marc Brehme and Cindy Voisine. The senior and corresponding authors are Dr. Marc Vidal from Harvard medical School, Dr. Hui Ge, formerly at Proteostasis Therapeutics, and Dr. Richard Morimoto from Northwestern University, who is also a co-founder of and scientific advisory board member at Proteostasis Therapeutics.

(\"Proteostasis Therapeutics\"), a company developing novel therapeutics to address diseases caused by defects in protein folding, trafficking and clearance, and Astellas Pharma Inc. (\"Astellas\") today announced that they have entered into a worldwide collaboration to research and develop therapeutic candidates that modulate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) through the use of Proteostasis Therapeutics' Therapeutics will receive an initial upfront payment from Astellas, along with a securities investment. Proteostasis Therapeutics is also eligible for research funding support, future development and commercial milestones that could result in total payments of over $400 million, as well as tiered royalties. Further, Astellas has the right to begin two additional projects under the same terms, which, if it fully exercised this right, would bring the total potential value of the collaboration to $1.2B. \"We are very pleased to be collaborating with Astellas, a worldwide leader in the development of innovative therapeutics,\" said Meenu Chhabra, President and CEO at Proteostasis Therapeutics. \"Our novel approach to drug discovery, coupled with Astellas' track record in drug development, will enable rapid discovery and development of therapies for important unmet medical needs.\" The collaboration will focus on one genetic disease, and further explore additional indications that can be affected through modulation of the UPR pathway. Stress induced by accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is observed in many diseases which are now recognized as protein conformational diseases, including genetic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and retinal degenerative diseases. Selective modulation of the UPR pathway in non-clinical investigations improved the stress response and restored function, suggesting that it can be beneficial as potential novel disease-modifying therapies for multiple diseases with high unmet medical needs. \"Proteostasis Therapeutics has a novel platform that offers a differentiated approach to discovering drugs for unmet medical needs,\" commented Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, at Astellas, \"it complements our existing internal and externalized R&D initiatives and we continue to invest in innovative technologies that can provide new therapeutic options to patients.

(NASDAQ: IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company, today announced that it has entered into a broad collaboration for the development of a herpes simplex virus (HSV) immune therapy with Sanofi Pasteur, (EURONEXT: SAN and NYSE: [SNY](http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&Ticker=SNY)). Sanofi Pasteur and Immune Design will each contribute product candidates to the collaboration: Sanofi Pasteur will contribute HSV-529, a clinical-stage replication-defective HSV vaccine product candidate, and Immune Design will contribute G103, its preclinical trivalent vaccine product candidate. The collaboration will explore the potential of various combinations of agents, including leveraging Immune Design's GLAASTM platform, with the goal to select the best potential immune therapy for patients. The two companies will develop the products jointly through Phase 2 clinical trials, at which point Sanofi Pasteur intends to continue development of the most promising candidate and be responsible for commercialization. Sanofi Pasteur will bear the costs of all preclinical and clinical development, with Immune Design providing a specific formulation of GLA from the GLAAS platform at its cost through Phase 2 studies. Immune Design will be eligible to receive future milestone and royalty payments on any product developed from the collaboration; other financial terms of the agreement have not been disclosed. \"Instead of being limited to a single approach, the companies are joining forces and combining multiple cutting-edge technologies with the goal to develop the most effective and safe immunotherapy to address HSV infection, a significant unmet medical need,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. \"With other clinical and preclinical GLAAS-based product candidates in development, both with partners and internally at Immune Design, I believe this new collaboration continues to demonstrate the productivity and broad applicability of this platform.\" About G103 and GLAAS G103 is a trivalent vaccine candidate consisting of recombinantly-expressed viral proteins adjuvanted with a specific formulation from Immune Design's GLAAS platform. The combination of a novel molecular toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist with rationally selected antigens is designed to boost pre-existing T cells and trigger a broad antibody response, allowing for prophylactic and therapeutic immunization. The GLAAS platform works in vivo and is based on a small synthetic molecule called GLA, which stands for glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant. GLA selectively binds to the TLR4 receptor and causes potent activation of dendritic cells (DCs) leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines that drive a Th1-type immune response. When GLA is accompanied by an antigen and injected into a patient, the combination is taken up by DCs and leads to the production and expansion of immune cells called CD4 T helper lymphocytes with a Th1 phenotype. These CD4 T cells play a key role in boosting pre-existing cytotoxic T cells that are specific to the same antigen; and providing help to other immune cells, including B lymphocytes that are the precursor to antibodies, and natural killer cells that are also important in the overall immune response. Immune Design believes that GLAAS- based product candidates have the potential to target multiple types of cancer, as well as infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases. Product candidates leveraging GLAAS' core technology have now been evaluated in over 1000 subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. About Immune Design Immune Design (NASDAQ: IMDZ) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next- generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease.

Uhl Westwicke Partners [robert.uhl@westwicke.com](mailto:robert.uhl@westwicke.com) 858-356-5932 NOVATO, Calif., Oct. 13, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced the presentation of results from a Phase 2 extension study of sialic acid extended-release (SA-ER, UX001) tablets in patients with hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM; also known as GNE myopathy), a rare, progressive muscle-wasting disease. SA-ER is designed to replace the deficient sialic acid substrate in patients with HIBM. The data were presented at the 19th International Congress of the World Muscle Society (WMS) in Berlin. \"The data from the extension study of SA-ER support our plans to move forward with this program,\" said Sunil Agarwal, M.D. Chief Medical Officer of Ultragenyx. \"While the 12 gram per day dose did not appear to have a clear advantage over the 6 gram per day dose, it does provide additional evidence of activity and safety and we are encouraged to see a potential long-term impact on disease progression in upper extremity muscle strength after approximately two years of treatment.\" Patients in the initial Phase 2 study were randomized to receive placebo, 3 grams/day, or 6 grams/day of SA-ER. After 24 weeks, placebo patients crossed over to either 3 grams/day or 6 grams/day, on a blinded basis, for an additional 24 weeks. The 48-week analysis compared change from baseline for the combined groups at 6 grams/day versus 3 grams/day of SA-ER. The initial Phase 2 data, which were presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting in April 2014, showed a statistically significant difference in the upper extremity composite (UEC) of muscle strength at 48 weeks with the higher dose group compared to the lower dose group. SA-ER appeared to be safe and well-tolerated with no serious adverse events observed to date. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and most commonly gastrointestinal in nature. In the first part of the extension study, all 46 patients from the 48-week Phase 2 study crossed over to 6 grams/day for a variable period of time that was on average 24 weeks. In the second part of the extension study, all 46 patients and 13 treatment-na\u00efve patients received 12 grams/day of SA-ER for 24 weeks. The results presented at WMS include the 49 out of 59 patients who had 24 weeks of data at the higher dose. While the 12 grams/day data do not suggest any clinically meaningful advantage over 6 grams/day, the 12 gram data do provide additional data that support clinical activity with SA-ER treatment. The 12 gram daily dose of SA-ER appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, but the rate of mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse events did appear to be greater with this dose. Over the entire approximate two-year study, treatment with SA-ER appeared to slow the progression of upper extremity disease when compared to the 24-week placebo group extrapolated out to two years. Based on the 48-week and extension study data, Ultragenyx intends to discuss with regulatory authorities a potential pivotal study of SA-ER in HIBM patients. The company will also continue to treat patients in the ongoing extension study. About Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is also known as GNE myopathy. HIBM is a rare, severe, progressive, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for sialic acid, with onset in the late teens or twenties. The body's failure to produce enough sialic acid causes muscles to slowly waste away and can lead to very severe disability, with patients typically becoming wheelchair bound and losing most major muscle function within ten to 20 years from onset. There are approximately 1,200 to 2,000 HIBM patients in the developed world, and there is currently no approved therapy. About Ultragenyx Ultragenyx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing to market novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases, with a focus on serious, debilitating genetic diseases. Founded in 2010, the company has rapidly built a diverse portfolio of product candidates with the potential to address diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is clear, and for which there are no approved therapies. The company is led by a management team experienced in the development and commercialization of rare disease therapeutics. Ultragenyx's strategy is predicated upon time and cost-efficient drug development, with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency.

(Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced the presentation of results from a long-term Phase 1/2 extension study, conducted by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma, Inc., of the investigational fully human anti-FGF23 monoclonal antibody KRN23 (UX023) in adult patients with (XLH). The cumulative 16-month data, combining the four-month dose escalation period data from INT-001 and the 12-month extension data from INT-002, were presented at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Annual Meeting in Houston. \"By binding and inhibiting FGF23, patients treated with KRN23 demonstrated increases in phosphate levels over the cumulative 16-month treatment period,\" said Sunil Agarwal, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Ultragenyx. \"Based on these encouraging results, we plan to continue development in adult XLH patients and are enrolling pediatric XLH patients in our ongoing Phase 2 study.\" The Phase 1/2 extension study (INT-002) was designed to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy following an initial four-month dose escalation study (INT-001) that was conducted in the US and Canada. During the extension study, 22 adult patients with XLH were evaluated over an additional 12 months. Patients received monthly subcutaneous injections of KRN23 administered at a dose range of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg. Data from the INT-001 study were previously presented at the ICE/ENDO joint meeting of The Endocrine Society and The International Congress of Endocrinology in June 2014. Data from the INT-002 study demonstrated that the increases in serum phosphorus levels, urinary phosphorus reabsorption, and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels observed in the initial INT-001 study were generally sustained during the 12-month extension. All patients continued to demonstrate increases in serum phosphorus levels. Approximately 52.6%-85.7% of subjects in the extension study had serum phosphorus levels that reached the normal range (2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL) at peak time on Day 7 or Day 14 after each dose over this 12-month period. The mean increases in markers of bone remodeling (procollagen type I N propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin) observed in INT- 001 were also generally sustained. KRN23 was generally safe and well tolerated over the cumulative treatment period. The most common treatment-related adverse events were injection site reaction, arthralgia, diarrhea, restless legs syndrome, injection site erythema, injection site pain, upper abdominal pain, headache, and decreased neutrophil count (the neutrophil changes were not associated with any significant infections). Serious adverse events were reported in three subjects but were all considered unrelated to KRN23. One patient discontinued treatment due to nephrolithiasis and one patient discontinued due to restless legs syndrome. There were no significant changes in parathyroid hormone or renal ultrasound. Serum calcium levels did not change significantly, and mild hypercalcemia was observed intermittently in two subjects. Urinary calcium was not increased, and three subjects had only transient hypercalciuria. No anti-KRN23 antibodies were observed. Ultragenyx and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (Tokyo:4151) initiated a Phase 2 study of KRN23 in pediatric patients in the US and EU in June 2014 and expect to continue the clinical development of KRN23 in adults with XLH. About X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) XLH is a disorder of phosphate metabolism caused by phosphate wasting in the urine leading to severe hypophosphatemia. XLH is the most common heritable form of rickets that is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait affecting both males and females, though some reports indicate that the disease may be more severe in males. Studies suggest there are approximately 12,000 XLH patients in the United States. XLH is a distinctive bone disease characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone that leads to a spectrum of abnormalities, including rickets, progressive bowing of the leg, osteomalacia, bone pain, waddling gait, short stature, gross motor impairment, muscle weakness, osteopenia, frequent/poorly healing microfractures, spinal stenosis, enthesopathy, and osteoarthritis. Most patients are managed using oral phosphate replacement and vitamin D (calcitriol) therapy, which requires frequent divided doses and careful medical monitoring. It is partially effective at reducing rickets, but it does not improve growth and can be challenging to optimize the dose without increasing the risk of depositing phosphate-calcium precipitates in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis). About KRN23 and FGF23 KRN23 is an investigational recombinant fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody, discovered by KHK, against the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). It is being developed to treat XLH, a disease characterized by excess activity of FGF23. FGF23 is a hormone that reduces serum levels of phosphorus and vitamin D by regulating phosphate excretion and vitamin D production by the kidney. Phosphate wasting in XLH is caused by excessive levels and activity of FGF23. KRN23 is designed to bind to and thereby inhibit the excessive biological activity of FGF23. By blocking excess FGF23 in patients with XLH, KRN23 is intended to restore normal phosphate reabsorption from the kidney and increase the production of vitamin D, which enhances intestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium. Ultragenyx and KHK entered into a collaboration and license agreement in August 2013 to develop and commercialize KRN23.

(Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced the presentation of positive interim data from the Phase 1/2 study of recombinant human beta-glucuronidase (rhGUS, UX003), an investigational therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome). The data are being presented at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) Annual Symposium in Innsbruck, Austria. The Phase 1/2 open-label clinical study is assessing the safety, efficacy, and dose of rhGUS administered every other week via intravenous infusion in three patients. A 12-week primary analysis phase evaluating 2 mg/kg of rhGUS every other week is being followed by dose-exploration and long-term extension. \"We are pleased with the 12-week results of the first clinical study to be conducted in MPS 7 and are grateful to the patients and investigators who are participating in the study,\" commented Emil D. Kakkis, Ph.D., M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. \"Based on the reduction of lysosomal storage shown in all patients in the Phase 1/2 study, we plan to move into Phase 3 testing.\" Results from the primary analysis phase show evidence of clearance of lysosomal storage as indicated by the decline in urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion and the reduction in liver size. The change in urinary GAG excretion was observed by two weeks after the first dose of rhGUS and declined by approximately 40-50% from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment. Decreases in liver size were observed in the two patients who had enlarged livers at baseline. No serious adverse events were observed in the 12-week primary analysis phase and through up to 28 total weeks of treatment. The most common adverse events reported to date are infections and gastrointestinal disorders. No infusionassociated reactions were observed after a total of 38 infusions to date in these three subjects. In addition to the Phase 1/2 study, one patient continues to be treated under an emergency Investigational New Drug application (eIND) sponsored by Dr. Joyce Fox and the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York. Through 24 weeks of treatment, a decline in urinary GAG excretion of 50-70% and a sustained reduction in the size of the enlarged liver and spleen have been observed. The data also show improved pulmonary function based on reduced carbon dioxide retention. No serious adverse events or infusion-associated reactions were observed through 12 infusions. The Phase 1/2 study will continue through the dose-exploration phase and long-term extension. Based on the Phase 1/2 study results and the 24-week results of the patient treated under an eIND, the company intends to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 study by year-end 2014. About MPS 7 Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome), originally described in 1973 by William Sly, M.D., is a rare genetic, metabolic disorder and is one of 11 different MPS disorders. MPS 7 is caused by the deficiency of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme required for the breakdown of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. These complex GAG carbohydrates are a critical component of many tissues. The inability to properly break down GAGs leads to a progressive accumulation in many tissues and results in a multi-system disease. While its clinical manifestations are similar to MPS 1 and MPS 2, MPS 7 is one of the rarest among the MPS disorders. MPS 7 has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and can present as early as at birth. There are no approved therapies for MPS 7 today. The use of enzyme replacement therapy as a potential treatment is based on 20 years of research work in murine models of the disease.

(Nasdaq: KBIO) today announced the publication of preclinical findings describing EphA3 as a novel target expressed by a broad range of human tumors, and whose activation can lead to the selective disruption of the tumor microenvironment and newly formed tumor blood vessels. The expression and function of EphA3 in the tumor microenvironment but not in adult normal tissues together with the favorable safety profile as observed thus far in a Phase 1-2 clinical study, where infusion reactions have been the most common adverse event, supports the development of KB004 (KaloBios' Humaneered\u00ae anti-EphA3 monoclonal antibody [mAb]) as a potential treatment for both hematologic and solid tumors. The new research findings, published online this week by the journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, are described by scientists from Monash University School of Biomedical Sciences and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Melbourne, Australia, and KaloBios. \"Eph receptors constitute the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and EphA3 is important in human fetal development. EphA3 is also found in the mesenchymal tissues of various developing organs but is virtually undetectable in normal adult tissues,\" said Professor Andrew Scott, from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. \"However, EphA3 is over-expressed in many solid and hematologic tumors where it is implicated in cell positioning and possible tumor stem cell survival.\" He continued, \"In this publication, we show that EphA3 is prominently expressed and functional in the tumor microenvironment, where it contributes to the formation of new blood vessels, and is also found on stromal tissue. We have also demonstrated that treatment of human tumor xenografts with a highly specific anti-EphA3 monoclonal antibody can effectively kill tumor-resident mesenchymal/stromal stem cells and inhibit tumor growth by disrupting the architecture and function of the tumor microenvironment.\" \"These data add to the rationale for our current clinical program using anti-EphA3 to treat leukemias and represent a clear rationale for the potential expansion of our investigation of KB004, KaloBios' Humaneered\u00ae anti-EphA3 Yarranton, Ph.D., KaloBios' chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research and development. KaloBios is currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KB004 in hematologic malignancies, with the Phase 2 expansion portion of that trial focused on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and EphA3-positive malignancies. \"Research points to stromal cells playing a key role in chemoresistance, protecting tumors from the killing effects of many anticancer drugs. Thus, if KB004 is able to kill these cells protecting either solid tumors or tumors in the bone marrow, it might offer a particular powerful new way to fight such cancers,\" Dr. Yarranton noted. About KaloBios KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a portfolio of proprietary, patient-targeted, first-in-class monoclonal antibodies designed to treat severe life-threatening or debilitating diseases for which there is an unmet medical need, with a clinical focus on severe respiratory diseases and cancer. Currently, KaloBios has advanced three programs to clinical development: - l KB001-A is an anti-PcrV mAb fragment being developed for the prevention and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection. KaloBios is conducting a 180 patient Phase 2 study in cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects with chronic Pa lung infection. KaloBios has received Orphan Drug designation from both the U.S. FDA and the European Medicines Agency for KB001-A for the treatment of Pa lung infection in CF patients. KB001-A has also received Fast Track Status from the U.S. FDA for the prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia. KaloBios is planning to seek a partner to help accelerate the development of this program. - l KB004 is an anti-EphA3 mAb with potential in treating hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. KaloBios is running an ongoing Phase 1/2 study evaluating KB004 in hematologic malignancies. The Phase 1 dose escalation portion of that study in subjects with hematologic malignancies is fully enrolled with dosing ongoing. KaloBios initiated the Phase 2 expansion portion of the study focused on patients with certain EphA3 positive hematologic malignancies in 2014. - l KB003 is an anti-GM-CSF mAb with potential to treat inflammatory diseases that was being developed for the treatment of severe asthma. In early 2014, KaloBios completed a Phase 2 clinical study in 160 patients with severe asthma which did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in FEV1 from baseline as compared to placebo. As a result, KaloBios discontinued development of this compound in severe asthma, and is continuing to analyze the Phase 2 data to review with thought leaders. KaloBios is currently evaluating other possible indications in order to determine next steps, if any, in the development of KB003. All of the company's antibodies were generated using its proprietary Humaneered\u00ae technology, a method that converts nonhuman antibodies (typically mouse) into recombinant antibodies that have a high binding affinity to their target and are designed for chronic therapeutic use. The company believes that antibodies produced using its Humaneered\u00ae technology offer important clinical and economic advantages over antibodies generated by other methods in terms of high binding affinity, high manufacturing yields, and minimal to no immunogenicity (inappropriate immune response) upon repeat administration in humans.

News Provided by Acquire Media CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and SEATTLE and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Aug. 7, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sanofi (EURONEXT:SAN) (NYSE:SNY) and Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company, today announced that they have entered into a licensing agreement for use of Immune Design's GLAASTM discovery platform to develop therapeutic agents to treat a selected food allergy. The incidence of food allergies is increasing worldwide in both developed and undeveloped countries, and especially in children.1 Globally, experts believe 220-250 million people may suffer from food allergies.2,3 In the United States alone, as many as 15 million people have food allergies,4 with allergic reactions resulting in an emergency room visit every three minutes and averaging more than 200,000 emergency room visits per year.5 \"This is an exciting time in the area of immunology research, and our relationship with Immune Design is a great example of how Sanofi has changed our approach to R&D,\" said Kurt Stoeckli, vice president and head of Global Bio Therapeutics Organization, Sanofi. \"With this partnership, we are able to tap into breakthrough science that holds great potential to transform how food allergies are treated, and the lives of those people affected. This kind of innovation is central to our new approach.\" Under terms of the agreement, Immune Design has granted Sanofi an exclusive license to discover, develop and commercialize products to treat a selected food allergy. The company has received an undisclosed upfront payment and will be eligible to receive development and commercialization milestones totaling US $168 million, as well as tiered royalties on sales of approved products. \"Our fourth agreement for the use of the GLAAS platform further demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach not only in cancer and infectious diseases, but now in allergic diseases as well,\" said Stephen Brady, chief business officer at Immune Design. \"Due to the immune dysfunction leading to allergic diseases, GLAAS' mechanism of action is well suited to correct the imbalance, allowing for the potential of new therapeutics in the targeted indication that currently uses century-old technologies. We are pleased that Sanofi has decided to develop products for this often life-threatening and growing food allergy.\" Under an existing collaborative research arrangement, Sanofi and Immune Design have generated a large set of preclinical data demonstrating that certain formulations within GLAAS, when given prophylactically or therapeutically, can shift the immune responses in a way that may result in significant protection and reduction from allergy symptoms. About Sanofi Sanofi, an integrated global healthcare leader, discovers, develops and distributes therapeutic solutions focused on patients' needs. Sanofi has core strengths in the field of healthcare with seven growth platforms: diabetes solutions, human vaccines, innovative drugs, and consumer healthcare, emerging markets, animal health and the new Genzyme. Sanofi is listed in Paris (EURONEXT:SAN) and in New York (NYSE:SNY). About GLAAS Immune Design's GLAAS platform works in vivo and is based on a small synthetic molecule called GLA, which stands for glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant. GLA selectively binds to the TLR4 receptor and causes potent activation of dendritic cells (DCs) leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines that drive a Th1-type immune response. When GLA is accompanied by an antigen and injected into a patient, the combination is taken up by DCs and leads to the production and expansion of immune cells called CD4 T helper lymphocytes with a Th1 phenotype. These CD4 T cells play a key role in boosting pre- existing CTLs that are specific to the same antigen; and providing help to other immune cells, including B lymphocytes that are the precursor to antibodies, and natural killer cells that are also important in the overall immune response. Immune Design believes that GLAAS product candidates have the potential to target multiple types of cancer, as well as infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases. GLAAS-based product candidates have now been evaluated in over 1000 subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials demonstrating an acceptable safety profile and efficacy. About Immune Design Immune Design (Nasdaq:IMDZ) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells, while enhancing other immune effectors, to fight cancer and other chronic diseases. Immune Design's three on-going Immuno-oncology clinical programs are the product of its two synergistic discovery platforms: DCVexTMand GLAASTM, the fundamental technologies of which were licensed from the California Institute of Technology and the Infectious Disease Research Institute, respectively.

(Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced a license agreement with UniQuest Pty Limited for intellectual property related to the treatment of refractory epilepsy and other seizurerelated and neurologic disorders with triheptanoin (UX007). The intellectual property originated from research on epilepsy and other neurologic models conducted at The University of Queensland. Separately, a United States (U.S.) patent has been issued with claims directed to compositions of triheptanoin above a certain level of purity. The patent term expires in October 2025. A second U.S. patent with claims directed to compositions of triheptanoin in a dosage unit was issued in August 2013 and expires in June 2020. These patent terms do not include any potential for patent term extension of up to five additional years. Similar claims are either granted or being pursued by Ultragenyx in other territories outside the U.S. \"The completion of the license agreement with UniQuest and the issuance of additional composition patent claims mark the continued strengthening of our triheptanoin portfolio,\" commented Emil D. Kakkis, Ph.D., M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. \"We are excited about the potential for triheptanoin to be used in certain difficult-to-treat seizure disorders and hope it will provide a new treatment option for affected patients.\" About Refractory Epilepsy Epilepsy is a family of chronic neurological disorders characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. There are approximately two million epilepsy patients in the U.S. of various types, some of which are genetic in origin. Refractory epilepsy occurs in patients whose seizures cannot be adequately controlled by anti-epileptic drugs, which happens in approximately one third of cases. About Triheptanoin Triheptanoin, also known as UX007, is a purified form of a specially designed synthetic triglyceride compound. Ultragenyx is currently evaluating triheptanoin in two clinical programs. The first program is studying the genetic seizure disorder Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS). This disease is caused by a genetic defect in the transport of glucose into the brain and affects an estimated 3,000 to 7,000 patients in the U.S. Glut1 DS is characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorder. Triheptanoin is metabolized to and intended to provide patients with heptanoate, which can diffuse across the blood-brain barrier and be converted into glucose. Heptanoate can also be further metabolized to four- and five-carbon ketone bodies in the liver that also cross the blood-brain-barrier and provide an additional energy source to the brain. Heptanoate and five-carbon ketone bodies can also regenerate new glucose in the brain, which is deficient in these patients. Ultragenyx is conducting a Phase 2 study in the U.S. and Europe to evaluate the potential of triheptanoin to treat Glut1 DS patients who have failed the ketogenic diet and who continue to have breakthrough seizures. The second program is studying long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD), a set of rare metabolic diseases caused by the inability to convert fat into energy, leading to low blood sugar, muscle rupture, and heart and liver disease. Triheptanoin is intended to provide patients with medium-length, odd-chain fatty acids that are metabolized to increase intermediate substrates in the Krebs cycle, a key energy-generating process. Unlike typical even-chain fatty acids, triheptanoin can be converted to new glucose through the Krebs cycle, potentially providing an important added therapeutic effect, particularly when glucose levels are too low. Ultragenyx is conducting a Phase 2 study to evaluate the potential of triheptanoin to treat LCFAOD. About Ultragenyx Ultragenyx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing to market novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases, with a focus on serious, debilitating genetic diseases. Founded in 2010, the company has rapidly built a diverse portfolio of product candidates with the potential to address diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is clear, and for which there are no approved therapies.

Proteostasis has received a multimillion dollar milestone payment as a result of this achievement. \"We are very encouraged to reach this milestone early in our collaboration with Biogen Idec,\" said Markus Haeberlein, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Proteostasis Therapeutics. \"Achieving a target protein reduction through inhibition of Usp14 in a whole animal system is an important biological validation and demonstrates the disease-modifying potential of our inhibitors against a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. We look forward to continuing to work with Biogen Idec to bring this program toward candidate designation.\" Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, have elevated levels of aggregation-prone proteins in the brain. Prior research has shown that the inhibition of the deubiquinating enzyme, Usp14, enhances proteasome activity and increases the clearance of such proteins. \"We remain optimistic about Usp14 as a very interesting and potentially important target for neurodegeneration,\" said Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Biogen Idec. In December 2013, Proteostasis and Biogen Idec entered into a collaboration to research and develop therapeutic candidates based on the inhibition of Usp14. Under the agreement, the companies are conducting preclinical research to identify lead compounds for clinical development. At specified points, Proteostasis may opt in for global co-development and U.S. co-commercialization rights. The total deal contains payments of up to $200 million, as well as tiered royalties.

(Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators to treat orphan diseases, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared its Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for the clinical development of PROHEMA\u00ae in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation for the treatment of inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). The FDA's clearance of the IND allows the Company to begin expanding its clinical investigation of PROHEMA into rare, non-malignant disorders. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of the \"PROVIDE\" trial (PROHEMA eValuation for the treatment of Inherited metabolic DisordErs) in pediatric patients with IMDs in the fourth quarter of 2014. \"For many severe inherited metabolic disorders, including those with central nervous system involvement, cellular enzyme replacement through unrelated donor cord blood transplantation has emerged as a potentially transformative therapeutic intervention,\" commented Christian Weyer, M.D., M.A.S., President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \"We believe pharmacologically-optimized HSC therapeutics, such as PROHEMA, hold significant promise for improving outcomes in patients with inherited metabolic and other rare genetic disorders. FDA clearance of the PROVIDE study marks an important step towards our goal of clinically evaluating this novel treatment paradigm in the non-malignant disease setting.\" The PROVIDE trial is designed to enroll up to 12 patients with various forms of IMDs, between the ages of 1 and 18, at up to three leading U.S. pediatric HSC transplant centers. The trial's inclusion criteria allows for the enrollment of patients with different types of lysosomal and peroxisomal storage diseases such as Hurler and Hunter syndromes, Krabbe disease and various other leukodystrophies, among others. The primary endpoint of the PROVIDE trial is safety as assessed by neutrophil engraftment. PROHEMA (16, 16-dimethyl prostaglandin the Company's lead pharmacologicallymodulated HSC therapeutic, is currently in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation, and the Company intends to initiate enrollment of a Phase 1b clinical trial in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancy in mid-2014. In 2010, the FDA granted PROHEMA orphan designation for the enhancement of stem cell engraftment in patients undergoing allogeneic cord blood HSC transplantation. In in vivo murine models of allogeneic HSC transplantation, Fate Therapeutics demonstrated that the use of PROHEMA, as compared to unmodulated HSCs, led to a significant increase both in the engraftment of donor HSCs and in the donor-derived expression of enzyme in the brain. About Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMDs) and Allogeneic HSC Transplantation (HSCT) Inherited metabolic disorders include a range of genetic enzyme deficiencies that interfere with critical metabolic pathways necessary to maintain normal organ function. In many of these disorders, the enzyme deficiency leads to cellular accumulation of toxic intermediates within the brain, causing progressive neurological damage that cannot be addressed with enzyme replacement therapy. For those inherited metabolic disorders, which include over 20 lysosomal and peroxisomal storage diseases such as Hurler and Hunter syndromes, Krabbe disease and multiple leukodystrophies, allogeneic HSCT holds a one-time, definitive therapy. Following allogeneic HSCT, donor-derived cells can migrate to and engraft in the brain, providing a long-term supply of an otherwise deficient enzyme to the central nervous system in a process known as cross-correction. About PROHEMA\u00ae PROHEMA is a pharmacologically-modulated, cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapeutic. PROHEMA is produced through a proprietary, two-hour, ex vivo cell modulation process that results in rapid activation of key biological pathways involved in homing, proliferation and survival of HSCs. In preclinical testing, PROHEMA has demonstrated the potential to accelerate engraftment and to drive durable hematopoietic reconstitution, without the need for multi-week expansion protocols. In an initial Phase 1b clinical trial in adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplant (dUCBT), the median time to neutrophil recovery ( > 500 cells/L) with PROHEMA was 17.5 days, which compares favorably to historical norms for patients undergoing dUCBT. In that trial, 100-day survival with PROHEMA was 100%, and PROHEMA provided the dominant source of hematopoiesis in 10 of 12 evaluable subjects, suggesting that treatment with PROHEMA may accelerate engraftment and drive durable and preferential hematologic reconstitution. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Fate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of pharmacologic modulators of adult stem cells, including small molecules and therapeutic proteins, to treat orphan diseases. The Company has built two adult stem cell modulation platforms: a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) modulation platform, which seeks to optimize the therapeutic potential of HSCs for treating patients with hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders, and a muscle satellite stem cell modulation platform, which seeks to activate the regenerative capacity of muscle for treating patients with degenerative muscle disorders.

CONTACT: Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. 844-758-7273 For Media, Bee Nguyen For Investors, Robert Anstey NOVATO, Calif., July 1, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, announced the first patient screened and enrolled in the Phase 2 study of the human monoclonal anti-FGF23 antibody KRN23 (UX023) in pediatric (XLH). XLH is an inherited metabolic bone disease characterized by short stature, skeletal deformities, bone pain, fractures, and muscle weakness. \"The initiation of the Phase 2 study of KRN23 in pediatric XLH patients is a significant step forward in our overall development plan for this debilitating bone disease,\" commented Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Ultragenyx's Chief Executive Officer. \"Completed studies in adults with XLH show KRN23's effect in increasing phosphate levels and bone remodeling. Due to the high rate of growth and bone formation during childhood and the critical role phosphate plays in bone mineralization, pediatric patients with XLH may have the greatest potential for improvement from treatment with KRN23.\" The multi-center, randomized, open-label, dose-finding Phase 2 clinical study will evaluate safety and efficacy in approximately 30 prepubertal pediatric XLH patients. The primary objectives of the study are to identify a dose and dosing regimen and to establish the safety profile of treatment with KRN23 in pediatric XLH patients. Preliminary clinical effects of KRN23 treatment on bone health and deformity as measured by radiographic assessments, growth, muscle strength, and motor function will also be assessed, as well as markers of bone health and patient-reported outcomes of pain, disability, and quality of life. The study has been evaluated and accepted for conduct by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the United Kingdom Medicinal and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA), and the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (CBG-MEB). The study will consist of a 16-week individual dose-titration period followed by a 48-week treatment period. The goal of the dose-titration period is to identify the individualized dose of KRN23 required to achieve stable serum phosphorus levels in the target range. Patients will be divided into three cohorts of escalating starting dose levels of KRN23 with either monthly or biweekly dosing regimens. At the end of the 16-week dose-titration period, patients will receive their individually-optimized dose of KRN23 on a monthly or biweekly basis for the 48-week treatment period. An interim analysis of safety and pharmacodynamic data will be conducted after 24 weeks of the treatment period. In a recent meeting with Ultragenyx, the FDA agreed that blinded radiographic assessments of changes in bone abnormalities, i.e. rickets and bowing, and changes in growth may be used as primary endpoint measures in the pediatric development program and a potential Phase 3 study. The FDA also indicated that a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients could be open-label, but recommended inclusion of a standard of care control arm for comparison on a non-inferiority basis. The final design of a pediatric Phase 3 study would be determined once sufficient safety and efficacy data are available and after further consultation with the FDA. Ultragenyx also intends to continue clinical development in the adult population in parallel with the pediatric program. About X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) XLH is a disorder of phosphate metabolism caused by phosphate wasting in the urine leading to severe hypophosphatemia. XLH is the most common heritable form of rickets that is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait affecting both males and females, though some reports indicate that the disease may be more severe in males. Studies suggest there are approximately 12,000 XLH patients in the United States. XLH is a distinctive bone disease characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone that leads to a spectrum of abnormalities, including rickets, progressive bowing of the leg, osteomalacia, bone pain, waddling gait, short stature, gross motor impairment, muscle weakness, osteopenia, frequent/poorly healing microfractures, spinal stenosis, enthesopathy, and osteoarthritis. Most patients are managed using oral phosphate replacement and vitamin D (calcitriol) therapy, which requires frequent divided doses and careful medical monitoring. It is partially effective at reducing rickets, but it does not improve growth and can be challenging to optimize the dose without increasing the risk of depositing phosphate-calcium precipitates in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis). About KRN23 and FGF23 KRN23 is an investigational recombinant fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody against the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) being developed to treat XLH, a disease characterized by excess activity of FGF23. FGF23 is a hormone that reduces serum levels of phosphorus and vitamin D by regulating phosphate excretion and vitamin D production by the kidney. Phosphate wasting in XLH is caused by excessive levels and activity of FGF23. KRN23 is designed to bind to and thereby inhibit the excessive biological activity of FGF23. By blocking excess FGF23 in patients with XLH, KRN23 is intended to restore normal phosphate reabsorption from the kidney and increase the production of vitamin D, which enhances intestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium. Ultragenyx and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK) entered into a collaboration and license agreement in August 2013 to develop and commercialize KRN23.

CONTACT: Paul Cox, Stern Investor Relations, Inc. 212.362.1200, paul@sternir.com Source: Fate Therapeutics, Inc News Provided by Acquire Media Treatment With KRN23 Induces a Sustained Increase in Serum Phosphorus and Increases in Bone Remodeling Markers NOVATO, Calif., June 24, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced the presentation of results from a multiple-dose study, conducted by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma, Inc. (KKP), of the investigational anti-FGF23 monoclonal (XLH). XLH is an inherited metabolic bone disease characterized by short stature, skeletal deformities, bone pain, fractures, and muscle weakness. The data was presented at the 2014 ICE/ENDO joint meeting of The Endocrine Society and The International Congress of Endocrinology in Chicago. \"We are pleased with the results of the Phase 1/2 study of KRN23 in adult patients with XLH,\" commented Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Ultragenyx's Chief Executive Officer. \"Based on observed improvements in phosphate metabolism, bone remodeling markers, and certain quality of life measures, we are encouraged by the potential for KRN23 to treat the underlying cause of bone disease in both adult and pediatric patients with XLH.\" A multiple-dose Phase 1/2 study (INT-001) with up to four escalating doses from 0.05 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg was completed in 28 adult XLH patients. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous injections of KRN23 given once every four weeks. The efficacy data from the Phase 1/2 study demonstrate that blocking excess FGF23 increases urinary phosphorus reabsorption, serum phosphorus levels, vitamin D levels. Repeat doses with KRN23 over four months led to an increase in serum phosphorus in 100% of patients, with approximately 89% of patients reaching the low end of the normal range. Peak mean serum phosphorus increased to 3.03 \u00b1 0.42 mg/dL after the fourth dose, which is an approximately 60% increase from the mean of 1.89 \u00b1 0.33 mg/dL at baseline. Comparable increases were observed in mean reabsorption of phosphate from the urine (TmP/GFR) and mean serum 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels. Increases in bone remodeling markers were also observed, including markers of bone formation and bone resorption. The increase in P1NP (procollagen type I N propeptide) from baseline was statistically significant (p < 0.05) after all doses and the increase in osteocalcin was statistically significant (p < 0.05) after the fourth dose. Increases in BALP (bone alkaline phosphatase) and CTx (carboxy terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen) were also observed. These data support the concept that KRN23's impact on improving phosphate metabolism will improve bone remodeling, a critical part of creating strong, properly-formed bones. Patients completed two quality of life questionnaires at baseline and after the fourth dose; mean scores improved for all SF- 36v21 and WOMAC2 scales, consistent with an improvement in health status for both instruments, although these were not blinded assessments. For SF-36v2, statistically significant increases from baseline were observed in the role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, and physical component summary scales. For WOMAC, statistically significant increases from baseline were observed in the physical functioning and stiffness scales. Stiffness is one of the major symptoms of XLH in adult patients. These findings will be evaluated objectively in a future randomized controlled study. There were no significant changes in parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, or urinary calcium excretion, consistent with the Phase 1 data showing that KRN23 can specifically improve phosphate control without interfering with calcium control. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, joint pain, diarrhea, back pain, and restless leg syndrome. Joint pain and back pain are both known symptoms of XLH in adults. There were no serious adverse events related to treatment or renal or cardiac tissue calcification. One patient discontinued treatment due to injection site reaction. No anti-KRN23 antibodies were observed. In addition to the four-dose Phase 1/2 study (INT-001) presented at ICE/ENDO, a long-term Phase 1/2 study (INT-002) was completed to evaluate KRN23 treatment for an additional 12 doses in 22 of the patients from INT-001. Administration of KRN23 continued to show a favorable safety profile and sustained improvements in phosphate metabolism and other measures. Data from the long-term Phase 1/2 study is expected to be presented at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Annual Meeting in September. Based on the Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 study results to date, Ultragenyx and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK) plan to initiate a Phase 2 study of KRN23 in pediatric patients in 2014 and expect to continue the clinical development of KRN23 in adults with XLH. 1Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form, Version 2 (SF-36v2) is comprised of eight scales measuring physical function, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health, as well as physical component summary and mental component summary composite scores. 2Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritics Index (WOMAC) is comprised of three scales measuring pain, stiffness, and physical functioning. About X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) XLH is a disorder of phosphate metabolism caused by phosphate wasting in the urine leading to severe hypophosphatemia. XLH is the most common heritable form of rickets that is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait affecting both males and females, though some reports indicate that the disease may be more severe in males. Studies suggest there are approximately 12,000 XLH patients in the United States. XLH is a distinctive bone disease characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone that leads to a spectrum of abnormalities, including rickets, progressive bowing of the leg, osteomalacia, bone pain, waddling gait, short stature, gross motor impairment, muscle weakness, osteopenia, frequent/poorly healing microfractures, spinal stenosis, enthesopathy, and osteoarthritis. Most patients are managed using oral phosphate replacement and vitamin D (calcitriol) therapy, which requires frequent divided doses and careful medical monitoring. It is partially effective at reducing rickets, but it does not improve growth and can be challenging to optimize the dose without increasing the risk of depositing phosphate-calcium precipitates in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis). About KRN23 and FGF23 RN23 is an investigational recombinant fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody discovered by KHK against the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) being developed to treat XLH, a disease characterized by excess activity of FGF23. FGF23 is a hormone that reduces serum levels of phosphorus and vitamin D by regulating phosphate excretion and vitamin D production by the kidney. Phosphate wasting in XLH is caused by excessive levels and activity of FGF23. KRN23 is designed to bind to and thereby inhibit the excessive biological activity of FGF23. By blocking excess FGF23 in patients with XLH, KRN23 is intended to restore normal phosphate reabsorption from the kidney and increase the production of vitamin D, which enhances intestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium. Ultragenyx and KHK entered into a collaboration and license agreement in August 2013 to develop and commercialize KRN23. About Ultragenyx Ultragenyx is a development-stage biotechnology company committed to bringing to market novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases, with an initial focus on serious, debilitating genetic diseases.

(Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators to treat orphan diseases, today announced that potential clinical applications of its ex vivo approach to pharmacologically modulating hematopoietic cells will be presented at the 12th Annual International Cord Blood Symposium being held from June 5-7, 2014 in San Francisco, CA. Two presentations will summarize the potential clinical benefits of modulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and T cells ex vivo, prior to their administration to patients undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation (HSCT), using 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2), a small molecule derivative of the naturally secreted homeostatic factor prostaglandin E2. In addition, a poster presentation will highlight the potential of the Company's proprietary small molecule-based platform to generate clinical-grade, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived therapeutics from an attached segment of an umbilical cord blood unit, while leaving the cord blood unit itself intact and available for later use in HSCT. Fate Therapeutics is currently advancing PROHEMA\u00ae, a pharmacologically-modulated HSC therapeutic, in a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients undergoing HSCT for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. 12th Annual International Cord Blood Symposium Presentations - Future Horizons for the Ex Vivo Modulation of Cord Blood. On Thursday, June 5th, Dan Shoemaker, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer of Fate Therapeutics, will give a presentation on \"Future Horizons for the Ex Vivo Modulation of Cord Blood\" as part of a session entitled \"Derivative Products from Cord Blood and Placental Tissue\" to be held from 1:30 - 3:30 pm. This presentation will explore current and future clinical applications of pharmacologically-modulated umbilical cord blood, including using the Company's therapeutic candidates, in patients with hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders. - PGE2-Modulated Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation. On Saturday, June 7th, Corey Cutler, MD, MPH, FRCPC of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) will give a presentation from 11:00 - 11:20 am entitled \"PGE2-Modulated Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation\", which will include a review of the enhanced biological properties and potential clinical benefits of pharmacologically-modulated HSCs and T cells, including PROHEMA\u00ae. Dr. Cutler served as the principal investigator for the Company's Phase 1b clinical trial of PROHEMA\u00ae in adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplant, which trial demonstrated safety and provided encouraging indications of efficacy including an acceleration in the median time to neutrophil engraftment, an increase in the rate of overall survival at 100-days, and a decrease in the rate of cytomegalovirus reactivation, as compared to historical rates observed at the DFCI and reported in the literature. - hiPSC Generation from Umbilical Cord Blood Segments. On Thursday, June 5th, Bahram Valamehr, Ph.D, Associate Director of Reprogramming Biology of Fate Therapeutics, will present a poster from 5:30 - 6:30 pm entitled \"hiPSC Generation from Individual Umbilical Cord Blood Sample Segments for Allogeneic cGMP Banking and Cell Therapy Applications\". The poster will highlight the use of the Company's proprietary small molecule-based platform to generate transgene-free, genomically-stable hiPSCs from a single frozen segment of a banked umbilical cord blood unit. These findings demonstrate the potential of using attached segments from banked umbilical cord blood units to derive, maintain and bank clinical-grade hiPSC lines without compromising the unit itself.

The Phase 1 open label, multi-center trial (NCT02122861) is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of LV305 in patients with locally advanced, relapsed, or metastatic breast cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer or sarcoma. The trial will enroll up to 36 patients at several clinical centers in the United States. \"The advancement of novel immuno-oncology agents such as LV305 that induce a tumorspecific in vivo T-cell response holds promise for the development of new and targeted approaches to cancer treatment,\" said Seth M. Pollack, M.D., Principal Investigator at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. \"LV305, which targets the NY-ESO-1 antigen expressed in a number of tumors, offers a targeted, tumor-specific in vivo approach to activating a T-cell immune response that we believe may provide benefit to a wide range of cancer patients,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Immune Design. \"LV305 is an integral part of our prime-boost strategy that is designed to provide a superior approach to fighting cancer. Data from the trial will include immunogenicity and initial indications of efficacy, and is intended to support the combination of LV305 with a second proprietary agent, G305, into our prime-boost strategy known as CMB305. We intend to commence a Phase 1 trial for CMB by the end of 2014.\" \"I am excited to see that a novel and perhaps bold idea has matured into a product candidate now being clinically evaluated, and believe that using a novel vector of this type to deliver genetic information specifically to dendritic cells opens a new avenue that holds much promise for treating cancer,\" said David Baltimore, Ph.D., President Emeritus, Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology, California Institute of Technology. About LV305 LV305, generated from Immune Design's DCVex platform, is designed to activate the immune system through the in vivo generation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) initially against a specific tumor-associated antigen, NY-ESO-1. DCVex originated from underlying discoveries made by one of Immune Design's founders and Nobel laureate, David Baltimore, Ph.D. Dr. Baltimore and his colleagues theorized that a lentiviral vector could be engineered to selectively deliver specific genetic information of a tumor antigen directly to dendritic cells to mount an immune response. LV305 is part of Immune Design's \"Specific Antigen\" approach, which drives the in vivo generation of a strong, antigen-specific CTL response against selected antigens present in a tumor. Preclinical tests have demonstrated the ability of LV305 to reduce tumor growth of NYESO- 1-expressing tumors, increase production of antigen-specific CD8 cells, and significantly improve the survival of tumor-bearing animals. LV305 is the first step in Immune Design's novel prime-boost approach to immuno-oncology, which includes combination with G305, generated from the GLAASTM platform, to expand CTLs and potentially generate a potent, durable immune response. About Immune Design Immune Design is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. The company's technologies are engineered to activate the immune system's natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells to fight cancer and other chronic diseases.

MEDI7510 is composed of MedImmune's RSV sF antigen plus GLA, a synthetic molecule licensed from Immune Design's GLAAS discovery platform. This follows an existing agreement between the two companies, in which Immune Design granted MedImmune an exclusive license to use GLA to develop and commercialize vaccines in three different infectious disease indications, one of which is RSV. The parties have not disclosed the other two indications. The Phase 1a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cohort escalation study (NCT02115815) is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single ascending intramuscular dose of MEDI7510 or placebo in adults 60 years or older who are healthy or who have stable, underlying medical conditions. The trial is expected to enroll 144 patients at several clinical centers in the United States. \"We are pleased to see another potential therapy progressing in the clinic that includes GLA,\" said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Immune Design. \"While we are pursuing product candidates from GLAAS in immuno-oncology, the platform also holds promise in infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases, and we plan to continue to explore additional collaborations outside of oncology.\" About GLAAS Immune Design's GLAAS platform works in vivo and is based on a small synthetic molecule called GLA, which stands for glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant. GLA selectively binds to the TLR4 receptor and causes potent activation of dendritic cells. When GLA is accompanied by an antigen and injected into a patient, the combination is taken up by DCs and leads to the production and expansion of immune cells called CD4 T helper lymphocytes. These CD4 cells play a key role in boosting the anti-tumor immune response by expanding the number and function of existing CTLs that are specific to the same antigen; and providing help to other immune cells, including B lymphocytes that are the precursor to antibodies, and natural killer cells that are also important in the overall immune response. Immune Design believes that GLAAS product candidates have the potential to target multiple types of cancer, as well as infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases.

Shire plc (LSE: SHP,NASDAQ: SHPG) and Lumena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company with rare disease pipeline assets, announce the acquisition of Lumena Pharmaceuticals by Shire. Chief Executive of Shire, Flemming Ornskov, MD comments: \"Our pipeline and strategic focus on rare diseases is even further strengthened with the acquisition of Lumena Pharmaceuticals, which also complements our strong GI presence. These attractive potential treatments may offer new hope to patients with rare cholestatic liver disease and further contribute to Shire's future growth. We are excited by the possibilities of these new assets in liver disease. We have the resources, the infrastructure and the operating capacity to invest in these new potential growth drivers which add further value to Shire's innovative pipeline.\" President and CEO of Lumena Pharmaceuticals, Mike Grey comments: \"I believe that this transaction is a significant win for all parties involved, especially the patients, and the future of LUM001 as a treatment for rare cholestatic liver diseases looks brighter than ever. Shire has deep rare disease experience, a global infrastructure, and the commercial expertise to deliver LUM001 to patients around the world. The Lumena team will work closely with Shire to finish the ongoing Phase 2 clinical programs as part of our commitment to the patient populations we have championed since we formed Lumena Pharmaceuticals.\" Strategic rationale and background on Lumena Pharmaceuticals The acquisition of Lumena strengthens Shire's already valuable and robust pipeline. It complements Shire's strategic focus on Rare Diseases and provides a future growth path for Shire's Gastrointestinal business, which generated revenues of over $800 million in 2013. In acquiring Lumena, Shire is gaining experience in liver disease with the opportunity to leverage its existing GI commercial infrastructure. In addition, there is a good fit with Shire's recent acquisition of Fibrotech, which has brought pipeline programs to address unmet patient need in other fibrotic conditions including renal impairment. Lumena Pharmaceuticals brings to Shire two new oral therapeutic compounds; LUM001, in Phase 2 with four potential orphan indications and LUM002, ready to enter Phase 2 later in 2014. LUM001 and LUM002 are both inhibitors of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), which is primarily responsible for recycling bile acids from the intestine to the liver. Blocking bile acid transport with ASBT inhibitors reduces bile acid absorption and has the potential to improve liver function and relieve disease symptoms (such as extreme itching associated with cholestatic liver diseases), and may slow disease progression. These rare cholestatic liver diseases are primarily treated by hepatologists and gastroenterologists and can be covered by a small, specialty sales force consistent with Shire's model. Shire does not expect the acquisition of Lumena to result in a change to its previously stated earnings guidance for 2014. About LUM001 LUM001 is a novel, once-daily, orally-administered, potent and selective ASBT inhibitor that works by preventing recycling of bile acids back to the liver and is thought to reduce bile acid accumulation, improve liver function and potentially relieve the extreme itching associated with cholestatic liver disease. LUM001 is currently in Phase 2 clinical development for four rare cholestatic liver disease indications; two pediatric and two adult with a potential 2016 launch. These potential indications are: Alagille Some of the key characteristics of cholestatic liver diseases are elevated bile acids, leading to progressive liver damage that can cause liver failure, and pruritus, or severe itching. Pruritus is generally the most debilitating symptom afflicting children and adults with these diseases. Surgical intervention, which lowers bile acid levels, has been shown to relieve symptoms and slow disease progression in patients with ALGS and PFIC - this is currently the only treatment option for these patients. Patients with cholestatic liver diseases may ultimately require liver transplants. By reducing serum bile acids, LUM001 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for alleviating the pruritus and progressive liver damage associated with cholestatic liver diseases. The prevalence of each of the four diseases is as follows: |Indication US||Indication US prevalence | 3 per 100,000 |EU individuals | <1 per 100,000 |3 per individuals | 40 per 100,000 |1 per 100,000| |PBC||126,979 individuals | 14 per 100,000 |30 per 100,000| |PSC||44,222 individuals | 3 per 100,000 |3 100,000| (Source: Lumena Pharmaceuticals Applications for Orphan Designation): LUM001 has received orphan drug designation for all four potential indications in both the United States and the European Union. About LUM002 LUM002 is a novel, once daily, orally-administered, highly potent and selective inhibitor of ASBT, in development for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a common and often \"silent\" liver disease characterized by fat deposits in the liver and inflammation which can progress to significant fibrosis. While the underlying cause of liver injury in NASH is not fully known, it is strongly associated with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, and other metabolic disorders. Approximately 6 million individuals in the US are estimated to have progressed to NASH and some 600,000 to NASH-related cirrhosis (Source: World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines June 2012). By blocking bile acid reabsorption, LUM002 is thought to modulate colonic bile acid concentrations and receptor signaling on cells in the lower portion of the GI tract. This signaling is believed to result in the secretion of peptides that regulate insulin release from the pancreas, glucose metabolism and the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating insulin resistance and normalizing lipoprotein metabolism have significant potential to benefit patients with NASH. Phase 1 safety trials in healthy volunteers and a Phase 1b trial in patients with metabolic disease have been completed. The next step is to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with NASH - anticipated to begin in the second half of 2014.

For further information please contact: Pharmaceuticals Link between lysosome-based genetic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases to be explored as foundation for new therapeutics CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 May 12, 2014 \u2014 Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc. (LTI), a company leveraging its expertise in lysosomal biology to develop novel small molecules for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, announced today it has raised $4.8 million in seed funding. Atlas Venture was the lead investor, with additional participation from Hatteras Venture Partners, Lilly Ventures, Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures, Roche Venture Fund, Partners Innovation Fund and several angel investors, including Orion Equity Partners, LLC. LTI was founded by Dimitri Krainc, M.D., Ph.D., and former Genzyme executives Henri Termeer, Bob Carpenter and Peter Wirth. Kees Been is the founding president and chief executive officer of the company. LTI's unique approach to discovering new drugs for neurodegenerative diseases is based on research performed in Krainc's lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a founding member of Partners HealthCare and an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. The work completed at MGH by Krainc and Joseph Mazzulli, Ph.D., LTI's scientific co-founder and a former postdoctoral fellow in the lab, builds on the association between Gaucher disease (GD), a rare lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in the gene for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and a predisposition to Parkinson's disease (PD). They demonstrated that increasing GCase activity in human neurons of GD and PD patients can normalize lysosomal function and improve neuronal survival. This research continues at Northwestern University, where Krainc is now Ward Professor and chairman of the department of neurology, and Mazzulli is an assistant professor of neurology. Compounds that enhance GCase activity represent a potential breakthrough opportunity to develop an entirely new class of agents to treat GD and PD. The risk of developing PD in the broader population has also been firmly linked to GCase mutations. This illustrates how rare diseases can be used as model systems for developing therapeutics for common neurodegenerative disorders. \"This inventive approach to treating Parkinson's disease was really facilitated by the success of current treatment strategies, such as enzyme replacement therapy, that have enabled the Gaucher disease patient population to live longer,\" said Been. \"However, an unfortunate consequence of this longevity is the finding that Gaucher patients experience a 20-fold increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. At LTI, our lead development program is a completely novel approach to treating Parkinson's disease by developing small molecules that can cross the blood-brain barrier to increase the activity of the GCase enzyme in the lysosome and potentially reduce Parkinson's disease risk.\" \"This seed funding will be instrumental in enabling LTI to progress its GCase program through the lead-generation process and in setting us up for preclinical development,\" said Carpenter, who chairs LTI's board of directors. \"I look forward to working with Kees and his team to refine LTI's GCase modulator platform over the coming months, with an eye toward advancing breakthrough therapeutics for Parkinson's disease.\" \"We are pleased to support LTI through this seed round of funding,\" said Bruce Booth, Ph.D., partner at Atlas Venture. \"Atlas believes that LTI's GCase modulator platform holds great promise as a foundation for discovering therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, through exploring the implications of known relationships between lysosomal storage and neurodegenerative disorders.\" \"Our long-term mission is to develop targeted therapies for children and adults with neurodegenerative disorders that will be based on in-depth, mechanistic understanding of these disorders,\" added Krainc. With this financing, new board members will include Booth; Clay Thorp, general partner at Hatteras Venture Partners; Steve Hall, Ph.D., venture partner at Lilly Ventures; Bernard Davitian, vice president and managing director of Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures; and Carole Nuechterlein, head of Roche Venture Fund. CEO Been also serves as a member of the board of directors. Nessan Bermingham, Ph.D., venture partner at Atlas Venture, and Reza Halse, Ph.D., partner at Partners Innovation Fund, have been appointed as board observers. About the Implications of Lysosomal Storage Disorders on Neurodegenerative Diseases Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of approximately 60 known genetically-inherited diseases characterized by a deficiency of various vital enzymes. All LSDs consist of neurological components, but Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common LSD, occurring when the gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is mutated and unable to effectively break down its substrate, glucosylceramide. This results in a build-up of lipids in patients' cells, causing serious health issues. Recent genetic research suggests that GCase mutations may also cause a predisposition to Parkinson's disease (PD). The manifestation of the neurotoxic aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein, also known as Lewy bodies, is the hallmark symptom of PD. Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc.'s (LTI) initial research shows that restoring lysosomal function in human neurons of GD and PD patients may normalize the otherwise-elevated levels of alpha-synuclein. In addition to its work with GD and PD, LTI is investigating other lysosomal enzyme deficiencies and their respective genetic links to common neurodegenerative diseases. About Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc. Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc. (LTI) is dedicated to innovative small-molecule research and development in the field of neurodegeneration, yielding new treatment options for patients with severe neurological diseases. Our strategy leverages the clinically-validated link between lysosome-based genetic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases to establish a unique and effective molecular platform for novel drug discovery. LTI's lead program targets Gaucher-related neurodegeneration, Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. www.lysosomaltx.com Company Contact Media Contact Kees Been Kari Watson CEO MacDougall Biomedical Communications (617) 913-0166 (781) 235-3060 Kees.Been@LysosomalTx.com KWatson@MacBioCom.com # # # Upper Extremity Muscle Strength Preserved Over 48 Weeks in HIBM Patients on 6 Grams NOVATO, Calif., April 30, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced the presentation of detailed results from a 48-week Phase 2 clinical study of sialic acid extended-release (SA-ER, UX001) tablets in 47 patients with hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM; also known by its new name as GNE myopathy), a rare, progressive muscle-wasting disease. SA-ER is designed to replace the deficient sialic acid substrate in patients with HIBM. Topline results were previously reported in December 2013, and the following abstract was presented at the Emerging Sciences session of the 66th American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting in Philadelphia. Z. Argov, Y. Caraco, H. Lau, A. Pestronk, P. Shieh, J. Mayhew, J. Martinisi, E. Oral sialic acid extended release (SA-ER) stabilizes upper extremity muscle strength in human GNE myopathy: A Phase 2 study Patients in the study were initially randomized to receive placebo, 3 grams, or 6 grams of SA-ER per day. After 24 weeks, placebo patients crossed over to either 3 grams or 6 grams total daily dose, on a blinded basis, for an additional 24 weeks. The final analysis compared change at week 48 from baseline for the combined groups at 6 grams versus 3 grams of SA-ER. Assessments included pharmacokinetics, composites of upper extremity and lower extremity muscle strength as measured by dynamometry, other clinical endpoints, patient reported outcomes, and safety. At 24 weeks, assessments of upper extremity composite of muscle strength showed a statistically significant difference in the 6 gram group compared to placebo (+2.33 kg; 5.5% relative difference from baseline; p=0.040). At 48 weeks, a statistically significant difference between the combined 6 gram group and the combined 3 gram group was observed (+3.44 kg; 8.5% relative difference from baseline; p=0.0033). Patients with less advanced disease (able to walk more than 200 meters at baseline), a predefined subset that comprised approximately 70% of total enrollment, showed a more pronounced difference (+4.69 kg; 9.7% relative difference from baseline; p=0.00055). \"We are encouraged that the preservation of upper extremity muscle strength on 6 grams was sustained compared to a decline on placebo or 3 grams,\" said Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Ultragenyx. \"We plan to discuss the Phase 2 and higher dose results with the regulatory authorities to establish the next steps for the SA-ER program.\" The lower extremity composite showed a similar pattern of response but did not show a statistically significant difference between the dose groups. None of the groups showed a significant decline during the treatment period. Clinical endpoints related to walking, including the six-minute walk test (6MWT), did not reveal significant differences; there was no significant increase or decline. The GNE Myopathy Functional Activity Scale (GNEM-FAS), a novel specific patient-reported outcome measure developed to assess the clinical meaningfulness of changes in function, did not show differences at 24 weeks but at 48 weeks showed a positive trend in total (p=0.086), mobility (p=0.087), and upper extremity scores (p=0.096) in the combined 6 gram versus the combined 3 gram groups. An alternative post-hoc statistical analysis using a statistical model incorporating all of the repeated data recorded over time did show statistical significance in these GNEM-FAS outcomes. SA-ER appeared to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed to date in either dose group, and no dosedependent treatment-emergent adverse events were identified. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and most commonly gastrointestinal. The company continues to treat patients in an extension study evaluating an increased 12 gram daily dosage of sialic acid based on the dose dependence observed at weeks 24 and 48 of the Phase 2 study. Data from the increased dose is expected in late 2014. About Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is also known as GNE myopathy. HIBM is a rare, severe, progressive, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for sialic acid, with onset in the late teens or twenties. The body's failure to produce enough sialic acid causes muscles to slowly waste away and can lead to very severe disability, with patients typically becoming wheelchair bound and losing most major muscle function within ten to 20 years from onset. There are approximately 1,200 to 2,000 HIBM patients in the developed world, and there is currently no approved therapy.

(Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators to treat orphan diseases, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared its Investigational New Drug Application (IND) amendment to evaluate PROHEMA\u00ae in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The FDA's clearance of the IND amendment allows the Company to expand its clinical investigation of PROHEMA\u00ae, which to date has only been administered to adults, in pediatric patients as young as one year of age. The Company plans to initiate enrollment of the \"PROMPT\" (PROHEMA\u00ae for the treatment of hematologic Malignancies in PediaTric patients undergoing single umbilical cord blood transplantation) study, which is designed to enroll up to 18 patients, between the ages of 1 and 18, at three leading U.S. pediatric transplant centers in mid-2014. \"Each year, over 3,500 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with leukemia, many of whom may ultimately require HSC transplantation,\" commented Pratik Multani, M.D., M.S., Chief Medical Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \"Building upon our encouraging clinical experience with PROHEMA\u00ae in adult patients, we look forward to expanding our clinical program to pediatric patients with life-threatening forms of leukemia and other hematologic malignancies. Our goal is to deliver a pharmacologically-optimized HSC therapeutic that can support rapid and durable hematologic and immunologic reconstitution, and enable the curative potential of HSC transplantation in patients across a wide range of ages and a broad spectrum of lifethreatening malignant and rare genetic disorders.\" PROHEMA\u00ae (16, 16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, or dmPGE2, modulated cord blood), which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in adults, is the Company's lead pharmacologically-modulated HSC therapeutic. In 2010, the FDA granted PROHEMA\u00ae orphan designation for the enhancement of stem cell engraftment in patients undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation. The PROMPT study is an open-label Phase 1b clinical trial of PROHEMA\u00ae in pediatric patients undergoing single umbilical cord blood transplantation for the treatment of various hematologic malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML),following myeloablative conditioning. Consistent with the recently initiated Phase 2 clinical trial in adults, the manufacture of PROHEMA\u00ae in the PROMPT study will utilize the Company's nutrient-rich media formulation, which has been shown in in vivo preclinical studies to improve HSC viability as well as HSC engraftment by more than two-fold as compared to a standard cell processing media. The primary endpoint of the PROMPT study is safety as assessed by neutrophil engraftment. The study will also evaluate various parameters of efficacy including additional measures of neutrophil engraftment, platelet engraftment, rates of graft failure, acute graft versus host disease and serious infection, and disease-free and overall survival. About PROHEMA\u00ae PROHEMA\u00ae is a pharmacologically-modulated, cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapeutic. PROHEMA\u00ae is produced through a proprietary, two-hour, ex vivo cell modulation process that results in rapid activation of key biological pathways involved in homing, proliferation and survival of HSCs. In preclinical testing, PROHEMA\u00ae has demonstrated the potential to accelerate engraftment and to drive durable hematopoietic reconstitution, without the need for multi-week expansion protocols. In an initial Phase 1b clinical trial in adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplant (dUCBT), the median time to neutrophil recovery ( > 500 cells/L) with PROHEMA\u00ae was 17.5 days, which compares favorably to historical norms for patients undergoing dUCBT. In that trial, 100-day survival with PROHEMA\u00ae was 100%, and PROHEMA\u00ae provided the dominant source of hematopoiesis in 10 of 12 evaluable subjects, suggesting that treatment with PROHEMA\u00ae may accelerate engraftment and drive durable and preferential hematologic reconstitution. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Fate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of pharmacologic modulators of adult stem cells to treat orphan diseases. The Company utilizes established pharmacologic modalities, including small molecules and therapeutic proteins, and well-characterized biological mechanisms to enhance the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells. The Company has built two adult stem cell modulation platforms: a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) modulation platform, which seeks to optimize the therapeutic potential of HSCs for treating patients with hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders, and a muscle satellite stem cell modulation platform, which seeks to activate the regenerative capacity of muscle for treating patients with degenerative muscle disorders. The Company is presently advancing its lead product candidate, PROHEMA \u00ae, a pharmacologically-modulated HSC therapeutic, in Phase 2 clinical development for hematologic malignancies. Fate Therapeutics is also advancing its proprietary Wnt7a protein analogs in preclinical development for the treatment of muscular dystrophies. Fate Therapeutics is headquartered in San Diego, CA.

CONTACT: Paul Cox, Stern Investor Relations, Inc. 212.362.1200, paul@sternir.com SAN DIEGO, April 10, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators to treat orphan diseases, announced today that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has issued Patent No. 8,691,573 entitled \"Stem Cell Cultures.\" The newly issued patent claims a class of small molecule inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) that are crucial to the therapeutic application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Modulators belonging to the patented class have been shown to be necessary for the high-throughput derivation of transgene-free hiPSCs, and for the maintenance, survival and genomic stability of hiPSCs in culture. Fate Therapeutics holds an exclusive license from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) to the patent in all commercial fields. \"We believe the class of ROCK inhibitors covered by these issued claims is a key component to enable the clinical manufacture of hiPSCs for therapeutic applications,\" said Scott Wolchko, Chief Operating and Financial Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \"These newly issued claims complement the hiPSC-related cell compositions previously patented under our Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research intellectual property portfolio, which we believe are foundational to hiPSC generation. Our growing patent estate covering small molecule-enhanced reprogramming and pluripotency maintenance and expansion is a reflection of the breadth of our proprietary platform for developing iPSC-based regenerative therapeutics.\" Thiazovivin, one specific ROCK inhibitor covered within the patented class, was first discovered by Sheng Ding, Ph.D., a scientific founder of Fate Therapeutics. Under a research collaboration between TSRI and Fate Therapeutics, Dr. Ding and his team first demonstrated that Thiazovivin, in combination with other small molecules, increases the reprogramming efficiency of human fibroblasts into hiPSCs by 200-fold as compared to non-chemically enhanced methods of hiPSC generation (Lin, T., et al, Nature Methods 6, 805 - 808 (2009)). Additional work by both Dr. Ding and Fate Therapeutics further differentiated the ability of Thiazovivin and its related class of molecules, as compared to other ROCK inhibitors, to significantly enhance hiPSC survival and homogeneity. Thiazovivin, as well as compositions and cell culture media comprising Thiazovivin, are patented under U.S. Patent No. 8,044,201 entitled \"Stem Cell Cultures,\" to which Fate Therapeutics holds an exclusive license from TSRI in all commercial fields. Last month, Fate scientists published an article in the journal Stem Cell Reports describing its proprietary stem cell modulation platform for developing hiPSC-based regenerative therapeutics. The Company's therapeutic platform consists of stage-specific cell culture systems containing combinations of small molecule modulators including ROCK inhibitors, and enables the rapid, parallel derivation of hiPSC clones and their subsequent expansion and survival as transgene-free, single cells in culture. Fate Therapeutics is currently researching therapeutic applications of hiPSC-derived myogenic progenitor cells and hematopoietic cells. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc.

(Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced the presentation of preliminary data from the Phase 1/2 study of recombinant human beta-glucuronidase (rhGUS, UX003), an investigational therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome). The following abstract is being presented at the ACMG Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting in Nashville, Tennessee. S. Jones, C. Breen, A. Skrinar, W. Sly, E. Kakkis. Phase 1/2 Open-Label Study to Assess Safety, Efficacy, and Dose of Recombinant Human Beta-Glucuronidase (rhGUS) in Subjects with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII. The Phase 1/2 open-label clinical study is assessing the safety, efficacy, and dose of rhGUS administered every other week via intravenous infusion in a 12-week primary analysis phase, which will be followed by dose-exploration and long-term extension. Preliminary results from three patients who have been administered 2 mg/kg of rhGUS every other week for two, six, and 12 weeks show evidence of clearance of lysosomal storage as indicated by the decline in urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion beginning at two weeks of treatment of approximately 30-50%. At the 12 week assessment of the first patient, absolute liver size was reduced by approximately 11%. This represents a 46% decrease in the excess liver size above normal for age and gender. The remaining patients have not yet reached the 12 week time point for liver size assessment. No serious adverse events were observed during up to 12 weeks of treatment, and no infusion-associated reactions were observed after a total of 13 infusions to date in these three subjects. The study will continue and additional 12-week interim data are expected in 2014. If the efficacy and safety results for all treated subjects are supportive and the dose confirmed, the company intends to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 study enrolling at least 12 patients in 2014. About MPS 7 Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome), originally described in 1973 by William Sly, M.D., is a rare genetic, metabolic disorder and is one of 11 different MPS disorders. MPS 7 is caused by the deficiency of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme required for the breakdown of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. These complex GAG carbohydrates are a critical component of many tissues. The inability to properly break down GAGs leads to a progressive accumulation in many tissues and results in a multi-system disease. While its clinical manifestations are similar to MPS 1 and MPS 2, MPS 7 is one of the rarest among the MPS disorders. MPS 7 has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and can present as early as at birth. There are no approved therapies for MPS 7 today. The use of enzyme replacement therapy as a potential treatment is based on 20 years of research work in murine models of the disease. Enzyme replacement as a strategy is well established in the MPS field as there are currently four approved enzyme replacement therapies for other MPS disorders: MPS 1 MPS 2 (Elaprase\u00ae, MPS 6 (Naglazym\u00aee, galsulfase). Ultragenyx initiated a Phase 1/2 study in the UK to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and dose of intravenous administration of rhGUS in December 2013.

CONTACT: Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. 844-758-7273 For Media, Bee Nguyen For Investors, Robert Anstey NOVATO, CA - March 24, 2014 - Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultrarare diseases, today reported its financial results and business highlights for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2013. \"Ultragenyx completed a landmark year in 2013, during which we achieved multiple milestones in our vision to build a next generation rare disease company,\" said Emil D. Kakkis, Ph.D., M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. \"We have expanded our pipeline to five clinical programs in Phase 1/2 or Phase 2 studies, and with the completion of our initial public offering in early 2014, we believe we are wellpositioned to advance multiple programs in parallel to address the significant unmet medical needs of these patients.\" Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Financial Results For the fourth quarter of 2013, Ultragenyx reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $18.7 million, or $4.98 per share, basic and diluted, compared with a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2012 of $6.8 million, or $2.83 per share, basic and diluted. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Ultragenyx reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $50.3 million, or $14.87 per share, basic and diluted, compared with a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2012 of $19.6 million, or $14.20 per share, basic and diluted. Total operating expenses for 2013 were $32.3 million compared with $16.0 million for 2012. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $9.5 million compared with $4.7 million for the same period in 2012. The increase in total operating expenses is due to the addition of triheptanoin and KRN23 to Ultragenyx's clinical development pipeline, advancements in the development of sialic acid extended release (SAER) and recombinant human betaglucuronidase (rhGUS), and increased headcount to support the company's growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and shortterm investments were $53.4 million as of December 31, 2013. Based on current operating levels, the company expects that existing cash, cash equivalents and shortterm investments, including approximately $121.7 million in net proceeds received from the initial public offering in February 2014, will be sufficient to fund operations into 2016. Recent Highlights KRN23 antiFGF23 Monoclonal Antibody in Xlinked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) - Results from the Phase 1 single dose study in 38 adult XLH patients were presented at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research Annual Meeting in October 2013 and published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in February 20141. The data demonstrated that KRN23 was well tolerated and increased serum phosphate and vitamin D levels compared to placebo at higher doses. rhGUS in Mucopolysaccharidosis 7 (MPS 7) - In December 2013, we initiated a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and dose of rhGUS in up to five MPS 7 patients between five and 30 years of age. - In February 2014, results from the treatment of a single patient under an emergency investigational new drug (eIND) application were presented at the Lysosomal Disease Network's 10th Annual World Symposium. The preliminary data showed a reduction in lysosomal storage based on reduced excretion of urinary glycosaminoglycans and a reduction in the size of the enlarged liver and spleen. The patient showed an improvement of pulmonary function and no infusionassociated reactions during the first 14 weeks of treatment. Triheptanoin in LongChain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders (LCFAOD) - In February 2014, we initiated a Phase 2 study in approximately 30 severely affected LCFAOD patients. A principal goal of the study is to determine the appropriate clinical endpoints and patient population for testing in potential laterstage pivotal studies. - Multiple investigatorsponsored and compassionate use trials testing triheptanoin in LCFAOD patients are also ongoing. Triheptanoin in Glucose Transporter Type1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS) - In March 2014, we initiated a randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled, parallelgroup Phase 2 study in up to 50 Glut1 DS patients between three and 17 years of age inclusive who are currently not fully compliant with ketogenic diet and continue to have seizures. The primary efficacy objective is the reduction in frequency of seizures compared to placebo. - Multiple investigatorsponsored and compassionate use trials in Glut1 DS as well as in other indications are also ongoing. SAER in Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM) - In December 2013, we released topline results after 48 weeks of treatment from the Phase 2 randomized study of SAER in 47 HIBM patients. The data showed that a modest increase in upper extremity muscle strength composite at the higher dose compared to a decline in the lower dose group was statistically significant. A positive trend was seen in a patientreported outcome of functional activity. The results were consistent with the 24week analysis. SAER appeared to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed to date in either dose group. - We continue to treat patients in an extension study evaluating an increased daily dosage of sialic acid based on the dose dependence observed at weeks 24 and 48 of the Phase 2 study. Corporate Highlights - In February 2014, we closed our initial public offering of 6,624,423 shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of $21.00 per share, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to an additional 864,054 additional shares of common stock. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $121.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, estimated offering expenses, and a dividend paid to preferred stockholders. - In January 2014, concurrent with the pricing of our initial public offering, we appointed Clay B. Siegall, Ph.D. and Matthew K. Fust to our board of directors. Dr. Siegall is President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Seattle Genetics, Inc. Mr. Fust is former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Anticipated 2014 Program Milestones KRN23 in XLH - Release data from the Phase 1/2 adult repeatdose studies completed by our collaborative partner Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK). - Initiate a Phase 2 study in pediatric XLH patients following discussions with multiple regulatory agencies on our pediatric study design. rhGUS in MPS 7 - Release early urinary glycosaminoglycans data on the first three MPS 7 patients dosed with rhGUS in our Phase 1/2 study in March 2014 at the Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting (ACMG). - Release interim 12week data from our Phase 1/2 study of rhGUS in patients with MPS 7 in the second half of 2014. - Initiate a pivotal Phase 3 study of at least 12 patients in the second half of 2014 if the 12 week Phase 1/2 data are positive. Triheptanoin in LCFAOD - Continue to enroll and treat patients in the ongoing Phase 2 study of triheptanoin in approximately 30 severely affected LCFAOD patients. We expect that data from this study should be available in 2015. Triheptanoin in Glut1 DS - Continue to enroll and treat patients in the ongoing Phase 2 study of triheptanoin in up to 50 Glut1 DS patients. We expect to release data from this trial in 2015. SAER in HIBM - Present detailed data from the 48week randomized, controlled Phase 2 study of SAER in 47 HIBM patients at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting in April. The abstract was one of ten chosen for presentation in a latebreaking news session called the Emerging Sciences session. A brief topline presentation of the results will take place on April 30, 2014 at approximately 6:30pm ET and will be followed by a poster session. - Release data from the ongoing extension study of SAER at a higher daily dosage in late 2014.

(Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators to treat orphan diseases, announced today the enrollment of the first patient in its \"PUMA\" (PROHEMA\u00ae in UMbilical cord blood transplant in Adults) study, a Phase 2 clinical trial of PROHEMA\u00ae (16, 16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, or dmPGE2, modulated cord blood) using the Company's nutrient-rich media formulation. The PUMA study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of PROHEMA\u00ae in a randomized, controlled setting in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The trial has been approved for conduct at ten major HSC transplant centers in the United States. Safety reviews are planned after six and 12 subjects, respectively, have been treated with PROHEMA\u00ae in the PUMA study, and the Company intends to provide a clinical update following the completion of these reviews. Full data on the primary efficacy endpoint are expected in mid-2015. \"Despite important advancements in the pharmacotherapy of blood cancers, many patients with leukemia or lymphoma advance to a stage where hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents the only curative therapeutic option,\" commented Christian Weyer, M.D., M.A.S., President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \"PROHEMA\u00ae is representative of Fate's commitment to developing stem cell therapeutics to address significant unmet medical needs and offer life-saving therapeutic solutions to patients with hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders. We have worked diligently to optimize the clinical potency and efficacy profile of PROHEMA\u00ae, and we are excited to pursue clinical development of PROHEMA\u00ae in both malignant and non-malignant disorders.\" During 2013, scientists at Fate Therapeutics demonstrated that the therapeutic profile of PROHEMA\u00ae may be further enhanced, as compared to its previous clinical use, by incorporating the Company's nutrient-rich media (NRM) formulation into the manufacture of PROHEMA\u00ae. In in vivo preclinical studies, PROHEMA\u00ae manufactured using its NRM formulation exhibited improved HSC viability and a more than two-fold improvement in HSC engraftment as compared to a standard cell processing media used previously in the clinical development of PROHEMA\u00ae. The Company has worked closely with the FDA over the past nine months to enable the clinical manufacture of PROHEMA\u00ae using its NRM formulation for the PUMA study. \"While allogeneic HSC transplantation is a proven therapeutic intervention with curative potential for patients with hematologic malignancies and over 50 rare genetic disorders, it is associated with significant treatment-related limitations and 100-day mortality rates between 20% to 30%,\" said Corey Cutler M.D., M.P.H., F.R.C.P.C., Associate Professor of Medicine at the Dana- Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School and principal investigator in the PUMA trial and the Company's prior clinical trials of PROHEMA\u00ae. \"Engraftment, particularly as measured by time to the engraftment of neutrophils, is correlated with key clinical outcomes of HSC transplantation including the length of hospital stays, rates of serious infections and overall treatment-related morbidity and mortality. I applaud Fate Therapeutics for its dedication and effort in bringing the most optimal product candidate to patients.\" The PUMA study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial designed to enroll 60 subjects, age 15 to 65 years, and will use the Company's NRM formulation in the manufacture of PROHEMA\u00ae. Patients will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1, with approximately 40 patients receiving PROHEMA\u00ae plus an unmanipulated cord blood unit and approximately 20 patients receiving two unmanipulated cord blood units. At the discretion of the treating physician, patients will be conditioned using an intensive myeloablative or a reduced intensity regimen. The primary endpoint of the PUMA study is the cumulative incidence of time to neutrophil engraftment as compared to a pre-specified control median, which will be adjusted based upon the median time to neutrophil engraftment calculated for the patients enrolled in the control arm. Secondary endpoints include additional measures of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, rates of graft failure, acute graft versus host disease and serious infection, and disease-free and overall survival. About PROHEMA\u00ae PROHEMA\u00ae is a pharmacologically-modulated, cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapeutic. PROHEMA\u00ae is produced through a proprietary, two-hour, ex vivo cell modulation process that results in rapid activation of key biological pathways involved in homing, proliferation and survival of HSCs. In preclinical testing, PROHEMA\u00ae has demonstrated the potential to accelerate engraftment and to drive durable hematopoietic reconstitution, without the need for multi-week expansion protocols. In an initial Phase 1b clinical trial in adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplant (dUCBT), the median time to neutrophil recovery ( > 500 cells/L) with PROHEMA\u00ae was 17.5 days, which compares favorably to historical norms for patients undergoing dUCBT. In that trial, 100-day survival with PROHEMA\u00ae was 100%, and PROHEMA\u00ae provided the dominant source of hematopoiesis in 10 of 12 evaluable subjects, suggesting that treatment with PROHEMA\u00ae may accelerate engraftment and drive durable and preferential hematologic reconstitution. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Fate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of pharmacologic modulators of adult stem cells to treat orphan diseases, including certain hematologic malignancies, lysosomal storage disorders and muscular dystrophies. The Company utilizes established pharmacologic modalities, including small molecules and therapeutic proteins, and well-characterized biological mechanisms to enhance the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells. The Company has built two adult stem cell modulation platforms: a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) modulation platform, which seeks to optimize the therapeutic potential of HSCs for treating patients with hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders that are undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and a muscle satellite stem cell modulation platform, which seeks to activate the regenerative capacity of muscle for treating patients with degenerative muscle disorders. The Company is presently advancing its lead product candidate, PROHEMA\u00ae, a pharmacologically-modulated HSC therapeutic derived from umbilical cord blood, in Phase 2 clinical development for hematologic malignancies. Fate Therapeutics is also advancing its proprietary Wnt7a protein analogs in preclinical development for the treatment of muscular dystrophies. Fate Therapeutics is headquartered in San Diego, CA.

CONTACT: Paul Cox, Stern Investor Relations, Inc. 212.362.1200, paul@sternir.com Novato, CA, March 11, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, announced the first patient enrolled in the Phase 2 study of triheptanoin (UX007) for the treatment of glucose transporter type-1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS), at Columbia University. Glut1 DS, also known as De Vivo disease, is a rare, severely debilitating disease characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorder. \"Glut1 deficiency was first described by us at the Columbia University Medical Center in 1991, so we are pleased to have the opportunity to enroll the first patient in the triheptanoin clinical trial sponsored by Ultragenyx. It is clear that more effective symptomatic and disease-modifying treatments are needed for this rare disease, and we hope this trial is the next step towards that ultimate goal,\" said Dr. Darryl De Vivo, the Sidney Carter Professor of Neurology and Professor of Pediatrics at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. The global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate safety and efficacy in up to 50 Glut1 DS patients between 3 and 17 years of age inclusive, who are currently not on or not fully compliant with ketogenic diet and continue to have seizures. The primary efficacy objective is the reduction in frequency of seizures compared to placebo following a 6-week baseline period and subsequent 8-week placebo-controlled treatment period. The blinded treatment period will be followed by an open-label extension period in which all patients will be treated with triheptanoin through week 52. Targeted enrollment may be modified based on an interim analysis. We anticipate that data from this trial will be available in 2015. \"We are advancing triheptanoin for Glut1 DS based on its anticipated ability to provide an alternative source of energy to the brain that could result in seizure control and improvement in other aspects of the disease,\" commented Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Ultragenyx's Chief Executive Officer. \"The placebo-controlled Phase 2 study is a significant step in the evaluation of triheptanoin for this rare and devastating disease.\" About Glut1 DS and Triheptanoin Glut1 DS is a severely debilitating disease characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorder. Glut1 DS is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the Glut1 protein, which is responsible for transporting glucose across the bloodbrain barrier. Because glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain, this disorder results in a chronic state of energy deficiency in the brain. Glut1 DS is a rare disease. Studies suggest a range of 3,000 to 7,000 Glut1 DS patients in the United States. There are currently no approved treatments specific to Glut1 DS. Triheptanoin is a specially designed synthetic triglyceride compound intended to provide patients with the medium-length, oddchain fatty acid, heptanoate. Heptanoate can circulate and also be further metabolized to four- and five-carbon ketone bodies in the liver. All of these metabolites are able to cross the blood-brain barrier without using the deficient Glut1 transporter, and can provide an alternative energy source for the brain when glucose is limited. Heptanoate also crosses the blood-brain barrier and can be converted to glucose.

(Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators to treat orphan diseases, announced today the publication of an article in the journal Stem Cell Reports by Fate scientists demonstrating high-throughput derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that exhibit characteristics necessary for therapeutic application. The publication describes the use of the Company's hiPSC platform, consisting of stage-specific cell culture systems, to enable rapid, parallel derivation of hiPSC clones and their subsequent expansion as transgene-free, single cells in culture. The Company's proprietary combinations of small molecule modulators, which include ROCK, GSK3 and MEK pathway inhibitors, used in the culture systems were found to be critical in promoting characteristics of the ground state of pluripotency including pluripotent culture stability, homogeneity and survival. \"This publication further highlights the scientific and technological progress we have made in defining the most stable and efficient platform for hiPSC-based cell therapy applications,\" commented Peter Flynn Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Early Program Development at Fate Therapeutics. \"While there are multiple approaches to cellular reprogramming, we are dedicated to deriving hiPSCs with pluripotent qualities necessary for robust, reproducible hiPSC generation and expansion. We believe that the use of our proprietary small molecule inhibitors is critical for enabling the development of potentially transformative, hiPSC-based regenerative therapeutics.\" In January of this year, Fate scientists published a separate article in Stem Cells Translation Medicine reporting the efficient differentiation of hiPSCs to a homogeneous population of skeletal muscle cells using the Company's proprietary hiPSC platform. In support of the Company's muscle regeneration therapeutic program, Fate scientists sourced fibroblasts from healthy volunteers as well as from patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, reprogrammed the fibroblasts to hiPSCs, and then differentiated the hiPSCs to muscle myoblasts with extremely high efficiency. The hiPSC-derived skeletal muscle cells closely resembled primary muscle cells, and were functionally responsive to treatment with the hypertrophic proteins insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and Wnt7a. Fate Therapeutics is currently developing proprietary Wnt7a protein analogs for the treatment of muscle-related diseases and disorders. In addition, the Company is currently researching therapeutic applications of hiPSC-derived myogenic progenitor cells and hematopoietic cells. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc.

(Nasdaq:FATE), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators to treat orphan diseases, announced today the release of new data on the observed effects of ex vivo pharmacologic modulation on CD8+ T cells and immune reconstitution from its previously-completed Phase 1b clinical trial of PROHEMA\u00ae (16, 16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, or dmPGE2, modulated cord blood) in adult patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation for hematologic malignancy (the ProHema-01 trial). Researchers affiliated with Harvard Medical School performed an analysis of the CD8+ T cell compartment using patient samples from the ProHema-01 trial. At Day 100, subjects who received PROHEMA\u00ae and an unmanipulated cord blood unit (n=12) showed a two-fold increase in the percentage of na\u00efve and early memory T cell fraction within the CD8+ T cell compartment as compared to subjects who received two unmanipulated cord blood units (n=9). These na\u00efve and early memory CD8+ T cell populations are believed to play a key role in promoting immune reconstitution and viral immunity following cord blood transplantation. These findings were recently published in Blood Cancer Journal (Li, L. et. al. Blood Cancer Journal 2014). \"In addition to the well-established effect of dmPGE2 on enhancing the engraftment properties of hematopoietic stem cells, our molecular characterization and immunological assessments provide new evidence that dmPGE2 can also significantly improve the functional properties of T cells contained within human umbilical cord blood,\" stated Dr. Vicki Boussiotis, M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and senior author on the Blood Cancer Journal publication. \"Enhancing the survival and immunological properties of T cells, and in particular those of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells, may have significant therapeutic implications for harnessing immune memory in the context of both pathogen- and tumor-specific immunity.\" Consistent with these reported immunomodulatory effects, low rates of viral reactivation were observed in the ProHema-01 trial. Specifically, cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in only two of 12 PROHEMA\u00ae subjects (17%), with no cases of CMV disease. In addition, no cases of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) were observed. These observations compare favorably to rates of CMV reactivation and EBV-associated PTLD reported in the literature of 36-56% and up to 16%, respectively. \"The functional properties of both hematopoietic stem cells and T cells are critical determinants of patient outcomes following allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation,\" commented Pratik Multani, M.D., M.S., Chief Medical Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \"These novel scientific and clinical observations raise the possibility that T cell-related mechanisms may also be enhanced using ex vivo pharmacologic modulation strategies. We look forward to evaluating patient outcomes related to dmPGE2-mediated immunomodulatory effects in our planned Phase 2 clinical trial of PROHEMA\u00ae.\" PROHEMA\u00ae is currently in clinical development for use in adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplantation.Following an optimization of the PROHEMA\u00ae manufacturing process, the Company expects to resume enrollment of its Phase 2 clinical trial (the ProHema-03 Trial) in the first half of 2014, with the goal of generating full data on the primary and major secondary endpoints related to engraftment in mid-2015. About PROHEMA\u00ae hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapeutic. PROHEMA\u00ae is produced through a proprietary, two-hour, ex vivo cell modulation process that results in rapid activation of key biological pathways involved in homing, proliferation and survival of HSCs. In preclinical testing, PROHEMA\u00ae has demonstrated the potential to accelerate engraftment and to drive durable hematopoietic reconstitution, without the need for multi-week expansion protocols. In an initial Phase 1b study in adult patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplant (dUCBT), the median time to neutrophil recovery ( > 500 cells/L) with PROHEMA\u00ae was 17.5 days, which compares favorably to historical norms for patients undergoing dUCBT. In that study, 100-day survival with PROHEMA\u00ae was 100%, and PROHEMA\u00ae provided the dominant source of hematopoiesis in 10 of 12 evaluable subjects, suggesting that treatment with PROHEMA\u00ae may accelerate engraftment and drive durable and preferential reconstitution.

CONTACT: Paul Cox, Stern Investor Relations, Inc. 212.362.1200, paul@sternir.com Open-Label Study to Assess Safety and Clinical Effects of Triheptanoin NOVATO, Calif., Feb. 11, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced that the first patient has been enrolled in an open-label Phase 2 study to assess safety and clinical effects of triheptanoin, also known as UX007, in patients severely affected by long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD). LC-FAOD are a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders characterized by metabolic deficiencies in which the body is unable to break down and convert long chain fatty acids into energy. \"We look forward to studying triheptanoin in this prospective clinical study and taking another step towards determining the potential role for triheptanoin in helping patients with LC-FAOD to better manage their debilitating disease,\" said Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. \"The goal for this study is to determine the optimal patient population and endpoints for evaluation in a potential future Phase 3 clinical trial.\" The prospective, interventional, open-label Phase 2 study will evaluate triheptanoin treatment in approximately 30 severely affected LC-FAOD patients, ages 6 months to 35 years, exhibiting significant clinical manifestations of LC-FAOD despite current therapy. Prior to initiating treatment with triheptanoin, subjects will continue their current therapy for four weeks to establish their baseline condition. Triheptanoin will then be titrated to an expected target dose of 25-35% of total daily caloric intake via oral administration, while ensuring tolerability. The patients will be followed to evaluate the effects of triheptanoin treatment over 24 weeks, then may continue treatment for an additional 54 weeks. The study will assess the impact of triheptanoin on several endpoints, including cycle ergometer performance, 12-minute walk test, muscle strength, creatine kinase levels, hypoglycemia, liver size, and cardiac disease. The study will be conducted at approximately eight clinical sites in the United States and Europe. During the treatment period, the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of triheptanoin on acute clinical pathophysiology associated with LC-FAOD, while the secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of triheptanoin treatment and its effects on energy metabolism in LC-FAOD patients. The objective of the extension period of the study is to evaluate the impact of triheptanoin on major clinical events, including hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and emergency interventions associated with LC-FAOD. About LC-FAOD and Triheptanoin LC-FAOD are a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders characterized by metabolic deficiencies in which the body is unable to convert long-chain fatty acids into energy. It is estimated that 2,000 to 3,500 patients are afflicted with LC-FAOD in the US, where fatty acid oxidation disorders are now detected by newborn screening. There are six main genetic diseases that cause LC-FAOD, and the main clinical program is focused on the most common four forms: carnitine dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. LC-FAOD patients are currently treated the avoidance of fasting, low-fat/high carbohydrate diets, carnitine supplementation and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil. Despite current therapy, many patients still have significant metabolic events including hospitalizations and significantly increased mortality due to LC-FAOD; a mortality rate of more than 50% has been observed in spite of treatment with current therapy. Triheptanoin, also known as UX007, is a purified form of a specially designed synthetic triglyceride compound. Triheptanoin is intended to provide patients with medium-length, odd-chain fatty acids that are metabolized to replace intermediate substrates in fatty acid oxidation downstream of their genetic block in fatty acid metabolism. Triheptanoin is also metabolized to a substrate that replaces deficient intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA cycle), a key energy-generating process. Triheptanoin can also support production of glucose and glycogen (gluconeogenesis). Together, the substrates produced by triheptanoin during metabolism are intended to improve energy production in FAOD patients.

SA-ER is designed to replace the deficient sialic acid substrate in patients with HIBM. Patients were initially randomized to either receive placebo, 3 grams or 6 grams of SA-ER per day. After 24 weeks, placebo patients crossed over to either 3 grams or 6 grams total daily dose, on a blinded basis, for an additional 24 weeks. The final analysis compared change at week 48 from baseline for the combined groups at 6 grams versus 3 grams of SA-ER. Similar to the results observed at the 24-week interim analysis, at 48 weeks the comparison of the upper extremity composite of muscle strength for the combined group of patients on 6 grams showed a modest increase and a statistically significant difference relative to the decline in strength observed in the combined groups on 3 grams. In the 6-gram cohort treated for 48 weeks, the modest increase in upper extremity strength observed at 24 weeks was sustained relative to a further decline in the comparable 3-gram group. These changes were more pronounced in those patients that have less advanced disease as assessed by a greater walking ability at baseline, a predefined subset. The lower extremity composite did not show a statistically significant difference between the dose groups, but neither group showed a significant decline during the treatment period. The upper extremity and lower extremity composites are predefined endpoints that aggregate change in muscle strength across multiple individually measured muscle groups. The GNE Myopathy Functional Activity Scale, a patient-reported outcome measure developed to assess the clinical meaningfulness of changes in function, showed a trend toward a positive effect in the combined 6-gram group as compared to the combined 3-gram group. The sit-to-stand test also showed a trend toward a positive effect. Other clinical endpoints related to walking, including the 6 minute walk test did not reveal significant changes in function, upward or downward. SA-ER appeared to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed to date in either dose group. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and most commonly gastrointestinal. \"These 48 week data suggest that 6 grams per day of SA-ER is mitigating the normally expected decline in upper extremity muscle strength,\" said Emil Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Ultragenyx. \"The maintenance of this effect from the 24-week data is encouraging. Given the difference between the dose groups and good safety profile, we plan to test an even higher dose of sialic acid in these patients who have no other approved treatment options.\" The data from the 48-week analysis are expected to be presented in full at a scientific conference in 2014. All 46 patients from the original study have elected to continue into the extension study. The company plans to treat patients with an increased dosage of sialic acid based on the dose-dependence observed at week 48. The first patient has already been treated with a higher dose of sialic acid, and data from the increased dose is expected in late 2014. About Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is also known as GNE myopathy. HIBM is a severe, progressive, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for sialic acid, with onset in the late teens or twenties. The body's failure to produce enough sialic acid causes muscles to slowly waste away and can lead to very severe disability, with patients typically becoming wheelchair bound within ten to 20 years from onset. There are approximately 1,200 to 2,000 HIBM patients in the developed world, and there is currently no approved therapy.

Contact Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. 415-483-8800 For Media, Bee Nguyen For Investors, Robert Anstey NOVATO, CA - December 4, 2013 - Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc., a biotechnology company, today announced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1/2 study of recombinant human beta-glucuronidase (rhGUS, UX003) for MPS 7, in Manchester, UK. MPS 7 is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase that results in a severe multi-system disease. William Sly, MD, Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Biochemistry at Saint Louis University commented, \"Patients, families, and researchers have been waiting many years for this advancement in the treatment of MPS 7. The initiation of clinical testing of rhGUS is the culmination of decades of work.\" The Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial will assess the safety and efficacy of rhGUS in a 12-week primary analysis phase, followed by dose-exploration and long-term extension. Five patients between 5 and 30 years of age inclusive will be enrolled and administered rhGUS every other week via intravenous infusion. Interim data from the Phase 1/2 study is expected in 2014. \"MPS 7 is a devastating condition that has been neglected by the drug development community despite 20 years of extensive nonclinical research led by Dr. Sly and his colleagues,\" said Emil D. Kakkis, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Ultragenyx. \"The initiation of this Phase 1/2 study is an important milestone for Ultragenyx and for patients with MPS 7.\" About MPS 7 Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS 7), originally described in 1973 by William Sly, MD, is a rare genetic, metabolic disorder and is one of 11 different MPS disorders. MPS 7 is caused by the deficiency of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme required for the breakdown of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. These complex GAG carbohydrates are a critical component of many tissues. The inability to properly break down GAGs leads to a progressive accumulation in many tissues and results in a multi-system disease. While its clinical manifestations are similar to MPS 1 and MPS 2, MPS 7 is one of the rarest among the MPS disorders. MPS 7 has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and can present as early as at birth. There are no approved therapies for MPS 7 today. The use of enzyme replacement therapy as a potential treatment is based on 20 years of research work in murine models of the disease. Enzyme replacement as a strategy is well established in the MPS field as there are currently three approved enzyme replacement therapies for other MPS disorders: MPS 1 (Aldurazyme\u00ae, laronidase), MPS 2 6 Ultragenyx Ultragenyx is a privately held, development-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing to market novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases, with an initial focus on serious, debilitating metabolic genetic diseases.

In these presentations we reported corrector activity for our compounds in human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells, both as stand- alone therapies, and in combination with existing clinical- stage corrector candidates.\" The Company's first poster and oral presentation, titled \"Robust Correction of DF508 Using Small Molecule Proteostasis Regulators Alone and in Combination with Clinical-Stage Correctors,\" were presented by Markus Haeberlein, MSc, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Research at Proteostasis Therapeutics. The Company has identified multiple novel CFTR corrector series from internal compound library screens using Multiplex Gene Expression with sentinels to pathways within the PN, and a subsequent screen for functional activity in a cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cell line. Identified correctors were found to have robust functional activity in DF508/DF508 hBE cells comparable to CFTR correctors currently in clinical development. Importantly, the maximal activity of those clinical-stage CFTR correctors was more than doubled when combined with the Company's correctors, providing a strong foundation for the ongoing development of the program's CFTR corrector candidates, and the potential for combination therapies. The Company's second poster, entitled \"Correcting the DF508 Defective Folding and Trafficking Mutant of CFTR Using Small Molecule Regulators of the Proteostasis Network,\" was presented by Lawrence Drew, Senior Research Associate at Proteostasis Therapeutics. The data details the Company's broader PN-based approach of identifying small-molecule CFTR correctors, and highlights the enhanced functional activity shown by the Company's correctors in DF508 cellular models and patient-derived hBE cells Compound induced modulation of PN pathways correlates with functional correction, supporting the role of PN modulation in rescuing the folding/trafficking of this disease-causing protein, and demonstrating proof of concept for the utilization of the PN in treating CF. About Proteostasis Therapeutics Proteostasis Therapeutics is disease-modifying therapeutics for diseases. The Company's lead programs in cystic fibrosis and protein aggregation diseases such as Parkinson's disease modulate protein chaperone and proteasomal degradation pathways within the cell. These pathways are part of the cellular 'quality control' machinery, called the protein homeostasis network or Proteostasis Network (PN) that regulates protein folding, trafficking, and clearance. By enhancing the function and capacity of the PN, the Company's product candidates correct for imbalances in the PN resulting from the cumulative effects of disease, genetic mutations, environmental factors, and aging.

Due to increasing global migration, the number of sickle cell carriers in European countries is increasing steadily. It is a chronic condition causing substantial illness and death. The main clinical feature of sickle cell disease is periodic painful vaso-occlusive crisis episodes, known as VOC or pain crises, which result in clinical complications, interruptions in patients' lives, and cumulative irreversible damage that impacts the morbidity and mortality of patients. Treatment for VOC today consists primarily of supportive therapy, in the form of hydration and pain control, typically requiring extended hospitalization. GMI-1070 is intended to treat VOC by inhibiting the cell activation and enhanced cell adhesion that causes the ischemia and pain. GlycoMimetics selected VOC of sickle cell disease as the first potential indication for GMI-1070.

Dan dan@purecommunicationsinc.com CHICAGO, April 23, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanofi vaccines division of SNY), and KaloBios Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: KBIO) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to Sanofi Pasteur for the investigation of KB001A, an antibody fragment, intended for protection against bacterial pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) in mechanically-ventilated patients. The Fast Track Drug Development Program of the FDA is designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of new drugs and vaccines that are intended to treat or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The joint announcement was made on this second day of the BIO International Convention, the 20th annual meeting of the world's largest biotechnology organization. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130423/610748-a ) (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130423/610748-b ) Most serious Pa infections occur in hospitalized and critically or chronically ill patients--primarily affecting the respiratory system in susceptible individuals--and are a serious clinical problem due to the bacteria's resistance to antibiotics. Sanofi Pasteur, which is responsible for the clinical development under the terms of the agreement with KaloBios, is currently conducting a phase I trial of the monoclonal antibody in the United States and has started the planning of a phase IIb study. \"Sanofi Pasteur is currently targeting the antibody for use in primary prevention of Pa-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients in hospitals and we are also interested in providing prevention of relapses and improvement of treatment outcomes in patients with an ongoing Pa infection,\" according to Michel DeWilde, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Research and Development. \"Additional indications may be considered later in the lifecycle of the product.\" Under the terms of the current agreement, Sanofi Pasteur has worldwide rights to KaloBios' KB001A technology for all disease indications related to Pa infections, except cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, the rights in which were retained by KaloBios, and Sanofi Pasteur has the option to obtain at a later date. \"Hospital-based pneumonias, especially those associated with mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU, are a life-threatening complication that can significantly increase mortality and morbidity as well as add tens of thousands of dollars to the cost of a hospital stay,\" said David Pritchard, President and CEO, KaloBios. \"KB001's novel mechanism of action against Pa may provide a unique means of fighting these infections, which are often resistant to antibiotic therapies. The FDA fast-track designation recognizes that this novel biologic could address an important unmet medical need.\" About KB001A KB001A, a Humaneered antibody fragment, is designed to fight Peudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) by blocking a virulence mechanism (the Type Three Secretion System or TTSS) on the bacterium's external surface that enables Pa to evade human immune defenses by killing white blood cells and epithelial cells, and triggering tissue- damaging inflammation. By blocking Pa's killing mechanism, KB001A is intended to reduce the damage done to the lungs by Pa and potentially enable the patient's own immune system to effectively fight and clear the bacteria from sites of infection. KB001A avoids known mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and does not contribute to broad-spectrum resistance, making it optimal for use as a single agent or in synergy with antibiotics in the preventive or therapeutic setting. KB001, a precursor, has completed two clinical studies in mechanically ventilated patients colonized with Pa and in chronically Pa infected patients with cystic fibrosis. KaloBios is currently conducting a 180-patient phase 2 study in cystic fibrosis in the United States with KB001A. About KaloBios KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a portfolio of patient-targeted, first-in-class monoclonal antibodies to treat serious medical conditions with a primary clinical focus on respiratory diseases and cancer.

SOURCE Sanofi Pasteur News Provided by Acquire Media San Diego, CA - Fate Therapeutics, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of adult stem cell modulators, announced today the presentation of preclinical data from its WNT7a protein analog program for the treatment of muscular dystrophy at the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) 2013 Scientific Conference, April 21-24, in Washington DC. The presentations describe the engineering of pharmaceutically optimized WNT7a protein analogs, as well as their mechanism of action and efficacy profile in preclinical pharmacology studies. \"The data presented today provide strong preclinical support for the therapeutic potential of WNT7a analogs in muscular dystrophy, a complex group of disorders with a large unmet need for novel, differentiated and potentially complementary treatment approaches,\" commented Christian Weyer, M.D., M.A.S., President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. \"We are working towards the nomination of an investigational new drug (IND) candidate later this year, and are excited about the potential to advance this new mechanism toward clinical studies.\" In the MDX mouse model of muscular dystrophy, intramuscular injection of a novel WNT7a analog resulted in significant dose dependent muscle hypertrophy and several-fold expansion of the satellite stem cell population. Moreover, three weeks after a single intramuscular injection, functional assessment revealed a significant increase in strength of the targeted tibialis anterior muscle (+18%, p<0.001). These functional improvements were accompanied by a significant reduction in markers of fiber necrosis and inflammation typically seen in dystrophic muscle. Significant muscle hypertrophy and satellite stem cell expansion were also observed in wild-type mice. The WNT7a analogs assessed in these studies were engineered to overcome several key challenges of Wnt-family protein manufacture and formulation while retaining full biological activity and specificity. These and other data suggestthe potential of WNT7a-based protein therapeutics across a range of neuromuscular diseases and conditions. The findings obtained with Fate's optimized WNT7a analogs expand upon those previously reported with non-modified WNT7a protein. In November 2012, muscle biology expert and Fate Therapeutics scientific founder Dr. Michael Rudnicki published data demonstrating the potential of WNT7a to ameliorate muscle degeneration in the MDX mouse model of muscular dystrophy (Von Maltzahn et. al., PNAS 2012). In previous studies, Dr. Rudnicki elucidated theunique biology of WNT7a and its dual mechanism of action of driving the expansion of themuscle satellite stem cell population and muscle hypertrophy. About Muscular Dystrophy Muscular dystrophies encompass a group of disorders with diverse pathophysiological manifestations resulting from genetic aberrations which include mutations or deletions to over 30 distinct genes. The most prevalent and well characterized is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked form of muscular dystrophy which is seen in 1/3500 live male births. DMD typically manifests in early childhood and progresses to an advanced stage of severe muscular degeneration resulting in impairment of ambulation and premature mortality. A core pathophysiologic phenomenon seen in muscular dystrophy is a cycle of muscle degeneration leading to continuous compensatory satellite cell activation and differentiation to affect a regenerative response, but resulting in the eventual exhaustion of the regenerative capacity and significant loss of muscle function. Enhancing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms to restore the regenerative capacity of muscle satellite stem cells thus represents a promising and unique approach for therapeutically intervention in various forms of muscular dystrophy as well as other neuromuscular diseases. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Uniquely positioned at the intersection of stem cell science and orphan disease, Fate Therapeutics is pioneering the discovery and development of innovative adult stem cell modulator therapeutics with the potential to cure or transform the lives of patients with rare life-threatening disorders.
