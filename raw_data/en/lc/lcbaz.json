PROCEDURAL BACK GROUND On Aug ust 5, 1999, petitioner J ohn Doe f iled a petition pursuant to the Na tional Vacc ine Injury Compensation Progr am (hereinaf ter ceiving titis A and he patitis B vac cination,3 on June 16, 1997. He claims the vaccinations resulted in \"injuries, illnesses and other symptoms and conditions . . . including , but reaction(s) and sy mptoms known as Petitioner alleges that hepatitis B vaccine caused his condition. Not until the post-4 hearing briefs, did he suggest that the vaccine exacerbated a pre-existin g condition. In fact, petitioner's position up until and throughout the he aring , as evide nced by his testimony , is that until he was vaccinated, he was in good health. Wh ether petitioner was, in fact, in good health prior to administration of the va ccine is at issue in this case. 2Anaphy laxis and Ana phylactic shoc k.\" See Petition for Vacc ine Compensation at Acc ording to petitioner, he de veloped sy mptoms he had not experience d prior to administration of the vaccines, and these symptoms continued to worsen, bec oming c hronic. Petitioner states that the4 consensus of the many doctors from whom he sought treatment is that his condition is likely to persist for the foreseeable future. Petitioner is now approxima tely 43 years old and resides in Town, USA. Mr. Doe initially filed his claim as a pro se petitioner, and continued to represent himself from Aug ust 5, 1999, the day he filed, to Apr il 2, 2001, a period of a year and eig ht months. On April 2, 2001, he substituted attorney Michae l Roberts of Cincinnati, Ohio. On April 17, 2001, re spondent filed the r equire d Rule 4 Report, rec ommending compensa See, . Respondent maintains that petitioner is not entitled to compensation because he has failed to establish that the hepatitis B vaccine ca used his prese nt condition, arg uing tha t the medical r ecords do not support petitioner's claim of a \"Table ca se.\" Responde nt insist s further that the statutory time limi t for the onse t of symptoms of the alleg ed injury require d to establish an on-Ta ble ca se (24 hour s) was br eached. It would follow that petitioner is not due the pre sumption of causation provided by statute in a Table c ase. See id. Moreove r, respondent arg ues that petitioner ha s not demonstrated a logic al sequence of cause and effect linking the hepatitis vaccine to the onset of his unusual symptoms and ther efore cannot preva il in a causa tion-in-fac t claim. See id. To summarize, responde nt maintains that petitioner is not entitled to compensation, having failed to mee t the leg al burde n required for compensation under the Act. This case has moved ve ry slowly for many reasons. The issues ar e extensive and unusually complicated. Following the onset of his symptoms, Mr. Doe consulted mu ltiple medical e xperts, domestica lly and abr oad, hoping to find not only a diag nosis for his condition, but to restore his for mer state of health. F or the most part, his ef forts we re unsuc cessf ul. For the purpose of hear ing e xpert testimony and upon completion of the filing of voluminous m edica l records, a he aring was he ld in W ashing ton, D.C. on April 14 and 15, 2003. Following the hea ring, the par ties ag reed to tap the potential bene fits of alterna tive dispute resolution (\"AD R\"), that suc cessf ully employ ed in the Prog ram. With the guida nce of a disintereste d, unbiased third per son, ADR has a history of facilitating settlement ac cepta ble to both parties, eve n in those case s that seeming ly could not be otherwise resolved. At the parties' request, Chief Special Master Gary Golkiewicz agreed to participate as mediator in A DR. The parties could not, however, come to an agreement and those3efforts wer e aba ndoned. The re cord is now c losed and the c ase is ripe for de cision. After revie wing the entire record, and f or the re asons set for th below, the cour t finds petitioner has not ca rried the burden of proof r equire d under the Act, and is ther efore not entitled to compensa tion. In providing an ana lysis of the ca se, the c ourt will first discuss the statutory provisions and methods of pr oof as they apply here . Second, the c ourt will lay out the fac tual backg round. Next, the court will ex amine the testimony of the medic al experts for the pa rties, and the documents filed. F inally , the cour t will ex plain how petitioner ha s failed to esta blish a logic al sequence of cause and effect linking Mr. Doe's chronic fatigue syndrome to the hepatitis B vaccination. II. STA TUTOR Y PROVISION S and M ETHO DS O F PROOF To prevail in a vaccine-related case, petitioner must establish entitlement to compensa tion, and can do so by one of two me thods. First, if petitioner c an esta blish that he sustained an injury or condition set forth in the Va ccine Injury Table, a nd if the injury was observe d or manife sted within a presc ribed time following the immuniz ation alleg ed to have caused the injury, the statute presumes causation, and petitioner is entitled to compensation. This method of proof is designated a \"Table\"case. If petitioner is unable to m eet the Table case criter ia, the statute provide s that petitioner may pursue a second me thod of proof, e stablishing that the vaccine actually caused the injury, including any sequellae. This method is comm only descr The a ctual ca usation method of proof ha s been the most common method pursued by petitioners in rec ent y ears, althoug h it presents a ve ry heavy burden. As noted in the initial filing in this case, petitioner has pursued his claim as a Table c ase but a lso pursues ca usation-in-fa ct as a lternative pr oof that his injury is vacc ine- related. Upon review of the entire record, the court finds the matter a non-Table case and will analy ze it as such. To demonstrate entitlement to compensation in a non-Table case, a petitioner must affirmatively demonstrate by a pre pondera nce of the evidenc e that the va ccina tion in question more likely than not cause d the injury alleg ed. See, e .g., Bunting v. Sec retary of HHS , 931 F.2d 867, 872 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Hines S, 940 F.2d 1525 ( ) and ( II). While the Act re laxes proof of ca usation standards f or on-Ta ble injuries, it does not relax the standards for non-Table injuries. See, e .g., Whitecotton v. Secretary of HHS , 81 F3d 1099, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Grant 956 F2d a t 1148. To preva an a ctual causa tion theory , petitioner must establish entitlement to an awa rd throug h traditional tort standards to prove legal causation-in-fa ct. See, e .g., Shyface v. Sec retary of HHS , 165 F.3d 1344, 1352 (F 1999). 4To the tra ditional preponder ance of the standard, show a medica causa lly connec ting the va ccina tion and the injury .\" Grant , 956 t 1148 (citations medica l theory is shown by \"proof of a log ical seque nce of cause and ef fect showing tha t the vacc ine was the reason for the injury .\" Hines 940 F.2d at 1525; Grant , 956 F.2d at tary HHS, 998 F.2d 979, 984; Knudsen Sec retary of HHS , 35 F.3d 543, 548 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The logical sequence of cause and effect must be supported by \"[a] reputable medical or scientific explanation\" which is \"evide nce in the f orm of scie ntific studies or expert medica l testimony .\" Grant, 956 F. 2d a t 1148; Jay, 998 F.2d at 984; See also H.R. Rep. No. 99-908, Pt. 1, at 15 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6344. The F ederal Circuit has held that for a petitioner to e stablish a prima fa cie case tion based upon ac tual causa tion, petitioner must prove by a pre pondera nce of the evidenc e that the va ccine was not only a \"but- for cause of the injury , but also a substantial fac tor in bring ing a bout the injury .\" Shyface 165 F.3d at 1352-1353. Petitioner does not meet oblig ation to show actua l causa tion by simply demonstrating an injury that bear s simil arity to a Table injury or to the Table time periods. Grant , 956 F.2d a t 1148. See also H.R. Rep. No. 99-908, Pt. 1, at 15 (1986, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6344. Moreover , a petitioner does not satisfy this burden by mere ly showing a proximate temporal assoc iation betwee n the , 956 F.2d a t 1148 v. U nited States, 718 718 F.2d 202, 205 (6 Cir. 1983), ce rt. denied 469 U .S. 817 (1984) (statingth \"inoculation is not the ca use of e very event that oc curs within the ten- day period [following Wit hout more, a pr oximate tempora l relationship will not support a finding of causa tion\")); Hodges v . Secre tary of HHS, 9 F. 3d 958, 960 ( Fed. Cir. 1993). Nor doe s a petitioner demonstrate a ctual ca usation by solely eliminating other potential cause s of the injury . See, e .g., Grant , 956 F.2d at 1149-1150; Hodges , 9 F.3d a t 960. Petitioner here initially filed his petition as a \"Ta ble ca se,\" a lleging tha t he has sustained an injury identified on the Va ccine Injury Table, a naphy laxis and ana phylactic shoc k. In the event the c ourt should find that the claimed injuries do not satisfy the cr iteria for a Ta ble ca se, petitioner invoked his rig ht to pursue the ca usation-in-fa ct alter native to establish his claim. An initial is sue, there fore, is whether pe titioner suffer ed a ta ble injury . A thoroug h revie w of the record re veals that pe titioner prese nted no testimonial evidence in an attempt to persua de the court that he did suffer anaphy laxis or ana phylactic shoc k. sug gest that petitioner suffe red shoc k. In fac t, not even the possibility of petitioner ha ving sustaine d either injury was ra ised at hea ring. Moving to the c ausation-in-f act case, the centr al remaining issue is whe ther the va ccine did in fact c ause pe titioner's many symptoms. According ly, the cour t relies hea vily on the experts' interpre tation of the medica l records as e xplained throug h their re ports and ora l testimony . The discussion beg ins with a summary , albeit a leng thy one, of the facts of this case. 5III. FIN DING S OF F ACT Consistent with all other aspects of this case, the findings of fact are not readily discerned. The parties concede few facts as unchallenged, and it falls to the court to sift through the re cord to de termine that whic h can be relied upon a s fact. Although the c ourt is satisfied that petitioner's claim of persisting malaise is, more likely than not, reliable, the reality of his condition does not suffice for him to prevail in his claim of actual causation. The court is persua ded that Mr. Doe is not malinger ing, a nd that althoug h his sy mptoms are puzzl ing, the y do not appear to have been fabricated. The mou ntain of medical records filed in this case supports the description of symptoms claimed, although, as will be discussed herein, there are some discrepa ncies a s to when and f or how long they appea red. The treating phy sicians who persona lly observe d petitioner's sy mptoms have documente d those sy mptoms and provided histories for the pur pose of diag nosis and trea tment. That fac tor bea rs consider able c redibility as to Mr. Doe' s condition, although it does not explain its cause. Whil e respondent concedes that Mr. Doe suffers from C hronic Fatigue Syndrome (\"CF S\"), the pa rties hotly contest the sig nificanc of his pre -vaccine medic al history . Petitioner presents that history as one that is, with few exceptions, unremarkable prior to the hepatitis vaccinations, while responde nt arg ues the history is indicative of one w ho has suffe red ong oing serious medica l problems prior to the vac cinations. The c ourt beg ins with a thoroug h revie w of petitioner's medic al history to rea ch its own dec ision. I n deter mining ca usation, both pre-va ccine and post-vaccine histories are relevant to the court's decision in this case and will be described in detail. Petitioner was born on Ma y 15, 1961 in Richmond, Mis souri. He c ontrac ted Rocky Mountain Spott ed fe ver a t approxim ately age four . He play ed footba ll in college but a seve re neck injury ended his footba ll care er. Mr . Doe a lleges that prior to the he patitis vaccina tions administered on June 16, 1997, his health was g enerally excellent with the exception of occasional colds, flu, and other common illnesses. He c laims that he was ve ry active in a number of ende avors, a nd \"just never had any real health issues at all to speak of .\" Tr. a t 14. Petiti oner had g astrointestinal problems, but, he c laims, \"nothing tha t was to the point of being debilitating by any stretch.\" Id. Genetic F actor s Both of Mr . Doe' s pare nts are living .

Petitioner's immediate fa mily has y et a se cond g enetica lly inherited disea se, retinitid photor eceptor lay er of the re tina. I t usually begins slowly in childhood. There are many forms and a ssociations of this ge netic disea se. One form ca uses spinocer ebellar and cerebellar ataxia. There is no evidence that petitioner has either disease process, although he does ha ve some de gree of ata xia. Petitioner's sister is diag nosed with \"possible\" lupus. The court is puzz led by the fa ct that fe w of pe titioner's trea ting phy sicians re flect this unusual ge netic history . Medical History Petitioner's medical records comprise more than one thousand pages. Although petitioner cla ims that prior to his vaccinations, he ha d no illnesses to speak of, his medica l history does not support his statement. The r ecords show that problems appe ar more often than Mr. Doe is willing to acknowle dge. Petitioner re ports an ele vated bilirubin following administration of the vaccination, yet a report from Dr. Howard Deckter of Gastroenterology Consultants of Grea t Cincinnati shows that lab tests performe d on Marc h 16, 23, and 28, 1995, indicates e levated bilirubin (1.5 - 1.9) with normal liver f unction tests.

Those same r esults were evidenc ed af ter administ ration of the va ccine s and one of petitioner's tre ating doctors at the time c ommented that he ha d no idea how long the condition existed.

I n addition, Mr. Doe r eporte d right upper quadra nt pain with radiation to the left uppe r quadr ant with fullness and ha d complained of gas with pain for two weeks prior to the March 30, 1995 appointment with Dr. Deckter. Wor th noting is the doctor's only notation for family history, \"unremarkable.\" Dr. Deckter's diagnosis at that time was probable irritable bowel syndrome.

That the doctor administered both vaccines on the same day is uncontested. O n the day he wa s vacc inated, petitioner r ecalls having be en aske d to sign a statement that said he had been informed of the possible adverse reactions to the hepatitis vaccines, which the nur se desc ribed a s \"a kind of sor eness a t the point of injection and that he may not be fe eling well for a day or so, nothing mor e than that.\" Tr. at 27. Petitioner claims that within 2 or 3 hours after receiving the vaccinations, he began to experience rapid heartbeat, fever, aches, and pains. P's Affidavit 1 at 1. On that same day, petitioner attempted to tra vel to Dallas, Te xas for a business mee ting. He arrived in Dallas but ultimately stayed in his hotel room and didn't attend the meeting because \"he was feeling so poor.\" I n the wee k following the vac cinations, he tra veled with his family to the beac hes of South Carolina. At that time, he experienced other debilitating symptoms including myalgias, muscle pain, a rthralg ia, and joint pains. On June 27, 1997, he called his doc tor to repor t that \"he had severe joint pain, night sweats\" and thought he was suffering \"an allergic reaction to hepatitis immuniz ation.\" He called ba ck on Jul y 2, 1997 stating tha t he had \" weird pa ins and was not getting be tter, ac tually worse.\" He a lso reporte d that his 3-y ear-old was c omplaining of joint pain. The symptoms continued during the family holiday, and frequently thereafter he would experience a relapse; the sy mptoms would wax and wa ne. Attac ks returne d with peculiar and tremendous muscle pain, nig ht sweats, ac hes, and f atigue so seve re tha t he could do no more than lie in bed. B etwee n those episodes, he continued to have difficulties with memory , his ga it, and ataxia. Tr. at 4. When Mr. Doe r eturne d home, his phy sician had a lready contac ted the manuf actur er of the vac cine, Smith Kline Be echam, informing the m of Mr. Doe 's symptoms. S mith Kline confirme d that \"adve rse reactions to i ts hepatitis B vac cinations had be en re ported a nd advised Mr. Doe' s treating physician to discontinue furthe r vac cinations.\" The manufa cture r stated the symptoms are indicative of serum sickne ss, and will subside. Mr. Doe r eceived no furthe r vaccinations thereafter, but he was seldom asymptomatic. On July 9, 2004, petitioner again called D r. Nunlist-Young . The re cord of that call notes that pe titioner wanted the doctor to know he is fee ling f ine; he is cha nging insura nce c ompanies and w ants \"these recent episodes explained as an a llergic reaction.\" T r. at 32. Over the mon ths, petitioner's doctors were unable to identify a cause of, or relieve his symptoms. He was unable to participate in sports and other activities and alleges that his cognitive abilities were c ompromised. He c laims that he had to g ive up his profe ssion and has never returne d to his former state of hea lth. The e xception being Dr. Nunlist-Young , petitioner's primar y dminist ered the vac I t appea rs Dr. N unlist-Young e xpresse d his opinion that sever al of pe titioner's sy mptoms were a ttributable to the recor d stating tha t petitioner suffe red a n allerg ic reaction to the titis B va ccine . Yet Dr . Nunlist-Young never provided a n affidavit to that effe ct and wa s not called upon to testify as the tre ating physician, on petitioner's be half. The court que stions the absence of testimony from Dr . Nunlist-Young , and why Mc Clellan as his primary care phy sician. 10At the time of his hepatitis vacc inations, Mr. Doe wa s serving as a businessman. H e was responsible for originating a nd manag ing a portfolio of bank inve stments, lending money to and investing mon ey in various businesses, corporate acquisitions, leveraged buy-outs and equity partne rships. He wa s require d to travel e xtensively in the United States and a broad. Post-Vac cination Medical History Following the vac cinations, petitioner consulted multiple medica l experts worldwide seeking a diagnosis for his symptoms and to learn what could be done to restore his former state of health. In mo st cases, the doctors could merely speculate about his condition; possible etiologie s were discussed and nume rous lab tests wer e per formed by the many doctors. F or almost two y ears, up until petit ioner filed his c laim, none of the doc tors ag reed with petitioner that his condition was vacc ine-re lated. The c ourt finds it significa nt, however , that many of13 these doc tors name B ndrome a s a proba ble diag nosis, a fac t that will be further explored in this decision. Coi ncidentally , it wasn't until after pe titioner filed his petition that any doctor identified his c ondition as chronic f atigue sy ndrome Petitioner saw Dr . Michae l McClellan on Nov. 16, 1998, almost a y ear and a ha lf afte r the vaccination. At that time, Dr. McClellan diag nosed him with Behc et's sy ndrome, noting that he had also proba bly suffe red a septic mening itis. S hortly there after, petitioner tra veled to Eng land wher e he sa w Dr. Spicke tt who \"had no idea what is wrong .\" On Aug ust 8, 1999, having visited more than ten specialists, none of whom d iagnosed any condition attributable to the hepatitis B vaccine, petitioner filed a petition under the Ac t, alleg ing tha t he suffe red injuries inc luding but not limited to anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock as a result of the hepatitis B inoculation. Pet. at 1. Less than a mon th after filing the petition, Mr. Doe saw Dr. Wai sbren who \"suspected post vaccinal encepahlomylitis and acquired autoimmunity.\" Then, on Janu ary 23, 1999, he again saw Dr . Spicket who at that time post-vacc ine syndrome. , four doc tors, Dr. Spicket, a n immunologist; Dr. McClellan, an inter nist; Dr. Hy de, a general pra ctitioner, and D r. Waisbren, a n immunologist; filed sworn af fidavits prese nting same opinion - that petitioner's c ondition is causa lly related to his hepatitis B vac cination.

THE I SSUES The outcome of this case rests on three central issues: 1. Wa s petitioner's condition in progress a t the time of the vac cination, and is his prese nt state the natura l prog ression of that The Stevens standa rd wa s criticized by Judge Braden in Althen v. Se cretary H HS,31 2003 U.S. Claims L EXIS 269 (Fe d. Cl., S ept. 30, 2003). See also, Capizzano v. Secretary HHS , 2003 U.S. Claims, L EXIS 219, (Aug ust 5, 2003), reaffirmed Capizzano v. Secre tary HHS, 2004 U.S. Claims, L EXIS 149 (J une 8, 2004). 18condition? 2) B ut for the he patitis curr ent condition exis t? 3) Do alter native ca uses ac count for pe titioner's condition? None of these issues bea r consideration, however, without first addressing the nascent issue: Can the hepa titis vacc ine cause CFS? c ourt finds that petitioner has not succ essfully provided a generic nexus betwee n the vac cine a nd the injury , the re maining issues be ar no e xamination. Petitioner 's Position Petitioner maintains that the hepatitis B va ccine either c aused his injuries and/or substantially aggravated an e xisting under lying c ondition that is likely to persist for the f orese en future. Petitioner claims further that he is entitled to compensation provided for by the Act for his injuries and his condition for the following reasons: (1) it is medically plausible that the hepatitis B vaccine cause d chronic fatig ue sy ndrome; tion of medical plausibility from the medic al community ; (3) he ha s proof that he has an injury recognized as medically plausible in the literature; (4) there is proof of a medically acceptable te mporal re lationship between the vacc ination and the onset of his injury ; and (5) he has provided pr oof of e limination of other cause s of the injury . Tr. 6-8. Petitioner relies upon two c ases de cided by the Chief Specia l Master to def ine the standard he proposes be satisfied for him to prevail in his claim. See, Steve ns v. Sec retary HHS , No. 99-594V, W L 387418 (F ed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Marc h 30, 2001) (r uling that pe titioner is denied summary judgme nt, having failed to satisfy a five -prong criter ia for a nalyzing ac tual causa tion under the Program); No. 1682537, at *8 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Dec. 18, 2001). First, to support the notion that it is m edically plausible31 that the hepa titis B va ccine can c ause CF S, petitioner offe rs the testimony of his experts and package inserts from the manufacturers of the vaccine, in which are listed several symptoms experienced by petitioner. Petitioner looks to four experts, three of them treating physicians, who are of the opinion that a causal link exists between hepatitis B vaccine and CFS. F rom this evidenc e, petitioner ma intains he has demonstra ted medica plausibili ty. Second, petitioner a sserts the medica l literature f iled provides conf irmation of medical plausibility from the medic al community . To this end, he off ers se veral published writings from which he intuits demonstration of a medically plausible causal relationship betwee n hepatitis B va ccine and chr onic fa tigue syndrome, a s set forth by the medica l The only Table injuries a ssociated with the he patitis Third, petitioner, relying upon his treating physicians, argues that he has successfully demonstrated he has CFS, as de scribed in the f iled literature . Using the method of diff erential diagnosis, petitioner's physicians arrived at what is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion. This is achie ved by having considere d and eliminated r easona ble alter nate c auses. Fourth, petitioner a rgues that the temporal relationship between the vacc ine and his CFS is supportive of a c ausal re lationship. He points to sy mptoms developing w ithin hours of the vacc ination, abating for only a day and then r eturning and g etting pr ogressively worse. Finally , petitioner ar gues that examination of his medical re cords make s clea r that no alterna tive cause for his injury exists. Further more, he looks to the testimony of his medical experts for support this assertion. Respondent's Report Sum mary in Opp osition In response to petitioner's alleg ations, responde nt maintains that petitioner is not entitl ed to compensation, having failed to e stablish a logic al seque nce of cause and ef fect showing tha t the hepa titis B va or and A vac cines c aused his condition. Respondent argues that the medical records are inconsistent with petitioner's claim. Respondent first proposes that there is a discrepancy as to the timing of the onset of symptoms, and second, that it is not clear w hether the immuniz ations were administered on June 18, 1997 or on J une 16, 1997. See, R. Rule 4 at 3; Pet.'s MR at 690. This factor is of importance inasmuch as the Vaccine Injury Table requires that the first symptoms of anaphy laxis or ana phylactic shoc k, which is the manife station of onset or signific ant ag gravation, be evident within 4 hours of a dminist ration of the va ccine . Respondent32 further argues that not only has petitioner f ailed to establish a c ase for a Ta ble injury , but that he has not demonstrate d actua l causa tion as neither the me dical re cords nor medical litera ture support the that the fa ct, petitioner's pr esent condition. Furthermore, petitioner's medical records reveal significant factors having nothing to do with the vacc ine, that may affect his hea lth, past, present a nd future. Respondent ar gues that the opinions of Drs. Mc Clellan, Geier , Waisbren, Spickett, and Hyde ar e ally insufficient to prove causa tion. Moreover , responde nt points out immunologist, Dr. L uggen, \"of fered seve ral clinical impressions but did not feel that his patient's illness was caused by the vaccine.\" R. Pr e-Hearing Memo a t 6-7; See, Med. Rec. 36- 37, 99. Respondent maintains that petitioner must demonstrate some inde pendent validation of his experts' methodology, e.g., supporting scientific literature to support a prima Dr. Nunlist-Young 's records indica te that petitioner did express conc ern regarding33 exposure to Scarlet F ever. See, Nunlist-Young records, J une 16, 1997. 20facie case. V. TES TIMONY AT HEARING Petitioner , John Doe Th e petitioner, John Doe, was the first to testify. He describes his state of health prior to the June 1997 vac cinations as \"g enerally excellent\" his whole life, tha t \"other tha n [Rocky Mountain Spott ed Fever as a c hild] , from a phy sical point of view, I was proba bly about as good as y ou can imag ine.\" Tr . at 14. When asked a bout ga strointestinal problems, he said he had them, \"but nothing to the point of being debilitating by any stretch\" and that he doe sn't reme mber how he treated them but thinks he \"took some antac id thing.\" Id.

He f elt fine the ne xt day and ar ound a we ek later , suffered a blinding headache, pains \"bouncing\" throughout his body, with pain and burning in his face. The sensations continued on a nd off f or around ten day s, during which time he wa s awa y on vacation. He said he \"ended up getting better after that,\" but remembered that a short time later, w hile trave ling to Va il, Col orado he experience d his right side f eeling \"asle ep.\" T r. at 19- 20. He wa s completely recovere d the following day and \"f elt so g ood [he] went white wa ter rafting.\" Id. The pains waxed and waned, becoming a constant pattern. Tr. at 20. During these \"episode s\" of pa in, petitioner descr ibes himself as g oing into a \" brain fog .\" On cr oss-examination, Mr. Doe testified that, on the da y of his vacc inations, he visited his doctor complaining of having had a sor e throa t for thre e weeks. He said he doe sn't reme mber having expressed conc ern to his doctor tha t he had be en exposed to somebody with Scarlet Fever. 33 He discusse d having had a lump, a lipoma, surg ically remove d from his deltoid muscle, at the site of the injec tion; the doctor said it was \"some kind of intramuscular lump that happens after vac cination sometimes.\" Tr. a t 30. He said that star ting the w eek a fter be ing va ccina ted he was very lethargic and that at times he required naps and didn't have \"nearly the same energy level that [he] had prior to the vac cination.\" Tr . at 31.

Tr . at 32. The message is documented on page 158 of petitioner's medical records. Pe titioner provided little additional testimony, stating that he wasn't sure of, or couldn't remember, muc h detail having to do with his inj ury.

Hyde ar ranged for Mr. Doe to ha ve a SPEC scan in Ottawa,34 Canada . The SPEC scan showed r educe d uptake in tempor poste rior fossa a nd pons. The re port stated that these finding s are indicative of c hronic fa tigue syndrome. Dr. Hy de maintains that petitioner suff ers from a \" general and se verely abnorma l immune dysfunction exhibit ed throug h his inflammatory reaction to the arte ries of the brain a nd . . . an inflamma tory reaction to the thyroid.\" Third Set Med. Rec. Dr. Hyde at 3. Based on his examinations and a revie w of the me dical re cords, Dr . Hyde conc luded that petitioner ha d no history of any serious illness or chronic ongoing disability until he received the two hepatitis vaccinations. Dr. Hy de obser ved that within a time per iod consistent with an adver se immune type reaction, Mr. Doe developed a series of problems that Dr. Hyde has observed in a large number of pa tients following r ecombinant he patitis ation. ms include sistence of memory and spee ch dy sfunction, var ious cog nitive dysfunctions, ical abnor malities other c ognitive es. Other symptoms i nclude loss of Dr. Hy de maintains that it is medically improper to g ive an immunization, and35 particularly a multiple imm unization to any patient with an active infectious disease. This is particularly so if one does not first ascertain the nature of this primary infection. \"Since [sic] in my experience , many of the seve re and perma nent adve rse immune re actions sulting patitis B immuniz ation.\" P. Med. Rec. a t 1348. See also, Tr. at 49. 22stamina, intractable pain, retina problems, skin lesions and other problems following the hepatitis B vaccine . See, e .g., Pet. Ex. Th ird Set of Med. Recs. Dr. Hyde maintains there was a close temporal relationship between petitioner's vaccinations and the onset of his illness. Upon examination, Dr. Hy de found \" an inflammatory reaction to the thy roid, a minor thyroid irre gularity .\" Upon discove ring that the abnor mal amount of autoimmune antibodies wa s of major pr oportions, Dr. Hy de postulated that the body was a ttempting to re ject or a ttack its own thyroid g land. Fur ther testing reve aled a follicular c s \"Ha shimoto's Thyrotox icosis.\" The land r emoved a nd the ca rcinoma duly excised. Dr. Hyde testified that he's done a partial assessment of petitioner and believes he has a major bra in stem injury that is measura ble. He be lieves that Mr. Doe 's symptoms and the pattern of his illness are consistent with both autoimmune and CNS vasculitis disease. He explains that . . . what possibly happene d is that the immuni zations caused the immune system no t to be able to recognize the infection [pe titioner] already had in his throat. And it probably beca me chr onic, and de stroy ed his brain or injured his brain to the e xtent it has been injure d. And I think this is the way, how I read it, how the imm unization works. 35 Dr. Hy de is of the opinion that petitioner wa s at risk for a n adver se reaction to the hepatitis vaccines for three reasons. First, he believes that those with an acute infection should be not administered the hepatitis B va ccine ; second that it should not be administered whe n the recipient is overtired, and third that it should not be given to those who, in addition to the first two contra indications also have a history of immune dy sfunction. For petitioner , Dr. Charle s M. P oser Dr. Char les M. Poser, M.D., is a neur ologist pra cticing medicine f or 52 y ears. Tr. at 98. He is cur rently a prof essor of ne urolog y at the B oston University School of Medicine a nd a23lecturer in neurology at Tufts and a visiting professor neurology at Harvard Medical School. In addition, Dr. Poser is a c onsultant in neurolog y to the Offic e of the Surg eon Ge neral for the Army and the Of fice of the Surg eon Ge neral for the Na vy, as we ll as a consultant to the Ve terans Administration Medical Center in Boston He testified that he has published about 240 articles in scientific journa ls, some 85 chapter s in reviews, ha s written five books a nd done some e diting. Tr. at 99. Petitioner wa s referred to Dr. Poser by Dr. Hy de. Althoug h his Dr. Poser's initial examination of petitioner was \" completely normal, Dr. Poser wasn't ter ribly surprised a s, he explained, periods of be ing a symptomatic were consistent with a diag nosis of CFS. Dr. Poser testified that \"The temporal re lationship to he vac cination with a re combinant hepa titis A and B vaccine is such that to strong ly suggest a c ausal re lationship.\" Tr. at 104. He added tha t he has \"seen sever al cases of c lassical CFS immediately following , and almost ce rtainly resulting from such vac cination.\" Id. Mo reover, he does not believe the thyroid carcinoma is related to this condition . Id. For petitioner , Dr. M ark I. Ge ier Dr. Mar k R. Geier, M.D ., Ph.D., is a medical doc tor prac ticing in Ma ryland and Vir ginia, and is certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics. He is a Board Certified Forensic Examiner, a Board Certified Me dical Examiner, and a specia list in both obstetrics and g enetics and has published 30 pe er-revie wed publica tions. Approx imately ten of these article s involve hepatitis B va ccine but his publi cations studied the saf ety and ef ficacy of many differ ent ty pes of vaccines. He ha s appea red on ma ny occa sions before the spec ial masters of the Vaccine Compensation Progr am as a n expert witness testify ing to the a dverse effects of va rious vacc ines. Dr. Ge ier ha s review ed the r eports of both pa rties in this case. Te stifying for petitioner, Dr . Geier argues that his own re search and the peer -reviewed f indings published by others show a causa l link between he patitis vaccine and ser ious adverse reactions. Specifica lly, Dr. Ge ier posits that the hepa titis B va ccine can c ompromise the auto-immune sy stem. I t is his opi nion that petitioner, more likely than not, was injured by the hepa titis B va ccina tion and that his claim should be compensa ted. See, P. Med. Rec. at 1909. For petitioner , Dr. M ichael McC lellan Dr. Micha el McClellan is board c ertified in inter nal medicine a nd is in practice providing both primary care, and tr eatment a nd manag ement of a cute a nd chronic illness. Dr. McClellan first saw the petitioner approxima tely a year and a half after administration of the hepatitis vaccines, and c ontinues to see him on a re gular ba sis. At the time petitioner first saw Dr . McClellan, he ha d been se en by sever al diffe rent doc tors in addition to his primary care phy sician and wa s seeking yet another opinion reg arding his various sy mptoms. Tr. at 481. During that initial visit, petitioner reported symptoms including headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, cognitive dysfunction, and night sweats. Petitioner acknowledges that some of the symptoms pre-dated his vac cination Dr. McClellan testified that several symptoms \"actually sort of predated [pe titioner's] complaints of sy mptoms . . . and would be a r ecurring feature24of his illness\" ever y time he saw pe titioner. Id. Dr. McClellan a rgues strong ly that Mr. Doe doe s not fit the profile of a malinge rer and is a c redible pa tient. Tr. at 485. For respondent, Dr. Steven H. Lamm Dr. Steven H . Lamm, an epide miologist, arg ues that there is no known association betwe en the hepa titis B va ccine and chr onic fa tigue syndrome, \" let alone c ausation.\" R. Ex. CC at 2. Dr. Lamm specia the fields of me dical , pediatric s, and occ upational and l health. He is boa rd-certified in pe diatrics, public hea lth, and occupa tional medicine, a nd is a cha rter f ellow of the A merica n College of Epidemiolog y.

He has published approximately one hundred articles in his fields. In addition, Dr. L amm is the founder and pre sident of Consultants in Epidemiol ogy and Occupational Hea lth, Inc., a c onsulting and r esearch c ompany dedica ted to the assessment of health risks from expos ure to various chemicals and biological substances. A s pecial area of his research has bee n to identify the roles that biolog ical and c hemical e xposures a s well as medica l diseases ha ve in the deve lopment of ce rtain hea lth outcomes. Tr. at 199. The court found D r. Lamm t o be a credible witness, with impressive credentials. Dr. L amm defe rs to petitioner's tre ating doctors as to the dia gnosis of chronic f atigue syndrome. His role in this case is not to diag nose Mr. Doe 's symptoms, but to review the medical litera ture re garding whether there is an H ep immuniz him as \"w hether the medica l evidence , the professional literature, indicates to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that [CF S] is a conseque nce of hepatitis B immunization.\" Tr. at 204.

He dr aws upon the r eport of the Canadian panel and the publications by Dr. Salit and Dr. Pennie. Tr. at 205; See, R. Ex . CC. Having reviewed Mr. Doe's medical records and the affidavits of treating physicians along with those of testify ing e xperts, as w ell as pee r-reviewe d literature , Dr. L amm has conc luded that the evidence in the literature does not support the proposition that CFS is r elated to the hepatitis B vaccination, nor does the testimony of petitioner' s doctors.

R. Ex . A, B . Dr. Zweiman asserts there is no evidence that Mr. Doe's condition is due to a defense defect. \"The way that one dete rmines whethe r or not an individual has defe ct is twofold . . . [ first] is whether or not they have those types of r ecurrent infe ctions, et ce tera, that are typical for an immune def ect of a par ticular ty pe. And se cond, to ac tually measure the functional capacity of an individual to manifest the host defense.\" Dr. Zweiman explained that in this case, that would be the capacity to m ake antibody responses to imm unization, \"the capacity to exhi bit what's ca lled delay ed hy perse nsitivi ty.\" This ca n be done by a ser ies of skin tests and other tests, none of which we re pe rformed on Mr. Doe . Tr. at 310. Dr . Zweiman c oncludes that without these tests, he could not say that Mr. Doe ha d a \"host-de fense defe ct that made him a particula r infec tion or adver se reaction to an immunization, et. cetera .\" Id. For re spon dent, Dr. Ar nold Safran Dr. Ar thur Safra n, a boar d cer tified prac ticing ne urolog ist, concurs with re spondent's other e xperts that He p B va ccine is not the ca use of Mr. D oe's c ondition. R . Ex. Z, AA. He points to petit ioner's me dical history prior to administration of the he patitis vaccine s and ar gues that many of petitioner' s symptoms predated those immunizations. Id. Dr. Safr an also c onsiders thyroid cancer, diagnosed after immu nization, but possibly growing prior to that, as a probable cause of many of petitioner's post-vaccination symptoms. VI. DISCUSSION This analy sis of the long and extensive rec ord of this ca se beg ins with an a priori assumption: P etitioner is suffe ring. Severa l doctors ag ree that he suff ers from chronic fatig ue syndrome, a n ong oing a nd disabling c ondition, and even those w ho don't ag ree with that diagnosis, acknowledg e his multipl e symptoms. Mr. Doe initiated liti gation ag ainst his insurance company , and pre vailed with a f inding of disability . That Mr. Doe is disabled, howeve r, is not36 the issue at hand. I t is the cause of his condition that is t he foc us of the deliber ation at hand. Specifically, the undersigned is charged with deciding whether, as petitioner claims, administration of the hepa titis vacc ine ca used chr onic fa or w hether , as responde nt arg ues, Mr. Doe would be in the same condition without having be en exposed to the vaccine, and that the va ccine was not a sig nificant fa ctor in the de velopment of those sy mptoms. Before going any further, the central issue mus t be explor ed, whether a causal nexus e xists betwee n hepatitis B va ccine and CFS. Issue On e: Can hepatitis B vaccine c ause chronic fatigu e syndrom e? The unde rsigned wa s not persuade d by Dr. Ge ier's te stimony . See, p. 27 infra.37 26Having carefully reviewed the record, which inc ludes reams of medical literature along with the affidavits of many doctors, the court has not been persuaded that hep atitis B vaccine can, in fact, cause chronic fatigue syndrome. The conclusions of those doctors who found a causal relationship between the vaccine and CFS have not been supported to a reasonable degree of medical probability. If the court is to accept that hepatitis B vaccine can cause CFS, petitioner would have to prese nt more compelling evidence than he has in this case. In fact, none of the medical literature submitted by petitioner addresses a most basic inquiry: whether hepatitis B vaccine can cause CFS. The strongest evidence provided by petitioner's experts is that of a temporal association. It is well- settled that temporal a ssociation alone is not proba tive in vaccine ca ses. See, Grant v. Secretary HHS , 956 F.2d 1144, 1148; U.S. , 718 2d 202, 205 (6 Cir. 1983), cert. 469 U.S. 817th (1984). Te mporal assoc iation betwee n administration of the vaccine and t he onset or w orsening of a condition doe s not suf fice to prove that the vac cine is the a ctual ca use of injury , at 1148; Hasler at ating on t he non-proba tive temporal relationship, petitioner's experts relied upon me dical literature that addresses the relationship betwee n vaccines other tha n hepatitis B a nd various injuries, betwe en hepa titis B va ccine and injuries not claimed by petitioner, and va ccine injury in ge neral. Only one study enter ed into evidenc e spec ifically investiga tes the relationship betwee n hepatitis B vaccine and CFS, a Canadian study filed by respondent. See, \"Canada Com municable Disease Report of the working group on the possible r elationship betwee n hepatitis B va ccina tion and chronic fatigue syndrome.\" CAN. MED. ASSOC. J. 1993: 149 (3). Petitioner criticized the study as unre liable, pointing to everything f rom sample size to the purportedly unimpressive g overnme nt offices from w hich the study was issued. Tr. at 90. Petitioner's objections to a study's reliability based upon of fice size are new to this P rogram a nd are unpersua sive. Dr. L amm responde d to each of petitioner's negative alleg ations that called into question the Canadian study. Dr. Lamm testified that there are three study groups in the Canadian report, the first with a sample of 6 9, the second of 700, and the third of 134. He e xplained that Dr . Geier 's testimony criticizing the study was li mited to only the first group, and that Dr. Geier' s statement that only ten of the sa mple were contacted is incorre ct. In fact, out of the 69 ca ses in that g roup, 59 had37 been contacted, of which 30 were identified as CFS cases and it was those 30 reported in that first study group. Tr. a t 213-214. Dr. L amm testified that since the initial report don e in 1993, two subsequent publications ca me out of that report, but that rec ent investig ation shows that, as of two days before he testified in this case, thos e were the only reports spe cifically looking at the hepatitis B vaccine and CFS. Tr. at 215-216. Significantly, those reports found no causal relationship between the hepatitis B vaccine and CFS. Fu rthermore, petitioner's challenge of Dr. Lamm' s most recent re search is of little value her e. VAERS is the Vacc ine Adver se Events Repor ting Sy stem databa se. I t has followed38 adult hepatitis B va ccine from 1997. I t is an epidemiolog ic databa se maintained by the Centers for Dise ase Control and Pre vention (CDC) since 1990. 27Petitioner insist s that Dr. L amm missed the Gerard report publi shed in B RAIN 2001. I n that study, all of the 50 patients with m acrophagic mild bursitis (\"MMB \") had been inoculated with hepatitis B or tetanus tox oid vacc ine bef ore biopsy . Tr. at 250. The court ra ised the same que stion as did Dr. Lamm: what is the relevance to pe titioner's CFS? Petitioner quickly explained that MM B is a variant of CFS. Tr. at 251 . The explanation was insufficient for Dr. Lamm, as it is for the court. The court is interested in those studies that address the specific relations hip betw een hepatitis B vaccine and CFS, not that of the vaccine and other conditions, or of other vaccines and CFS. Review of the Canadian study that examined the interplay of hepa titis B and CFS provides persua sive evidenc e that ther e is no scientific ba sis in thi s record supporting an assoc iation betwee n hepatitis B va ccine and chr onic fa tigue syndrome, let a lone one of causa tion. Another study published in 1997 reported that hepatitis B vaccine was not a precipitating factor for CFS. Moreove r, Dr. L amm found Dr.G eier's research and te stimony irrele vant to this case as it does not addre ss the diagnosis of CFS. The court notes, as does Dr . Lamm, that Dr. Ge ier's r eports ar e not concerned with CFS, but with arthritis and the symptoms of acute arthritic reactions. Dr. Lamm criticizes Dr. Geier's studies for their lack o f reliability. They were, he reports, \"internally inconsistent with his i ndividual reports a nd inconsistent a cross the repor ts.\" Dr. Lamm explains t hat even if Dr. Ge ier ha d used a r eliable methodolog y, he did not apply it in a reliable ma nner. Testify ing for responde nt, D r. Lamm points a gain to Dr. Ge ier's e rrone ous determination of incidence rates from the re porting rates (case reports per 10 milli on dosag es) compiled in a \"passive surveillance system, VAERS.\" Dr. L amm emphasizes the signif icanc e of the differ ence betwee n38 incidence rate and repor ting rate. Furthermore , he fa ults Dr. Geier 's methodolog y for its depe ndence on two assumptions that have not been validated. First, that the reporting rate (i.e., the percentage of ca ses that ac tually get reported to VAERS for a particula r symptom or dia gnosis) is the same for all vacc ines, and sec ond, that the ag e distributions of the vacc ines are simil ar. D r. Lamm arg ues that relianc e on these false a ssumptions results in risk estimates that are far removed from the subsequently demonstrated a ctual risk and there fore devoid of predic tive value. Ac cording ly, Dr. Lamm finds the Geie r report neither r eleva nt nor valid. The c ourt finds Dr. Lamm to be better qualified than D r. Ge ier in the a reas discussed her e. The c ourt finds Dr. L amm's criticisms relevant and valid in that reg ard. The court doe s not find Dr. Ge ier's te stimony probative, a dding the prese nt matter to a long line of vaccine ca ses finding little or no va lue in Dr. Geier 's testimony . As has bee n the ca se with sever al spec ial masters in the Dr. Geier's testimony has been accorded no weight in other vaccine cases: Thompson39 v. Sec retary HHS (Fed. Mstr. 23, Haim retary of HHS , No. 90-1031V, WL 346392 (F Aug . 27, 1993) (Dr . Geier's testimony is not reliable, or grounded in scientific methodology and procedure. His testimony is m erely subjective belief and unsupported speculation.\"); Marascaloco v. Secretary of HHS , No. 90-1571V, 1993 WL 277095 (F ed. Cl. Spec. Mstr.

June 10, 1992) (\" Because Dr. Ge ier has made a profession of testifying in m atters to w hich his professional background (obstetrics, genetics) is unrelated, his testimony is of limit ed value to the court.\" ) Daly v. Se cretary Spec. Mstr. July 26, 1991) (\"The court is inclined not to allow Dr. G eier to testify befor e it on issues of Table injuries. Dr. Ge ier clearly lacks the expertise to evaluate the sy mptomatology of the Ta ble injuries and r ender an opinion there on.\"). Americ an Medic al Association MA) g uidelines for e xpert (3)(a ) \"Existi ng policy regarding the compete ncy of expert witnesses ... (B OT Rep. SS A-89) is rea ffirme d, as follows: The AMA believes tha t the minimum statutory require ments for qua lification as an e xpert witness should re flect the following : (i) that the witness be re quired to have compar able e ducation, tra ining, a nd occupa tional in the same fie as def endant; (ii) that the oc cupational xperie nce inc lude ac tive medical pr actice or tea ching experience in the same fie ld as the def endant; and ( iii) that the active me dical practice or te aching experience in the same fie ld as the def endant; and ( iii) that the active medical pr actice or tea ching experience must have bee n within five y ears of the date of the occur rence giving r ise to the claim.\" A merica n Medica l Association, Policy Compendium (1999). 28Program, the undersigned discounts Dr. Geier's testimony for several reasons. First, Dr. Geier is39 an obstetrician and geneticist. He has been trained in those specialties but not in epidemiology. According ly, Dr. Geier does not me et the AMA's guidelines for expert witnesses. The g uidelines40 clearly set forth the minimal requirements a doctor must fulfill to be co nsidered an expert witness. Of primar y importance is that the testify ing doc tor be a n expert in the field for w hich he opines, a nd that formal tra ining in that fie ld is essential. Counsel for petitioner, Mr . Shoemaker , beg an his direc t examination of this wit ness with a thinly veiled and ine ffective ser ies of questions desig ned to establish that although D r. Ge ier's research employs the use of numbers and P va lues, he is not involved in epidemiological endeavors. Tr. at 140-141. Severa l special masters in the Prog ram ha ve af forde d littl e substance to Dr. Ge ier's testimony , the most fr equent criticism being that he is not an epidemiolog ist. Mr. S hoemaker's attempt here is to forestall similar criticism by the undersigned, by suggesting Dr. Geier is simply using c ompara tive statistics freque ntly employ ed by any medical doc tor perf orming research. To be succ inct: the undersig ned is not persua ded. Elsewhe re in the transcript, Mr. Shoemaker even refers to Dr. Geier 's work in this case as epide miologica l. Tr. at 10. Dr . Geier prese nted pape rs he For example, as a g eneticist, Dr. G eier provided a credible explanation of why41 petitioner could not have Usher' s disease, ba sed on the c hromosome patter n for that c ondition. Tr. at 156- 157. 29wrote that addre vac a nd arthritis, not CFS; and of tetanus tox oid and hepatitis B vaccines' relationship to Guillain-Ba rr, not CF S. According ly, except for that whic h addre sses g enetics, the court discounts Dr. G eier's testimony here . 41 The c ourt is require d to review and conside r all issues ra ised and a ll matters submitt ed. The undersig ned has done so without ex ception . The court has found the me dical litera ture filed by petitioner to be of little value to his cla im. Among the a rticles submitted in support of his alleg ations is: S . Guis et al., \" Identical Twins With Macrophagic Myofascitis: Genetic Susceptibility and Triggering by Aluminic Vacc ine Adjuvants,\" 47 A RTH. & RHEUM. 543 - 545 (2002) , providing an anecdotal repor t of a sing le set of twins who de veloped mac rophag ic my ofasc itis (MMF) af ter the third and final a dminist ration of he patitis B vaccine. The article conclude s that \"this observa tion illustrates the importance of the genetic background in MMF , and its possible triggering by aluminic vaccines.\" See, R. Ex. 6 at 33. The value of this article in determining causation in the present case eludes the court in three ways. First, Mr. Doe is not diagnosed with MMF . His diagnosis is CFS. MMF is recently descr ibed.\" Id. Unlike CFS, the diagnosis of which is one of e xclusion, MMF is diag nosed based on \"de ltoid mus cle biopsy that usually shows bnormalities including inf iltration of connec tive tissue by e and g rossly rounded CD68+ histiocy tes.\" Although Mr. Doe developed a mass in the are a of his deltoid muscle, t here is no evidenc e that a biops y revealed the a bnormalities descr ibed in the ar ticle. Second, the a rticle refe rs to a situation in which the complete sequenc e of hepatitis B va ccina tion was completed; that is, the twins rec eived thre e doses. I f anything - the article suggests a possible ca usal rela tionship betwee n hepatitis B by positive recha lleng e. F inally , for the sa me re asons explain ed above, the article provide s no indication that aluminic vacc ines ca use CFS. Petitioner filed another exhibi t for the purpose of showing \"that even as e arly as 1988, it was recognized that my algic encephalomy elitis, or chronic f atigue sy ndrome (CF S), has bee n associate d with vaccinations as an initiating event, and . . . demonstrat[ing] that it has long been known that it involves immunological dysfunction.\" See, P. Ex. 3. A.R. L \"Wha t is Myalgic Ence phalomy elitis? \" THE LANCET 1286-1287 (June 4, 1988). For sever al reasons, this particular exhibi t carries little weig ht in the delibera tions at hand. First, it is a letter to the e ditors of THE LANCET , not a pee r-reviewe d article , and is the refore la cking the rig orous scrutiny of pee r-reviewe d article s published in that highly regarded journal. The L ANCET letter ser ves to stress the importanc e of ha ving a single name to desc ribe a particula r disorder for whic h \"re gnostic criter ia are agreed.\" Id. at 1286. To that end, the authors express their agreement w ith the Center for Disease Con trol (\"CDC\") that the \" best term\" f or the condition [known as myalgic encephalomy etlitis] is CFS.\" Id. Next, the letter provides30no probative evidence that hepatitis B vaccine bears a causal relation to that condition, regardless of its name. The court's e fforts are not direc ted at naming petitioner' s condition, but at determining whether that condition has bee n caused by his hepatitis B va ccina tion. Finally , the authors make clear, in the letter's opening paragraph, that a diagnos is of CFS is b ased upon a \"characteristic history (espe cially muscle fa tigue ), a nor mal phy sical ex amination (excluding the finding s of lymphadenopa thy, or immuno-im pairing diseases.\" Id. Using those criter ia, and c onsidering petitioner's thyroid disease and alternate diagnosis of Behcet's syndrome, the letter serves little purpose in the instant ca se other tha n to cast doubt upon a diag nosis of CFS. Nor doe s it escape the attention of the c ourt that the vac cines mentioned in the a rticle a re tetanus, chole ra, influe nza, and ty phoid, but not hepatitis B. The letter proposes that the va ccine s mentioned have been a ssociated with the onset of CFS in several cases, there by \"sug gest[ing] that antig enic c halleng e, not nec essar ily in the form of a n infec tion, may be the pre requisite for the development of the disorde r.\" Id. Not only is the argument speculative for the specific vacc ines mentioned, but to extend such speculation to vaccines not e ven considered by the authors, amounts to litt le more tha n guesswork on the part of pe titioner. An eve n more puzzl ing submission is petitio ner's Exhibit 2 in which a case of Reiter' s syndrome and one of reactive arthritis were reported after the second and first dose of hepatitis (Eng erixe) B vacc ine were administered. W. Hassan, R. Oldham, \"Reiter 's syndrome a nd rea ctive arthritis in h care workers nce of positive recha lleng e, which is s trong evidenc e of a causal relationship, for developing joint symptoms after hepatitis B vaccination.\" P. E x. 2. But, the ar ticle does not link \"joint pain\" in g eneral to vaccination, but joint pain sy mptomatic of Reiter's Syndrome a nd rea neither of w hich petitioner suff ers. Ac cording ly, the ar ticle's relevance is weak. The c ourt is ill-dispos ed to find cr edenc e in exhibit s proffe red f or the stated purpose of providing evidenc e but, upon cl ose examination, simpl y does not exist , and more tellingly , bear no indication that any information re levant to this case w as conta ined there in. Testifying for petitioner, Dr. Pose r pos ited that CFS, or disseminated encephalomyelitis is a \"common complication of vac cinations.\" Ye t, he fails to present compelling scientific e vidence supporting tha t opinion. Tr. at 107-108. When confronting difficult medica l issues such as those befor e the court today , the spec ial masters fr equently rely on the Institut e of Me dicine's c onclusions as a sound sourc e for answe ring questions reg arding plausibilit y and ca usation. Due to the I OM's statutory char ge, the sc ope of its re view, and the cross-se ction of experts making up the committee re viewing the adverse events associated with vaccines, the court considers their deter minations authoritative and subjec t to gr eat de ference. Occ am's Razor: (also Oc kham's ra zor): A rule in scienc e and philosophy stating tha t42 entities should not be multi plied needle ssly, which is interpre ted to mean that the simplest of two or more competing theories is preferable and that an explanation for unknown phenomena should first be a ttempted in terms of wha t is already known {Afte Will iam Claims L EXIS at *42, n. 28; citing Watson v. Secre tary of HHS, 2001 U.S. Claims L EXIS 268, No. 96-639V, 2001 WL 1682537, at *5, n. 11 (F ed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Dec . 18, 2001). I n its 1994 repor t entitled, Adverse Events Associate d with Chil dhood Vaccines: Evidence Bearing on Causality: Kathleen R. Stratton et al., Institute of Medicine, Adverse Events Associate d with Childhood Vaccines: Evidence Bearing on Causality 8, 14 (hereinafter \"IOM 1994 Report\") , the I e favor s rejec tion of a causal relationship betwee n hepatitis B vacc ine and incident m ultiple sclerosis\" as well as multiple sclerosis rela pse. Notably, the IOM report made no mention of CFS as it relates to the hepatitis B vaccine, although it discussed various other conditions in relation to the vaccine, concluding that the evidence is inadequa te to acc ept or re ject a causa l relationship betwee n any of them and the hepatitis B vac cine. IOM repor t at 80. The c ommitt ee se ems more c oncer ned with monitoring the incidents of var ious disorders a s they relate to general vaccine administration, than to the relationship between those inciden ts and the hepa titis B va ccine itself. Specifica lly, the committee does not re commend a policy revie w of the he patitis B vac cine by any of the national and f ederal vac cine a dvisory bodies, but recommends specific surveillance of hepa titis B disea se and increased surveillance of sec diseases suc as cirr hosis and hepatoc ellular c arcinoma (empha sis added). I n sum, the I OM repor t lends no cre dibilit y to petitioner's theory of ca usation in this case. Having considere d the testimony regarding the exist ence of a causal re lationship between hepatitis B a nd CFS, the court ha s been more favor ably impressed with the opi nions of responde nt's experts than with those of petitioner. Respondent's ex perts are better qualified and more convincing in the ir arguments against vac cine-related causation. Moreover, they have effectively rebutted all of petitioner' s arguments. None of the articles submitt ed by petitioner in support of his position have been r eleva nt to the issues at hand; the studies do not support a finding of ca usation. Petiti oner ha s simply not shown that hepatitis B va ccine can c ause CF S or petitioner's injuries. Although the court is not satisfied that petitioner has af firmatively established a c ausal association between hepatitis B vaccine and CFS, the undersigned will continue with its analysis, hypothesizi ng whether the vac cine, were it show n that it could ca use CFS, did so in this case. Issue Tw o: EVEN IF it were e stablish ed that the Hep B vaccine COULD c ause CF S, DID it cause Mr. Doe's condi tion? At hearing, in his opening remarks for petitioner, Mr. Shoemaker invoked the rule of Occam's Razor, an age-old dictum advancing the proposition that the simplest expl anation is us ually the best. Tr. at 5. After months of excruciating review of the record, the court would welcome42The Ame rican Her itage Dictionar y at 860 (2 College ed. 1985).nd 32a simple explanation for petitioner' s condition, but cannot countena nce an explanation that is not only simple, but simp listic. The apparent explanation Mr. Shoemaker wants this court to adopt is that beca use petitioner' s decline allegedly began within day s of his hepatitis B va ccina tion, any symptoms ex isting af ter the va ccina tion were cause d by the vac cine. B ut the statute under which petitioner's claim was filed, assure s that no specia l master will be led into suc h temptation as temporal association or an apparent absence of alternative causation. On the contrary, although temporal a ssociation and lac k of alter native ca usation may be considered, neither one, nor the two together, are sufficie nt evidence for pe titioner to successf ully carry his burden of pr oof. See, Grant v. Sec retary of HHS , 956 F. 2d 1144 (Fed. Cir. Cl. S pec. Mstr. F eb. 17, 2000). The court understands well Mr. Shoemaker's desire that the court look to that most simple of explanations: Mr. Doe w as vac cinated; Mr. eafter suff ered; erg o, Mr. Doe' s suffer ing was cause d by the vaccine. The undersig ned is not the first to point out the log ical fa llacy inhere nt in such reasoning. The Feder al Circuit has adopted the principle tha t \"infer ring causa tion solely on the basis of a pr oper te mporal seque nce is the log ical fa llacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc (literally, 'after this, therefore because of this').\" IOM 1994 Report at 23. This log ical fallacy exists even in the abse nce of alterna te ca uses. Nor doe s biologic pla usibili ty lend substance to a tempora l relationship. Huston v. Sec retary of HHS , 39 Fed. Cl. 632, 636 (1997), for the proposition that a showing of biologic plausibilit y and temporal association is insuff icient ctual ca usation; Hasler, 2d 202, 204- 205, the pr opositions t hat a pr oximate tempora l relationship alone will not support a finding of causation and that evidence supporting the notion that \"A\" can cause \"B\" does show tha t \"A\" a ctually did cause \"B.\" Moreove r, we re temporal relationship ca use enoug h to establish causa tion, the court is not convince d that temporal a ssociation has bee n succe ssfully demonstrated he re. A careful re view of petitioner's medical records indicates that several of the symptoms he suffered post-vaccination we re documented pr ior to the vac cination. Moreove r, these sa me sy mptoms have bee n ref erenced a s indicative of CF S. Th is information beg s the question, but for the va ccine , would petitioner's condition be differe nt today c ourt emphatica lly profe sses its inabilit y with any degree of ce rtainty , that but for the va ccine , petitioner would be a healthy man today . Even if the c ourt was persua ded that but for the vac cine, pe titioner would at least be he althier than he now is, the court cannot sa y that the vac cine wa s a subs tantial factor in bring ing a bout his present condition. According to the Fe deral Circuit in Shyface 165 F.3d 1344, a logic al seque nce of cause and ef fect must lead to the conc lusion that there is no other ex planation or competing cause for the injury . A natura l place to look for guidance as to whethe r the va ccine was a substantial f actor in petitioner's case would be his trea ting doc tors. 33Treating Doct ors In the instant case , howeve r, petitioner's medical re cords r eveal two camps of tre ating physicians, those who make clea r their opinion that petitioner's c ondit ion is not relate d to the vaccine, and those who attribute his condition to it. The latter, it appears, were visited when petitioner pre pared for litiga tion. Under standably , petitioner submits only the opinions of those who attribute his condition to the vaccine. But a review of petitioner's medical records reveals alternate opinions of at least six doc tors not called upon to testify. As stated above, the observations of those doctors testify ing f or petitioner r eveal a shaky foundation upon which to build a theor y of ca usal association. F or example, Dr. L uggen, who examined petitioner i n the fa ll of 1998, testified that lab results showed sever al abnor mal rea dings, inc luding e levated bilirubin leve ls. Dr. L uggen noted that he has no ide a whe ther thi s abnormal r eading is a new sy mptom, and attests to the fac t that he is \"not cer tain how long [petit ioner] has experience d that symptom,\" specula ting that it may be for more than a y ear. The medic al records show tha t, at the time, more than a year had passe d since petitioner was vaccinated, and that he had elevated bilirubin levels for at least a year prior to vaccination. Considering the voluminous records of the many examining doctors who re ached no consensus of opinion as to causa tion in thi s case , the under signe d is reluctant to entr ust the opinions of treating doctors with any greater weig ht than t he ex perts who have not see n petitioner. Contrary to what petitioner's c ounsel advoc ates, there are no easy answe rs to be had. E vidence of a c ausal connec tion to the hepatitis B vac cine ha s not been e stablished. Throug hout the y ears, the undersig ned has revie wed clinically -base d testimony on a case by case basis. In a 1991 case, the undersigne d found the testimony of a tre ating physician to be more probative than that of an epidemiologist. Robinson v . Secre pec. Mstr. N 27, 1991) (f or the proposition that epidemiolog ical studies ar e relevant, but not necessarily the standard by which the court is required to render its decision in vaccine vase s, as it would be virtually impossibl e for claimants t o prove off-Ta ble ca ses wer e that the standard) . Yet, six years later, the unde rsigned found tha t clinically -base d testimony may be unpersua sive. See e .g, O'Leary v . Secre tary, HHS , 1998 U.S. Claim LEXIS 91 (for the proposition that clinical diag nosis, care and treatment c an also be unpersua sive). Specif ically , the under signe d found ma ny unknowns exist , and as [phy sician] admits, ot is needed off-Ta ble ca se to tip the balanc e.\"Id. at *3. And so it is in the instant matter before the court: Too many unknowns exist and petitioner has not provided enough to tip the balance in his favor; he ha s not provided convincing evidenc e that the vac cination is a more likely cause of CFS than is the virus petitioner suff ered at that same time. It appear s, howeve r, that petitioner had dia gnosed himself as suff ering an aller gic reaction to the hepatitis vaccines within hours of a dminist ration. See, P. Ex . 4 Med. Rec. a t 83. When various spec ialists made clea r their disag reement with tha t diagnosis, petitioner travele d far and wide to doctors who subscr ibed to a hepa titis B the ory of ca usation. From that time on, petitioner visited those doctors with whom the spec ial masters a re so f amiliar - several doctors who have testified time and ag ain that my riad conditions are probably vaccine-re lated. The c ourt fac es a ve ry sensitive question at this tim e, discussion of which must be pr emised by the under standing that the34undersig ned is sy mpathetic not only to the plight of pe titioner, but to a nyone who suff ers from an idiopathic condition, and espe cially those whose c onditions are without positive diag nosis. That being said, it is understanda ble that if able to, the aff licted will trave l far a nd wide to find a diagnosis, cause, a nd - hopef ully - trea tment. There is evidence throughout M r. Doe's records that he proposed his theory of causation to many of his doctors, and time and again, they refuted the possibility. A look back at the chronology of petitioner's symptoms, post-vac cination, reveals the notations ma de by at least six doctors that Mr. Doe disc ussed his theory of causa tion with them. Mr. Doe c ontinued his searc h and stopped only when he found those doctors who subscribed to the theory of ca usal rela tionship between the vaccine and his condition. This is not surprising in light of a dominating f act in this case : Mr. Doe filed his claim for entitlement under the Act on August 4, 1999 - five months before any doctor affirmed his suspicion. I t appea rs that he studied the statute a nd the g uidelines for the Prog ram a nd filed in good faith, although he heard many doctors challenge his belief that his condition at that time was a ttributable to the vac cine. Only Dr. Nunlist-Young , his primary doctor for many years, initially agreed with Mr. Doe that he experienced serum sickness. I t is int eresting that testify ing for petitioner, Dr . Poser makes a distinction between serum sickness and a neu rologic r esponse to vaccination. He states that CFS is the result of a ne urolog ic response to the vac cine, but that serum sickne ss is a differ ent ty pe of response in that it is humera l, not cellular . Furthermore , in answe r to Mr. Shoemaker 's question as to whether serum sickne ss can lead t o a more debilitating a uto-immune condition, Dr. Poser testified that he really doesn't know, but would say \"probably.\" Tr. at 109 . He then emphasized that his basis for concluding that the CFS wa s caused by the vaccination is because he could find \"no other cause that could be implicated in c ausing this.\" Yet none of the specia lists to whom petitioner was re ferred in the first year and a hal f following vaccination, indicated the vaccine as a cause of his symptoms. Dr. Nunlist-Young wrote a brief sta tement that he believed his patient's sy mptoms were va ccine - related, but he wa s not called upon to testify on his behalf . The c ourt finds no evidenc e of c ausation in temporal association and lack of alternative causes. Also worth noting is the report of Dr. Harold T. Pretorius, dated Aug ust 5, 2003 - post- hearing. See, P. Reply Post-Hear ing Me mo at 9; P. R ep. Dr . Pretorius. Dr. Pre torius perfor med a baseline a cetazotamide Bra in SP ECT on petitioner and c oncluded that he vs. stimulated (HPAO ) tracer th e left parietal, left frontal, right parieto-oc cipital and either temporal c ortex a nd cerebellum, consistent with immune cerebritis.\" He state s the condition is \"likely due to prior he patitis B vac cine injec injec tions.\" See, P retorius. The c ourt, howeve r, wa s privy to information re garding his pa tient, of which Dr . Pretorius was una ware: following the initial hepatitis B vaccination, pe titioner received no a dditional hepatitis B vac cination. See, P. Aff. De c. 2002 at 2 \u00b6 5 (a ttesting to the fa ct that petitioner re ceive d no further hepatitis B va ccina tions). According ly, the cour t finds no probative va lue in Dr. Pretor ius's conclusion. Again, the undersigned has full appreciation for what Mr. Doe has experienced and his quest The c ourt has alr eady set forth its opinion as to Dr. Geie r's credibility . See, p. 27, 37,43 supra. See also, Ormec hea v. Se No. 90-1683V, 1992 WL 151816 pec. J une 10, 1992) ( \"Because Dr. G eier has made a prof ession of testify ing in matter s to which his professional background (obstetrics, genetics) is unrelated, his testimony is of limited value to the cour t.\") 35for definitive answers and acknowledges that Mr. Doe finally found doctors to support his theory. He c onsulted wit h Dr. Hyde and Dr. Poser a nd the under signe d found both doctors to be pr e- disposed to accept a causal relationship between the vaccine and CFS. The court does not come to this case with any prede termined notions; it behooves the cour t to reflec t on the testimony of all the doctors. The Expe rts The c redibility of seve ral of petitioner's ex perts has been called into question repeatedly by sever al spec ial masters a nd judge s. For example, in found tha t Dr. B yron Hy de, testify ing f or petitioner, \"de votes his time to litigation and helping people who asser t that hepatitis B va ccine has injured them . . . [and he appears to be ] alone against the mainstream of the medical establishment, a status he re gards a s a mark of U.S. App. L EXIS, 9981 (Fe d. Cl. May 11, 2004). As is ev ident in the matter before this court, Dr. Hyde, in the Gardner-Cook case, associates himself \"with some like-minded people . . . and by a process of misdiagnosis and misinterpretation, has cast asper sions on hepatitis B vaccine in the leg al area. Id. at 22. The unde rsigned ag rees that \"[i] t may well be th at hepatitis B vaccine causes adverse reactions, but Dr. Hyde's opinion in this case is highly suspect and not c redible.\" Id. The court found Dr. Hyde's credentials are unpersuasive in that his resea rch is der ived mainly from his own lab's f indings with little support f rom outside studies. As stated ea rlier, the r esults of his studies are published by his own founda tion. I n sum, the testimony of Drs. Hyde, Weisbren, and Geier provides little to advance petitioner's case. Not only do these doc tors fail t o establish an aff irmative and pr obative diag nosis of vacc ine ca usation, but they fail to overcome the evidence of alternative causation. On the other hand, respondent's experts provided a convincing challeng e to petitioner's a ssertions of ca usation. For examp le, in response to Dr. Hyde's testimony that Mr. Doe had a \"predisposition to having problems,\" Dr. Zweiman reminds the court Mr. Doe stated tha t prior to this ti me, he ha d no problems w ith recurrent infections. In the absence of either recurrent infections or positive test results, it follows tha t Mr. Doe ha d no evidenc e that he ha d a host-def ense de fect. Tr. at 311. As to Mr. Doe' s slightly decr eased CD-4, Dr. Zweiman observes that should a host-defense condition exist, one would have e xpecte d to see a much more pr ofound abnor mality or def ect in the CD-4 levels. For ex ample, he inf ormed the c ourt that people w ith CD-4 counts of ar ound 400 still have \"absolutely no ased inc idence of infec tion\"and that i ndividuals with compromised immune According to D r. Hyde, the Nightingale Research Foundation is \"one of the poorest44 charitable institut ions in Canada. . . [e]very one volunteer s; no one is paid a sala ry.\" Tr. a t 70. Dr. Hy de is founder and cha irman of the f oundation. See, http://www.nightingale.ca/nightb.html August 16, 2004. 36systems, such as H IV-infected patients, \"do not start getting into trouble with major infections until the CD-4 count is dow n around 200.\" Tr. 313. Mr. Doe' s count was 629. Id. Dr. Z weiman emphasizes that Mr , Doe apparently displayed no immune dysfunction that would m ake him susceptible to an adverse reaction to the hepatitis B vaccine, and exhib its nothing that suggests his immune system ha s been affected by the vaccine. The court found Dr. Zweiman's testimony well- supported by medical science. His explanation of why he discre dits a causa l association betwe en the vaccine and CFS is clearly stated presenting the mechanisms of immune defenses, in sult antibodies, ce and the flexibi lity of the immune system. Tr. at 310. While petitione r failed to present a cog ent and log ical theor y of ca usation, respondent w as persuasive in p resenting a logical theory of alternat ive causation. Especially effective w as Dr. Z weiman's explanation of the sig nificanc e of the results of tests assessing petitioner's e ffective immunity . See, Tr. at 311- 313, 334-336. Moreover, Dr. Zweiman a lso found insufficient indepe ndent validation of the opinions of D rs. McClellan, Waisbren, Spickett and H yde. See, Med. Rec. 1881- 1882. Dr. Z weiman que stions the e xpertise of sever al of petitioner's witnesses. He discounts the opinions of Drs. Hy de and Waisbre n beca use t hey base the ir opinions on case r eports and not on published epidemiolog ical litera ture. court acknow ledges, howe ver, tha t epidemiol ogy is not required to prove entitlement in the program, and that case reports can be considered as evidence. See, Capizzano, 2003 U.S. Claims, L EXIS 219, (Aug ust 5, 2003), reaffirmed Capizzano v. Secre tary HHS, 2004 U.S. Cla ims, LEXIS 149 (June 8, 2004); see also, Kathleen R. Stratton et al., I nstitut e of Me dicine, Adve rse Eve nts Associa ted with Childhood Va ccine s: Evidence Bearing on Causality , 27 (1994) ( IOM Report on Causality ). Still , the court finds little value in the testimony of Drs. H yde and Waisbre n for se veral reasons. Dr. Hyde's credentials do not compare favorably with those of respondent's experts. His training and clinica l experience are as a g eneral pra ctitioner. Tr. a t 69. He is without any board certification. Id. Dr. Hy de refers frequently to his publi shed book, but on cross-e xamination the cour t learned that the book was self-published. \"We p ublished the textboo k th rough the tion and various pamphlets.\" Tr. at 71. Throug hout his testimony , and expert re port, Dr.44 Hyde maintains that CFS ca n be precipitated by a viral infec tion. Moreove r, he a cknowledg es that petitioner had a viral infec tion for three wee ks at the time he wa s vaccinated. To intuit that petitioner's CFS wa s cause d by the vac cine r ather than by the viral infe ction is speculative, and there fore of no proba tive value to the c ourt. When questioned about his understanding of the Center for Dise ase Control's (CDC) 1994 definition of CFS, Dr. Hy de wa s, at best, eva sive. 37It's not a ver y useful def inition; complex. . . . is it's not useful. . . . W ell, that definition g oes on for sever al pag es, as y ou probably know. There's no way I w ould even attempt to give you that by memory. And this is one of the problems w ith that definition. It's literally unuseable , beca use it just goes on f oreve r. I wouldn't comment on that definition without it right in front of me. Tr . at 73. Petitioner's exp erts ar gue that ample e vidence exists to support a causa l relationship betwee n hepatitis vacc ine and CFS. Dr. W eisbren, an i mmunologist, diag nosed Mr. Doe on September 14, 1999, as having chronic debilitating post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis and acquired autoimmunity. Dr. Spickett, anothe r immunologist Mr. Doe visited in L ondon, Eng land on two occasions, is of the opinion that Mr. Doe suffers from ch ronic fatigue syndrome. Yet not only do these doctors fail to provide the c ourt with a log ical p rogression of ca usation, but they fail to addre ss petitioner's pre - existing condition, those symptoms troublesome enough to warrant multiple visits to his doctors. These pr e-vaccine symptoms include oral ulcer s for sever al years, abdominal pain that was so se vere at times as to inhibit walking, nonspec ific ey symptoms, and diz ziness and disorientation. Although peti tioner presented several experts, including treating doctors, to testify on his behalf , his medical re cords r eveal at least as many doctors who do not support his theory of vac cine- related ca usation, namely Drs. De borah A . Fritz, Robert L. Reed, Micha el E. L uggen, Starr F ord, Daniel C. Jacobs, L eonar d Calabrese, Jos eph Micha lski, S teven F essler, A dam Kauf man, Salem Ford, Daniel Wall ace and Dr. Scheuner . These doc tors all examined petitioner, and while the y represent a range of medical specialties, none indicated that petitioner suffered from CFS caused by, or eve n possibly cause d by the hepa titis vacc ine. Alter nate Causes Whil e unnec y to de cide given the court's r esolution of this case, ba sed on petitioner' s failure to prove the va ccine ca pable of causing CFS, a sig nificant of alterna te ca usation persists. The undersigned cannot sweep away the ample evidence that presents possible alternate cause s of Mr. Doe 's problems. Petitioner's medic al records a re replete with mult iple fac tors that may have c aused his cur rent c ondition. Given the various alter nate c auses c onsidered by petitioner's doctors, is not satis fied that pe titioner has convincing ly demonstrated the elimination of reasonable a lternative c auses. Dr . Luggen , petitioner's tre ating immunologist, offer ed seve ral clinical impressions, but did not feel that his patient's illness was caused by the vaccine . See, R. Prehea ring Memo at 6-7, citing Med. Rec. 36-37, 99. Although D r. Poser, a nother of pe titioner's experts, testified that in his opinion, petitioner suffers from C FS triggered by the hepatitis B vaccination, the court finds it telling that he a lso testified that there is no sing le cause of CF S and that there is a basic mec hanism that can be activate d by a number of fa ctors. Tr. a t 112, 24. In addition to the affidavits and oral testimony of certain treating doctors and experts, the court found the comments on petitioner's medic al records revea ling. As noted earlier, it appea rs that most of petitioner's doctors did not have a complete family history . Dr. F ritz knew that petitioner's sister has what is possibly lupus and that his grandmother suffers from reactive arthritis.

See, Pet. Ex . 4 Med. Rec. D r. Fritz at 38-39. Simi larly, with reg ard to ckter , a gastroente rolog ist, who saw petitioner on sever al occasions pr ior to administration of the hepa titis vacc ines, on Marc h 30 and Apr il 7, 1995, notes an \"unrem arkable\" famil y history. Although pe titioner testified that he ha d insignifica nt gastrointestinal problems that never interfe red with his lifesty le, and were treated with anta cids, Dr. Deckter recorded the following impressions: \" ing study indicates norma l liver.45 Impression: rig ht upper qua drant pa in with radiation to left upper quadra nt and lower a bdomen, not decreased with Z antac or B entyl; Elevated bilirubin with normal L FT's. Probable Gilber t's [disease].\" A w eek later, after seeing petitioner again, Dr. Deckter noted that the \"abdominal pain is so severe that it wake ns [petit ioner] at times but that pain i s decreased with rest. [He] [ u]nderwent pandendoscopy with a fin al diagnosis of slight hia tal hernia, mild duodenitis and probable irritable46 bowel sy ndrome.\" See, Pet. Ex . 4 Med. Rec. D r. De ckter at 47-55. The record is no table for its contradiction of petitioner's testimony that he suffered only mildly from g astrointestinal problems. The doctor's notes re garding the deg ree of pain suff ered by petitioner, could only reflect petitioner's account of that pain. Not only did the pain awaken him from slee p, but it see med to abate with r est, raising the question of whe ther phy sical manife stations of fatigue have be en an ong oing pr oblem for pe titioner. Also in 1995, the month illegible in the record, petitioner visited his primary care phy sician, Dr. Nunli st-Young. The notes from that office visit reveal the following: \"[Petitioner is] [h]ere because of c [His] [f]riend pre scribed amoxic illin which helped initially. Has also been feeling 'funny' - described as having hot flashes, disorient ated slightly , pain up bac k of nec k (shar p and shooting , sporadic) .\" Notew orthy , the descr iption of 'funny ' Although petitioner ave rs that prior to vac cination, he suff none a fter va ccina tion, it appears that 1995 at least, he e xperie nced disorien tation and pains that sound similar to those he e xperie nced f ollowing the va ccina tion: shooting pains up and down his body - pains that waxed and waned. Cf. Pet. Reply to R es. Post- Trial Brief at 4-8. See, 6-8, supra; Res. Post-Hear ing Me mo at 4; tr. 14, 405-406, 445-450, 481;39Med. Rec 87, 866-886, 1106, 1107. The court is simply not convinced that petitioner has borne his burden by demonstrating a causa l link between he patitis B vac cine a nd CFS. Moreove r, petitioner ha s not persuade d the cour t that administration of hepa titis B va ccine a but-for c ause , or sig nificant factor in his case . VII. CO NCLUSION The court stresses yet again that to prevail in the instant case, petitioner's burden is not to mere ly convince the c ourt that he is disabled, but that administration of the he patitis B vac cine cause d his disab ility. The c ourt does not question petitioner's c redibility regarding his condition. Although tha t question was the foc us of prior litiga tion, it does little to address the issue with which the cour t grapples - c ausation. The unde rsigned ha s reviewed and ca refully considere d the opinions of ever y expert testify ing in this case, the complete filed records of every medical doc tor who trea ted Mr. Doe , and the medica l literature pr ovided by both parties. In coming to a decision in this case, the under signe d finds the opinions and rea soning of responde nt's experts most persuasive. Dr. Lamm and Dr . Zweim an not only presented superior credentials and expertise in the issues mo st relevant to this case, but they provided compelling arguments again st a causal relationship between hepatitis B vaccine and CFS. In addition, their testimony compromised petitioner's assertion that, assuming a causal relationship, the hepatitis B vacci ne more likely than not was the cau se of petitioner's CFS in this case. That Mr. Doe, an accomplished pr ofessional, should ha ve to end his care er premature ly and suffer the ravages of so debilitating a condition is indeed a tragedy. The undersigned is empathetic to his plight. Suc h empathy, however, cannot find a demonstration of causation where none exists. It may well be that in the not so distant future, medical science will establish the pre cise e tiology of chronic fatig ue sy ndrome and simil ar conditions. At this ti me, howeve r, the c ourt may only consider the exist ing e xplanations. I n the abse nce of evidenc e that the he patitis cine Mr .
