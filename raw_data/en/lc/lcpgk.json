Preferably, use green tea or chamomile tea bags for quick results. It is thought that the residual caffeine helps to constrict blood vessels which reduces blood flow, helping to provide some relief from dark circles. How To Use Cold Tea Bags - Soak the bags in water and chill in the refrigerator. Remove from the fridge and gently place them on both your eyes for 10 to 15 mins. Repeat regularly. 2. Grated Potatoes or Grated Cucumber This is by far, one of the most effective remedies. They also aid in reducing the puffiness around the eye area. Vitamins, antioxidants and the anti-inflammatory nature of these cooling veggies helps to reduce inflammation around the eyes while also helping to stave off darkening. How To Use Potatoes or Cucumber - Grate some raw potatoes or cucumber and place the shreds on your eyes. Relax and remove them after 10-12 minutes. Alternatively, you can also extract the juice of potatoes or cucumbers. Take a cotton ball, soak it in the juice, and place it over your eyes. Make sure the entire area around the dark circles is covered. Leave it for 1-3 minutes and wash off with cold water. In case you are pressed for time, you can also directly place slices of cucumber or potato on your eyes. 3. Cold Milk Cold milk is a natural cleanser for the eyes and also helps in soothing the sensitive skin around the eyes. Cold milk contains lactic acid, which not only helps to reduce puffiness but also lightens the skin. Additionally, potassium in milk allows the skin to stay better moisturised, leaving you with softer and supple skin. How To Use Milk - Dip a cotton ball in cold milk and apply it to the eye area. Keep it for a while and later rinse the eyes with cold water. Repeat at least thrice a week! 4. Elevating the Head The way we sleep also affects the surrounding areas of our eyes. A few pillows under the head can make it raised and prevent fluid from pooling under the eyes, making them look puffy and swollen. 5. Aloe Vera Aloe Vera is an effective moisturizer. Moisturized skin is less likely to sag and will stay healthy longer. Additionally, aloe vera also helps to nourish the skin, preventing premature ageing. How To Use Aloe Vera - Before hitting the sack, gently apply Aloe Vera gel under the eyes and massage for 5-7 minutes. Don't rinse unless you feel sticky and uncomfortable. 6. Almond oil and Lemon juice Another tried and tested remedy to treat dark circles is to mix almond oil and lemon juice. Lemon juice's active component is ascorbic acid, along with other nutrients it helps to reduce water retention which can cause puffy circles around the eyes. It also has a mild bleaching action, however, when used undiluted it can have the opposite effect and cause damage to the skin, so always use caution. How To Use Almond Oil & Lemon Juice - Take about a teaspoon of almond oil and a few drops of lemon juice, combine them, and gently apply it around the eye area. Massage and let it rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Rinse post that! 7. Rosewater This one can surely be termed as grand mom's secret remedy! Rosewater is refreshing, rejuvenating and can practically be used on almost all skin types and for all skin-related issues. It's also a mild astringent and can be used as an effective skin toner too.

Tomatoes Tomatoes are natural bleaching agents. They also contain antioxidants that help to tame down the discolouration around the eye area. How To Use Tomatoes - Mix a teaspoon of tomato juice with a spoon of lemon juice and apply under both the eye areas. Let it remain for 10 minutes or so, and rinse off with cold water. Alternatively, you can also consume tomato juice mixed with some lemon juice and mint leaves to get rid of dark circles. 9. Yoga and Meditation One of the underlying reasons for dark circles is stress, depression and an erratic lifestyle. Thus, one of the most prudent ways to deal with dark circles is to stay calm and composed. But as stress is an integral part of our life, this is not always possible. Hence, it is beneficial to make Yoga and Meditation an everyday ritual! Yoga not only calms down the mind but also helps to regulate the body clock, and most importantly, it addresses most body problems from the core. 10. Regular Sleep Arguably, one of the most important factors to consider when you're trying to get rid of dark circles - getting enough sleep on a regular basis. Regular sleep ensures that your body (and thus, your skin) has enough time to rest, repair and regenerate. This improves the youthfulness of your skin as well as your overall health. One of the first things that reveal our internal health conditions is poor skin condition. Proper sleep on a regular basis can be your biggest weapon against preventing and reducing dark circles in the long term. 11. Other Remedies Apart from the above natural treatments for dark circles, there are a number of other home remedies to try out. Here is a quick list of some great alternative options: Orange juice is rich in vitamins, particularly vitamins A and C, both of which help with healthy skin. Add orange juice with a little glycerin and apply it under your eyes. Vitamin E oil can help to fight the damage and prevent or reduce the acuteness of dark circles. It works by getting rid of free radicals that are known to cause cell damage. Gentle and organic, coconut oil is perfect for sensitive skin if you don't like using too many skincare products. Coconut oil can help to soothe the skin and reduce inflammation while lightening the baggy look. Turmeric, like coconut oil, is a natural anti-inflammatory substance. You can apply it to your under-eye skin with some pineapple juice (or other base substance of choice). Dark chocolate contains high amounts of flavonols, these plant compounds are associated with protection from UV-radiation damage. Flavonols are linked with a slower ageing process because they help prevent some of the damage from sunlight, so enjoy some dark chocolate every once in a while. Your stomach and skin will be glad for it! Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients and are part of your body's cellular structures, it is also beneficial for proper blood circulation. As we stated earlier, baggy eyes and dark circles have a lot to do with poor blood flow. Foods that are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids include salmon and some nuts. Can help your body circulate blood better and curb dark circle development. High amounts of salt (particularly the sodium in salt) and less water can result in a bloated look. Reduce your salt consumption and drink a healthy amount of water daily. We've expanded on the importance of water a little more, further down the article. Alcohol, like salt and coffee, is also a dehydrating substance. It leads to your body expelling a lot of liquid which also leads to hangover symptoms. Reduce your alcohol consumption and you'll notice the results when you don't wake up with puffy eyes on the weekend! When you step out in the sun, wear sunglasses.

Follow these simple guidelines, take some extra care, and dark circles will be the least of your worries. Why Do Dark Circles Occur? Not restricted to any particular age group, these dark circles occur primarily because of the below reasons: Improper diet - Lack of nutritious foods such as salads, fruits, and intake of junk, unhealthy, and processed foods results in the occurrences of dark circles. Inadequate nourishment also makes the skin look dull, shallow and may result in the formation of these dark circles. Inadequate water intake - Water is one vital fluid that the body needs at all points of time. Not only does it help to keep the skin hydrated, but also helps in the secretion of toxins. Up your water intake and see how magically these dark circles start to disappear. Insomnia - Irregular sleep patterns or short sleep cycles help in the formation of dark circles. Thus, it is vital to have a balanced lifestyle coupled with adequate periods of rest. Genetics - Many times, many people may inherit the problem of dark circles from their parents. If you fall into this category, the issue of dark circles cannot be solved completely. But with adequate care and nourishment, they can be reduced. Illness - Prolonged periods of illness can throw our routine out of schedule and result in the temporary formation of dark circles. Computer usage - Long hours in front of the smartphone and computer can result in eye strain and stress. This can also cause dark circles. Allergies - Eye dryness and allergic reactions trigger dark circles. Histamines cause blood vessels to dilate and result in redness, puffy eyes, broken blood vessels, which can all lead to dark circles. Sun overexposure - Overexposure can cause an excess of melanin which in turn darkens the skin colour, especially around the eyes. Age - Natural ageing makes skin thinner, and in turn, the dark blood vessels beneath the skin become visible, making the area below the eyes look darker. Thankfully, all is not lost when you start seeing the occurrences of these dark circles! With adequate care and treatment, you can quickly get this situation under control in no time.
