(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced they have completed a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)", "sitename": "Businesswire", "date": "2022-08-22", "cleaned_text": "NEW YORK & MAINZ, announced they have completed a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of a booster dose of an Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 12 years of age and older. The application follows guidance from the FDA to include clinical data from the companies' bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccine and the companies' bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted vaccine to address the continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Pending authorization, the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine will be available to ship immediately. A conditional marketing authorization application has also been initiated with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine and is expected to be completed in the coming days. \"The agility of the mRNA platform, together with extensive clinical experience with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, has allowed us to develop, test and manufacture updated, high-quality vaccines that align to circulating strains with unprecedented speed,\" said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. \"Having rapidly scaled up production, we are positioned to immediately begin distribution of the bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 boosters, if authorized, to help protect individuals and families as we prepare for potential fall and winter surges.\" \"Given the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, it's of great importance that vaccines can be rapidly adapted to the major circulating Omicron lineages,\" said Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. \"In less than three months after the FDA provided its guidance for adapted vaccines in the U.S., we are ready to ship the first doses of our Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine, pending regulatory authorization, to provide people in the U.S. with the possibility to get a booster adapted to the currently most dominant strain of the virus.\" The bivalent vaccine contains mRNA encoding the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is present in the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, together with mRNA encoding the spike protein of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant. Pre-clinical data showed a booster dose of Pfizer and BioNTech's Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine generated a Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 variants, as well as the original wild-type strain. A clinical study investigating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older is expected to start this month. The companies [previously announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-announce-omicron-adapted-covid-19&esheet=52821946&newsitemid=20220822005376&lan=en-US&anchor=previously+announced&index=3&md5=76484a5ecd3b3f36d640f627583a9841) safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from a Phase 2/3 trial of a 30-\u00b5g booster dose of their Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent vaccine candidate, which combines the existing vaccine and a vaccine targeting the Omicron BA.1 variant spike protein. The Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent vaccine elicited a superior immune response against the Omicron BA.1 variant compared to the companies' current COVID-19 vaccine. The Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent vaccine was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Following guidance from the EMA and International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA), Pfizer and BioNTech [submitted](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fannouncements%2Fpfizer-and-biontech-complete-submission-european-medicines-agency-omicron-ba1&esheet=52821946&newsitemid=20220822005376&lan=en-US&anchor=submitted&index=4&md5=c665a2943e12b8b2d57e6252ce34b591) an application for the Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine in July.

The booster schedule is based on the labeling information of the vaccine used for the primary series - a second booster dose to individuals 50 years of age and older who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine - a second booster dose to individuals 12 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromise and who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine COMIRNATY\u00ae INDICATION COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is a vaccine approved for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 12 years of age and older. HOW IS COMIRNATY \u00ae GIVEN? COMIRNATY\u00ae is administered as an injection into the muscle as a 2-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart. COMIRNATY\u00ae AUTHORIZED USES COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is FDA authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to provide: Primary Series - a third primary series dose to individuals 12 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromise Booster Dose - a first booster dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have completed a primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae - a first booster dose to individuals 18 years of age and older who have completed primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. The booster schedule is based on the labeling information of the vaccine used for the primary series - a second booster dose to individuals 50 years of age and older who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine - a second booster dose to individuals 12 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromise and who have received a first booster dose of any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine Emergency Use Authorization Emergency uses of the vaccine have not been approved or licensed by FDA, but have been authorized by FDA, under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) in individuals 6 months of age and older. The emergency uses are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. INTERCHANGEABILITY FDA-approved COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine FDA authorized for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for individuals 12 years of age and older can be used interchangeably by a vaccination provider when prepared according to their respective instructions for use. The formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine authorized for use in individuals 6 months through 4 years of age, 5 through 11 years of age, and 12 years of age and older are different and should therefore not be used interchangeably. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Tell your vaccination provider about all of the vaccine recipient's medical conditions, including if the vaccine recipient: - has any allergies - has had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - has a fever - has a bleeding disorder or is on a blood thinner - is immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects the immune system - is pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding - has received another COVID-19 vaccine - has ever fainted in association with an injection - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) may not protect all vaccine recipients - The vaccine recipient should not receive Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) if the vaccine recipient has had a severe allergic reaction to any of its ingredients or had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae - There is a remote chance that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where the vaccine was administered for monitoring after vaccination. If the vaccine recipient experiences a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital - Seek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms: difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weakness - Seek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms: difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weakness - Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine, more commonly in males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low Seek medical attention right away if the vaccine recipient has any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine, particularly during the 2 weeks after receiving a vaccine dose: - Chest pain - Shortness of breath - Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart - Fainting - Unusual and persistent irritability - Unusual and persistent poor feeding - Unusual and persistent fatigue or lack of energy - Persistent vomiting - Persistent pain in the abdomen - Unusual and persistent cool, pale skin - Fainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA). Sometimes people who faint can fall and hurt themselves. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask the vaccine recipient to sit or lie down for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine - Some people with weakened immune systems may have reduced immune responses to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) - Additional side effects include rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, injection site pain, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, feeling unwell, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, arm pain, and fainting in association with injection of the vaccine and irritability These may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccine. Call the vaccination provider or healthcare provider about bothersome side effects or side effects that do not go away. - You should always ask your healthcare providers for medical advice about adverse events.
