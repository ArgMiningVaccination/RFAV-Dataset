If possible, also email retreatstaff@spiritrock.org before 4:30 p.m. After 4:30 p.m. if retreat staff have not heard from you they begin calling folks from the waiting list. Our security gate is closed each night between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. If a late arrival has been approved and you anticipate arriving after 10:00 p.m., contact the registrars or retreat staff prior to arrival to receive the 4-digit gate code. Departure: The retreat ends by 11:00 a.m. on closing day. Breakfast is served on the closing day, but not lunch. Early Departure: Early departures from the retreat are not allowed without approval from the teachers. If your plans have changed since you registered, please contact the registrars immediately. COVID-19 Safety Our COVID-19 protocols are based on county, state, and federal (CDC) health guidelines, best practices for our retreat setting, and feedback from our community. These protocols include a requirement that all retreat participants, teachers, and staff be fully vaccinated and provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test on opening day of the retreat. At least one booster is required and must have been received two weeks or more before arrival. Effective June 5, 2023 On June 5, Spirit Rock implemented the following important, new updates to our COVID-19 safety protocols: For Residential Retreats - Masking: Optional for all participants, staff, and teachers, attending a residential retreat. If you choose to mask, any masking type will be allowed. Please bring your own supply of masks. - Vaccination: All staff, teachers, and practitioners must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, which includes at least one booster. If you have not received at least one COVID-19 booster since your first COVID vaccination, you will need to have a booster before you attend retreat. The first booster must have been received no less than two weeks (14 days) prior to the retreat start date. Any FDA-approved booster is acceptable. If you have had more than one booster, in addition to your first COVID-19 vaccination, you are fine to attend regardless of the timing of the boosters. Proof of vaccination with booster(s) will be required. Individuals will not be admitted to the retreat if not \"fully vaccinated.\" - Negative COVID test: All practitioners must arrive with proof (picture or actual test) of a same-day negative antigen test that they have taken prior to arrival. Practitioners who do not arrive with a negative test will be given one prior to admittance. Individuals will not be admitted to the retreat if the test result is positive for COVID-19. Spirit Rock will administer a second test to everyone on day four or five for all retreats that are seven nights or longer. Anyone who tests positive at that time will need to exit the retreat. [Click here for more details on COVID-19 safety for in-person retreats](https://www.spiritrock.org/programs/covid-protocols) Practitioner Questionnaire As part of registration, you will complete an online practitioner questionnaire. In this required form you'll submit proof of COVID-19 vaccination + booster, a headshot photo, and answer questions about your meditation practice and psychological health. This form is confidential and will be disposed of after the retreat. Final Payments If you are not paid in full, please be sure that your full balance is paid before the start of the retreat by contacting the registration department. If we have a credit card on file for you, we are happy to charge the remaining balance for you. Payment plans are not available following a retreat. Cancellation Policy & Fees Standard Cancellation Fees:* - $100 On or before 8 weeks - $175 8 - 4 weeks before - $300 4 - 2 weeks before - No refunds less than 2 weeks before Scholarship and Commuter Rate Cancellation Fees:* - $75 On or before 8 weeks - $100 8 - 4 weeks before - $200 4 - 2 weeks before - No refunds less than 2 weeks before *Fees reduced for serious illness, including COVID, or death in family Dna: Generosity & Giving The cultivation of generosity is at the heart of the Buddha's path. Dna is the Pli word for giving, and refers to the spiritual practice of generosity and letting go. Your giving supports our teachers and staff to continue offering the Dharma in an accessible and open-handed way. To read more about the practice of dna, go to [Dna: The Practice of Generosity](https://www.spiritrock.org/retreat-dana). Dna for teachers: At the end of your retreat you'll be asked to offer financial support to your teachers. Registration fees do not support retreat teachers and most retreat teachers receive no compensation for teaching at Spirit Rock beyond what practitioners offer. Your gifts support teachers to continue their Dharma practice and teaching. Please offer what makes sense for you, giving from the heart. Dna for Spirit Rock Staff* & Operations: Spirit Rock depends on the generosity of our community (sagha) to continue offering the Dharma in an accessible way. Retreat registration fees gather only about half of our budget, and donations are needed to supply the rest, including scholarships, staff, and all other expenses. * Changes in \"staff dna\": As of Fall 2021, retreat staff are no longer paid through dna contributions at the end of each retreat. Retreat staff, including cooks, managers, and retreat coordinators are now paid as employees, which increases stability and equity for these valued members of our community. Please consider this change as you plan your dna contributions to Spirit Rock both at retreat and throughout the year. Any amount you pay above the base rate of the sliding scale registration fee, or any dna or donation, is tax deductible to the full extent of the law. Please retain your payment information as evidence of your gift. Deep appreciation for your generosity! Travel and Ridesharing [Airport information and driving directions](https://www.spiritrock.org/directions) [Community Ridesharing Bulletin Board](https://www.spiritrock.org/ridesharing/retreats) Your fellow practitioners are traveling from near and far, and may need help getting to and/or from the retreat. Consider offering a ride to, from, or both ways. Our rideshare board can be used to coordinate rides or to share an airport shuttle to the retreat. We do not monitor this board. It is the responsibility of the practitioners to coordinate between themselves via this platform. Your generosity is appreciated. Emergency Phone Number If you need to be reached in an emergency during the retreat, the retreat staff office number is 415.488.0164 ext. 262. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. PT daily. Please leave a message and know that it will take some time to get a message to you. They will get a message to you as quickly as possible. Please let people know this number should be used only in case of emergencies. What to Bring - Proof (photo or test sample) of your own negative COVID-19 test result. The test must be completed the same day as opening day of the retreat.

We provide fragrance-free shampoo, conditioner, and body soap in each shower of the dorms. - For yoga retreats only: If you have specific blocks, straps, or other yoga equipment that you need, you may want to bring your own.

You will be responsible for all costs related to shipping your lost items. Safety & Security To ensure that our retreat environment remains one of safety and refuge for those who come here, all retreat center dormitory rooms have locks. You may request a key at retreat check-in and keep it for the duration of your retreat. In addition, we have installed a gate at the main entrance near Sir Francis Drake Boulevard that will prevent automobile access to the land at night. The gate automatically opens from the inside and emergency vehicles have full access at all times. The gate is closed from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. If commuters are allowed on this retreat and you are a commuter, you will be given the gate code so you can exit and enter as you need to daily. Lastly, please lock your car and leave valuables out of sight or bring them with you into the retreat center. Accessibility Spirit Rock is located in the coastal hills of northern California. The wooded campus includes separate buildings for dining, meeting, and sleeping. Spirit Rock has two-story residence buildings with single and double rooms. Go to [Spirit Rock Accommodations](https://www.spiritrock.org/retreat-accommodations) to read more details about our residence rooms and dining hall. There is a 6% slope from the dining room to the residence halls. Practitioners will need to navigate this steep incline several times throughout the day including for meals. The incline may be a challenge for some. In addition, the second floor residence dorms as well as our upper and lower walking halls in the upper meditation center require the use of stairs. If you have physical access needs that prevent you from climbing stairs, please contact us in advance so that we can have a conversation about how we may be able to support you to the best of our ability. If you have other mobility limitations, please let us know in advance, so we can assist you with your participation in the retreat. We do have four (4) electric scooters for those in need. Our center has some limitations due to various ages of construction, so if you are a person with a disability, we would greatly appreciate a conversation with you in advance of your arrival. If you need support and you haven't yet let us know, please contact us at: registration@spiritrock.org and we will be in contact with you. Spirit Rock is not able to house anyone prior to or after the retreat. However, there are places nearby in Woodacre, if you need to arrive early or stay after the retreat. These accommodation arrangements would be at your own expense. View [Off-site Accommodations](https://www.spiritrock.org/offsite-accommodations). Commuters Some retreats allow a limited number of retreat commuters\u2014retreatants who stay off-site. Commuters are expected to attend the entire retreat and follow the daily schedule. While you will not have a room on campus, we will have a resting area with futons for folks to use. Commuters will be given the gate code so you can exit and enter as you need to daily. The gate is closed from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. Lock your car and leave valuables out of sight or bring them with you into the retreat center.
