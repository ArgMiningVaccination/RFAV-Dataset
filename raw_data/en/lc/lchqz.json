As an acupuncture clinic, even well before COVID we have always worked hard to adhere to all professional guidelines regarding the cleanliness of our facility, as well as following clean needle technique and ample hand washing. For more information about what we do to keep our office clean and our commonsense COVID-19 policies, please read below: - The acupuncture treatment room is thoroughly cleaned and turned over before and after every patient. - We have many patients who are sensitive to chemical disinfectants and therefore we do not use ammonium or harsh cleansers in our office. We clean with natural cleaning solutions made with tea tree, oregano and thyme essential oils, all of which have been shown to kill viruses, bacteria and fungal spores. - We do not take temperatures at our office, as we trust that our patients can tell for themselves whether or not they are running a fever. We do ask that patients with fevers please stay home. - Patients who are experiencing other symptoms of acute and active illness (such as chills, body aches, diarrhea, vomiting, etc) are currently and have always been asked to stay home until they are well again. - Our acupuncturist will mask up upon request. - We do not require our patients to wear a mask unless they choose to. Nobody will be turned away due to mask status. - We do not discriminate against vaccination status. Whether you are vaccinated or not is your choice and you are welcome here regardless. - All commonly touched surfaces (door knob handles, counter tops, light switches, etc) are disinfected regularly during the course of the day. - Your acupuncturist always washes her hands before touching patients. - And for those who still wish to receive treatment but are uncomfortable coming into the office, we offer virtual sessions as well.
