There are three types of doshas: [Which Ayurvedic Dosha Are You? Take This What Is Kapha Dosha? Kapha means \"that which sticks,\" and derives from the elements Earth and Water (picture damp earth or chocolate mud cake). When in balance, Kapha dosha is stable, soft, cool, calm, loving, caring, and affectionate. Kapha doshas have deep and soothing voices and age gracefully because of their doughy, soft skin. They also have large eyes and smiles. Kapha women especially blossom beautifully during pregnancy. They are the earth mamas and papas who are very kind, compassionate, and patient. When out of balance, Kapha dosha is prone to weight gain, depression, and lethargy as well as chesty coughs, sinus congestion, and water retention. Kaphas can feel swampy, sluggish, or have a muddy mind. Psychologically, they struggle to let go and can suffer with attachment, possessiveness, and remaining in a situation that is not healthy for them.

They need warm, dry weather to pacify them. Because Kapha types have a tendency to sloth and be too much in their bodies, their lifestyle needs to heat up and be a little more active. This also helps with weight loss and raising their body temperature, which is usually cold. Healing crystals are especially helpful for warming Kapha when they need to heat up.
