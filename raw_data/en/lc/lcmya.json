The legislation makes modifications to FDA operations by requiring the expansion of the use of real-world evidence ( RWE ) at HHS, requiring additional communication between FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for B reakthrough Therapy drugs, and direc ting the Secretary to establish two additional FDA Centers of Excellence . It requires FDA to publish guidance on the standards and factors it will employ regarding use of other evidence, such as clinical evidence, patie nt registries, or other RWE, to fulfill post approval study requirements to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of a therapy approved under accelerated approval. It also directs the Secretary to convene a multi -stakeholder meeting to explore innovative ways and incentives to foster the adoption of decentralized trials. The bill also makes a number of investments for patients and caregivers, including by establishing educational programs for caregivers, investing in health literacy, requiring more diver sity in clinical trials, procuring patient experience data in clinical trials, and allowing Medicare to cover the costs of clinical trials funded by the Patient -Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) . It establishes a subscription model to pay for n ovel antimicrobial drugs, provides federal support for the use of genetic and genomic testing for pediatric patients with rare diseases , and provides Medicare coverage for pharmacogenetic consultations by qualified clinical pharmacists and genetic counselo rs. Additionally, the bill creates a g enerally accepted standard for electronic prescribing and provides clinician -led clinical data registries with access to Medicare claims data for research to improve quality and cost efficiency by linking the data with clinical data in registries. Finally, the bill reauthoriz es the Research Policy Board authorized by the 21 st Century Cures Act. XI. H.R. 6584 , THE \"DIVERSE AND EQUITABLE THE \"DEPICT ACT\" H.R. 6584 Eshoo, Fitzpatrick (R -PA), and Kelly (D-IL), directs the FDA Commissioner to amend certain regulations to increase clinical trial diversity . The bill requires Investigational New Drug (IND) and Investigational Device 5 Exemption (IDE) a pplicants to report clinical trial enrollment targets by demographic subgroup, including age, race, ethnicity, and sex, and provide a rationale for those targets, and to provide a Diversity Action Plan detailing the actions the sponsor will take, such as o utreach and engagement strategies, to reach these enrollment targets. The bill also provides FDA with the authority to mandate post -market studies when sponsors fail to meet diversity enrollment targets and do not provide a sufficient justification. It also requires FDA to publish an annual report aggregating and analyzing the data provided by sponsors on their progress toward and strategies for improving diversity in clinical trials. The bill requires FDA to hold a workshop to assess how sponsors utiliz ed the clinical trial flexibilities initiated during the COVID -19 public health emergency and their impact on improving access to clinical trials in underserved populations . It also provides funding to NIH for community engagement and outreach to increase inclusion of underrepresented minorities in clinical trials and research and provides grant funding to Community Health Centers to increase their capacity to participate in clinical trials and research. XII. H.R. 6888 , THE \" HELPING EXPERTS ACCELERATE ACT OF 2022\" H.R. 6888 , the \"Helping Experts Accelerate Rare Treatments Act of 2022,\" introduced by Reps. Tonko (D -NY) and McKinley (R-WV) , requires the Secretary to submit an annual report summarizing FDA's activities relating to designating, approving, and licensing drugs used to treat rare diseases no later than four years after enactment. The bill also requires the FDA Commissioner to convene one or more public meetings to solicit input from stakeholders regarding approaches to improving engagement with rare disease condition patients , patient groups, and experts. The bill also incorporates experts on the science of small population studies in FDA's existing list of external consultants on rare disease drugs and biologics. XIII. H.R. 6963, THE \"ACCELERATED APPROVAL INTEGRITY ACT OF H.R. 6963, the Accelerating Approval Integrity Act of 2022, introduced by Rep. Pallone (D-NJ), makes several changes to enhance program integrity within the accelerated approval pathway at FDA. The bill would codify requirements for adequate and well -controlled post- approval studies for drugs approved under the program , require studies to be designed prior to approval, and allow FDA to require that post -approval studies be underway at the time o f approval. The bill also streamlines processes to withdraw a drug's approval if post -approval studies are not conducted with due diligence or do not show a clinical benefit. The bill would also require sponsors to publish additional information on a dru g's label if it is approved under accelerated approval and would make failure to conduct studies with due diligence, or failure to report on such studies, a prohibited act subject to monetary penalties. XIV. H.R. 6972, THE \" GIVE KIDS A CHANCE ACT \" H.R. 6972 , the \"Give Kids a Chance Act,\" introduced by Rep s. Butterfield and McCaul (R-TX), would establish additional FDA authorities regarding the conduct of pediatric investigations of molecularly targeted drugs to treat cancer . In current law, FDA is auth orized to require drug sponsors to conduct pediatric investigations of drugs intended to treat adult cancers if the agency determines the drug is directed at a molecular target that is substantially relevant to 6 the growth or progression of pediatric cancer . This legislation would extend FDA's authority to require pediatric studies in certain combination s of drugs . XV. H.R. 6973, THE 6973, the \"Enhanced Access to Affordable Medicines Act,\" introduced by Rep. Carter, would allow new generic drugs to be approved with a different label from the listed (also known as the \"brand\") drug if the generic drug application is otherwise eligible for approval, except that the listed drug has revised its label within 90 da ys of its patent expiring or within 90 days of when a generic drug application is otherwise eligible for approval. The sponsor of the generic drug application granted approval would be required to revise its own label to bring it in line with the updated listed drug label within 60 days of approval. If the listed drug updated its label with respect to drug warnings, the generic drug would not be eligible for approval before updating its own label. XVI. H.R. 6988 , THE \"DRUG MANUFACTURING INNOVATION , the \"Drug Manufacturing Innovation Act,\" introduced by Rep s. Levin (D -CA) and Joyce (R -PA), authorizes the Emerging Technologies Program at FDA, a collaborative program where industry representatives, academics, and others can meet with FDA offi cials \"to discuss and identify potential technical and regulatory issues regarding the development and implementation of a novel technology prior to filing a regulatory submission.\"1 The bill authorizes FDA to make grants to carry out the program , and au thorizes $20 million each year for FY 2023 through FY 2027 to carry out the program. XVII. H.R. 6696, \"ACCELERATING ACCESS FOR \"Accelerating Access for Patients Act\" , introduced by Rep. Rodgers (R - WA), broadens the pathway for accelerated approval by allowing such approvals if the Secretary determines the drug's safety and effectiveness based on the known benefit -risk profile in the intended population, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the disease and t he availability or lack of alternative treatments . Current law requires a determination that the drug is safe for the approved population and has an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical bene fit. The Secretary is required to establish a comprehensive clinical development plan to determine whether a drug is subject to approval under these circumstances, and issue guidance describing criteria, processes, and other considerations for demonstrating t he safety and effectiveness of such a drug. The bill also allows clinical benefit to be proven by means beyond a clinical trial. It also requires an annual report to Congress on the use of RWE in post -approval studies . Finally, the bill requires the Sec retary to submit draft guidance no later than 18 months after the date of enactment and final guidance no later than 18 months after the draft guidance is released. 1 Food and Drug Administration, Emerging Technology Program (Feb. 22, 2022) (www.fda.gov/about THE NATION'S SAFE PHARMECEUTICALS AND EXCIPIENTS BY CREATING TO OLS FOR INSPECTING AND OVERSEEING NEEDED SUPPLIES ACT\" OR THE \"INSPECTIONS ACT\" H.R. 7006, the (R-VA) and Welch (D-VT), would enhance FDA's inspection tools and study when and how they are used . The bill would allow FDA to consider the compliance history of establishments in a country or region as a factor when establishing a schedule for risk -based inspections. It would also allow the Secretary to use any records or other information collected for the purp oses of or in lieu of an inspection to satisfy requirements for a preapproval or risk -based surveillance inspection, including resolving the findings of such inspections, if applicable and appropriate. The bill also allows the recognition of foreign gover nment inspections as sufficient for preapproval inspections if the Secretary has entered into an agreement with that foreign government. Additionally, the bill requires a periodic assessment of whether additional arrangements and agreements with foreign g overnments as allowed in this legislation are appropriate. XIX. H.R. 7008, THE \"PRE -APPROVAL INFORMATION Exchange Act\", introduced by Rep. Guthrie (R-KY), would allow drug and device sponsors to share ce rtain information , including health care economic information, scientific information, and pre-clinical trial results, with health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, formulary committees, and other payors before a drug is approved by FDA and before an ap plication for the drug is submitted to the agency . The information would be required to include a clear statement that the drug or device it discusses has not been approved, and that the safety and efficacy of the drug or device has not been established . Additional required disclosures include information about studies the drug or device is undergoing, how the studies relate to the overall plan for the development of the drug or device, and whether an application for the drug or device has been submitted to FDA and when such submission is planned. XX. H.R. 7032, THE \" INCREASING TRANSPARENCY IN GENERIC DRUG APPLICATIONS ACT OF 2022 \" H.R. 7032 , the \"Increasing Transparency in Generic Drug Applications Act of 2022,\" introduced by Rep . Kuster (D -NH), requires the Secretary to determine whether proposed new generic drugs are qualitatively or quantitatively the same as the listed drug. If it is determined that a proposed drug is not the same as the listed drug, the Secretary must inform the generic drug applicant how the proposed drug differs from the listed drug. The bill also requires the Secretary to publish guidance on the process of determining whether a new drug is qualitatively or quantitatively the same as a listed drug no later than one year after enactment. XXI. H.R. 7035 the \"Biologics Market Transparency Act, \" introduced by Reps. Manning (D - NC) and Hudson (R -NC), amends section 506I of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require prompt reports of marketing status by holders of approved applications for biolog ics and 8 biosimilars products . Specifically, the legislation require s all holders of approved Biologics License Applications (BLA) to conduct a one -time report to confirm that their products listed in the Purple Book are still available for sale. Approved BLA holders must report to the Secretary when withdrawing a product from the market. Similar requirements are already in place for small molecule drugs; this bill would extend the requirements to biologics and biosimilars. XXII. H.R. 7047, A BILL TO AMEND TITLE III OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT WITH RESPECT TO THE DETERMINATION BY THE SECRETARY REGARDING CERTAIN BIOSIMILAR APPLICATION ELEMENTS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES H.R. 7047, a bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act with respect to the determination by the Secretary regarding certain biosimilar application elements, and for other purposes, in troduced by Rep. Schrader (D -OR), would give the Secretary discretion to determine whether it is necessary for a biosimilar product to demonstrate that it has the same strength as that of its reference product. Current law requires that a biosimilar or in terchangeable product demonstrate that the strength of the biological product is the same as th at of the reference product to be granted a license. A reference product is a single biological product already approved by the FDA . XXIII. WITNESSES The following witnesses have been invited to testify: Jeff Allen, Ph .D.
