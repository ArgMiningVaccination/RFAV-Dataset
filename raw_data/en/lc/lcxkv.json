Peter Boone and Simon Johnson1 Abstract Despite likely strong medium-term grow th prospects for many poor countries, there will remain serious pockets of poverty fo r the foreseeable future. People in these pockets are unhealthy, uneducated and low inco me. Interventions to improve health in these pockets, by targeting child mortality, are ap pealing as ways to in crease welfare, and a package of health measures is likely to ha ve more effect than single interventions. Increasing access to education should presumab ly be bundled with health improvements. Robust sustainable delivery mechanisms also need to be established. Research design should move towards testing the plausible set of ideas in this regard, sometimes implemented as packages of measures rath er than single interv entions, using the high standards of medical science. Still, it remains unclear if improving h ealth and education by themselves will substantially eliminate thes e pockets of poverty. We also need an appropriate experimental research design that will ex amine the effect of adding to the bundle of interventions a variety of mo re direct measures that c ould increase pr oductivity.

BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 2 \"The only things that matter in this fall en world are transportation and sanitation.\" -- Rudyard Kipling, 19132 I. Introduction By the early 1960s, there was a great se nse of progress and optimism among both epidemiologists and economists. Both felt that they had tied major breakthroughs in their respective fundamental sciences to the pres sing problems of the contemporary world. And both saw strong evidence that they had cr eated plausible policy \"levers\" that could be adjusted so as to improve people's liv es and increase prospe rity around the world. Much of this positive view in both professions was justified. For example, the progress over the past 50 year s in terms of lowering the burde n of infectious disease is undeniable. And during the same time span, a substantial number of countries have experienced sustained growth, reaching pr eviously unprecedented levels of GDP per capita. One could argue that the applied public health progress was more as directly intended; new drugs, vaccines, and - most importantly - innovati ons in national and international delivery systems have had pr ofound effects in term s of increasing life expectancy and reducin g ill-health. Economics, without doubt, has experienced more mis-steps, particularly in terms of policy recommendations or \"interventions\" suggested and funded for low income countries. Bill Easterly's (2001) aptly titled book, The Elusive Quest for Growth , makes this point in compelling detail. 3 And Dani Rodrik is of 2 Quoted in Anderson (2006), first page of introduction. 3 Rosenstein-Rodan's (1961) for ecasts of capital requirements and growth implications for \"underdeveloped\" countries might be seen as the high tide of incautious optimism about the preciseness of our knowledge about economics. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 3course right to worry that the evidence on policies that work in any measurable cross- country sense is still uncomfortably weak.4 Yet, seen in the bigger picture, the fall of communism and the closely associated intellectual defeat (or substantial retreat) of the idea that the state and its bureaucrats should run a large part of the economy, can r easonably be attributed in part to modern economic thinking.5 The state, and the elite that contro ls it, is far from finished as an economic actor, but the idea that state-ow ned firms will predominate is long gone.6 And it is the consequent economic rise of both India and China th at sets the stage for the next 20 years of global economic growth.7 No doubt there will be (and perhaps even are today) bumps in the road, but a ma jor transformation of the global division of labor started 20 years ago - even if we only now recognize the profound consequences.8 This transformation was, of course, made possible by a revolution in \"transportation,\" meaning the cost of moving goods and services, which began for goods with containerized shipping in the early 1960s and spread to se rvices through the information technology innovations of the 1980s and 1990s. This transformation is as profound and 4 For anyone feeling that there are easy answers or that outsiders can drop in with previously overlooked solutions, Rodrik's webpage and blog are appropriate antidotes: http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~drodrik/ . His views remind us of the mid-19th century pessimism about the effectiveness of medicine, known as \"therapeutic nihilism\" (Shorter, 2006). Much of that pessimism, and its associated emphasis on the need for more careful study of the fundamentals, of course turned out to be justified. 5 The debate over the Washington Consensus and the apparent concern that this was in some sense inappropriate, not applied or did not work (e.g., Spen ce et al 2008) seems to miss the point. The Consensus (and the underlying ideas that long predated it) prevailed in broad terms against the alternatives, and countries that figured out how to apply an appropriate version of this Consensus are now driving global growth (Johnson, Ostry and Subramanian 2007). 6 The rise of Sovereign Wealth Funds suggests that th e state may be \"back\" as a global creditor. More generally, of course, there are vast resources controlled by elites in many countries - whether these elites accept the label of \"state-\" anything on their activities is largely irrelevant. What matters is the nature, purpose and operation of political connections. 7 Seen in terms of direct economic consequences for the global economy, the fall of the Soviet bloc was a side show; with the major issue, s till unresolved, being exactly how this will affect the provision of oil and gas to the world market. The former Soviet empire is in demographic decline and was never more than 300m people to start with. India and China have close to 3bn people between them. 8 On the consequences of globalization, see International Monetary Fund (2007a and 2007b). On the difficulty of anticipating precise bumps in the road, see Berg, Ostry and Zettelmeyer (2008). BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 4as irreversible as any other major wave of intertwined technological and social innovations. The rapid growth of India and China, bot h in terms of wealth and human capital, will pull along even the poorest re gions. The rise of India an d China has already reversed a decades long decline in commodity pri ces, opening up opportunities in Africa and poorer Asian countries for major investment. The same rise will also change labor markets, encouraging the movement of lo w-value added industries to lower wage countries, and offering Africa and other part s of Asia the opportunity to become low value added manufacturing and service bases in the future.9 Yet this transformation and the associated rise of prosperity in what were, until recently, relatively remote and low productiv ity parts of the world undoubtedly leaves some people behind. It is therefore reasonable to expect that countri es previously known as \"poor\" will be host to regions of high income (close to industrial country averages or higher) and other, smaller pocke ts of extreme poverty. This paper focuses on what could make a s ubstantial difference to people living in these potential pockets. The market is un likely to reach down and lift them up anytime soon. In part, this is because they do not have access to high quality public goods, particularly health care. \"Int erventions\" that improve health could make a big difference, but only if (a) we understand more how about to package health and education interventions, and (b) there are ways to also provide pot entially productiv ity enhancing 9 The evidence already suggests strongly that there are no insu rmountable obstacles to Africa's development (Johnson, Ostry, and Subramanian, 2006). The key is finding ways to integrate with the global economy that are robust to internal and external shocks. On this, substantial progress has been made, but the jury will remain out at least until we see what happens when there is a large negative shock to these countries' terms of trade (International Monetary Fund, 2008). BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 5interventions. Point (a) is essential and al so attainable. Point (b) may or may not be potentially essential, and it remains unclear whether it is attainable. Section II explains the present and future for pockets of poverty in broad terms, based on what we observe in India. If we accept there should an agenda to reduce pockets of poverty, we need to think very clearly about how to channel help to the people that need it most. Secti on III reviews what we know a bout the political economy why pockets exist a nd persist. Since what works and doesn't work in interventions is a vast topic, we concentrate here on evidence regarding a narro wer topic: how to reduce child deaths in pockets of poverty? This is an area wher e some success has already been achieved. Clinicians often argue that we already know how to drama tically reduce child deaths; however, closer scrutiny reveals there is a grea t deal of uncertainty. Section IV discusses the methodological issues and suggests one wa y to make further progress; this is somewhat at odds with the relatively new st andard approach in development economics. We then consider the potential poverty imp act of reducing child deaths and argue in Section V that this can be substantial a nd should be pursued. Section VI reviews the available evidence on what works and what doesn't, but also highlights what we don't know - and how we can address that. Section VII suggests that the ke y to delivery is to build private services that largely bypass th e public sector. If designed appropriately, these should be sustainable. At the same time, in Section VIII, we caution that the available macroeconomic evidence suggests improved child health may not necessarily raise per capita incomes and reduce poverty. While there may be some \"e nd-runs\" around this problem, including BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 6through migration, we remain concerned that th ere is not yet an integrated agenda to define, test and implement packages that include direct measur es that will raise productivity and reduce poverty. Our conclusion is that we probably can dr amatically improve health, and possibly speed poverty decline, in the pockets of poverty, but to ge t there we also need to implement new research strategi es and evaluation methodologies. This is likely to be prove more effective and more sustainable that a strategy of \"just do it.\" The best evidence today comes from well-designed rando mised controlled trials, however, as we discuss below, the existing evidence derived from these has important methodological and strategic shortcomings when analysing how to reduce child deaths. Fortunately, the nature of pockets of poverty is such that they lend themselves to well-designed randomised controlled tria ls where broad packages of interventions could easily be tested against status-quo or alternativ es; Section IX lays explains our work in progress in this regard. Section X concludes that the advent of more testing and experimentation with these packages may mean we will soon (within 20 years?) learn the best routes to rapidly end pockets of poverty. II. Pockets Defined During the next 20 years, we can expect the pattern of poverty and poor health around the world to change dramatically. Th e days where large nations suffer massive extreme poverty, such as the times of famine in Bangladesh and India, are certainly BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 7gone.10 The reality today is that pot-bellied ma lnourished children are very rare, and in twenty years they should be almost unheard of.11 This change in the pattern of poverty ha s important ramifications for development assistance. We believe the pattern of poverty observed in I ndia today will be representative of many poor nations.12 Despite rapid growth and improvements in health and education, many regions and communities in India still suffer poverty similar to the worst areas of sub-Saharan Africa. For exampl e, the state of Bihar has a child mortality rate similar to Malawi, with 12% of children dying before the age of five, while in urban Andhra Pradesh child mortality is one third that level. If you drive three hours due west of wealthy Hyderabad neighborhoods, you find v illages where 6% of children die at birth, and schools and public he alth services hardly functi on. Within these communities lower caste families and tribal areas are even worse off. The education system has similar discrepa ncies. In urban areas children attend public or private schools and many young adults achieve standards equivalent to averages in wealthy nations. However, smaller towns and many villages have schools that hardly function. For example, today in India, desp ite high official enrolment rates, 33% of children in grades 3-5 are unable to read text at the level of a grade 1 student, and even more are unable to do simple subtra ction (Pratham (2007), Sathe (2005)). 10 We recognize that measured progress towards poverty reduction has been uneven (Chen and Ravallion 2007); in fact, this is part of our point. We are also aware that some countries may impose terrible burdens on their people, for example through creating agricultu ral production disasters or refusing to allow outside support in the case of catastrophe. Amartya Sen's insight on the incompatibility of democracy and famine continues to hold. 11 The World Food Program, World Bank and others are no doubt correct to emphasize there is in 2008 a new food crisis and this may push back anti-poverty progress by 10 years. Our view is that a supply response will be forthcoming, as seen after every ot her surge in commodity prices. We also see gains for many low income countries coming exactly from higher commodity prices. But it is true that changing terms of trade, if persistent, may deepen (and perhaps move the location of) the pockets of poverty we focus on below. It is certainly unlikely to eliminate the issue. 12 The pattern in China may be more similar than is commonly thought. But the data are much less good, so we confine ourselves to India as the plausible benchmark. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 8We believe this change in the map of poverty has critical ramifications for the design and use of aid programs that aim to improve people's lives. While we can reasonably anticipate that tric kle down will eventually make most groups better off, it may take many generations to remove the poc kets of extreme poverty. This delay has many costs. For some people it will simply mean they die early in childhood, where they otherwise might not have. For those children that survive, they will receive very poor education. Recent neurological and behaviour al studies suggest human brains have a critical period of development during childhood. Children who miss out on early stimulation and education may ultimately be worse off mentally and socially, and these losses appear irreversible. So by ignoring the problems today, we condemn the current generation of children to some perm anent neurological disabilities. The existence of these large pockets of poverty has potential costs for rich countries, including the United St ates and European nations, a nd for local neighbors. In order to limit the development and spread of di sease, such as Asian bird flu or AIDS, we need good monitoring systems and effective na tional programs. Since poor regions are generally \"dysfunctional\" in these areas, th ey can become long term incubating grounds for disease. They will certainly host and maintain a human reservoir of existing infectious diseases such as malaria, maki ng it necessary to develop new treatments as resistance builds, and preventing any clos ely connected regions from permanently resolving disease. This change in the map of poverty also has important ramifications for how aid agencies with a moral agenda to reduce pove rty should function. We need to recognize that inhabitants of these pocke ts of poverty will often be outcasts and weak groups of the BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 9political system, so funding and programs di rected through governments to improve the poor's lot will probably fail. If we cannot turn these \"outca st\" regions into insiders, we should not expect central governments to truly use resources to make these regions rise up to be more nearly equal to more privileged areas. III. Why do Pockets of Poverty Exist? We define pockets of poverty as regi ons in extreme poverty, where the basic services needed to preserve and build hu man capital are poor or non-existent, so that child mortality is high and literacy rates are low. Unfortunately, there are no reliable, comprehensive surveys that allow us to calcu late the population in such regions, but the numbers would certainly be in the hundreds of millions. 13 Figure 1 shows the international pattern of child deaths, plotting child mortality against log GDP per capita. As we discuss be low, child deaths are highly correlated with education and income, along with provision of public services, so they are probably good proxies for general failure to promote human capital. These national statistics hide very large variation within countries. Northern st ates of India, such as Bihar, have child mortality rates similar to western Africa. The rural rates of child de aths in India average 30-50% higher than urban rates. Even in the better off states, services to tribal populations and other \"outsiders \" are generally extremely poor.14 Despite India's rapidly growing wealth, su ch pockets of poverty are widespread. There are many reasons why they persist in In dia, and are likely to become the standard 13 According to World Bank (2008a and b) estimates 2.7bn people live with less than $2 income per day (in 2001). Most of these people probably live in regions where health and education function poorly. 14 In a baseline survey of 144,000 women ahead of a randomized controlled trial in tribal regions of Andhra Pradesh, not far from Hyderabad, we found 6% of children died before one month of age in 2007. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 10in poor African nations and othe r poor nations as they too be come wealthier. One reason is the interaction of family environmen t and geography in any economic system. Children with illiterate parents who have not benefited from economic change need to break with their parent's gene ration. Their ability and desi re to do this will depend on many factors, but it is natural to imagine th at isolated regions, or specific ethnic and religious groups, will naturally integrate less quickly with the changes around them. This may due to choice, but often, esp ecially for the children, it is not.15 A second reason is the inherent nature of capitalist politics and interests. While rapid economic growth probably trickles down to all eventually, people with wealth concentrate in urban areas. They tend to ultimately control political power, and they demand good private services for themselv es, or they demand the government make services available to them. This naturally l eads to a concentration of the best public and private services in wealthy areas.16 Migration to urban areas may be a solution, but if remote villages have not provided decent health and education to children, the migrants may not be well-placed to succeed in urban areas, and this could slow the migration process. Third, in some instances we observe a tyranny of some groups over other groups. In the tribal regions of Indi a, low caste groups, Muslims, a nd others have historically faced prejudice from all levels of authority. It will take decades to truly change the ability of these peoples to fully benefit from rapid growth, and to pull some communities out of their current extreme poverty. If polit ical power is based in part on oppression 15 Sachs (2005) stresses the importance of geography. People living near water, rail links and good roads will be better able to benefit from the coming growth than those people living in more remote regions with poor transport. 16 This is a version of \"urban bias,\" but not exactly the versions in Lipton (1977) or Bates (1981). BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 11through ill-health, then there will be pow erful opposition to sensible interventions by outsiders.17 Our impression is that this is a re latively small consideration in most areas, although there can definitely be a backlash if local notables feel that outsiders are organizing relatively poor people for political action. Finally, even when there is public or private demand for health and education services, there can be other obstacles to regular provision of such services. Collier et al (2003) calculate that on average, nations in s ub-Saharan Africa experienced civil conflict once every six years during the last half century. This makes long term investment and regular supply of health, education, infrastr ucture, private business, etc., difficult to maintain. The problems that stem from co mmunities with differe nt ethnic, religious, tribal, and other backgrounds living close toge ther means that such problems will persist and those regions may be poor for a very long time. We cannot quantify the relative importance of these rival explanations in general or how they are balanced across different locations. In gene ral, our qualitative assessment from practical experience is that pockets of poverty exist primarily because they are neglected by the elites with power a nd by the groups that have effective voice. It is neglect, rather than a sini ster conspiracy of oppression, th at means relatively isolated people do not have access to decent health care or education. As a result, it is possible for outsiders to offer such services without generating adverse poli tical reaction or the development of some other means of oppression. 17 The value to the elite of continued ill-health and denial of health care for the poor is one element of \"structural violence\" emphasized by Paul Farmer (2004). No doubt he is right for many situations and this may provide a convincing mechanism supporting the finding that \"inequality\" is bad for the poor, e.g., Ravallion 2005, but we don't (yet at least) see compelling evidence that this implies a general first order constraint on effective health interventions - again, Farmer's own medical work suggests these are possible even in the most difficult circumstances. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 12IV. What Constitutes Good Evidence? There is a remarkable difference between the evidence considered acceptable to justify development policies and the eviden ce needed to gain regulatory approval for simple drugs. Since one of our goals is to examine the existing evidence, we first start with a framework analysing th e quality of evidence. The gold standard for evidence in the me dical literature is a well-designed randomised controlled trial. Table 1 illustrate s the phases of development and associated types of evidence necessary to get a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Phase 1 and 2 are early stages in which initial evidence on safety and efficacy is gathered. The key necessary step for approval is Phase 3. Here drug companies must pre-specify the design a nd analysis in one or more randomised controlled trials, which are sufficient to de monstrate efficacy of the drug in a setting similar to public use post-approval. The rules for design of randomised trials have evolved over many decades, and they are structured to limit the scope for investigator and selection bias. In general, the published evidence today in the economics literature - as well as much of the public health literature - would be classified as phase 2 information in medical science. Creative s econdary analysis of randomis ed experiments, e.g., Miguel and Kremer (2004), of course can provide va luable insights into optimal project design, and add substantially to understanding of th e impact of interventions outside of the primary analysis. But the view in medical science is that re trospective analysis of surveys and other data is subject to substantial investigator and selection bias, and so would never satisfy BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 13strict criteria needed for demonstrating e fficacy of a drug. The advent of randomised evaluations in economics without doubt grea tly improves the quality of available evidence, but these would not be considered well-designed randomise d controlled trials in the medical community, due to the lack of pre-specification of primary and secondary endpoints, no pre-specified statistical an alysis plan, multiple endpoints, use of non- testable hypotheses to analyse trial re sults, emphasis on somewhat complicated regression analysis rather than simpler trial designs, etc.18 The statistical importance of the quality of information can be readily seen from success in drug trials. Approximately 70% of drugs that make it to human trials advance to Phase 2 trials. Of those that succeed in phase 2, approximately 60% ultimately succeed during phase 3 trials; across therapeuti c categories, this conditional success rate ranges from 39% to 83%. Hence approximately 40% of drugs which appear likely to be effective after phase 2 are la ter rejected during phase 3 (D anzon, Nicholson, and Pereira 2005). These numbers probably understate the tr ue failure rate of phase 2 information since many drugs that enter phase 3 are base d on previously appr oved products, such as different dosing regimes for pain reli ef ingredients already approved. Unfortunately, when designing programs to reduce child deaths, there is limited evidence available from well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Such trials 18 See, for example, the Consolidat ed Statement of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) regard ing transparent reporting of trials and trial design ( www.consort-statement.org ); this has been endorsed by most leading medical journals. These rules reflect accrued consensu s in medical science over the last several decades reflecting a long history of failures and successes in trial design. The rules continue to evolve but in general are becoming increasingly strict. Randomised evaluations in the economics literature typically fail two key tests: pre-specification of the primary endpoint, and pre-specification of the analysis plan. In medical trials, any secondary findings, i.e. all those th at are not the pre-specified primary analysis of the primary endpoint, are judged to be exploratory and must be confirmed by at least one further dedicated trial. This strict focus on pre-specification reduces the risk of investigator bias, since investigators can otherwise pick and choose analysis strategies and end points to find significant results which in reality may be spurious. See Altman, Schulz et al (2001). BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 14are primarily limited to clinical settings where existing and new drugs are tested or community settings where very specific interventions, such as hand-washing, are introduced. As discussed below, these trials help us understand which ingredients should be used in health packages to limit child deaths, but they do not tell us much about the best means to ensure services are received by children that need them . Another flaw with these trials is that they rarely have all-cau se mortality as a prim ary endpoint, and instead target specific diseases or conditions. So, for example, although we may learn that hand washing reduces diarrhea, we cannot be sure what impact it ultimately has on mortality unless we know the exact relation between ch anges in diarrhea incidence and changes in child deaths.19 The second available body of evidence de rives from household surveys. These are far less costly than trials to implement, and they can collect substantial information for analysis. This gives them the advantag e that they can be large enough to examine mortality outcomes with sufficient statistical power to capture impor tant relationships. However, since we can never be confident that these relationships are causal rather than spurious or biased, the results n eed to be treated with caution. Given the limited evidence base, as discu ssed in the next two sections below, there will always be major uncertainties su rrounding the impact of any potential package of measures. Should we be w illing to risk embarking on pol icies that have only phase 2 levels of evidence, and arguably, there mi ght well be a 20-60% chance that we are 19 For example, Luby et al (2005) found hand-washin g with soap reduced diarrhea incidence in Karachi slums. Despite this finding, there was no clear trend towards lower mortality in the intervention arm of the trial. The trial was not powered to measure mortalit y, and this was not a primary endpoint. If we are designing packages to reduce child d eaths, and not just child morbidity, we need to assume that the reduced diarrhea will actually lead to lower deaths. However, there is no evidence which would permit us to define the relation between the lowered diarrhea incidence and mortality. The trials examining the impact of impregnated bednets were more convincing since they were designed with all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint (Keiser et. al. (2005)). BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 15wrongly concluding they are effective when they are not? Poole (1970) argues that, when the impact of alternative policies is unc ertain, the optimal res ponse is to prefer policies for which we have greatest cert ainty. This argument suggests we should generally focus active policy on areas where we have evidence from well-designed RCTs wherever possible. We believe the available evidence points us in a clear direction, which we explain below, but it would be dangerous to assume we can succeed without more experimentation and rigorous analysis. Well designed trials which ex amine the impact of packages of health interventi ons, in combination with crea tive secondary analysis based on techniques used in randomised experiment s, would be an important addition to the evidence base. We stress: there really is not yet sufficient evidence to give us sufficient confidence regarding how to sharply reduce child deaths in pockets of poverty. V. Clinical Evidence: Tw enty-three Measures that Coul d Dramatically Reduce Child Deaths The Bellagio Child Survival Group, a team of leading medical experts, was assembled by The Lancet in 2003 in order to assemble and judge current evidence regarding how to reduce the 10 million annual child deaths in low income countries. Figure 2 shows their main findings (Bryce et al (2003 and 2005), Darmstadt et. al. (2005)). They concluded that 90% coverage of 23 simple measures could reduce child deaths by 63%, saving six million lives per year . The three single largest measures (oral rehydration therapy, breast-feedi ng, and insecticide treated bed nets) can all be conducted at home, with little or no cost, and they would prevent 35% of child deaths. They BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 16recommended a public outreach program be cr eated, with frequent home visits by nurses, to ensure that children and pregnant mother s received the remaining interventions. At first glance it would seem reasonable to simp ly take these measures and implement them in \"pockets of poverty\" to improve child hea lth. However, before doing so several issues need to be considered. First, while the clinical evidence derives from single experiments, bringing down child deaths needs the implem entation of a package of meas ures. Trials with single interventions cannot tell us how the same in terventions would work in a package. For example, consider the relative importance of bednets and anti-malarials in Figure 2. There is very good evidence that use of ins ecticide treated bednets reduces all-cause mortality for children in moderate and hi gh malaria incidence regions of Africa.20 There is also very good evidence, e.g. see Muta bingwa et al (2005), that timely use of artemisinin-based therapies resolve virtually all malaria in Africa, and with second line treatments nearly all malaria deaths could be prevented. Therefore bed nets and drug therapy are potential substitutes, and if you could manage to cover the population with good clinical services and ear ly malaria recognition, you may find that bed nets have little additional impact.21 You would also find that the re servoir of malaria declines, so that eventually malaria disappears from the population if it is trea ted quickly and fully. Since there are few well-designed trials th at examine the impact of a package of measures in order to understa nd such interactions, the Bellagio team had to make guesses 20 There is also a strong case for distributing bed nets free of charge (e.g., Cohen and Dupas 2007). 21 The issue is of course far more complicated. Th e WHO recommends all cases of fever be treated as presumptive malaria. This may increase resistance and can be costly in regions where non-malarial fevers are common. The use of impregnated bed nets could reduce the frequency and cost of treatments and may also reduce development of resistance if the reduced incidence of disease slows resistance. Some of these complications could be better understood or modelled if we ran trials with packages of interventions and compared outcomes of alternative packages where we excluded specific ingredients. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 17as to the relative importance of bednets and antimalarials when deriving Figure 2. They had to also do this for many other interventions that could be complements or substitutes. In fact, there is very little reliable evidence to guide them, apart from personal experience and guesswork. A second issue that needs to be addresse d ahead of practical implementation is cost effectiveness. The Bellagio group did not explicitly consider cost effectiveness, but rather limited themselves to choosing major interventions for which there was evidence that a substantial number of lives could be saved.22 If we could estimate costs, and the interactions between different interventions, we could theoretically solve an optimization problem to determine the best package of measures subject to a budget constraint. This could well lead to measures other than those discussed by the Bellagio group - for example we might remove substitutes but aim for greater coverage of complements. In practice, the cost effectiveness of these interventions is a relatively minor issue. Each of these interventions is fairly inexpe nsive on its own, while th e bulk of any health budget will be made up of quasi-fixed costs su ch as personnel and transportation costs for outreach and general implementation.23 The only expensive inte rvention would be water and sanitation infrastructure. The Bellagi o group estimated that water and sanitation would reduce child deaths by just 3% and ye t cost 16% of the overall budget for the program (Bryce et. al 2005). If we took into a ccount cost effectivene ss, we may prefer to 22 Bryce et. al. (2005) calculated th e cost of implementing the 23 recommended measures with universal coverage in 42 countries responsible for 90% of deaths at $5.1bn per year in 2002 dollars. 23 For example, the spring 2008 cost of a package of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) is $0.10. A single child's course of the anti-bacterial co-trimoxazole is $0 .50, and a child's course of the anti-malarial coartim is $0.90. If chloroquine can be used instead of coar tem, the cost falls to $0.20 . These are the three main treatments that children would need from age one month to five years. They are likely to have 3-4 bouts of symptoms of each disease during one year. The need for treatment however will depend on the course of the disease. If we assume two treatments for each di sease per year, the cost of providing drugs to all children in the low income countries studied by the Bellagio group would be just $0.6bn per year. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 18remove water and sanitation infrastructure in order to increase spe nding on areas related to hygiene and behaviour change which could be cheaper and as effective (Luby et. al (2005), Curtis et. al. (2003)). The final issue is the one where we have the greatest concern. The Bellagio group recommended achieving 90% coverage of th ese interventions th rough public outreach programs in communities. They called for $5.1bn support from national governments to hire nurses, provide them with transportation, and arrange fr equent community visits to households with children. This is surprisi ng because outreach programs have been tried in many regions of the world, including ma ny extremely poor regions, and very often failed. The Bellagio group made this recomm endation without referr al to well-designed studies that would back up thei r assertion that this could wo rk. Nor did they discuss the constraints that today prevent such programs from being successful. VI. Survey Evidence on How to Reduce Child Deaths The measures listed in Figure 2 are not breakthrough science, and nor are they a hard and fast recipe. There are many nations and communities in very poor regions which managed to substantially reduce child mortality long before the Bellagio study was completed, and before the clinical measures listed there were ever tested. 24 The Bellagio study group confirms there are no \"missing drugs \", and we can dramatically reduce child mortality at low cost with existing technologies. However, there is one major piece 24 The former Soviet Union, Cuba, the Indian state of Kerala, Costa Rica, Vietnam and China are all well- known cases of good child health despite relatively low incomes (and pockets of poverty). There are also smaller community-based projects, as in Arole and Arole (1994), which appear to have achieved impressive results despite extreme poverty, although no well-designed studies have verified this achievement. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 19missing: we still do not know how to ensure populations get these interventions in the sustained manner (over a decade or more) neces sary to dramatically reduce child deaths. In this section we focus on two key issues . First, what should be the mechanism for ensuring that children get the treatments listed above? Second, si nce it is frequently argued we need to build up the public health sector to lower mortality, is there evidence suggesting we should favour either the public or private sector? Figure 3 outlines the general stages th at children pass through when they eventually die from disease. The first stage is to be exposed to a ri sk, such as a virus or bacterial infection, or possibly an unsafe practice during birth. If the risk manifests itself in disease, some action by people close to the child will be taken. This is usually the parents, and it could mean the child is given a medicine or taken to a clinic; or perhaps nothing at all happens. If the child is taken to a clinic, then he/she can either be treated effectively or not effectively. In order to die, a child generally passes through each of these steps, so a child death can be thought of as the conditional probability of passing through each step without resolving the diseas e. To reduce the proba bility of death we can target each stage. There have been numerous studies using survey data that have attempted to examine the relative importance of different interventions, househol d characteristics, and other factors that impact child deaths. One of the richest sources of information is the Demographic Health Survey Database (DHS ). This survey includes answers to questionnaires from women of fertile age, household heads, and village leaders, and records birth and child survival histories, education levels, wealth measures, and other household and village indicators. The DHS also records recent disease symptoms of BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 20children that match WHO criteria for suspecte d malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea. These are the three main causes of post-neonatal child deaths. The combined survey data covers 278,000 child survival records and 20,000 clusters. Boone and Zhan (2006) constructed i ndexes to proxy for treatment seeking behaviour, morbidity levels, wealth, educati on, distance to clinics and access to safe water and sanitation. Their \"tre atment seeking\" indicator wa s constructed using principal component analysis across a range of measures, which demonstrate whether a mother tended to seek modern treatments for her ch ild's health but which were not directly correlated with survival of the child. These measures included the mother's antenatal and delivery care, and child vaccinations near birt h that protect against diseases from which there is very little or no child mortality. Boone and Zhan then specified household and community level logistic regression equations to examine if post-neonatal child deaths could be predicted by this treatment indicator and other right hand si de variables. The main results from this survey are pictured in Figure 4. The figure shows the predicted impact of alternative interventions on all-cau se child mortality in the 45 countries where DHS data is available. For example, if all households had access to improved sanitation and water, child mortality is predicted to fall by 3%. The small predicted decline in mortality reflects the fact that approximately half the households in the survey already had improved water and sanitation, and the general finding that this variable was insignificant with a small coefficient in the estimated regression equations. The remaining exercises calculated here were to: (i) raise the estimated treatment indicator in each households to the average leve l in Egypt (Egypt had the median level of the 45 countries in the sample), (ii) raise schooling to the average leve l in Egypt (eight BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 21years for boys and six years for girls), and (iii ) reduce by half the morbidity levels in each survey cluster of roughly 50 households. The findings from these survey data shoul d be treated with caution. As opposed to well-designed randomised controlled trials , we cannot assume these relations reflect causality, and there may be confounding factors which were not adequa tely controlled for that could bias results. There are also problems with measurement error and other potential biases. However, the data show potentially informative correlations, and the DHS has the advantage of covering a large number of households across most of the countries and regions where we would be like ly to implement policies to reduce extreme poverty. With these caveats, the results in Figure 4 show similar findings to the Bellagio child survival group and other surveys. In particular, the impact of improved water and sanitation appears empirically small. Clas en et al (2007) completed a meta-study analysing impact from water and sanitation tr ials and found that wh ile there was evidence that they reduced disease, there was no cr edible evidence that they reduced all-cause mortality. This evidence contrasts with Cutle r and Miller (2005) w ho argue the advent of public water and sanitation services in the Un ited States can explain a large reduction in population death rates around 100 years ago. It seems plausible that the much wider coverage of water and sanitation today, along wi th the advent of vaccines and treatments for the main causes of death from infectious disease, mean that further improvements in water and sanitation are no longer necessary or very significant to eliminate remaining deaths. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 22There was a very weak correlation be tween reported morbidity and child mortality. On average, in pockets of povert y, children suffer 1-4 bouts each of diarrhea, fever, and cough with rapid breathing each year.25 If a large difference in morbidity rates did explain the differences in mortality acr oss countries, then we would expect these morbidity indicators to play a more important role explaining cross-country differences in deaths. We take this weak correlation as suggesting a ppropriate treatment for sick children is more important than preventing children from becoming ill in low income countries. However, since the data on morbid ity may be biased due to mother's recall (Manesh et al, 2008), and the pr evalence of disease reflects only the previous two weeks from the day of the survey, rather than the history over which the mo ther's child survival data is taken, measurement error and othe r sources of bias could be driving this relationship. 26 Figure 4 also illustrates that the \"treatme nt\" indicator used in Boone and Zhan proved highly significant, implying that ch ildren living in households where mothers sought out antenatal care and early childhood va ccines were far less li kely to die in the post-neonatal stage, despite the fact that thes e factors have little direct impact on post neonatal survival odds. This finding is not su rprising - it is consistent with the Bellagio study since both imply that increased coverage of modern treatments will substantially reduce child deaths.27 25 These three sets of symptoms are considered suffi cient for presumptive treat ment for diarrhea (using ORS), malaria (coartem or other anti-malarial) and pneumonia (co-trimoxazole) according to World Health Organization (2006) Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines. 26 For example, the strong role of parent's education may reflect their ability to reduce disease prevalence, so the impact of lower morbidity may be better captured in the regressions through the parent's education. 27 The treatment indicator was calculated using the first principle component from indicators of antenatal care, place of delivery and BCG vaccinations. None of these should directly impact whether a child survives if they survived to one month of age. The de pendent variable in these regressions is survival from one month of age to five years of age. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 23However, there is one major difference between the survey findings and the Bellagio study. A common finding in most studies using survey data is that parental education is an important pred ictor for child survival. In Boone and Zhan, similar to other studies, combined maternal and paternal years of scho oling was a highly significant and empirically important predictor for su rvival outcomes. Since Boone and Zhan controlled for wealth in their regressions, this probably reflects the greater health knowledge of educated parents. More educated pare nts are probably better able to treat disease at home, and more likely to seek out care in clinics and hospitals as needed. The Bellagio Study group made no exp licit mention of improving parents' education or their health knowledge as an im portant intervention. One reason they left this out is that, at the time of their study, they did not find cr edible evidence that raising a parent's health knowledge, or providing gene ral education to parents, impacted child survival. However, a further reason is that health professionals generally prefer to separate delivery from interv entions, with the implicit or explicit assumption that public health services will find means to provide in terventions. This is reasonable in certain cases, but often the delivery method is closel y bundled with the type of treatment or intervention. For example, when choosing between a one-time vaccine and treatment for an infectious disease, there are good reasons to think we would be far more successful with vaccines. Vaccination campaigns have be en carried out regularly in regions which otherwise receive virtually no health care. Medical trials cannot indicate whether your implementation method is feasible unless they are conducted with that purpose in mind in the regions which are relevant. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 24The risk that the Bellagio team takes by not including parent's education in a package of measures may actually be very large. Recent neurological studies have confirmed the very intuitive understanding that a love for one's child is probably a highly potent mechanism for ensuring child surviv al. In a functional MRI scanning study, mothers shown pictures of their own children demonstrated greater neurological activity in reward zones of the brain compared to mo thers shown pictures of children that they knew, but were not their own (Bartels and Zeki, 2004). This natu ral biological link arguably makes parents the single best agent to ensure their child survives during her first few risky years of life. Since parents make the crucial first decisions regarding antenatal care, location and type of deliv ery, recognition of symp toms of disease, and the choice of treatment, they are potentially a major agen t for change, or a factor that can prevent change, when targeting child mortality reduc tion. Indeed, if we embarked on a program without sufficiently working with parents to change behaviour, we might not succeed despite making available a ll 23 interventions highlight ed in the Bellagio study. Despite the logical importance of this channel and the potential for it to be a necessary ingredient in a package to reduce child deaths, there is surprisingly little evidence from randomised controlled trials m easuring the potential fo r better educating parents to limit child deaths. One recent st udy does suggest the potential is large. Manandhar et al. (2005) compared the imp act of organizing wo men's participatory discussion groups in rural regions of Nepal, with control regions where no discussion groups were introduced. The groups discusse d safe delivery, pregna ncy and care of the neonate. They found that neonatal deaths in the intervention regions were 28% lower than in the control region after two years. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 25There is good evidence that parents are not very knowledgeable about health. For example, there is a great deal of variation in maternal knowledge regarding the use of fluids to prevent diarrhea. Children su ffering from diarrhea can quickly die from dehydration, so it is important to provide a dditional fluids in orde r to prevent death. Figure 5 shows that approximately 1/3 of Indian mothers believe fluids should be withdrawn from a child with diarrhea. This in dicator is highly correlated with actual child mortality rates in each state. These problems are similar throughout Afri ca although they vary by disease. In a recent health knowledge survey we conducte d in rural Guinea-Bissau, only 16% of 600 parents interviewed had ever heard of pneumonia, although pneumonia is probably responsible for 1/3 of postneonatal child deat hs in rural Guinea-Bissau. This contrasts sharply with a survey at a clinic in Nige ria where 61% of women attending the clinic knew that difficulty breathing is a sy mptom of pneumonia (Uwaezuoke 2002). It may be unlikely, but it is plausible parental educa tion could be both necessary and sufficient to dramatically reduce ch ild deaths. If we examine Figure 2, approximately 35% of the gains are due to factors which can be implemented at home, such as breastfeeding, using impregnated bed ne ts, and treating diarrhea with ORS. Such measures have no financial burden on the public sector and no need for clinics or pharmacies. Behavior change alone should permit these gains. The remaining interventions can be divide d into those that can be implemented with simple drugs in the community or at home, and those which requir e a visit to a clinic or a health professional. In reality, only a small fraction of the lives saved actually require a clinic, and these clin ics do not need to be in th e public sector. Our next BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 26question is therefore whether there is clea r evidence favoring public or private clinics when trying to improve health in pockets of poverty. VII. Public versus Private Delivery of Health Services There is a general bias in the health prof ession to promote public care over private systems in low income countries. The WHO's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health argued that a large public sector build-out was needed because the private sector could not be relied on to provide equitable, affordable services sufficient to reduce mortality. However, they did not present em pirical evidence to justify this argument.28 The public sector today provides inadequate services, suffers from corruption, and better serves wealthier political elites than th e poor. It is an em pirical question as to whether public or private services will ulti mately perform better to help pockets of poverty, and this undoubtedly also depends upon the specific local circumstances, so there may be no right solution for any region (Bustreo, F., A. Hard ing, et al. (2003)). There is substantial variation in the size of the private sector in the 45 countries covered by DHS, so it is possible to use DHS data to compare basic performance measures of public and private systems. In Figure 6 we have plotted post-neonatal child mortality rates against the share of the pr ivate sector in child health services.29 The data 28 World Health Organization (2001). The Bellagio Child Survival Study Group was less decisive, although their general assumption was that the public sector would be responsible for most services, while the private sector \"should be involved whenever possible, especially in monitoring and ensuring quality and equity\" (Bryce, J., S. el Arifeen, et al. 2003). 29 DHS reports where mothers sought out care when there child was most recently sick with symptoms of diarrhea, fever, or cough with rapid breathing. We have used these reports to calculate the percentage of visits that were in the public or private sector. We onl y include visits to clinics in these calculations. Many parents seek advice at pharmacies in low income countries, and these are usually private. If we included pharmacies in the calculations, the share of the privat e sector would rise substantially for each country, although the qualitative relationship between mortality and size of the public sector would not change. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 27show there is no clear relationship between public or non-public management of the health system, and mortality outcomes for these children.30 In fact, the real conclusion from Figure 6 is that bot h public and private systems are consistent with very low child mortalit y. For example, today most child care is sought in the private sector in Kerala, Egypt , Indonesia and Vietnam, and each of these countries and states have achieved very lo w child mortality. On the other hand Cuba, many states in the former Soviet Union, and regions in Latin America generally rely on the public sector and have achieved low mort ality. In China, low child mortality has been achieved in a system where parents pay user fees equal to 75% of total costs. These findings suggest there are multiple syst emic routes to low child deaths. In regions with stable government and political elites that are willing to spend on the poor, it may make sense to channel inte rventions through the public s ector. In other regions it may be preferable to develop private s upply, and hope that pare ntal education and experience will lead to substant ial increases in demand for health services. In order to reduce risks of supply disruptions we shoul d probably aim to buttress both public and private services. Loevinsohn and Hardi ng (2005) provide impressive evidence that public sector contracting of services can be a highly successful means to deliver services to children while avoiding the pitfal ls of public sector implementation - although these programs do require public sector willi ngness and ability to provide financing. 30 BZ use similar data and show that inequality of h ealthcare services is unrelated to the public or non- public management of care. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 28VIII. The Macroeconomic Consequences of Improved Health While the evidence is not yet fully sati sfactory, there is good reason to believe dramatic reductions in child deaths are achie vable if an appropriate package of measures is introduced in \"pockets of poverty\". The m easures discussed in Figure 1 can be rapidly introduced, so over a period of five years we could well see much greater than 50% reductions in child deaths. In our view, this is attainable even in th e poorest parts of Asia or Africa today. However, if our goal is to design a p ackage of measures to reduce extreme poverty, or at least make sure we do not ex acerbate poverty, then we need to consider implications of rapid improvements in heal th on poverty. Here the evidence is mixed. There is obviously a considerable amount of microeconomic evidence that suggests better health leads to better economic outcomes fo r individuals, for example in the form of higher wages.31 So there is no doubt that improving health for people born into pockets of poverty would make them better off relativ e to those not in \" pockets\" in the same country.32 For example, Soares (2007) finds th at health improvements across regions Brazil had a welfare value roughl y one-third that of the growth in income per capita, 1970-2000, and contributed about a quarter of the improveme nt in welfare over this period. Strong claims for the effect s of health on income have been made, based on cross- country correlations (e.g., Bloom and Canning 2005, Bloom and Sachs, 1998, World Health Organization, 2001, Lorentzon, Mc Millan and Wacziarg 2008). Plausible 31 Strauss and Thomas (1998) survey the research through the late 1990s. Important recent papers include Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004), Bleakley (2003 and 2007), Miguel and Kremer (2004), and Schultz (2002). 32 In addition, of course, we should value health im provements for their own sake and this may outweigh any income considerations (Becker, Philipson, and Soares 2005). BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 29mechanisms include positive effects from reduc ing ill-health on productivity directly, as well as through increasing education and savings.33 Weil (2007) finds that when the microeconomic evidence is aggregated, health can explain about 25% of the variation in the cross-sectional log income per worker acr oss countries (about the same as education and more than physical capital). None of this speaks to causation, of cour se, and it is hard to find well identified experiments with plausibly exogenous increase s in collective health (of the kind and scale that would happen if we could improve health in pockets of poverty). Nevertheless, some insight may be drawn from the from the post-World War II \"international epidemiological transition\", in which ne w drugs, chemicals and delivery mechanisms spread quickly from a few industrial c ountries around the world (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007). This country-level evidence indicates that there were quick and positive effects on life expectancy and on ill-health. 34 But the effects on GDP per capita or per working age population were much slower to emerge - taki ng at least 40 years and, in some cases, even longer. The proximate cause of this delayed effect was the increase in population that followed the health improvements; there was a fertility transiti on, but only over time. To put this phenomenon into perspective, Figu res 7 and 8 show that while there has been considerable convergence in life expect ancy among countries that were, circa 1940, initially poor, middle income and rich, there has been much less convergence in income per capita.35 33 Case and Paxson (2008) find that height is asso ciated with cognitive ability. This suggests, although it does not prove, that health improvements which increase height could have direct effects on cognition, and presumably therefore on productivity. 34 Data limitations mean that we do not (yet) have a clear picture of what ha ppened to health in Africa during this period. 35 As Deaton (2004) points out, the convergence in lif e expectancy in broad terms suggests there are more gains to be had if globalization can bring better health care to world's least healthy. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 30The effects of health improvements in this major post-war episode can arguably be identified by measuring the initial burden of disease in te rms of deaths from specific infectious diseases and measuring changes in \"predicted mortal ity,\" i.e., how much mortality should have fallen if the ne w medical technologi es were adopted.36 Figure 9 shows that over 1940-1980 there was a strong negative correlation between changes in predicted mortality and changes in log life expectancy, i.e., countries that had a larger initial burden of infectious di sease also had a larger increase in life expectancy. Figure 10 shows a similar negative relationship betw een predicted morta lity and log population - places with more to gain (and presumably mo re gains) from the reduction in infectious diseases experienced larger increases in population. And Figure 11 illustrates the problem: while the change in GDP was also higher for countries experiencing bigger declines in predicted mortal ity, the effect on GDP was not large enough - over this time period - to make up for the increase in popula tion. In short, ther e is no evidence that these dramatic and rapid improvements in health led to higher income per capita (or even per worker). These empirical findings are consistent w ith neoclassical theory, if there is an important fixed factor of production (e.g., land). Ashraf, Lester and Weil (2008) calibrate a model with exogenous health improvement s on income, and the available evidence on 36 Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) have data on 15 diseases, but most of the action comes from reductions in deaths from tuberculosis, pneumonia, and - for some countries - malaria. The increase in life expectancy for many countries, from around 40 to around 60, is similar to what could be achieved in pockets of poverty today. However, the pattern of disease burden in today's developing countries is of course somewhat different, with child mortality being higher relative to adult mortality than was the case generally in 1940. We would also stress that the effect of reducing HIV-AIDS in particular may have quite different (and more positive) consequences for income per capita. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 31key parameters suggests health improvements are likely to produce a population increase that can substantially delay the positive effects on income at the macro level.37 None of this recent work suggests that health improvements should not be pursued - they are surely impor tant enough in their own right, irrespective of the effect on income. But the question is whether health (and education) interventions will, by themselves, lift people out of poverty. What are the other plausible interventions that could address this issue? Is it about the availabili ty of (micro) finance? Is it about the availability of subsidized fertilizer? Is it about the dissemination of new and (hopefully) \"appropriate\" technologies - perhap s the arrival of cell phones? Is it roads? All of these, and more, have their proponents. Not only is th is an open issue, but we seem to be some distance from even designing interventions that would provide meaningful tests and guidance on how to move forward. 38 In a sense, the broad \"Millennium Village\" package advocated by Jeff Sachs is a sensible approach.39 This is an integrated set of in terventions that attempt to address many issues, including health, education and agricultural productivity directly. But from the design of this project, it is hard to know what exactly we w ill learn - other than (presumably) large inflows of foreign mone y and attention have positive effects for recipients, at least while the flows continue . Still, a broad-based approach along these 37 Still, their calibration of the fertility effect is less than what Acemoglu and Johnson find in the data. Either something is missing in the theory or the postwar experience in developing countries had some features that are not in the model. Acemoglu, Fergusson, and Johnson (2008) suggest that part of the \"missing link\" may be that population increases led to more social conflict and violence as there was greater competition for resources. In turn, this is linked to who gets access to health care services in general and in the face of shocks (e.g., the arrival of HIV-AIDS). 38 One approach would be to encourag e birth control, i.e., to try to accel erate the fertility tr ansition. There is obviously a great deal of ac tivity in this area (e.g., see http://www.hewlett.org/ Programs/Population/ ). But relatively little is yet known about how to make this effective in pockets of poverty, other than through improving the female education. Lant Pritchett (2008) argues for a different appr oach focussing on letting labor move more freely across borders, and encouraging international migration would remove the fixed (local) factors of production problem. But it rema ins to be seen if this is politically feasible. 39 See http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/ , and associated press coverage. BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 32lines, within the \"experimental\" framework laid out above, could have considerable appeal. IX. Designing programs to end pockets of poverty The Millennium Villages project has another important flaw - it will be impossible in the future to confidently concl ude whether it was a success. The project could have been designed similar to a drug tr ial, with villages being randomly selected from a list to decide which received s upport, and the outcomes of those villages compared to the non-selected villages in a pr e-specified analysis plan. Such rigorous analysis would be an extremely valuable tool to understand how well it works, and to learn how to improve outcomes. If we combin ed the best aspects of medical trial design listed in section 2, with cr eative techniques for conducti ng secondary analysis (e.g. Miguel and Kremer's (2004)), we could potentia lly learn a lot about how best to reduce poverty in rural African Villages. The authors of this paper, through Effective Intervention ( http://www.effint.org/ ), a UK based charity, are involved in several la rge trials aimed at improving health and education in extremely poor regi ons. We have partnered with medical statisticians at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine along with local h ealth professionals, to design and implement projects to reduce ch ild mortality in rural regions of Africa and India. While these are aid projects, we have designed them as randomised controlled trials identical to a drug approval trial, and we are testing whether a comprehensive package of interventions, including intensiv e provision of community health education BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 33and contracted out clinical services, will be sufficient to rapidly reduce child deaths.40 The trials are being implemented in 600 vill ages in India and Af rica, with a total population of 500,000. It will take three years to accumulate sufficient events (i.e., child deaths) in order to credibly determine the imp act on overall child mortality for each trial. At the end of each trial, we will learn whethe r the system we have put in place is truly capable of rapidly reducing deaths within three years, and we will also learn the costs. We are also in the planning stages for a project that will combine improved child survival with education in pockets of poverty. One endpoint for the trial will the percentage of children at age te n who are literate and numerate at a level consistent with middle income counties. We will track these children, and compare them to controls, for at least ten years after the trial. This tria l will help us learn whether children living in remote impoverished regions, who learn by ag e ten to be literate and numerate, gain benefits from this additional education. We will also learn how to implement such projects and what can be achieved in these communities at modest cost. Our aim is to ultimately build up a rigorous ly evaluated and validated package of measures which can help lift current and future generations of childre n out of pockets of poverty. However, much more knowledge is needed before we can understand whether this is possible, and how to achieve it. X. Conclusion There is enough evidence to say that we likely can rapidly reduce child deaths in pockets of poverty. Doing this effectively re quires designing an a ppropriate package of measures and ensuring that they can be sustai nably delivered to the children and pregnant 40 The details of the study protocol are described in Boone and others (2007). BROOKINGS GLOBAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE 34mothers that need them. This is both f easible and compelling, quite aside from any economic considerations. A dramatic improvement in health conditi ons has the potential to reduce poverty. But it may also lower per capita income in thes e regions by raising tota l births or fertility or both, particularly if fixed factors of production mean that additional population creates negative \"crowding\" effects. Presumably, en couraging investments in human capital will help make poverty reduction more likely. But we should also be cautious regarding whether combining education with health improvements would be sufficient for poverty eradication. Since survey data tells us health, educa tion and poverty are ve ry closely linked, to really end pockets of poverty we probably n eed to have an even broader package of measures that addresses all these areas dire ctly. Without doubt, we need more evidence to know what can be achieved on this \"grander\" scale. The standard approach of medical research, in which single interventions are test ed in trials, may not be ideal for gaining evidence here. Rather, packages of measures should be tested, preferably as randomised controlled trials, with clearl y defined endpoints and pre-spec ified goals. Over the next decade, this would provide us with much be tter evidence regarding what works, and what can be achieved.
