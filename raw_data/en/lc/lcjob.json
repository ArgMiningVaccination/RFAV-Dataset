GIVE US A CALL TODAY, WE ARE ALWAYS ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS! OPEN MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY Located in the heart of Tacoma, the leading health professionals at Renaissance Chiropractic Center are dedicated to helping you achieve your wellness objectives -- combining skill and expertise that spans the entire chiropractic wellness spectrum. The Doctors at Renaissance Chiropractic Center are committed to bringing you better health and a better way of life by teaching and practicing the true principles of chiropractic wellness care. Our History Renaissance Chiropractic Center has been a fixture in Tacoma since the early 1980s. It was started by 2 brothers, Dr. Brian Long and Dr. Dennis Long, who began working together in the late 1970s and then building the office you know in 1980. The brothers believed in Chiropractic Care and passed that down to their children. Dr. Brian and his wife Sue have 6 children, 5 out of 6 work within wellness care- 4 of which are Chiropractors and 1 is a Licensed Massage Therapist. Today, Dr. Doug and Dr. Mike, continue to serve Tacoma as the owners of Renaissance Chiropractic Center. They don't do it alone, though. They work alongside their associate chiropractors, licensed massage therapists, and the office staff. They're passionate about providing the same level of care as their fathers who established the practice. We should note that Dr. Doug and Dr. Mike are both heavily involved in the chiropractic community. Dr Mike currently serves as a commissioner on the Washington State Chiropractic Quality Assurance Commission, a position Dr Doug held for 10 years prior. They have also both served on the board of the Washington State Chiropractic Association. Dr Doug and Dr Mike have spoken at community groups and chiropractic seminars throughout their careers. Our Specialties The chiropractors have training in adjusting patients of all ages. They work with infants, children and pregnant women. They also help those who suffered from automobile, work or sports related injuries. They address many conditions through spinal adjustments such as headaches, back and neck pain, disc injuries, nerve related issues and many other musculoskeletal complaints. Many of their patients experience improved sleep, increased energy levels, better digestion, and improvements with other health related issues. Our Treatments When you visit a chiropractor here, your adjustments will be tailored to you and your specific needs. A chiropractor from our practice may do traditional hands-on adjustments or utilize lower force techniques in the form of a drop table or an adjusting instrument such as an Activator. We also offer spinal decompression and massage therapy, among other treatments. If you have any questions about whether or not chiropractic adjustments may benefit you, contact Renaissance Chiropractic to schedule a consultation. Our doctors provide spinal decompression, corrective exercises, and more. Call 253-473-0300 to begin your path to relief.
