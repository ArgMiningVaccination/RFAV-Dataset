When our bodies are healthy and our stress levels are low, we increase our odds of avoiding sickness-or sailing through it, if we do get sick. The ongoing COVID-19 situation may serve as excellent motivation to make lifestyle changes that will make us healthier than ever. Infrared Sauna, BEMER Therapy, and TheraLight 360 treatments, available at iSauna in Northville, Michigan, all strengthen the immune system. Because there are so many strains of viruses and they are constantly mutating, an optimally functioning immune system is essential for maintaining good health. The iSauna treatments described below may help you to stay healthy during this cold, flu, and COVID-19 season. All of iSauna's high-tech therapeutics are touchless and offer multiple benefits. Once we have explained the therapy and shown you how to use it, you will relax in a private room. For most of the therapies, you simply lay down on a therapy bed and relax while the lights and lasers do their work. Expect to feel happy, relaxed, and rejuvenated after treatment. Immune System 101 The immune system is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that defend our bodies against bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi that may cause disease. A healthy immune system protects us by preventing or limiting infection. It does this by identifying and destroying harmful pathogens that enter the body. Our immune systems can be quickly compromised by stress, pain, and fatigue. Further, chronic health issues reduce the body's ability to defend and heal itself. Improving overall health, as well as taking measures specifically designed to boost the immune system, maximizes the body's ability to fight off infectious disease. Infrared Sauna for Boosting Immunity Infrared Sauna Therapy uses infrared light to directly heat the body's core, rather than warming the air around you and only heating surface skin. Infrared Sauna is a highly effective health building and immune boosting therapy. You may have heard about Infrared Saunas' relaxation and weight loss benefits. But Infrared Sauna also relieves stress and pain, and helps our bodies eliminate toxins. Through these mechanisms and more, Infrared Sauna offers significant health benefits. In an Austrian study, 25 healthy subjects who regularly used saunas had significantly fewer episodes of common colds than those who did not. This benefit became even more significant after 14 weeks of consecutive sauna use. Therefore, in order to fully experience the immune-strengthening benefits of sauna use, we recommend using Infrared Sauna at least twice a week throughout the year. To maximize the immune-boosting benefits of Infrared Sauna, iSauna offers full-spectrum Infrared Therapy. The near-infrared spectrum stimulates immune cell growth and activity by stimulating mitochondria. At the same time, the mid-infrared spectrum penetrates deep into tissues, yielding benefits from the immune-stimulating effects of heat throughout the body and also, improving sleep. Finally, the far-infrared spectrum provides great healing and anti-stress benefits. How Infrared Sauna May Help Strengthen Your Immune System - Stimulates the Immune System: Spending time in an Infrared Sauna raises the core temperature of the body. Thus, the body experiences a simulated fever which is the body's natural way of fighting infections. - Reduces Stress: Since high stress levels often result in a weakened immune system and, as a result, illness, reducing your stress levels is crucial for maintaining a healthy body. Regular use of an infrared sauna balances cortisol levels and relaxes the body and mind. This allows your immune system to work efficiently, without the hindrance of high cortisol levels. - Improves Blood Circulation: Infrared therapy stimulates the circulatory system, causing the heart to beat more vigorously and blood vessels to dilate. This helps cleanse the circulatory system and more fully oxygenate the body's cells. The increase in circulation pumps the blood towards the outside surface of your body, taking with it bacteria or other illness-causing substances. - Increases White Blood Cell Production: The heat generated by an infrared sauna stimulates energy at a cellular level which increases the body's production of white blood cells. These cells act as your immune system's first line of defense when infection strikes. When a harmful substance enters your body, white blood cells detect it and control the immune system's response. - Stimulates Detoxification: When the heat of the sauna stimulates sweat, the body releases toxins. Detoxification allows the body to clean out what's harmful and creates an opportunity for repair and renewal. - Promotes Restful Sleep: [Sleep is a vital immune booster.](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-health/how-sleep-affects-immunity) At iSauna, we offer several options for Infrared Sauna, including [Walk-In Sauna, Lay Down Sauna](https://www.isauna.com/infrared-sauna-treatments), and [Wellness Pods](https://www.isauna.com/wellness-pods) (Cocoon Fitness Pod and Aqua Hydration Pod). BEMER for Enhancing Immune Health BEMER is a revolutionary medical technology that has been shown to stimulate the body's natural systems to restore energy, improve health, and reduce pain. BEMER stands for Bio Electro Magnetic Energy Regulation. This therapeutic device uses pulsed electromagnetic frequencies (PEMF), to aid in the body's circulation. When you receive a BEMER treatment, the patented PEMF stimulates the mitochondria in your cells to increase the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which your body uses for energy. How BEMER Therapy May Help Strengthen Your Immune System Improves Blood Flow: The BEMER is designed to improve circulation, thereby supporting the body's natural self-regulation. Blood transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and immune cells throughout the body. When our cells, tissues and organs are adequately nourished and metabolic waste products are removed, our bodies become healthy and function properly. Enhances Microcirculation: BEMER treatment increases the responsiveness of white blood cells by improving microcirculation. This enables the immune system to protect the body in the event of infection. BEMER therapy supports the body's self-healing and regeneration process. Boosts Nitric Acid Production: [Studies show that nitric oxide inhibits the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15650225/). By this mechanism, BEMER therapy offers direct benefits during cold and flu season. Expect to feel relaxed during your BEMER treatment, which generally lasts 10-15 minutes. You may feel a slight tingle as the flow of blood improves. The amount of electromagnetic energy administered is less than that of the earth's natural magnetism. Theralight 360 for Supporting Your Immune System The TheraLight 360 is a full-body photobiomodulation (PMB) system that uses low level laser technology (LLLT) to combat the root cause of cellular aging and inflammation. Because Theralight 360 promotes new cell growth and improves cell function, this innovative therapy can be an amazing immunity booster. As such, Theralight treatments may give you an edge when facing illnesses such as colds, flus, and COVID-19. The [TheraLight 360 is the best available light healing technology in the industry](https://www.isauna.com/blog/the-life-enhancing-benefits-of-theralight-360-treatmentsnbsp). With complete full body coverage and over 40,000 red and near infrared light LEDs, our TheraLight 360 penetrates your entire body for optimal and comprehensive healing. The red and near infrared light nourishes the cells, reducing oxidative stress and increasing mitochondrial function. Thus, TheraLight treatments play a significant role in optimizing health span and lifespan through addressing the needs of our cells in significant ways. How TheraLight 360 Treatments May Help Strengthen Your Immune System - Stimulates the Immune System: Red Light Therapy stimulates immunoglobulins and lymphocytes. Thus, the immune system works better in fighting off pathogens. - Fights Fatigue at the Cellular Level: Fatigue is a common result of excess stress and depression-both of which are at high levels as the COVID-19 situation persists. Fatigue can be intensified by the vicious cycle of excessive stress hormones, which cause damage to our cell's energy generators\u2014the mitochondria. Light, at specific wavelengths, is readily absorbed by the mitochondria of the body's cells, which activates metabolic energy processes. Red and near-infrared wavelengths of light promote ATP production, which boosts energy transport within cells, leading to increased cell proliferation. This boost in the body's natural healing cycle, helps reduce inflammation, and promotes healing of damaged tissue. - Reduces Pain and Inflammation: TheraLight therapy can help reduce pain and inflammation from muscle and joint strain throughout the body as well as fight fatigue. - Uplifted Mood: Clients often walk out of their 10-minute TheraLight treatment with huge smiles. They are surprised at how happy they feel. - Improves Sleep Quality: When we spend all day indoors, our cellular energy systems and circadian rhythms suffer, leading to issues like poor sleep, fatigue, mood-related issues and weight gain. Using TheraLight 360 is a simple way to expose your body to more natural light. This can help reset your circadian clock and aids in the release of melatonin needed for healthy sleep.
