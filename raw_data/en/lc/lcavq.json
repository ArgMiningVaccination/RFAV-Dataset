Background: We previously reported a phase I study of a cancer vaccine using five novel HLA-A*2402-restricted peptides, and demonstrated the safety and thepromising potential of our five-peptide cocktail for advancedcolorectal cancer. The objective of this analysis was toinvestigate predictive biomarkers for the prior selection ofpatients who are likely to have clinical benefit from suchtherapy. Patients and Methods: Seventeen patients withcolorectal cancer who were treated with the five peptidesunderwent a complete blood count, serum chemistry testsand enzyme-linked ImmunoSpot assay before the of high reactivity to the peptides.Results: Interleukin-6 level was a significant predictor foroverall survival of patients treated with the peptide cocktail(p=0.017). A high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was likely tohave some association with the poor induction of peptide-specific immune reaction. Conclusion: Interleukin-6 levelmight be a good predictive biomarker for ofpatients treated with this peptide vaccine.Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were reported in the early 1990s (1). Since then, various approaches to discoveringTAAs have been reported (2). Among them, genome-basedtechnologies, including comprehensive gene expressionprofiles of malignant cells, have contributed verysignificantly to the identification of cancer-specific antigens(3-7). We previously reported the identification of threeoncoantigens that showed cancer-specific expression patternsand have oncogenic activities, ring finger protein 43(RNF43) (4), 34 kDa translocase of the outer mitochondrialmembrane (TOMM34) (5), and insulin-like growth factor 2mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3, other name is KOC1)(6), as targets for the development of cancer peptide vaccinesfor colorectal cancer (CRC). Active immunotherapy using induction of tumor-specific cytotoxic T- lymphocytes (CTLs), requires the preservation of the hostimmune system, as recommended in the guidance fortherapeutic cancer vaccines released from the US Food andDrug Administration in 2011 (8). However, since patientswith very advanced stage disease whose immune status isvery poor are usually allowed to enroll to clinical studies inan early phase of drug development, it is very difficult toevaluate their survival benefit (9). Hence, there is a desperateneed for predictive biomarkers to allow the prior selection ofpatients who are likely to respond well and in whom CTLswould be induced effectively by epitope peptides. We previously reported a phase study of a combination vaccine treatment using a cocktail containing three peptidesderived from oncoantigens and two peptides targeting 4201This article is freely accessible online.

Although peptide-specific CTLinduction and skin reactions at the vaccine injection sitemight be good markers for monitoring immune responses, afew months are required for skin reactions to becomeapparent, and CTL measurement is also time-consuming andnot very quantitative. The purpose of this study was toexplore predictive biomarkers for the efficacy ofimmunotherapies before treatment and for the selection ofpatients likely to exhibit better treatment outcomes followingvaccination. We herein demonstrate possible predictivebiomarkers for active immunotherapies. Patients and Methods Patients and study design. The detailed protocol of this study was described previously (10). Briefly, patients were eligible forenrollment when they had histologically confirmed CRC withoutindication of surgical resection, when they had failed to respond toprior standard chemotherapy or were intolerable to the standardtherapy, and when they were HLA-A*2402-positive by DNA typing.The patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative OncologyGroup performance status (PS) of 0 to 2, a life expectancy of at least3 months, and to have adequate organ functions. This study wasapproved by the Institutional Ethics Review Boards of YamaguchiUniversity (H18-82) and was conducted in accordance with theDeclaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informedconsent prior to study entry. The study protocol was registered at theUniversity Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) ClinicalTrials Registry (UMIN000004948). This study was primarily conducted to evaluate the safety and to find the recommended dose of these peptides. Good ManufacturingPractice grade peptides of peptides with HLA-A*2402 were synthesized by American Peptide Company Inc.(Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Dose escalation was performed in threepatient cohorts with doses of 0.5, 1, and 3 mg for each peptide.Each peptide was mixed with 0.5 ml of incomplete Freund'sadjuvant (IFA) (Montanide ISA51; Seppic, Paris, France)administered to patients subcutaneously into the thigh or axillaregions on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in a 28-day treatment course.According to the result of this study, we decided the recommendeddose of each peptide for further study to be 3.0 mg, adding threepatients at the dose of 3.0 mg to confirm the safety. Next weperformed a single injection of the cocktail of five peptides whichcould be expected to induce immune responses at the same level asseparate injections of each of the five peptides. The cocktail of fivepeptides at the dose of 3 mg was mixed with 1.5 ml of IFA andadministered to six patients. Vaccination was continued even afterthe progression of disease when a patient wished and a primarydoctor who provided best supportive care or additionalchemotherapies recommended. From the fourth course of treatment,the vaccination schedule was changed to be biweekly, and from theseventh course, it was reduced to once a month.The study confirmed the safety as well as immunological and antitumor effects in 18 patients. A patient who underwent curativeresection after eight weeks of vaccination was excluded from theanalysis; hence seventeen patients were included in the analysis ofthe present study. Sample collection. A complete blood count and serum chemistry tests were performed before treatment and every two weeks. Fifty millilitersof blood was drawn before each course, and then peripheral-bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs) and blood plasma were isolated. PBMCsand plasma were preserved in liquid nitrogen until examination. Measurement of the peptide-specific IFN- response and plasma IL6 level. Antigen-specific estimated by enzyme- linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT: CTL, Shaker Heights, OH, USA)assays following in vitro sensitization as described previously (10, 15). The number of peptide-specific spots was calculated bysubtracting the spot number in the control well from the spotnumber of a well with vaccinated peptide-pulsed stimulator cells.Antigen-specific T-cell response was classified into four grades (,+, ++, or +++) according to the algorithm flow chart described inour previous report (+++: IFN- producing cells more than 0.2%,++: +: than 0.01% in IL6 level was measured byelectrochemiluminescence immunoassays (Meso Scale Discovery,Rockville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analysis. Overall survival (OS) rates were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival was measured in days fromthe first vaccination to the day of patient death from any cause. p- Values were assessed using a log-rank test. A Cox's proportionalhazards model and a logistic regression model were used to estimatethe hazard ratios (HRs) for the treatment effect in relation to OS andbiomarkers. Student's t-test was used for the analysis of peptide- specific immune responses. All statistical analyses were performedwith SPSS statistics 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A value ofp<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results As described previously (10), the vaccine treatment using multiple peptides was well-tolerated without any severetreatment-associated systemic adverse events. Regarding theclinical outcome, one patient achieved complete responseand six patients had stable disease for four to seven months.The median overall survival time (MST) was 13.5 months.Patients in which we detected induction of CTLs specific tothree or more peptides had a significantly better prognosis(MST=27.8 months) than those with poorer immuneresponses (MST=3.7 months) ( Immunological parameters as biomarkers of To explore biomarkers for this vaccine therapy, we analyzedimmunological parameters of the 17 patients. Univariateanalysis revealed that 15% or more lymphocytes in whiteblood cells peripheral blood ( p=0.042), IL6ANTICANCER than 2.0 pg/ml ( p=0.015) might be biomarkers predictive of better prognosis of patients treated with thepeptide cocktail (Table I). Multivariate analysis of the Coxregression model indicated that IL6 was the most significantpredictor for OS [ p=0.017; HR=4.212; be a predictivebiomarker for OS ( p=0.009; Figure 1). Relationship to CTL The induction and lymphocyte proportion, CRPor IL6 evaluated. A low lymphocyte proportionand a high NLR were related to lower induction of a peptide-specific immune reaction ( p=0.061), although a high CRP level and a high IL6 concentration had no effect on CTLinduction (Table III). Discussion The preservation of the host immune system is criticallyessential for active specific immunotherapy aiming in vivo induction of CTLs (16) and long-term vaccination is requiredto observe CTL induction and clinical benefit (8). Hence, it is crucially important to explore biomarkers for predictingthe host's immunity and the clinical responses for successfulimmunotherapy (17). We investigated possible predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy using the information of our previous phase study of a combination vaccine treatment for metastaticCRC with a cocktail consisting of three peptides derivedfrom oncoantigens and two peptides targeting VEGFR1 andVEGFR2 (10), and found interesting correlations betweencertain parameters and clinical outcome. Firstly, a plasma IL6 level of 2.0 pg/ml or more might be the most useful predictor for poor OS by multivariateanalysis of the Cox regression model ( p=0.017; HR=4.212; Table II), and the log-rank test also suggested that patientswith an IL6 level of 2.0 pg/ml or more had shorter OS thanthose with a lower IL-6 ( p=0.009), (Figure 1). However, induction of CTLs was not affected by the plasma IL6 levels(Table III), implying that IL6 might modulate the localimmune response and protect cancer cells from immuneattack by CTLs. The tumor stromal cells consist of a varietyof cellular components, including various kinds of immune-associated and inflammatory e.g.regulatory antitumor immunity and leading to tumorresistance (18, 19). These results indicate that the regulationof the chronic inflammation surrounding tumor tissues usingselective blockade of IL6 trans-signaling (20) or monoclonalantibody against IL6 (21) may be a good approach forfurther improving the clinical efficacy of vaccination.

Moreover, patients with an NLR of 5.0or more and a lymphocyte proportion less than 15%(p=0.065 for both), (Table III) exhibited poor induction of CTLs, suggesting that these patients are unlikely to haveclinical benefit of active immunotherapy. In conclusion, IL6 may be the most promising biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients treated with peptidevaccines and a combination of anti-IL6 agents with cancervaccination may improve the clinical benefit ofimmunotherapy. Furthermore, although the data are verypreliminary, patients with a lymphocyte proportion less than15% or NLR of more than 5.0 may not expect clinicalbenefit of active immunotherapy.
