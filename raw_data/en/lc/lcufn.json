The objective of the 2-day outreach program was for Women in Science to inspire and empower high school girls from disadvantaged communities. At the beginning of the event, students showcased various scientific innovations, followed by demonstrations by scientists from institutions such as the South African Medical Research Council, Stellenbosch University, University of the Western Cape and University of Cape Town. Students had firsthand experience on techniques such as DNA extraction as well as the use of microscope to evaluate disease morphological features. Students also receipt prizes for answering basic health science-related questions. According to Dr Ikanyeng, \"the event was a heartwarming experience to see a room full of enthusiastic faces of girls eager to learn about science, this gives me hope that this is a generation of girls that will break the glass ceiling and close the gender gap in Science\". \"The domino effect of sharing knowledge with young girls is a powerful generation of women that are aware of the vast opportunities available to them, despite their backgrounds, and how they can use their voice and learned skills as a tool to bring about global change. I was very excited to witness the budding greatness presented by these girls and their keenness to creating a more sustainable South Africa using science\", added Dr Sangweni. Researchers hope to make their participation in this annual event a regular occurrence as they bring science to under-resourced communities. [ Biomedical Research and Innovation Platform is proudly associated with CSSFF-SAMRC training initiative ](#accordion-piy5f-2) On Friday the 9th of June 2023, the first cohort of students of the Chan Soon-Shiong Family Foundation (CSSFF)-SAMRC Studentship Programme received their certificate after completing the introductory training course in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. The CSSFF-SAMRC capacity development programme aims to grow the next generation of biopharmaceutical manufacturing professionals, researchers, and technical experts needed to establish an industry in (South) Africa. The Biomedical Research and Innovation Platform hosted its first breast cancer consortium meeting in Cape Town on the 2nd August 2023. The meeting, chaired by Dr Tarryn Willmer, brought together a multidisciplinary team of research scientists and clinicians with an overarching aim to harness resources and expertise for breast cancer research in Africa. Breast cancer remains the leading cause of death in women globally, with low and middle-income countries being disproportionally affected by the disease. Africa has the highest age-standardised breast cancer mortality rate in the world but despite these dire statistics, studies on the unique genetic, environmental and socio-economic factors driving tumour biology and clinical behavior in Africans is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, a breast cancer consortium meeting, hosted by BRIP, brought together clinicians and scientists from various institutions (including SAMRC Genomics, GENEdiagnostics, University of KwaZulu-Natal, University of Limpopo and Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University) to address pertinent questions, needs, and resources concerning breast cancer care in South Africa. Highlights of the meeting include a transdisciplinary collaborative partnership between surgical oncologists, pathologists, and cell and molecular biologists, where presentations were given, and the team engaged in insightful discussions across the disciplines. Those in attendance agreed that Africa has the scientific and intellectual capacity, as well as the necessary resources to tackle health challenges and formulate solutions for Africa's health problems. Dr Tarryn Willmer, a senior research scientist at BRIP said, \"This consortium will expand our understanding on breast cancer in Africa by fostering collaborations among researchers and clinicians, and establishing a concrete framework for the implementation of Afrocentric research, sharing of resources and analysis of pooled data.\" Pretoria, South Africa | The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) would like to congratulate Prof Rabia Johnson, a Chief Specialist Scientist and Deputy Director at the SAMRC for scooping the 2023 Forbes Woman Africa Academic Excellence Award. The award was presented to her based on her research work conducted within the last 20 years. View the [complete Press Release](/press-releases/samrc-scientist-wins-forbes-woman-africa-award) The SAMRC's Biomedical Research and Innovation Platform (BRIP) and the Non-Communicable Research Unit (NCDRU) successfully hosted another World Diabetes Day Awareness Campaign at Jack Muller Park on the 20th of November. Walkers and runners alike completed either a 3 or 5 km route around the park to promote physical activity. Lifestyle modifications, such as increasing physical activity and eating healthy, nutritious foods are an essential part of managing or even preventing diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Supported by Corporate and Marketing Communications Division, the theme for the year, access to diabetes care, was promoted and information around diabetes risk factors and management was shared. View the [SAMRC World Diabetes Day Brochure](/sites/default/files/attachments/2022-11/WorldDiabetesBrochure.pdf) The theme for 2022 is \"Access to Diabetes Care for All\" and under the initiative of \"Education to Protect Tomorrow\", SAMRC staff and students went out to the Parow Senior Centre sharing important information on Diabetes care and preventive measures.

A time of sharing food, stories and everything that makes us PROUDLY South African. We are stronger together and are fortunate to stand on the shoulders of giants. On Sunday the 28th August, Dr Kwazi Gabuza, senior Scientist at the Biomedical Research Innovation Platform, took part and completed his second Comrades marathon. The Comrades Marathon is an ultramarathon of approximately 89 km, which is run annually in the KwaZulu-Natal province and is said to be the world's largest and oldest ultramarathon race. The race takes place between the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, with the direction of the race alternating each year between the \"up\" run (87 km) starting from Durban and the \"down\" run (now 90.184 km) starting from Pietermaritzburg. The race had been postponed in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID pandemic. Completed the race for the 3rd time in a race-time of 10:52:59, Dr Gabuza said \"It was uncertain that the Comrades would take place this year, following the two year break and the restrictions that were only scraped early this year. Only in March was everyone made aware that it will be happening in 2022. My training then started with the hope to be fully fit by 28 August. The two-year break definitely took its toll on the runners. It was a very challenging Comrades marathon, much harder than my previous attempts in 2017 and 2019.\" Well done Kwazi and congratulations on finishing yet another Comrades marathon. Here's to many more to come All the effort of early mornings and late nights on the road are paying off for Dr Kwazi Gabuza, a Senior Scientist at the Biomedical Research and Innovation Platform (BRIP). On the 15th of April, Dr Gabuza completed his 5th Two Oceans Ultra Marathon in a time he can be proud of (6h30min)! The gruelling 56 km race saw runners face strong head winds on the flatter part of the course, with the reward of the enormous climb up Chapman's Peak Drive and then Constantia Neck to test those legs and lungs. Well done Kwazi - we are so proud of you. We cannot wait to see what you do at Comrades 2023. All the best with the rest of your training while still maintaining a high level of research, mentoring and keeping office humor light. Following closely in Dr Gabuza's footsteps is one of BRIP's MSc students, Ms Hannah Fokkens, who completed her first Two Oceans Half Marathon in a more than respectable time. We know that this is only the beginning of your running achievements - well done Hannah! | | Dr Kwazi Gabuza - TTOM Ultra Marathon | | Ms Hannah Fokkens - TTOM Half Marathon "}
