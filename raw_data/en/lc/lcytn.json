Illinois uses the standardized data collection methods developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). These methods also are used by the 47 states and New York City , Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board (GPTCHB) participating in PRAMS. Data are collected through mailed surveys with telephone follow -up for non- respondents . A systematic stratified random sample of approximately 200 mothers is selected monthly from a frame of eligible birth certificates. At two to six months after delivery, each sampled mother is mailed an introductory letter and survey. A reminder letter and two additional survey mailing s are s ent to those who do not initially respond. PRAMS interviewer s telephone mothers who do not respond to any of the mailed surveys to administer the survey by telephone. Surveys are available in English and Spanish , and telephone interviews are conducted in both languages. In 2017, a total of 2,235 women were select ed to participate in the study ; 1,224 women completed the survey . Data w ere weighted and are representative of the 12 -month PRAMS -eligible population of 141,656 recent mothers . Data collection during 2017 marks the second year using the Phase 8 PRAMS survey. Sampling Design A systematic stratified random sampling design is used to oversample low birthweight ( less than 2,500 grams) births. The sample is stratified by low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) and normal birthweight (2,500 grams or greater). The 201 7 overall weighted response rate was 55 %. The weighted responses rates by birth weight are 55% for both low birth weight and normal birth weight . Weighting and Interpretation of Results Statistics are based on weighted data. The weights were developed by CDC to adjust for sample design, non-response patterns, and omissions from the sampling frame. The final sampling weight used in the analysis of the survey da ta is the product of these three elements. Weighting is necessary to give unbiased estimates of population parameters. The p ercentages, 95 percent confidence intervals, and total estimated population affected were calculated using Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN\u00ae *) software. Estimates for response categories with small sample size (i.e., fewer than 30 respondents in the denominator ) are not reported due to possible imprecision and bias. PRAMS data are representative of Illinois resident women, age 14 year s or older, who gave birth in Illinois to live infants . The sampling design is valid at the state level and not intended or developed to represent sub-state geographies or their populations without further evaluation. The data are not applicable to all pregnant women. At the direction of IDPH legal counsel, w omen younger than 18 years of age were not asked questions about physical abuse. Acknowledgements The Illinois PRAMS project would like to thank all the mothers who took the time to participate in our survey . These women provided valuable information to improve the understanding of why some babies are born healthy and some are not.
