Age for Everyone I love homeopathy and use it for 20+ years. Nothing works as fast as correct chosen homeopathic drug! Like my post if you find it helpful, please. I take it sublingual on empty stomach ,15 minutes or more before food. It is helpful during colds, when swelling is observed (it can be internal, like in throat ,so voice is changed and/or it is difficult to breathe). It's helpful for people with bee's allergy and with skin burn,when the burned place is red, painful and very swelled. "}
