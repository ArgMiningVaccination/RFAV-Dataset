If you've ever been to a spa for a facial, or visited an upscale beauty store, you've seen the beautiful glass bottles of facial oil on the shelves. Perhaps like me, you are almost afraid to touch them because they are so expensive and fancy looking. Maybe you sneak a dropper-full from the tester on your skin but don't dare look at the price. I've drooled over plenty of expensive facial oils and [purchased a few facial oils too](https://mindfulmomma.com/facial-oil-serum/) - but it's nice to know that there's a DIY alternative to what could be a very expensive facial oil habit. What is a Facial Oil? I may receive commissions from purchases made through links in this article. [Full Disclosure](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) You may be wondering what all the hype is about facial oils anyway. What exactly is a facial oil and how is it different from a facial serum or a facial moisturizer? Is it an extra step we don't need, or is there a legitimate benefit? Let's take a look into the benefits of a facial oil.... A natural facial oil is a blend of plant-based carrier oils and beneficial essential oils, intended to nourish, deeply hydrate and protect our skin. - Facial oils have no added water and are not emulsified like a cream or moisturizer - Unlike water-based serums, facial oils (sometimes called facial oil serums) are oily to the touch, but absorb into skin quickly - Natural facial oils (unlike mineral oil) mimic the skin's natural sebum production and don't clog pores - As we age, our skin produces less oil and facial oils help add oil back, helping us combat wrinkles and dry skin - Contrary to popular belief, facial oils can be beneficial to people with oily skin because they help regulate oil production and fight bacteria that causes acne - Facial oils protect skin from environmental damage from sun and chemicals in air (although they do NOT provide sunscreen protection) I've written about my love of facial oils before and if you want to see some of my favorite facial oil brands, check this post: [Favorite Facial Oil Serums](https://mindfulmomma.com/facial-oil-serum/). If you are NOT inclined to DIY, there are plenty of great natural facial oils available - from luxurious [Vintner's Daughter](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=626481&u=451673&m=54367&urllink=www%2Ethedetoxmarket%2Ecom%2Fcollections%2Fface%2Doils%2Dserums%2Fproducts%2Factive%2Dbotanical%2Dserum&afftrack=) (have not tried this one) to mid-priced [Beautycounter](https://www.beautycounter.com/micaelapreston?goto=/products/skin-care&filters=face-oils) (their Facial Oils are amazing!) to budget [Acure](https://www.amazon.com/Acure-Radically-Rejuvenating-Argan-Packaging/dp/B01KU49HEA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=acure+rose+argan+oil&qid=1552669716&s=gateway&sr=8-3&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=9b7683dd270fad6ce8b05193a7eb2613&language=en_US) (a great low-priced option). The more expensive facial oils tend to use unique combinations of carrier oils and have a complex essential oil scent. Lower priced facial oils tend to be pretty simple. Benefits of a DIY Facial Oil But if you are inclined to make a DIY face oil, the benefits are huge: 1.) You control the ingredients (and can easily avoid artificial fragrances and harmful preservatives) 2.) You can customize it to your skin type. (see how to make a custom homemade facial oil blend at the end of this post) 3.) You'll save money (yes there is some outlay for ingredients but you can use them for other [DIY beauty recipes](https://mindfulmomma.com/diy-beauty/)) 4.) You can proudly say \"I made this myself!!\" 5.) Homemade facial oil makes a gift! RELATED: [Natural Anti-Aging Treatments (Peels, Serums & Scrubs)](https://mindfulmomma.com/natural-anti-aging-treatments/) Best Facial Oil Ingredients As I mentioned before, natural facial oils are a combination of carrier oils and essential oils. Be aware that not all facial oils on the market are made with natural ingredients. Petroleum-based mineral oil and artificial fragrances or parfums are NOT what you want in your facial oil. Look for these natural ingredients instead: Plant-based Carrier Oils The best carrier oils to use in facial oil come from vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds. These plant-based oils are a natural source of antioxidants, polyphenols, and essential fatty acids, and are very nourishing and hydrating to your skin. Certified organic carrier oils are preferred but not necessary if you can't find or afford the organic version. Just make sure you buy from a reputable source. Some of my favorite carrier oil sources are Aura Cacia, Now Brands and Inesscents. I won't attempt to list every carrier oil available, but here are a few of my favorites: [Jojoba oil](https://www.amazon.com/Aura-Cacia-Natural-Balancing-Jojoba/dp/B0001TPRGM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=aura+cacia+jojoba+oil&qid=1552673613&s=gateway&sr=8-5&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=afd124c586d9deff6d5b28192d8ee403&language=en_US)(used in oil](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Calendula-Oil-fl-oz/dp/B01IIIXSIQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=3SUY82ED2O06X&keywords=inesscents+calendula+oil&qid=1552673939&s=gateway&sprefix=inesscents,aps,142&sr=8-3-fkmrnull&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=15d061a50b6a5b2a41a138ca31609330&language=en_US)(an herb-infused carrier oil - used in my recipe below) [Tamanu oil](https://www.amazon.com/PURA-DOR-Organic-Tamanu-Certified/dp/B07RBQM6N8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=tamanu+oil&qid=1592249479&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExRlc5M0E0TEFJMDI5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjExMTU4WEZRRVBTOVROUVlBJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwOTg4MzAzS0hJSlE4Q09XMjYmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=3deff61dd1ec831fbefef1c486818dca&language=en_US) [Avocado oil](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Solutions-Avocado-Oil-4-Ounce/dp/B00TDF2EXY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=now+avocado+oil&qid=1552674007&s=pantry&sr=8-5&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=5aa5012e96fbdb107822513d85812149&language=en_US) Natural Essential Oils Essential oils are extracted or distilled from the petals, leaves, bark, stem, and roots of plants. They are powerful substances, with therapeutic qualities as well as lovely natural scents. In facial care, essential oils are beneficial for stimulating skin cell production, improving circulation, neutralizing bacteria, calming inflamed skin and more. Because essential oils are so powerful, using the proper dilution ratio is important. Most sources recommend a dilution rate of 2 - 2.5% for skin care products, which would be [between 18 to 23 drops of essential oil for 1-oz (30ml) of carrier oil](https://www.rockymountainoils.com/dilution-rate/). So many different essential oils are beneficial for skin care that I won't attempt to list them all here. In my facial oil recipe below, you'll see that I used rose geranium, frankincense and lavender essential oils. I am not loyal to a particular brand of essential oils, and I have not used any of the popular MLM brands. Here are some of the essential oil brands I can find easily, either at local stores or online: [Rocky Mountain Oils](https://mindfulmomma.com/RockyMountainOils)(both USDA Certified Organic and Brand](https://www.amazon.com/365-WFM-Essential-Oil-Starter/dp/B08RG39TH4?crid=3N0BNK4A08LMS&keywords=365+essential+oils&qid=1682715173&sprefix=365+essential%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=1ba4b2e7c5f89c502664d218dc6139ca&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)from Whole Foods (non organic) FYI - a great resource for using essential oils: [The Complete Book of Essential Oils & Aromatherapy](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Essential-Aromatherapy-Revised-Expanded/dp/1577311396/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=The+Complete+Book+of+Essential+Oils+&+Aromatherapy&qid=1552674117&s=gateway&sr=8-3&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=1d55508f3611ebefa699b7ae1df81a14&language=en_US) by Valerie Ann Worwood RELATED: [Homemade Cleansing Balm](https://mindfulmomma.com/diy-cleansing-balm/) How to Use a Facial Oil The most important thing to know about a facial oil is that a little goes a long way! Facial oils are most commonly used to moisturize skin but can also be used for cleansing. As a moisturizer, you will only need a few drops of oil for your entire face. Best practice is to rub the oil between your fingers and then pat or smooth around face. Pro tip: Spritz face generously with toner before patting on the face oil to help seal in moisture. Have you heard of the oil cleansing method? Your facial oil can also be used a face cleanser by rubbing the oil into DRY skin and following a similar routine to what I outline in my [DIY cleansing balm](https://mindfulmomma.com/diy-cleansing-balm/) post. Anti-Aging DIY Facial Oil Recipe OK - are you ready? Let's save some money and DIY the heck out of this face oil idea!

It is an AMAZING oil blend for hydrated, glowing skin! (See below for tips for making a custom facial oil for your skin type.)

[Rosehip oil](https://www.amazon.com/Aura-Cacia-Organic-Skin-Care/dp/B00502NMTE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=aura+cacia+rosehip+oil&qid=1552673891&s=gateway&sr=8-5&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=7007037d35cb97b83ab9653189a87da2&language=en_US) - Very fast absorbing and loaded with Vitamin C and A, rosehip oil is popular for aging, mature, and dry skin because it helps with collagen production and reduces the appearance of wrinkles. [Calendula oil](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Calendula-Oil-fl-oz/dp/B01IIIXSIQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=3SUY82ED2O06X&keywords=inesscents+calendula+oil&qid=1552673939&s=gateway&sprefix=inesscents,aps,142&sr=8-3-fkmrnull&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=15d061a50b6a5b2a41a138ca31609330&language=en_US) - [Calendula is an herb known for soothing and healing skin](https://mindfulmomma.com/why-calendula-is-great-for-skin/).

Mixing up your facial oil couldn't be easier. Simply pour the carrier oils into a glass bottle (a [mini stainless steel funnel](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Miniature-Essential-Super-Outlet/dp/B078Z9LWDW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=mini+stainless+steel+funnel+set&qid=1592249916&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzNUVBQzRaVzQ3WkxHJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjE4MDY1M05aN1UxWkdQNjBRMiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTAyMDkwMk9PT09ZQUtZQTBCQiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=54d20f7e0e5901dfd42682dfe43b6e53&language=en_US) comes in handy for this.)
