Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges iiiExECUTIvE SUMMAR yExECUTIvE SUMMAR y Overview The science of understanding how biological systems operate and interact with one another (the biosciences) is increasingly important to global prosperity and quality of life. As the world's population grows, so will the need for more efficient and sustainable ways to grow food, keep people healthy, produce energy, and manufacture biological drugs, therapeutics, and chemicals. These advances can only be realized by gaining a deeper understanding of how biological systems operate\u2014an understanding that depends on advancing the state of the art in biosciences measurement. Despite major breakthroughs and discoveries in recent years, our understanding of biological systems still faces many challenges. Biology is an informational science that depends on accurate measurements and standards. Whether quantifying the amount of protein in a cancer cell or the rate at which an organism converts sugar to alcohol, measurements are the foundation for improving our understanding of biological systems. To identify measurement challenges in the biosciences, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI) co-hosted an international conference, Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges , on October 19-22, 2008, in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Attended by leading bioscience professionals from all over the world, this landmark event was a first-time opportunity to discuss the global measurement and standards challenges to innovation in key bioscience areas (Exhibit E.1). Bioscience practitioners with diverse backgrounds met to share the views of international policymakers, create opportunities for networking and collaboration, and discuss opportunities and challenges. This report provides an overview of the conference and the important ideas generated by experts in the field. Priority Measurement and Standards Challenges An important outcome of the conference is a prioritized list of challenges that can be used to guide future research at NIST and the measurement and standards community worldwide. These priorities are summarized in Exhibit E.2. Exhibit E.1 Conference Focus Areas Agriculture - increasing yield, quality, and safety in the world's food supply Bioenergy - obtaining sustainable energy from biological sources Environment - understanding our planet through linking molecules to ecosystems Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing - obtaining higher quality products through better bioprocess measurements Medicine - improving health through measurement of complex biological signatures Hot Topics - unrecognized, overlooked, underestimated, and often ignored measurement needs in the biosciences, including Agriculture viability Antibiotic and antiviral drug resistance Environmental bioremediation Environmental bioterrorism monitoring Marine versus terrestrial sources of bioenergy Personalized medicine Stem cell therapy Synthetic biology iv Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesAgriculture - Standards and standardized methods are a priority, as they assure confidence and consistency in biological measurements of plant/animal systems and their ecological and environmental interactions. As markets continue to expand globally, international standards will be important to assure worldwide product acceptance. Improved measurement methods are also needed to achieve greater accuracy, speed of measurements and analysis, and real-time, remote capability. Innovative technologies are needed to measure complex biological system parameters, such as water in plants, structures of microbiota, and reversible interactions in living systems. Assimilation and dissemination of data and accessible bioinformatics systems are critical and remain a significant challenge. Sustainable agriculture will require consensus on how to measure sustainability and life-cycle impacts. Ensuring that sustainable practices are attractive to farmers and livestock operators, and communicating the true cost of sustainability, are both key challenges. Bioenergy - Improved characterization methods for various forms of biomass in terms of composition, reliability, quality, and enzyme activity, are needed, particularly for next-generation biofuels. Methods are also needed to monitor the characteristics of biomass in production and harvesting; during conversion processes; and in storage, transport, and delivery. The standardization and sustainability of biofuels is a global challenge that requires nations to work together. Standards are needed to establish the performance and sustainability of biofuels regardless of feedstock. Ensuring consistent measurements and standards across the biofuels supply chain requires an extensive network of measurement methods. While some exist, many others need to be developed, particularly for biomass production. On the production side, characterizing the breakdown mechanisms of and measuring the parameters relevant to the recalcitrance of cellulosic biomass are key challenges to unlocking the energy potential of non-food biomass resources such as perennial grasses, wood energy crops, and agricultural residues.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Agriculture Bioenergy Environment Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing MedicineAnalytical ofagricultural emsBioinformaticsfor agricultureReal-time remoteand non-invasivemeasurements for agriculture ofsystem properties from molecularpropertiesReliable integration of complexenvironmental ta for decision making Next-generationmanufacturing tools In-process and end- product measurementsStandardreference da rence materials and st andardization across platforms Consensus approachesand markers for sampleintegrity Better methodologies and practices for sample handling More robust protein measurements High-throughput multiplexed measurements Improved tools and st andards for bioinformatics Improved tools and st andards to ensure confidence in data and enable comparability across platforms Universal Measurements and Standards NeedsExhibit E.2 Priority Measurement and Standards Challenges for Biosciences Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges vEnvironment - Priority challenges for obtaining system properties involve defining the critical attributes of ecosystems, determining the measures of system health, and identifying the indicators that provide early warning of changes in ecosystem health that are important to sustaining human well-being. Standardized, validated methods for the development and use of biomarkers are currently lacking and are critical to effective early warning systems. Issues such as natural variability, specificity of biomarkers, and variability across environmental conditions impede standardization and need to be addressed. The major challenge to incorporating broad perspective variables (e.g., resource and land use, air and water transport, climate change) will depend on the effective integration of diverse data at different scales, from the molecular to systems level. Effective early warning systems will require an array of measurement technologies ranging from DNA probes to satellites, geographic information systems (GIS), and others. A greater understanding of the links between external drivers and stressors affecting ecosystem health, environmental exposures, and system-level responses is needed as a foundation for an environmental early warning system. This knowledge is impeded by the growing magnitude and diversity of toxins, chemicals, hazardous compounds, pathogens, diseases, and other stressors released into water, air, land, and living systems. New measurements and standards, including sampling methods, are required for toxins, microbial contaminants, pathogens, and many other threats to a healthy environment. Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing - Controlling and monitoring biological manufacturing processes that work with living cells is difficult due to a high degree of uncertainty, both in processing and obtaining desired product attributes. The ability to make measurements in complex matrices in a process environment and obtain samples online and in-process remains a significant challenge. Without understanding the mechanisms behind product variability, obtaining the desired attributes becomes an iterative process. Finding simpler ways to mimic complex systems (e.g., immune system assay), more accurate bioassays, and measuring in vivo changes could improve pathways to reliable product attributes. Tools for measuring system parameters such as structural properties, aggregation, oxidation, and others, will ultimately pave the way for predictive biotechnology and product development. The high cost of measurement remains a significant impediment in today's biomanufacturing environment. Medicine - Developing sampling standards and protocols for the proper processing, handling, and treatment of cells, tissues, and other biological samples is a high priority. Without standard methods, the result is questionable sample integrity, poor reproducibility of results, and difficulty in performing credible analysis. Definitions and standards for phenotype data are also critical; these are needed to help identify, characterize, and predict disease pathways, activity, and disease and treatment outcomes. Standardization of data and assays across biological platforms is a priority, but is hindered by the diversity of platforms and a lack of interoperability and comparability among platforms. There is a need for clear definition of reference points, and improved traceability of measurements to reference points. Information exchange and ensuring consistency of information continues to be a major challenge. Universal Ideas and Observations The universal, crosscutting needs identified across all biosciences are: Better methodologies and practices for sample handling More robust protein measurements High-throughput multiplexed measurements Improved tools and standards for bioinformatics Improved tools and standards to ensure confidence in data and enable comparability across platformsEXECUTIVE SUMMARYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY vi Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesObservations that emerged from the conference include the following: Improvements in the biosciences are key to global economic security and quality of life in the future A much deeper understanding of complex biological systems is needed Highly sophisticated measurements are needed in order to study the relevant changes that occur in complex biomolecular networks Major measurement challenges exist that are stifling innovation in the biosciences Current technology is inadequate due to a very limited measurement infrastructure that allows scientists to have confidence in only a very small percentage of the biomeasurements being conductedNew multiplex, multiparametric measurement technologies must be invented and developed These new measurement systems will rely heavily on the accuracy and comparability of the data obtained from current technologies as a basis upon which to build the new systemsStandardization of current measurement technologies will be needed to enable next-generation systems Standardization of next-generation biomeasurement systems that bridge historical and new data will be needed as new methods emergeEXECUTIVE SUMMARYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 1Importance of Measurement to the Biosciences The science of understanding how biological systems operate and interact with one another (the biosciences) is increasingly important to global prosperity and quality of life.

As a result, there is increased pressure on agriculture and aquaculture to provide affordable, safe, and nutritious foods. New and innovative technologies are being developed to improve crop productivity, enhance crop protection, and increase environmental stress tolerance to help meet growing demands on the agricultural/aquaculture industry. Developing and testing these technologies involves sophisticated measurements on complex biological systems, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The agriculture technical panel and plenary focused on future opportunities and challenges facing this important sector of the biosciences. These discussions produced a potential vision of the future and the broad challenges to be addressed. An important outcome was identification and prioritization of the critical measurement and standards challenges to technology innovation in this field. Overcoming these challenges is critical to increasing the yield, quality, and safety of the world's food supply. vision of the Future In the future, technological advances could lead to significant improvements in the way we grow, produce, and protect our food supply. These will affect more than just the quantity and quality of food supplied. Improvements will be achieved in the nutritional makeup of food (healthier and safer food), the sustainability of food systems (ecological, societal, and environmental), and the scientific ability to design foods that are personalized for individual consumption. Exhibit 2.1 illustrates the concepts put forth to describe some of the future characteristics of agriculture and the food supply. These characteristics embody what could potentially be attained with continued and sustained progress in technological innovation. Technical Panel on Agriculture Increasing yield, quality, and safety in the world's food supply Technical Panel Co-Leaders: (1) Tamas Torok, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; (2) Steven Britz, U.S. Department of Agriculture Plenary Speakers: Pamela Ronald and Raoul Adamchak, University of California, Davis2.0 AGRICULTURE2.0 AGRICULTURE 6 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesBroad Challenges The broad technological challenges identified for agriculture are shown in Exhibit 2.2. These illustrate the importance of better understanding the biology of plants and animals, their interactions with the environment, and their value as sources of food. To improve the quality of the food supply, clarification and consensus is needed on the constituents that are most nutritious and valuable to human health. Other challenges arise in expanding the food supply through aquaculture, which will require a much greater understanding and control of aquatic resources. Promoting a sustainable food supply is a key thread throughout. Future challenges arise in the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and water resources, as well as reducing the carbon footprint and other impacts on air, land, and water.AGRICULTUREAGRICULTURE Exhibit 2.1 Characteristics of the v ision of the Future for Agriculture Technological Advances Systems are in place for more rapid plant breeding (predation-free and disease-free crops, moisture- and salt-resistant crops) Rapid, accurate, complete phytochemical composition analysis is possible, from farm to fork Genetically engineered (GE) agricultural products and crops are readily available Food is engineered for particular nutrients or profiles of nutrients; nutrient intakes are personalized based on genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics Multiparameter measurements in complex biological systems are possible Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with remote sensing of crop stressors have the ability to monitor potentially dangerous productsLeaf pigments/protein: remote monitoring of photosynthetic capacity and nutrient limitation; precision agriculture; production capacity Societal Aspects Technical advancements provide food for 10 billion people in 20, 30, 40 years By 2030, education is available to the public, including farmers and breeders, on the environmental, social, and economic impacts of sustainable agricultureUse of antibiotics in animal agriculture is significantly reduced or eliminated Global Markets and Products Multi-country standards are in use Value of crops is based on compositional characteristics; agriculture becomes more than just a commodity market Sustainability Efficient, safe nutrients and pesticides are used Real-time monitoring and modeling on the ecosystem scale is possible Crops are available to cope with climate change and rising emissions of CO2 Sustainable animal production systems are in use Social and environmental costs (economic, other) of production are considered in design and operation of agricultural systems Solar energy is used as an energy resource for farm systems Carbohydrate profile, structural (i.e., fiber) and non-structural: important to defining nutritionally available energy in human foods and animals feeds; important to biofuel applications Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 7Exhibit 2.2 Broad Technological Challenges for Agriculture Understanding Plants and Their Environments HIGH PRIORITyBioinformatics bottlenecks (communication, controlling vocabulary, data integration, storage analysis, and access to information) Insufficient knowledge of plant biology and ecosystems at the molecular level Inefficient water use MEDIUM PRIORITyNeed to increase \"effective\" yield: move from valuing mass to target components (how to measure effective yield) Dynamic, non-invasive, in situ measurements capable of detecting/monitoring reversible, temporal, and spatial interactions Unintended consequences of GE food or increased yield, such as food safety issues (toxins \" and microbes) Establishing \"best\" targets for plant breeders to focus on Understanding Animals and Their Environments MEDIUM PRIORITyImproved status of animal production efficiency, health, and environmental impact Replacing antibiotics and antimicrobials in animal feed Post Harvest (Identity Preservation) MEDIUM PRIORITy Packaging food in safer ways (fewer contaminants such as heavy metals and toxins) Improved Nutritional Quality HIGH PRIORITy Lack of agreement on valuable nutrients (beyond proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins) MEDIUM PRIORITyImproved methods for measuring phytochemical composition Need to clarify and agree on meat and egg nutritional quality Essential fatty acid (EFA) status altered by limited food intake \" Expanded Aquaculture Capabilities MEDIUM PRIORITyImprovement of fish nutrition and disease control Need to develop algae that satisfy nutrient needs while minimizing water, soil effects (i.e., fewer pesticides, minimized environmental damage) Accounting for problems with invasive species Sustainability HIGH PRIORITyEnabling and encouraging precision agricultural practices Lack of comprehensive monitoring and modeling: water and agricultural chemistry Need to reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture MEDIUM PRIORITyBetter understanding of diseases for the development of \"selective\" pesticides Need to quantify \"local\" hydrology (atmosphere, surface, subsurface) Addressing air quality associated with animal production facilities AGRICULTUREAGRICULTURE 8 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesExhibit 2.3 illustrates the broad non-technological challenges that can impede technological advances to improve the food supply. Appropriate policies, incentives, standards, and regulation can help accelerate and encourage technological advances as appropriate. Communication to promote dissemination of accurate information to the public is a broad challenge that must be addressed. A better understanding of land allocation (and the various benefits and disadvantages) is a key aspect. Consumers need to be better informed about what constitutes a healthy diet, the risks associated with the food supply, and future challenges. Education is an important element. To expand and continue rapid breeding programs, for example, will require rebuilding the plant breeding work force. Due to breakthroughs in nanotechnology and other areas, agriculture and food are increasingly multi-disciplinary and will require greater input from disciplines not traditionally involved in this field. Role of Measurement Measurements and standards play a key role in the agricultural sector, from plant genetics to production and harvest. Exhibit 2.4 illustrates the measurement parameters of interest and why they are important to better understanding and improving agricultural systems.Exhibit 2.3 Broad Non-Technological Challenges for Agriculture Policies/Regulations HIGH PRIORITyPolicies needed for rapid plant and animal breeding: Smart regulation \" Consistent international policies \" Government incentives to reduce cost \" Clarify/identify appropriate standards MEDIUM PRIORITyAddressing identified concerns about achieving national food security Internalizing environmental costs Communication MEDIUM PRIORITyLack of public participation in allocating land Competing considerations for food, energy, \"nature\", living space \" Public perception of risk Need for improved diet education Increasing population and its implications Inability of consumers to make fully informed decisions about food consumption Inadequate education and information about products Education MEDIUM PRIORITyNeed to rebuild plant breeding work force Multi-disciplinary educational requirements for new technology AGRICULTUREAGRICULTURE Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 9Exhibit 2.4 Key Measurements to Support Technological Innovation in Agriculture Understanding Plants and Their Environment Gene expression : important part of expanding necessary information on biological systems Stomatal conductance : supports primary production and remote monitoring of photosynthesis and water supply Genome plus environment, which equates to phenotype : relation between plant and environment, to predict plant response and pathogen geography (timely, effective, efficient treatment) Photosynthetic partitioning and yield, genetics, CO 2, environment : biotic/abiotic stress Microbial community structure/activities : space and time, intimate part of plant environment, safety Environmental microbial baseline : finding human pathogens among background microbiota Reversible short-time interactions of living systems (massively parallel) : understand multi-tasking Remote sensing : sensors for quantifying specific stressors (nutrient, disease, weeds, etc.); ecosystem health assessment larger- scale linkage Leaf pigments/protein : remote monitoring of photosynthetic capacity and nutrient limitation; precision agriculture; production capacity Understanding Animals and Their Environment Fertility and reproduction in animals : improved food supply Antibiotic resistance : safety and health of animals Post Harvest (Identity Preservation) GE protein in food : analysis of food components Standardized database of food components (baseline, seasonal, geography) : compare GE and traditional plants Toxicity of biomaterial : ensure food safety Microbiota : interactions between food-borne microbes and consumer Traceability of food, with rapid track back to origin of problems : food safety, quality Rapid mycotoxin analysis : critical to food safety Improved Nutritional Quality Phytochemical composition in foodstuffs : relation to genetics, environmental impacts Effects of phytochemicals on humans : impacts on cells, organisms Lipid composition : fats and oils are approximately 1/3 of energy intake; nutritional quality/absorption is related to lipid class and fatty acid content Amino acid profile rapid analysis : building blocks of protein critical to growth and therefore important to formulating animal production feeds Seed composition : more details will enhance crop quality Blood proteins for efficacy : what's good/bad, most non-invasive, multiple proteins Natural antioxidants : foods contain a host of antioxidants important for food stability; many are undefined, qualitative analysis is needed Carbohydrate profile, structural (i.e., fiber) and non-structural : important to defining nutritionally available energy in human foods and animal feeds; important to biofuel applications Expanded Aquaculture Capabilities Metagenomics of water environment : proteomics Environmental sensitivities : viability of aquacultureAGRICULTUREAGRICULTURE 10 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesExhibit 2.5 illustrates some of the measurements that are important to sustainable agriculture and particularly to reducing or mitigating pollution from farms. In general, this area was recognized as a high priority for measurements. Sustainability is becoming a key challenge as the industry looks to increase yields, quality, and nutrients without increasing environmental and other detrimental impacts. Measurement also plays a role in policy and regulation. For example, to assure the biosafety and acceptance of GE crops, relevant functional assays are needed to support regulation. The challenges to accomplishing this are very complex. Measurement is also essential to communication of information about the food supply to the public. Confidence in food-related measurement helps assuage public concerns about food safety and enables consumers to make well-informed decisions. Measurements and Standards Challenges The key challenges related to measurements and standards for agriculture are illustrated in Exhibit 2.6. While these are not comprehensive lists of the measurement needs facing agriculture, they provide a starting point for some of the key challenges from a biosciences perspective. Standards and Standardized Methods. A central theme is assuring confidence and consistency in biological measurements of plant/animal systems and their ecological and environmental interactions. Consensus among users of measurements and analytical tools is a critical aspect. Current methodologies have considerable variability and inconsistency among laboratories and within the user community. As the global aspects of markets continue to increase, international standards will be important to assure worldwide product acceptance and understanding of key parameters.Exhibit 2.5 Key Measurements to Support Sustainability in Agriculture Mitigating Environmental Impacts from Farms Sustainability measurements : recognition of good practices in the marketplace and promotion of sustainable practices Carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with organic and conventional production practices : accessible database for carbon offsets Preferential fluid dynamics : although active only a fraction of the time, this process is responsible for up to 90% of pesticides reaching ground water Rapid analysis of phytate phosphorous : animal nutrition and environmental effects Fast analysis of potential human pathogens in waste used for fertilizer or compost : safety of raw produce Manure nutrient profile : animal waste profiles and environmental impacts Animal feed conversion ratio : improved precision of feed formulations (less waste) Land Use and Soil Sustainability Indirect land use change : assessment of environmental/societal/economic externalities Degraded land : identification of where and how improved land use is possible Rapid soil nutrient analysis : soil nutrient mapping and fertilizer application as part of a precision agriculture system Soil-water dynamics (surface and subsurface hydrology) : water drives plant growth and chemical transport and behaviorAGRICULTUREAGRICULTURE Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 11Exhibit 2.6 Measurement and Standards Challenges for Agriculture Standards and Standardized Methods HIGH PRIORITyBetter sampling methods and sample processing methods robust enough for complex samples (environmental, food, animal) Reference materials for field testing devices Acceptance of standard method, if developed, by those using independent or in-house methodsInternational standards for compounds: protein, microbe analysis (threshold, standard method) MEDIUM PRIORITyResolution of analytical variation (actual lab-to-lab and within a lab), with practical value Achieving consensus among those who use analytical tools and make decisions based on the valuesLack of knowledge of where to \"sense\" an agricultural environment (where to sample and reflect environmental risk) Technological Improvements to Measurements/Methods HIGH PRIORITyFertility tests and standards, with knowledge transfer to industry to improve animal and plant science\"Shotgun\" lipidomics as a quantitative tool Requires an array of stable-isotope labeled standards for various lipid class, molecular \" species Ineffective existing methods for chemical composition\u2014time consuming and often require extraction, which may generate errorsMethods to assess carbon flux in plants\u2014real-time (e.g., carbon-11) High-throughput molecular breeding technology Classification and enumeration of high-complexity microbial communities MEDIUM PRIORITyRemote estimates of soil moisture/chemistry are too uncertain to use for optimizing irrigation Prion screening Identification and classification of microorganisms; species concept and lateral gene transfer Robust remote quantitative sensor for canopy photosynthetic capacity (not normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) to identify stressQuantified uncertainty and representative measurements that monitor the environment (soil water dynamics, flow processes, etc.)Detection of multiple proteins in complex mixtures (cheap, rapid, sensitive) High-throughput fatty acid analysis including robotic derivatization (transmethylation), columns/methods for ultra-fast gas chromatography (GC) analysis, and software for automated data analysis Measurement Innovation HIGH PRIORITyRemote quantitative sensor for plant water status Nanotechnology devices for rapid detection (field devices) MEDIUM PRIORITyIn vivo , r eal-time measurements in an intact system Measurement of reversible interactions in multi-tasking living systems Measurement of microbiota structure and function Quantification of subsoil stratigraphyAGRICULTUREAGRICULTURE 12 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesTechnological Improvements to Measurement Methods. Primary challenges appear to be the need for greater accuracy, broader capabilities, speed of measurements and analysis, and the ability to take measurements both in real time and remotely. Improvements to measurement methods could provide new insights on plant and animal breeding, the value and use of lipids and fats, and the complexities of microbial communities. Enhanced monitoring of the environmental interactions among plant and animal systems could increase the capability to identify stresses on the environment and produce new knowledge to enhance plant and animal science and engineering. Measurement Innovation. The complexity of the biological systems involved creates a unique challenge that will require innovation in measurement methods, particularly for measuring water in plants, structures of microbiota, and reversible interactions occurring among living systems. New technologies such as nanotechnology could potentially be applied to develop new measurement methods that may help answer some of the key questions pertaining to plant and animal systems. Sustainable Agriculture. Exhibit 2.7 illustrates some of the key measurement challenges related to developing and promoting the use of sustainable agricultural practices. One of the major challenges is identifying and coming to consensus on the minimal set of data that is needed to define and monitor sustainability, as well as to examine the life-cycle impacts. There are also significant challenges in understanding and communicating the true costs of sustainability (as well as non-sustainability), and ensuring that sustainable practices are practical for farmers and livestock operators. This means sustainable practices must be easy to implement and use, require a low level of training, and give reproducible results. Priority Measurement Topics The measurement challenges illustrated in Exhibit 2.6 provide the foundation for a set of three priority measurement focus areas for agriculture that aim to address these challenges. Collectively, panel members determined: the importance of the focus area, objectives in addressing it, a potential approach, and stakeholder roles. They also rated the technological and commercial risks and the impacts of action in five categories. Their findings are reflected in Exhibits 2.7-2.9. These focus areas address some of the most critical challenges that have been identified for agriculture. Many focus on improved data processing and analysis, making accurate measurement and information accessibility essential to overcoming these challenges. The priorities also reflect a need for new measurement technologies and standards to support a new level of quality and functionality in next-generation agriculture.Exhibit 2.6 Measurement and Standards Challenges (cont.)

The production of alternative fuels from renewable, non-food biological feedstocks, therefore remains an important component of any future alternative energy strategy, and offers potential for addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Biodiesel produced from oil-rich algae or the recombinant or synthetic biology-based production of next-generation biofuels are examples of more sustainable sources of bioenergy currently under development. Measurements and standards are a critical aspect of biofuels at every stage of development, from basic research in plant science and genetics, to the distribution and delivery of biofuels to consumers. The energy technical panel and plenary focused on future opportunities and challenges for sustainable production of non-food-based biofuels. Group discussions produced a potential vision of the future and the broad challenges to be addressed. They then identified and prioritized the critical measurement and standards challenges to the development and use of next-generation biofuels. Overcoming these challenges will be critical to establishing and maintaining the feedstock production, conversion, and delivery infrastructure needed to ensure that renewable biomass is a viable energy supply option. vision of the Future It is expected that bioenergy, and particularly biofuels, will increasingly become an established part of the energy infrastructure. While today most biofuels are made from corn (ethanol) and soy beans (biodiesel), next-generation biofuels produced from non-food sources will dominate in the future. While biofuels will not be the only alternative transportation energy option, they will be an important component along with electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, and others. Exhibit 3.1 illustrates the concepts and characteristics of the vision of the future for biofuels. Attaining this vision will depend highly on the development and deployment of new biochemical and thermochemical technologies to convert non-food biomass resources (e.g., cellulosic biomass, algae) into viable fuels, chemicals, and materials. It is envisioned that integrated biorefineries of the future will routinely produce a wide slate of products from a diversity of feedstocks such as perennial grasses, woody energy crops, agricultural and forestry residues, and even industrial and consumer wastes.

The most critical challenges relate to technology development, specifically solving the recalcitrance problems of cellulosic biomass. Effective, economical pretreatment and conversion technologies, both biochemical and thermochemical, will be needed to successfully use non-food biomass such as perennial grasses, crop residues, and wood. BIOENERGYBIOENERGY Exhibit 3.1 Characteristics of the v ision of the Future for Bioenergy Energy Security and Infrastructure A significant portion of transportation fuels are derived from sustainable, domestically produced biofuels 75% of fossil fuels are replaced with bio-based sources via a variety of fuels and blends Biofuels provide a significant source of clean, long-distance, and heavy-duty transportation fuels A robust national infrastructure promotes expanded use of biofuels (and flex-fuel engines) Technological Advances Engines have been modified to make better use of biofuels Oil/hydrocarbons are produced directly from plants Direct conversion of sunlight to bio-based energy is possible (e.g., via genetic engineering) Biocatalysis provides new routes to chemicals Integrated biorefineries use proven biochemical and thermochemical technologies and diverse feedstocks to produce a variety of products Global Market and Products Advances in biomanufacturing and co-products create new markets and products Enzymes and bacteria for biochemical production of biofuels are traded as commodities; clear standards and certified reference materials (CRMs) are available to assess organism potency for production of biofuels Global biodiesel/ethanol standards independent of feedstock are in use Global production and use of liquid biofuels from optimized bio-refineries increase, and such refineries are responsive to regionally appropriate standards The cost of energy from renewable biomass is less than the cost of energy from oil and coal National laws on fuel quality and testing assure marketability Societal Aspects Long-term public commitment to biofuels beyond economics is a primary driver of development and deployment Consumers have a wider choice of economic transportation fuels Sustainability Life-cycle analyses are available for expanded uses and types of biofuels Bioenergy is integrated with other sectors (e.g., buildings) on a local basis to improve sustainability (e.g., lawn clippings into fuel) Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 19Exhibit 3.2 Broad Technological Challenges for Bioenergy Technology Development HIGH PRIORITyEconomical conversion technologies (enzymes, gasification, products) for processing cellulosic biomass Better catalysts for cellulosic biofuels Genetic engineering for more efficient production Catalysts for chemical production from biomass residues Optimized, integrated biorefining systems MEDIUM PRIORITy New biology for more efficient use of solar energy and acreage (microbes and algae) LOWER PRIORITyAddressing the energy-water nexus (water and biomass sources, biorefining) Optimizing energy inputs into process (e.g., fertilizer, process heat) Efficient separation technology for end products Feedstock Production, Storage and Transport MEDIUM PRIORITyLand use\u2014optimizing fuel/acre efficiency Multi-feedstock plants LOWER PRIORITy Assurance of feedstock supply and storage Distribution and Delivery Infrastructure HIGH PRIORITy Infrastructure to deploy biofuels (transporting, storing, blending, dispensing) MEDIUM PRIORITy Fleet availability (engine development) LOWER PRIORITyStandards and regulations (logistics) Optimization of infrastructure, i.e., supplies, production, distribution, and utilization; including byproducts Methods and Standards Infrastructure MEDIUM PRIORITyLocal production/utilization, transport costs, point-source pollution Global standards addressing regional and other barriers Need for rapid, precise, and inexpensive methods and certified reference materials LOWER PRIORITy Harmonization of standards for different feedstocks Sustainability HIGH PRIORITySustainability of bio-feedstocks, from dirt to delivery Robust LCA methodology to enable fair comparison with oil, agriculture, and cattle MEDIUM PRIORITyDefining and measuring sustainability across all relevant areas Yield sustainability\u2014biomass replacement, water use, other resources Effects of urbanization on farmland and other indirect impacts on land Limits of recyclability of materials on manufacturing options for bioproducts BIOENERGYBIOENERGY 20 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesDistribution and delivery infrastructure also presents a critical issue, particularly as the volume of biofuels begins to increase. The current infrastructure needs to be expanded and improved to handle large volumes of next-generation biofuels. The infrastructure for transporting and storing biomass feedstocks is also insufficient and needs to be upgraded. Standards are needed both upstream to identify the quality and specifications of perishable biomass feedstocks from production through transport and storage, and downstream to specify fuel quality from the plant gate to vehicle use. Exhibit 3.3 illustrates the broad non-technological challenges to achieving the promise of next-generation biofuels. Public perception is a key issue; strong science and education are needed to increase public understanding and dispel misperceptions about biofuels. Market push and pull continue to be a challenge for biofuels. Next-generation biofuels based on non-food biomass are not cost effective given today's technology, and capital and operating costs are high. Price-enabled products are needed to trigger demand and ensure continued investments from the commercial sector. Loan guarantees and other incentives may help to push biofuels forward until new technology becomes more mature. For the industry to become established, stable development infrastructure must be created and sustained over the long term. The presence of a stable, educated workforce; funding to support long-term R&D as well as near-term demonstration projects; and coordination of information and other efforts at the federal, state, and local levels are all important elements of the needed infrastructure. Even though substantial investments have already been made, continued investment by the public and private sectors will be needed to move next-generation technologies into the marketplace. While cellulosic ethanol technologies are on the immediate horizon, there will be a significant lag between construction and operation of the first-generation plants and optimized operation of integrated biorefineries.

As illustrated in Exhibit 3.4, metrology is needed to support all aspects of the supply chain, from feedstock production and harvesting, to biomass conversion processes and eventual consumer use in vehicles.

These are not intended to be all-inclusive of the measurement needs that must be addressed for bioenergy. However, they provide a starting point for identifying some of the key challenges facing the emerging biofuels industry.

There is an immediate need to improve characterization methods for various forms of biomass in terms of composition, reliability, quality, and enzyme activity, particularly for next- generation biofuels. Methods are needed to monitor the characteristics of biomass in production and harvesting; during conversion processes; and after storage, transport, and delivery. In the long term, it would be desirable to be able to understand and monitor issues related to toxicity, reliably identify the renewable fraction of a biofuel in situ , and identify the originating feedstock. Documentary Standards. Standards are needed to establish the performance and sustainability of biofuels, regardless of the type of feedstock used. Sustainability is an issue that should be addressed in the near term, particularly by defining sustainability parameters. Defining sustainability for both the biofuels already in the marketplace and next-generation biofuels continues to be a challenge worldwide. The standardization of highly complex mixtures, such as oils containing a variety of triglycerides, is problematic because of the many combinations possible, although this could potentially be addressed via development of standards using surrogate mixtures. Harmonization of Measurements and Standards. Ensuring consistent measurements and standards across the biofuels supply chain requires an extensive network of measurement methods and techniques. While portions of this network are already in place, new components will need to be developed, particularly for biomass production and quality assurance. The measurement infrastructure also needs to accommodate next-generation biofuels as they begin to enter the market. With the global market for biofuels steadily increasing, a high priority is to establish a measurement and standards framework and infrastructure that are harmonious across nations. This will ensure that the United States can potentially export and import biofuels and bioproducts as well as biomass feedstocks. Priority Measurement Topics The measurement challenges illustrated in Exhibit 3.5 provide the foundation for a set of five priority measurement focus areas for bioenergy that aim to address these challenges. Collectively, panel members determined: the importance of the focus area, objectives in addressing it, a potential approach, and stakeholder roles. They also rated the technological and commercial risks and the impacts of action in five categories. Their findings are reflected in Exhibits 3.6-3.10. These focus areas address some of the most critical challenges that have been identified for bioenergy. Many concentrate on standards and references, making compatibility and consensus essential to overcoming these challenges. The priorities also reflect a need for new measurement technologies to support a new level of quality and functionality in next-generation bioenergy.BIOENERGYBIOENERGY 24 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesBIOENERGYBIOENERGY Exhibit 3.6 Priority Measurement Topic The lack of standard reference data for bioenergy process design, optimization, and policy is slowing development of these technologies.

For example, introduction of \"new\" pollutants (e.g., prescription drugs and metabolites, new-generation pesticides, and flame retardants) may impair natural processes and degrade environmental quality. These unintended consequences of environmental alterations on global ecosystems have the potential to adversely affect human well-being, including public health, economic sustainability, and the resilience of communities and cultures. It is critical that early warning systems to assess the status and trends of the environment and identify potential threats to ecosystems and human well-being be established at local, regional, national, and global scales before irreparable harm ensues. To mitigate these risks, identification of environmental quality and public health indicators, and development of new measurement and testing technologies and methods, including sampling procedures and sensor systems, will be required. The environment technical panel and plenary focused on exploring the potential measurement, standards, and technological challenges that must be overcome to establish and implement the required early warning systems. The panel identified the technological advances required to distinguish natural environmental changes from those resulting from anthropogenic activities. The following sections describe the results of the technical panel discussions, including a potential vision of the future and broad challenges that need to be addressed. The prioritized critical measurement and standards challenges to technology innovation identified by the committee must be overcome to create and sustain environmental early warning systems that contribute to sustaining healthy ecosystems and human well-being. vision of the Future In the future, it is envisioned that systems for monitoring and tracking the state of the environment will quantitatively measure ecosystem health in near real time through advances in technology and measurement methods. Interoperable and networked information management systems and models will translate the complex data obtained into information valued by other sectors and environmental decision makers. It is possible that a \"P4 medicine\" approach, described by Dr. Leroy Hood in his Medicine plenary lecture, could be achieved for the environment (predictive, preventive, place-specific, and participatory) where information from environmental early warning systems is combined with the prognosis and treatment of potentially endangered ecosystems. Exhibit 4.1 illustrates some of the characteristics of the future of the environment that could help sustain early warning systems. Measurement technologies\u2014new and improved\u2014play a key role in all of the concepts shown.

Some of the greatest challenges relate to our lack of a mechanistic understanding of the linkages between human activities, environmental threat, ecosystem processes, and human well-being. Currently, there is little agreement on what to measure and how to measure it to characterize environmental health. New tools and methods are needed to increase knowledge and understanding of complex ecosystems and how they interact to sustain human well-being. The impacts of anthropogenic activity on the environment can be significant, and ideally should be predicted and understood in advance, rather than addressed retrospectively. Another critical challenge is effectively assimilating and integrating the large amounts of multi-disciplinary data required for a reliable early warning system. The complexity of ecosystems and resulting information presents considerable challenges if the data are to be used for decision-making in a timely way. Communication of information in general is an issue, particularly among different disciplines, scientific communities, and with the public and private sectors. Overall, the non-linear, dynamic state of the environment and ecosystems represents an overarching challenge that adds to the complexity of forecasting potential issues and impacts before they occur.ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT Exhibit 4.1 Characteristics of the v ision of the Future for Environment Measurement Science and Technology Analytical methods for assessing environmental health that are quantitative, specific, and standardized are available for application for a range of spatial and temporal scales Broadly applicable, rapid molecular biology tools are used to measure toxins, pathogens, biodiversity (microbes to communities), and organism healthNetworked real-time sensors feed information about toxins, pathogens, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes into web-based databases where reliable models convert the complex data into information useful for environmental decision-making Advanced databases and IT systems support for centralized knowledge and information exchange Predictive Modeling and Simulation Models that describe structure-property-function relations and connectivity from molecules and ecosystems are developed and used to identify key environmental quality indicators and measurementsNew modeling approaches improve capabilities for forecasting and hindcasting changes in environmental conditions Ecosystem Health Services and Products Rapid, accurate, qualitative, objective measures of ecosystems enable P4 (predictive, preventive, place-specific, participatory) management of ecosystems The connectivity between a healthy environment and human well-being and quality of life is understood and valued by society Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 31Exhibit 4.2 Broad Technological Challenges for Environment Defining Complex Ecosystems and Health HIGH PRIORITyRapid and reliable real-time results for key environmental quality indicators that bridge historical and new measurement approaches Lack of reference materials for key environmental quality indicators (toxins, strains, genetic sequences) Difficulties in making new technologies user-friendly (kits, dipsticks, indices) from local to global scales Lack of reliable and rapid methods for assessing pathogen risks and virulence MEDIUM PRIORITyAccepted and standardized procedure for validation of new measurement methods at multiple spatial and temporal scales with fewer false positives Standardized sample processing (concentrating, extracting, purifying) for molecular level indicators LOWER PRIORITy Lack of fast, cheap approaches or tools for measuring ecosystem health, including biodiversity Impacts of Commercial Activity HIGH PRIORITyTechnology transfer to client communities (commerce, government, management, public at large) Prevention/prediction of environmental problems before they occur Non-linearity/dynamic state of ecosystems MEDIUM PRIORITyAddressing potential issues early on, during development stages (research to application); enacting regulations in advance using forecasting toolsAdoption of new approaches and methods at local scales/field level LOWER PRIORITyUnderstanding of new product performance and prediction of unintended impact on environmentForecasting and addressing climate change (highest priority in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development/Working Party on Biotechnology [OECD/WPB]) Complex Data Integration/Processing HIGH PRIORITyInterdisciplinary environmental measurements represent multiple spatial and temporal scales and are difficult to integrate Reliable forecasting tools and predictive models for environmental stresses do not exist and modes of action are poorly understood for many stressors MEDIUM PRIORITy Difficulty measuring the non-linearity and dynamic nature of ecosystems Communications HIGH PRIORITyThe perception that environmental health is not important and is antithetical to the economy and human well-being Inadequate mechanisms and systems for communicating environmental data across sectors and disciplines MEDIUM PRIORITyEngagement of the commercial sector to become proactive in protecting ecosystem health and services LOWER PRIORITy Interdisciplinary communications require a common language/terminology ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT 32 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesRole of Measurement Exhibit 4.3 illustrates the measurements that are important to building early warning systems for the environment, particularly those relevant to system properties and ecosystem health. Important measurement areas include (1) explanatory variables and external drivers that provide information about the environmental setting and the external environmental and socio-economic factors that affect ecosystem characteristics (climate change, land and resource use, extreme events such as hurricanes, and the degree and type of pollution); (2) biomarkers, diagnostics, and exposure measures that provide information about threats or factors that affect environmental condition and health; and (3) broader system properties (biodiversity, food, and biomass/fiber production) that are critical to sustaining ecosystem functions and services and support human well-being. Identification of system properties was particularly problematic because no generally accepted definition of ecosystem health exists and many ecosystem services are undervalued by society (waste processing, food and biomass/fiber production, climate and flood control). Exhibit 4.3 Key Ecosystem Measurements for Environmental Early Warning Systems Explanatory v ariables and External Drivers Identification and characterization of stressors: resource and land use, pollution, extreme events, invasive species, and climate change External drivers and inputs: atmospheric and hydrographic processes, inputs of key materials Bulk physical and chemical properties: temperature, oxygen levels, and other environmental quality parameters Full life-cycle carbon budget: cradle-to-grave understanding of interactions with climate Historical and current data: retrospective analysis, evaluation of trends Biomarkers/Diagnostics/Exposure Measures Degree of environmental contamination and stress : levels of chemical pollutants, toxins, and pathogens in the environment Contaminant fate and effects : threshold values for new and emerging pollutants, mixtures of pollutants, pathogen abundance and virulence Identification of threshold values and limits for exposures : pollutant concentrations that affect critical biological functions Abundance and genetic profiles of key pathogens and other toxin-producing organisms : improved assessment of risk and virulence, genetic markets of toxicity and virulence Species identification and organism identity : microbes to higher taxa (group in class of organisms) Genetic profiles of pathogens and other microbes : presence of virulence or toxin-producing genes Extreme and unanticipated occurrences or events : extreme wildlife mortalities, persistent toxic algae blooms, and presence of invasive organisms Human exposures and health effects : contaminant levels in food products and recreational waters System Properties Biodiversity at multiple levels : community, specific taxa, and molecular Health of sentinel organisms : population and disease status, physiological state, metabolic signatures, and reproductive condition Rates of key processes : food and fiber production, material transformations and processing Change in ecosystem services that affects human well-being : flood control, food or fiber harvest levels, and human illness and diseaseENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 33Supporting or explanatory measurements provide important ancillary information for developing preventive and remediation strategies and identify external drivers and factors that affect ecosystem health that are well beyond the immediate system boundaries and sphere of influence. Biomarkers and other diagnostic indicators are important to identification, characterization, prevention, and treatment of adverse environmental changes. For example, biomarkers can be used to identify potential for disease, determine the virulence and fate of harmful organisms or pathogens, and assess the potential for toxic releases. Exposure measurements provide information about the actual degree of contamination and other stresses the biological components of an ecosystem experience. Evaluating system responses to multiple stressors, such as complex mixtures of chemical pollutants, is important because synergistic interactions often result in effects which far exceed the additive effects of the substances composing the mixture. Information about the effects of multiple stressors provides input to models that improve predictions of potential impacts on health, safety, and environmental condition. Overall system measurements are those ecosystem attributes that are most directly connected to ecosystem attributes and services that affect human health and well-being. For example, the health of sentinel species, like fish and marine mammals, may provide early warning and better understanding of potential threats to human health and well-being. Measurements and Standards Challenges The key challenges related to measurements and standards for environmental early warning systems are illustrated in Exhibits 4.4 and 4.5. These are not intended to be all-inclusive for the measurement needs that must be addressed for this important field. However, they provide a starting point for identifying and prioritizing some of the key challenges that must be addressed. Explanatory v ariables. The major challenge to incorporating broad perspective variables (e.g., resource and land use, air and water transport, global patterns) will depend on effective integration of a diversity of data at different scales, from the molecular to ecosystem levels. This will require an array of measurement technologies ranging from DNA probes to satellites, geographic information systems, and others. Collecting and integrating multi-disciplinary data at these scales will require a significant investment for research, development, demonstration and deployment of new technologies, data gathering, and modeling. Exposures and Stressors. Greater understanding of the linkages among external drivers and stressors affecting ecosystem health, environmental exposures, and system-level responses is needed as an underlying foundation for an environmental early warning system. Gaining this knowledge is impeded by the growing magnitude and diversity of toxins, chemicals, hazardous compounds, pathogens, diseases, and other stressors released into water, air, land, and living systems. The impacts of multiple stressors and complex mixtures is particularly problematic and must be measured and understood to forecast and effectively remediate system responses and sustain ecosystem services critical to human well-being. New measurements and standards, including sampling methods, could be required for toxins, pathogens, and other stressors. Biomarkers. Standardized, validated methods for the development and use of biomarkers are currently lacking and are critical for the proper incorporation of biosciences into early warning systems. Issues such as natural variability, specificity of biomarkers, variability across environmental conditions, accountability for regional differences within and among species, and other challenges which impede standardization have to be addressed. System Indicators and Properties. Priority challenges for obtaining system properties involve first defining what constitutes the ecosystem, determining the measures of system health, and identifying the indicators that provide early warning of changes in ecosystem health, or services that are important to sustaining ecosystem health and human well-being. Once defined, a variety of challenges remain in obtaining the system-level measurements needed, such as characterization of biodiversity at the molecular level, assessment of the health status of sentinel organisms, effective utilization of remote sensing systems, ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT 34 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesExhibit 4.4 Measurement and Standards Challenges for Environment Early Warning Systems System Properties HIGH PRIORITyDefinition of the components and indicators of ecosystem health and services Species definition from a molecular perspective: appropriate level of similarity Assurance of temporal/geographic stability of indicator or diagnostic responses MEDIUM PRIORITyThe non-steady state, non-linear aspects of ecosystems and environment Remote-sensing technology to provide molecular- to system-scale measurements\u2014requires technology development and ability to interpret hyperspectral signatures Availability of repositories for cells, tissues, and cultures Reproducibility of measurement results across researchers, platforms, and users Establishment of a standard and supplemental catalog for biologic component identification at all levels (molecular-ecosystem/biomedical)Difficulty with biological sample stability and archiving when compared to chemicals Handling natural bio-variability in protein characterization and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)/ post-translational modifications (PTM) System Indicators HIGH PRIORITyCharacterization and quantification of a \"healthy\" ecosystem, community, or organism Lack of accepted measures of sentinel organism health Difficulty validating metagenomic analysis Identification of crucial system-level parameter(s) MEDIUM PRIORITyNet carbon sequestration or emissions by natural or managed ecosystems Availability of inexpensive, reliable, non-satellite-based remote sensing technologies LOWER PRIORITy Effective method for identifying reliable sentinel organisms Biomarkers HIGH PRIORITyDifficulties with biomarkers (e.g., some are species-specific; current standards and reference materials may not apply; regional differences may exist within species) Validated methods for multiple biomarkers (metabolite patterns) for stress and disease MEDIUM PRIORITyPoor comparability of proteomics measurements Missing reference materials for quality assurance/calibration Lack of reliable generic biomarkers for organism \"stress\", including disease Explanatory v ariables MEDIUM PRIORITyData integration from molecular to system level\u2014technology ranging from DNA probe to satellite imagerySufficient investment in technology Exposures and Stressors LOWER PRIORITyAvailability of more certified toxin standards Pathogen concentration/extraction from environmental samples Validation of cell-line culture viability/virulence during archival for use in later response studies Predicting emerging pathogens arising from climate change Methods for measuring emerging contaminants/metabolites in water, sediment, and tissues, given a continuously changing compound listLimited data and methods for toxicity of mixed and new chemicals Lack of methods/standards for many harmful algal bloom (HAB)-related toxins ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 35attainment of accurate measurements, and assurance of the integrity and fitness-for-purpose of biological samples. Development of system-scale indicators and property measurements will be a mid- to long-term endeavor due to the complexity of ecosystems. As Exhibit 4.5 illustrates, there are a number of critical crosscutting measurement and standards challenges that should be addressed to enable the development of environmental early warning systems. Standardization of methods and measurements is a key aspect. One of the most important issues to be resolved is reconciling differences between old and new measurements and developing new standards where they are needed. Other key challenges involve handling the large amounts of information required at different scales, ensuring validity of data, coordinating with existing efforts in different disciplines/agencies, and building a foundation of widely applicable molecular-level measurement tools such as biomarkers, genetic probes, and microarrays. Other challenges arise in the comparability of measurement results, and the effective linking of different environmental parameters to enable appropriate decision-making.ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT Exhibit 4.5 Crosscutting Measurement and Standards Challenges for Envir onmental Early Warning Systems HIGH PRIORITyReconciling differences between new and old measurements and developing additional standards and methods where needed Identification of appropriate genetic markers for biological groups of interest Securing the needed resources for personnel, funding, and technological advances Building/maintenance of a repository of certified reference genetic probes for species, certified nucleic acid probes, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primersGreater coordination/synergy among bioinformatics initiatives and related efforts Reliability and consistency of measurement results over broad spatial and temporal scales: from pipette to biome, from microseconds to centuries MEDIUM PRIORITyComparability of measurement results for toxins, pathogens, diseases, and molecular tools Measurement bias\u2014amplification and inhibition of specific properties Education/training on measurement data quality from local to global scales Understanding linkages of environmental parameters: pathogen presence, appropriate genotype and virulence, risk of diseaseFailure to exploit advances in other fields (weather, climate) and apply to environmental measurements and forecasting (leveraging IT advances, intelligence/knowledge sharing) LOWER PRIORITyLack of disease definitions/descriptions and ways to disseminate disease data Building/sharing of authenticated sequence libraries Large number of anthropogenic chemicals being recognized as \"emerging contaminants\" Economical methods for bulk toxin production and purification36 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT Priority Measurement Topics The measurement challenges illustrated in Exhibits 4.4 and 4.5 provide the foundation for a set of three priority measurement focus areas for environmental early warning systems that aim to address these challenges. Collectively, panel members determined: the importance of the focus area, objectives in addressing it, a potential approach, and stakeholder roles. They also rated the technological and commercial risks and the impacts of action in five categories. Their findings are reflected in Exhibits 4.6-4.8. These focus areas address some of the most critical challenges that have been identified for environmental early warning systems. They cover a spectrum of measurements needed to support the availability of ecosystem health indicators and the quantification and integration of complex environmental data. The priorities also reflect a need for new measurement technologies and standards to support a new level of quality and functionality in next-generation environmental early warning systems.

While technological advances and scientific discoveries are accelerating change and driving innovation in the commercial biomanufacturing sector, the manufacture of many biological products depends on technologies that have remained the same for years. Keeping pace with societal demands for therapeutics, energy, and other biobased goods and services will require innovative approaches that in turn depend on the availability of transformative tools for product characterization and measurement, manufacturing engineering, and knowledge management. The biopharmaceutical manufacturing technical panel and plenary focused on identifying critical capabilities for biomanufacturing. Participants sought to highlight where new or novel metrology methods, standards, and technologies are needed to help blaze the path to 21 st century biomanufacturing systems that are risk- based, efficient, agile (high-throughput), flexible, and focused on quality. Panel discussions produced a potential vision of the future and the broad challenges to be addressed. An important outcome was identification and prioritization of the critical measurement and standards challenges to technology innovation in this field. Overcoming these challenges will be critical to ensuring that measurement technology is available to keep pace with and support technological innovations in biomanufacturing. vision of the Future In the future, it is envisioned that technological advances could lead to a range of improvements in biomanufacturing and enable production of biological products more cost effectively and reliably. Greater understanding of biological properties, the manufacturing process, and product variables will enable greater process control, the use of standardized platforms, and more flexibility in processing and products. Innovations such as cell-free manufacturing, seamless scale-up of new product lines, standardized platform technologies (bioreactors, cell lines), and new methods for manufacturing regenerative medicine products (e.g., stem cell therapies) will enable faster realization of emerging concepts such as personalized/niche drugs and customized biotherapies.

These illustrate the need for better understanding of the manufacturing process. Today this is largely an iterative, slow process that involves trial and error and then feedback to incorporate improvements. The inherent uncertainty of biological processes sometimes makes it difficult to predict or control processing outcomes and product quality, and to scaleup new processes. The quality-assurance tools available to other types of manufacturing (e.g., chemicals, food) are practically nonexistent for biological manufacturing processes. Tools that measure performance, diagnose quality issues, and evaluate products are needed to enable better, more cost-effective biological manufacturing. Another critical challenge is knowledge-based and stems from a generally limited understanding of systems biology and end-use pathways, in vivo mechanisms, and the variability and/or relevance of material attributes. Better understanding of these technical areas could provide the knowledge to improve biomanufacturing reliability and reduce some of the uncertainties in today's processes.

A key challenge is the high cost and risk of R&D. Current investments in R&D, education, and other infrastructure are insufficient to keep pace with the increasing size and global nature of biomanufacturing. Solving some of the challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach, which can be impeded by an inability to communicate in the same technical \"language\". Conflicts in collaboration can lead to a fracturing of effort between industry and academia, taking longer or making it difficult to find solutions. Policy and regulation are other key areas that can inadvertently impede progress in some cases. Biological systems are inherently uncertain. As a result, biologics must often undergo continuous process improvement and change in an iterative manner, with efficacy being determined after the product has been manufactured (since the outcome cannot always be predicted).

Measurements and standards are also critical to support the regulatory process, particularly as it pertains to approval of new biological products and innovations, as well as the environmental impacts of biological processes. Exhibit 5.4 illustrates the key measurements in this field and why they are important. Measurement and Standards Challenges The key challenges related to measurements and standards for biomanufacturing are illustrated in Exhibit 5.5. These challenges represent the measurement needs that must be addressed in this field, but are not all-inclusive. They provide a good starting point for understanding some of the urgent measurement challenges facing this unique and rapidly growing industry. Biomanufacturing Processes. Biological manufacturing processes, which work with living cells, have a high degree of uncertainty in both processing methods and in reliably obtaining the desired product attributes; they are difficult to control and monitor. The ability to make measurements in complex matrices in a process environment, and obtaining samples online and in-process, remains a significant challenge. When data is available, it is difficult to determine how that data can be used to improve the process. The variability in different product platforms creates a barrier in a number of ways, but particularly in designing generic processing tools and methods that can be applied across platforms. Products. Variability in biological products is difficult both to measure and predict with any reliability (e.g., what creates variability?), mostly due to the inherently dynamic nature of living systems. Without understanding the mechanisms behind product variability, obtaining the desired attributes becomes an iterative rather than straightforward process. In many cases, measurements of product attributes are driven by the need to meet regulatory requirements or approvals. Such measurements do not necessarily provide any useful information about manufacturing performance or other factors that impact product attributes and functionality. Finding simpler ways to mimic complex systems (e.g., immune system assay), more accurate bioassays, and how to measure product changes in vivo could provide tools for understanding and improving pathways to reliable product attributes. Lack of Fundamental Knowledge. Developing a better understanding and analysis of the risk factors for product efficacy is a high priority. The lack of efficacy is often determined by different processes and procedures in use. These are not necessarily matched to criteria of acceptability within the manufacturing process. As a result, risk analysis is not rational, but rather drug-related or tied to doctor error. Tools/Methods. New tools are needed to measure proteins/biomarkers in complex fluids, particularly alternatives to mass spectrometry. An enhanced understanding of structure-function relationships, for example, could enable improved quality, consistency, safety, effectiveness, and yield of biological products. Tools for measuring structural properties, aggregation, oxidation, and other system properties will ultimately pave the way for predictive biotechnology and product development. A key issue is the current level of sensitivity, specificity, and objectivity of measurements for biological systems in the manufacturing environment. Other. The high cost of measurement is an impediment in today's biomanufacturing environment. Cost decisions are complicated by whether tools are permanent or disposable technology, and if processes must be retrofitted. Add-on technologies can require process redesign at significant cost, and the ultimate cost-benefit ratios must be demonstrated to justify the investment. Another challenge in developing and implementing new measurement technology is the sometimes diverse nature of the user and desired outcomes, which can range from physicians to regulators to equipment suppliers.BIOPHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURINGBIOPHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 47Exhibit 5.5 Measurement and Standards Challenges for Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Biomanufacturing Processes HIGH PRIORITySpecific measurements in complex matrices, compounded by interference in in-process environments Lack of cross-platform compatibility and comparable methodologies Lack of clarity on how to use the data to improve the process Obtaining representative samples online Products MEDIUM PRIORITyInadequate understanding of sources of product variability Mimicking complex systems (e.g., immune system assay) in simpler ways Prevalence of regulatory-driven measurements versus those driven by characteristics for manufacturing performance and function LOWER PRIORITyAccurate bioassays (potency) in the face of inherent variability of biological systems Measuring product changes in vivo (difficult to measure function ex vivo ) Lack of Fundamental Knowledge HIGH PRIORITyIrrational risk analysis caused by determination of efficacy by different processes and procedures that are not necessarily matched to criteria of acceptability within manufacturing process Tools/Methods HIGH PRIORITyLack of alternatives to mass spectrometry (MS) as a measurement tool for proteins/biomarkers in complex fluids Sensitivity, specificity, and objectivity of measurements MEDIUM PRIORITyLack of generally applicable data pre-processing tools to incorporate more information into models Other HIGH PRIORITyCost of measurement Permanent versus disposable technology \" Add-on technology and redesign implications \" MEDIUM PRIORITyMeasurement challenges created by diverse users Innovator/copier \" Regulatory (U.S. vs. other country) \" End-user (physician/patient/hospital/NGO) \" High level of skill required to install the equipment in-process BIOPHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURINGBIOPHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING48 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesPriority Measurement Topics The measurement challenges illustrated in Exhibit 5.5 provide the foundation for a set of four priority measurement focus areas for biomanufacturing that aim to address these challenges.

These focus areas address some of the most critical challenges that have been identified for biomanufacturing. Many are data- and knowledge-based, making improved data-gathering and analytical tools essential to overcoming these challenges.

Therapeutic or preventative interventions will be based on \"disease signatures\"\u2014unique descriptors that are definitive markers of health status. These signatures will be derived from the integration of quantitative and qualitative measurements (biochemical, biophysical, and bioelectronic) of hundreds to thousands of biomolecules and/or intermolecular and cellular interactions. Likewise, the next generation of health assessment diagnostic tests will be based on multiplex determinations constituting a unique complex signature, rather than single markers of biological activities. The shift to signature analysis in diagnostics will help enable routine health status monitoring that uses each person's own signatures of wellness and disease as the controls against which to detect pathologic changes. This new focus will enable a comprehensive, integrated approach to wellness that includes prevention of disease, early detection of disease risk, and individualized treatment plans for each patient. In turn, this new approach to wellness may help control the rising cost of healthcare, for which spending now consumes nearly one-fifth of the U.S. gross national product. The medicine technical panel and plenary focused on the current needs and future opportunities related to innovative areas of medicine. These discussions emphasized identifying potential challenges impeding innovation in biomeasurements, clinical trial design, and the information processing and visualization technologies required to make disease signature analysis translatable into clinical practice. Panel participants identified a potential vision for the future, the broad technological challenges that need to be addressed, and the critical measurement and standards challenges that must be overcome to achieve technology innovation in the field of medicine. vision of the Future In the future, it is envisioned that revolutions in medicine will dramatically change the way patients are diagnosed and treated. As shown in Exhibit 6.1, technological advances, greater understanding of the correlation of disease to phenotype, ability to test the underlying etiology, and more sophisticated tests and assays will all contribute to improving diagnoses. Biomarkers will be well developed and more robust, enabling their use in guiding treatment decisions. Increased knowledge in many areas, combined with new predictive tools, will allow for the better identification and understanding of the characteristics and pathways of disease, enabling more effective therapies to be developed more quickly. Standardization will play an important role in optimizing sample and data collection, improving the understanding and mining of information from journals worldwide, and providing the infrastructure for new medical tools, such as the use of disease signatures. Modeling capabilities will improve with a greater range of capabilities for assessing current status as well as future disease risks. These advances will support the movement toward health-based and preventive medicine, in addition to providing support for improved diagnosis and treatment. Technical Panel on Medicine Improving health through measurement of complex biological signatures Technical Panel Co-Leaders: (1) Judy Britz, Britz Consulting; (2) Paul J. Utz, Stanford School of Medicine Plenary Speaker: Lee Hood, Institute for Systems Biology54 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesPersonalized medicine, where diagnosis, prevention, and treatment are tailored to individuals, is envisioned as a future reality. The groundwork for customized medicine is now being laid, although significant challenges must first be overcome. As Exhibit 6.2 illustrates, substantial advances in our knowledge of the genome and genotypes, phenotypes, and establishment of disease signatures will contribute to the creation of truly personalized medicine. These will enable the connection of diagnosis and treatment, as well as the identification of potentially risky outcomes with individual patient characteristics. In the future, preventing disease and poor health, rather than reactively diagnosing and treating disease, will become the greater focus of medical practice. Emphasis will be placed on maintaining and improving good health, enabled by better, less-invasive health testing and monitoring methods, as well as safer therapies. The business of healthcare will evolve to keep pace with the new demands placed on it by the move toward personalization and preventive, health-based medicine. This will require a substantial change and improvement in the way medical records and data are collected, stored, updated, and used. Medical records will need to be easily updatable in real time and transferable across different medical disciplines. Massive sets of patient information with many layers of detail will need to be combined with data on the etiology and genetics of disease to enable interpretation of health conditions as well as identification of preventive measures. MEDICINEMEDICINE Exhibit 6.1 Characteristics of the v ision of the Future for Medicine: Technological Advances Supporting Treatment and Diagnosis Diagnosis More accurate diagnoses translate to more efficacious treatments; physicians can order multiplexed assays for disease groups (e.g., autoimmunity) and obtain readily interpretable, numerical scores defining relative risk Normal pathway correlation to phenotype is understood; measurement of aberrant signaling to identify therapeutic responses that correlate with genomic/protein expression profiles is possibleEvidence-based lab medicine replaces intuitive test interpretation Underlying disease etiology is evaluated, rather than a complex array of symptoms and pathways Standards guide collection of samples and data, as well as how disease signatures are characterized Treatment The major cellular/molecular subtypes of disease can be identified, with robust biomarkers used in guiding treatment decisions Therapies are developed faster, based on more comprehensive understanding of biomolecular systems and more powerful tools for molecular engineering, and guided by companion diagnostics Fundamental Knowledge Biomarkers and diagnostic clinical trials are integrated, and diagnostic clinical trials exist\u2014sensitivity, specificity, predictive values are assessedStandard language and terminology enable harvesting the full benefit from published research literature Modeling capabilities range from proactive to reactive, and optimize treatment based on assessment of current status as well as risk for future eventsStatistical interpretations as well as mechanistic models are used as complementary information Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 55Broad Challenges The broad technological challenges to achieving the vision for medicine are shown in Exhibit 6.3. These reflect the growing movement toward revolutionary new ways of practicing medicine that are based on a deeper understanding of disease, the susceptibility of individuals to disease, and the efficacy and safety of treatments. Critical challenges are evident in a lack of adequate standards and measures; handling and effectively using massive amounts of information related to patient care and disease; and building the necessary science, technology, and knowledge foundation to support a new level of customized medicine tools. The current regulatory environment, policies impacting privacy, lack of economic incentives, and inadequate communication all constitute broad, non-technological challenges to personalized medicine and advanced medical practices, as shown in Exhibit 6.4. The regulatory process will have to adjust to accommodate the changes inherent in personalized treatment where the patient has greater control over treatment options. New paradigms in diagnostics may require new regulatory approaches. Privacy issues will also arise, due to the larger and more detailed quantities of personal information needed for customized medical practice. As the sharing and transfer of information across practitioners and medical disciplines becomes more automated and routine, more complex issues related to the protection of patient information could emerge. MEDICINEMEDICINE Exhibit 6.2 Characteristics of the v ision of the Future for Medicine: Personalized, Health-Based Medicine and New Business Models Personalized Medicine Personalized medicine is a reality\u2014physicians are able to integrate the individual's genotype, phenotype, diagnosis, and disease based on a signature; develop a patient profile; and select type, drug, and monitoring needs accordingly.

Personalized therapeutics could increase costs further in the short term, particularly in the early phases of development and use. Economic incentives may be needed to induce greater investments in preventive and predictive or health-based medical practice. Role of Measurement Measurements have played an important role in medicine from its earliest beginnings, and today are an integral foundation of medical research, diagnostics, and treatment. Exhibit 6.5 illustrates the key measurements needed to support continued technological innovations in this crucial field and why they are necessary.Exhibit 6.4 Broad Non-Technological Challenges for Medicine Regulatory MEDIUM PRIORITyValidation and regulatory challenge inherent in \"patient as own control\" and expense of outcomes research LOWER PRIORITyLack of clinical understanding in regulatory bodies (ability to prioritize parameters) Regulatory classification of diagnostic tests Health Care Policy HIGH PRIORITy Privacy issues and consensus, public and private LOWER PRIORITy Ways to evaluate and improve practices with real patients Economics and Incentives HIGH PRIORITyLack of funding/funding prioritization and the existence of competing priorities, such as science, economics, and social objectives MEDIUM PRIORITyRising healthcare costs (imaging, high costs of customized therapies, overall costs) High cost of diagnostic trials Economic incentives for preventative and predictive medicine Competing business incentives in personalized medicine/companion diagnostics \" Economics and Incentives HIGH PRIORITyCultural attitudes around sharing (work toward common standards and goals) Lack of collaboration between industry and academia overall Communication/collaboration between industry, academia, and government agencies MEDIUM PRIORITyEducation for: Patients (pros/cons) \" Providers (interpret pros/cons) \" Payers (preventive and proactive, bulk versus niche) \" Individuals (participate as own control) \"58 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges MEDICINEMEDICINE Measurement is a key enabler of improved diagnostics. Genetic measurements aid in the understanding of disease pathways and signatures, are critical to the use of biomarkers and genetic markers for disease, and can provide information for early treatment and disease recognition. Measurements are also crucial to understanding and subsequently improving the outcomes of medical treatments, as illustrated in Exhibit 6.5. Measures of morbidity, mortality, and quality-of-life parameters can reveal a lot about the efficacy of treatments and their long-term impacts. Outcome measures that evaluate how well new treatment paradigms are working compared with traditional approaches can be invaluable in guiding and refining innovative medical procedures or therapies.

Common, standardized ways of reporting and making measurements, as well as consistency in the type of patient data that is entered into the medical information system, are essential for effective diagnosis and treatment. In some cases, simply defining the attributes that must be measured (i.e., measurands) to assess disease and health is important. Standards, which specify how measurements should be made, are necessary to ensure that physicians are consistently informed about critical medical variables, tests, treatments, and protocols. Measurement and Standards Challenges The key challenges related to measurements and standards that were identified for medicine are illustrated in Exhibit 6.6. These are not intended to be all-inclusive of the measurement needs in medicine, but rather describe some of the challenges that need to be addressed to support personalized, health-based medicine. Standardization is a key theme that runs throughout the challenges shown here; it impacts the effective collection and handling of samples, is critical to the use of clinical phenotypes, and plays a key role in diagnostics and treatment.Exhibit 6.5 Key Measurements to Support Technological Innovation in Medicine (cont.) Measuring Outcomes and Effectiveness Morbidity/mortality, quality of life : measure of outcomes based on comparable inputs Histology\u2014disease phenotype (gold standard) : early detection and prediction of disease Quantitative measures of clinical phenotypes : ensure efficacy and utility of diagnostic test Detailed clinical phenotype and medication history, effects of medications : impacts effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment Clinical phenotype/outcome measures versus biology and imaging : disease treatment paradigms Disease definitions, indices, outcome measures : disease treatment paradigms Long-term outcomes of defined phenotypes with accompanying sample banks : validation of biomarkers Biomarkers and outcomes data : better links with actual patient symptoms validation/Standardization of Measurement Common quantitative units across measurement platforms : consistency in measurement Defined measurement(s) that best distinguish disease from health (stable, unique, platform- and antibody-independent measurements) : based on forms that are optimal discriminators or predictors, rather than what is available or easy to measure Consistency measures for input information : patient history, phenotypes (age, race, sex), social factors, diet, environment provide data for retrospective analysis Sample integrity measures : ensures quality of sample banks Process integrity and quality : informs best-practice decisions Statistical international standards : enable correct inferences, global consensus Variables that are not machine-dependent : markers that are stable over time Standard reference particles with defined refractive index, size, concentration, and fluorescence load : objective, device- independent standard Positron emission tomography with fluoride tracers (F-PET) sample integrity, suitability for immunohistochemistry (IHC), gene expression, other analysis : lowering of cost and time and improvement of data integrity Extension of CDISC standards to biomarkers and platform-independent data standards : enables integration and comparison of data across platforms60 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges MEDICINEMEDICINE Exhibit 6.6 Measurement and Standards Challenges for Medicine Sample Integrity and Preparation HIGH PRIORITyStandards and protocols for proper handling and treatment of samples Cells: Lack of validated method for processing, freezing/thawing cells;

Developing standards and protocols for the proper processing, handling, and treatment of cells, tissues, and other biological samples is a priority challenge. Without standard methods, the result is questionable sample integrity, poor reproducibility of results, and difficulty performing credible analysis. One objective is the ability to collect relevant samples in a way that is reproducible, accurate, and provides meaningful results in practical, real-world settings. Clinical Phenotype and Outcomes. Definitions and standards for phenotype data are a high-priority challenge and are needed to help identify, characterize, and predict disease pathways and activity levels, and understand disease and treatment outcomes. The standardization of phenotypes is impeded by their inherent complexity, data that is mostly subjective in nature, and a lack of agreement on how to best characterize the data. Standards and Preferences. The standardization of data and assays across a large number of biological platforms is a major challenge in medicine. Existing platforms are diverse and lack interoperability and comparability, and the technology needed to address these issues is not available. The inconsistencies inherent in tracing biological measurements to a well-defined reference point also make standardization challenging, as do a number of non-technical issues, including a lack of information-sharing and an unwillingness to undertake potentially costly efforts to develop cross-platform standards.Exhibit 6.6 Measurement and Standards Challenges for Medicine (cont.)

They also rated the technological and commercial risks and the impacts of action in a set of categories. Their findings are reflected in Exhibits 6.7-6.10. These focus areas address some of the most critical challenges that have been identified for emerging innovations in medicine. Many are related to the development of new standards and protocols that are essential to overcoming these challenges.

What are the concerns regarding alterations in the biosphere that should be considered when practicing synthetic biology? More simply put, could new life forms thrive at the expense of unrecognizably important life forms in the biosphere? Common Measurement Challenges in Biological Science Investigation and Application A number of measurement challenges that cut across different sectors of the biosciences were identified. These are summarized below. Information and Data Exchange. Inadequacies in our ability to conveniently share information across disciplines resulting from database structural incompatibilities were commonly cited as serious challenges to information exchange. The absence of interoperability in respect to data transfer between instrument platforms is one example of such inadequacy. Another example is the inflexibility of data structures to accommodate new information or previously overlooked information that needs to be incorporated into existing databases. Inadequacies in data and information availability and in the formats in which the data are stored pose serious, even threatening, risks when the data are intended to be used for making decisions. Education in Principles of Measurement. A general lack of familiarity of the importance of measurement science for the quality assurance of laboratory measurement results was observed, indicating a need for education in the principles of measurement. Some measurement concepts and fundamentals are relatively unknown outside the metrology community. Quality Assurance of Data and Tests. The absence of reference materials suitable for use in biological measurements limits confidence in the quality of data upon which decisions and recommendations can be made. This issue is wide ranging, extending from assessment of water quality to genetic markers for disease. Quality assurance procedures outside the current regulatory structure for genetic marker tests used in medical diagnosis, for example, create a situation that does not provide confidence in the comparability or accuracy of these tests. Test quality has not kept pace with new developments to the extent that confidence in measurement results can be deemed satisfactory. In Situ Measurement. Measurements that ignore the environment or milieu in which biological processes and reactions occur can provide data that mislead rather than inform. This is a consequence of the need for measurements that can be made in situ with the same accuracy of measurements previously made only after preparation of samples which destroy the information that is only available in situ . Non-Invasive Measurement. The need for non-invasive measurements, particularly for cells, was noted in several contexts. MRI, CAT, and PET scanning are technologies that might be adaptable to measurements of single cells. Examples of applicability are in embryogenesis and single-cell toxicology studies. A lack of technologies suitable for non-invasive measurement of embryonic systems and development severely impede progress in assessing the likelihood of successful in vitro fertilization. Similarly, technologies capable of acting like global positioning systems for intracellular structures could provide advantages for evaluating the effects HOT TOPICSHOT TOPICS 70 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges HOT TOPICSHOT TOPICS of both toxic substances and potential therapeutic drugs on cells. If such technologies were to be developed, many of the impediments now identified with animal testing and limited traditional methods could potentially be overcome. Cross-Discipline Transfer of Technology. Technologies that have been developed and are currently used in medical diagnostic testing environments need to be made available to laboratories in which more routine biological testing is employed; examples are water quality and soils testing. Some of the impediments are economic, but others result from the absence of methods and reference materials suitable for use in these application areas. Testing for microbial contamination of water is too frequently performed by methods that are not usable in real time (e.g., the water may have been safe when it was tested, but the test was two days ago). Ineffective Animal Models for Drug Testing. The traditional uses of animal models for assessment of risk and efficacy in the evaluation of new drugs are unsatisfactory, particularly when more specifically targeted therapeutic agents are being evaluated. Misleading results may arise from inadequate specificity of conventional methods and may result in risks not being identified or efficacy missed. Single-cell procedures that can be more suitable are hampered by inadequate sensitivity or the absence of calibration materials to assure the validity of such measurements. Understanding Measurement Needs. Technological advances are limited conceptually by measurement of what we know how to measure, rather than what we believe could be more informative. The challenge is being able to measure the attribute with the specificity and accuracy needed to form a sound basis for recommendations and decisions.Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological Challenges 718.0 UNIvERSAL IDEAS AND OBSER vATIONS8.0 UNIvERSAL IDEAS AND OBSER vATIONS Universal Ideas As the preceding sections have illustrated, measurement challenges have been identified that are relevant to the unique requirements of individual sectors (e.g., agriculture, medicine). However, a number of critical measurement needs have emerged that are common to many areas of the biosciences. This is notable because solutions for these common measurement problems could thus have wide applicability and support innovation in more than one area. The universal, crosscutting needs identified for the biosciences are: Better methodologies and practices for sample handling (ensures sample integrity, reproducibility of results, and traceability) More robust protein measurements (enables broader understanding of disease and treatment) High-throughput multiplexed measurements (enables rapid analysis of performance and functionality, and supports an accelerated discovery process) Improved tools and standards for bioinformatics (enhances the reliability, accessibility, and utility of critical information exchange systems)Improved measurement tools and standards (ensures confidence in data and enables comparability across platforms) Observations Based on the roundtable and plenary presentations, and discussions among the various technical panels, a number of overarching observations emerged. These emphasize the importance of biosciences to our economic future and quality of life, as well as the importance of measurement to achieving the future promise of biosciences. It is clear that, more sophisticated, highly reliable, and standardized measurement methods will be necessary to support and accelerate technological innovation in this important field. As rapid advances in the biosciences continue to emerge, measurements and standards will need to advance as well. Failure to do so could not only stifle innovation and discovery, but impede some of the new concepts that will be critical to our future economic security and quality of life. Overarching observations about the biosciences include the following: Improvements in the biosciences are a key to global economic security and quality of life in the future. A much deeper understanding of complex biological systems is needed. Highly sophisticated measurements are needed in order to study the relevant changes that occur in complex biomolecular networks. Major measurement challenges exist that are stifling innovation in the biosciences. Current technology is inadequate due to a very limited measurement infrastructure that allows scientists to have confidence in only a very small percentage of the biomeasurements being conducted.72 Accelerating Innovation in 21st Century Biosciences: Identifying the Measurement, Standards, and Technological ChallengesNew multiplex, multiparametric measurement technologies will need to be invented and developed. These new measurement systems will heavily rely upon the accuracy and comparability of the data obtained from current technologies to build the new systems. Standardization of current measurement technologies will be needed to enable next-generation systems. Standardization of next-generation biomeasurement systems that bridge historical and new data will be needed as new methods emerge.
