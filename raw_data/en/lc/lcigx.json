Nursing Journals", "date": "2012-02-04", "cleaned_text": "By Staff It's been a tough few weeks for Big Pharma, as three major studies have now completely disproved the effectiveness of its most profitable drugs. Last week, a huge study admitted that the risks of antidepressants in children and teens far outweigh the benefits, as the drugs routinely increase suicidal behavior. Out of 14 antidepressants, only one was shown to improve depression better than the placebo. Now, scientists are reporting that cholesterol drugs, which 15 million Americans are prescribed, are also completely worthless. A group of international researchers published a study that found no link between what's known as \"bad\" cholesterol and death as a result of heart disease in individuals over 60 years of age. In fact, the results found that 92 percent of people with high cholesterol actually lived longer. The best way to achieve and maintain good heart health is not through medications but through healthy lifestyle habits. \"Lowering cholesterol with medications for primary cardiovascular prevention in those aged over 60 is a total waste of time and resources, whereas altering your lifestyle is the single most important way to achieve a good quality of life,\" said vascular and endovascular surgery expert Professor Sherif Sultan from the University of Ireland. 'Lowering cholesterol with medications is a total waste of time' Study co-author Dr. Malcolm Kendrick said their findings show \"that older people with high LDL (low-density lipoprotein) levels, the so-called 'bad' cholesterol, lived longer and had less heart disease.\" The revelations are sure to have huge implications for the pharmaceutical industry, as the cholesterol drug Lipitor is the most profitable meditation of all time - raking in more than $140 billion in sales. The guidelines for preventing heart disease and the buildup of plaque in the arteries need to be re-evaluated, said the study authors, adding that \"the benefits from statin treatment have been exaggerated.\" But the truth is that the benefits of statins haven't just been exaggerated, but 100 percent fabricated, as well as the \"research\" supporting other drugs such as antidepressants and vaccines. The push to get even more U.S. adults on statins was facilitated by doctors tied to the industry. Physicians with the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology issued new guidelines three years ago calling for one-third of all adults to consider taking statins - a push proven to be extremely lucrative for Big Pharma. When questioned about the conflict of interest, the response was: \"Ties between heart doctors and Big Pharma are so extensive that it is almost impossible to find a large group of doctors who have no industry ties.\" New study says multiple vaccines at once not safe for kids The third major study in a matter of days to discredit the pharmaceutical industry, found that giving children multiple vaccines at once is unsafe - a complete contradiction to the vaccine narrative shoved down everyone's throats by government, drug companies and the media for decades. \"Although CDC recommends polio, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and pneumococcal vaccines for two-, four-, and six-month-old infants, this combination of eight vaccines administered during a single physician visit was never tested for safety in clinical trials,\" wrote medical researcher Neil Z. Miller. \"This is at odds with a CDC report which found that mixed exposures to chemical substances and other stress factors, including prescribed pharmaceuticals, may produce 'increased or unexpected deleterious health effects.'\" So there you have it. The pharmaceutical industry, as well the government mandated policies that support it, have absolutely no credibility, and therefore should not be trusted by anyone. The best way to maintain good health is to practice healthy lifestyle habits including eating a balanced diet, exercising and taking time to quiet the mind.
