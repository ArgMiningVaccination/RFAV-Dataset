Feedback from themembership has indicated that these meetings continueto be a highly valuable and stimulating educational activity. I therefore encourage you to participate in the2003 ASM which will be held in Melbourne next October.Further information on this meeting will be sent to you inthe mail and will also be mounted on the ASCIA website. As tabled in the Treasurer's Report at the recent ASCIA Annual General Meeting, the finances of ASCIAhave been considerably boosted by the hard earned proceeds from the ICACI 2000 meeting in Sydney. In thisASCIA newsletter I would like to hereby issue a formalrequest for ASCIA members to submit suggestionsregarding the long-term future investment and expendi-ture of these funds. A request was also made at therecent Council meeting for each state ASCIA representa-tive to seek ideas from their constituents regarding the future of these funds. The opportunity presented to Ascia by the ICACI 2000 funds allows us to consider the long-term direction of thesociety and the executive welcomes any thoughts aboutthis. All of these submissions will be considered at the next face to face Council meeting on 8 March 2003 andsummarised at the 2003 ASCIA Annual General Meeting.Submissions should be sent to our Executive Officer,Jill Smith. The ASCIA website www.allergy.org.au continues to attract an ever increasing number of visitors, includingthe public and the media. Several information brochurescontained on the website are also available as printedbrochures. A recently revised Reply Fax for you to usewhen requesting these brochures was enclosed with my letter to you dated 7 November 2002. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in the organisation of the Adelaidemeeting and those who have agreed to take up Counciland Executive positions in ASCIA for the next two years. I look forward to working with a strong team. I wouldalso like to thank Roger Garsia, the outgoing President,who leaves the society in such a strong position. Lastly, I would like to extend to all of our members, to Jill Smith, our Executive Officer, and to all of our supporters, my best wishes for a happy, healthy and productive 2003.

Congratulations and thank you to the organising committee of the 2002 Annual ScientificMeeting of ASCIA, co-chaired by David Gillis and WilliamSmith. The Programme Committee assembled an excellent programme in Adelaide and at the satellitemeeting at Wirrina. With the new biological agents entering clinical practice and the insights from clinicalexperience of those already in use beginning to becomeapparent, the ASCIA Annual Scientific Meetings shouldbe an essential component of the continuing educationof our members. I look forward to seeing you at the2003 ASM in Melbourne. We congratulate Andrew Kemp upon his appointment to the jointly funded Chair in Paediatric Allergy andImmunology at The Children's Hospital at Westmead andlook forward to the discipline of Paediatric Allergy andImmunology flourishing further with the injection of funding into this new academic position. Most of ASCIA's clinicians would be aware that the Primary Immunodeficiency Register is about to be reborn and will have a much more streamlined interfacefor those registering cases. It will be a major resource for planning and research in the future and my heartiest congratulations go to Sean Riminton, 2Contentsascia ASCIA PresidentWarwick Britton and Karl Baumgart for their work over the years and more recently in the establishmentand maintenance of the existing registry and particularlyto Sean and Warwick for their efforts in bringing it to the forefront of modern technology and for expanding its potential. We believe all the ethical issues for its re-initiation have been satisfactorily resolved and we lookforward to the support of ASCIA members in making thisa truly national resource which benefits our patients andadds to our understanding of these important diseases. Many members of ASCIA have been active in recent months increasing awareness that the lack ofCommonwealth subsidisation for the adrenaline auto-injector Epipen \u00aeis causing significant financial burden to patients with life-threatening anaphylaxis.While President of ASCIA I wrote to the Federal Ministerfor Health and I know that many members in variousstates have also taken up this issue with their localhealth Ministers. Hopefully there will be some relief forthe patients for whom un-subsidised auto-injectors arebeyond financial reach. This issue was discussed at theCouncil Meeting of 26 September 2002 and it will bekept at the forefront of discussions with various healthfunding bodies. The issue has also been brought to theattention of the Royal Australasian College of Physiciansand the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC). Also high on the agenda for that Council Meeting in September was reporting on efforts to get consistencyacross states in the approach taken to management of food allergies in the educational sector particularly the early childhood and school education sector. Therehave been many meetings over the years in differentStates but it appears there is developing a momentumfor consensus which should come to fruition over thenext twelve months. The membership has been veryactive in this area and hopefully their efforts will yield a consistent approach across the States. Many members of ASCIA with laboratory and clinical immunology interests were participants in the recentFOCIS meeting in San Francisco. This is a most usefulcontinuing education activity displaying the importance ofClinical Immunology and Allergy in the management of somany organ based diseases. ASCIA will strengthen itslinks with the FOCIS group with a view to more Australianscience being presented in that forum. The move to a fully professional Secretariat (Executive Officer) has been very successful and my thanks are dueto Jill Smith for her hard work in this role. The ASCIA trademark is now registered. Unfortunately, it is not possible to register AER as a trademark. TheASCIA Education Resources (AER) brochures have beenvery successful and widely distributed. Some topics havebeen reprinted already. Interest in the ASCIA website has doubled over the past year, with a \"hit rate\" of 7653each day, an average of 414 page impressions per day and it hosts 4225 unique visitors each month. Some progress has been made with the registration of the new immunotherapy agents, however, particular difficulties remain with histamine registration. The inaugural Pathology Update was a successful and worthwhile meeting. Associate members and laboratory personnel have been very helpful in ensuring the appearance of new items forflow cytometry and coeliac antibody measurement in thePathology Schedule. ASCIA's links with asthma organizations have further strengthened, with Mimi Tang's continued role on theNational Asthma Council and the establishment of a liaison with Asthma Australia. I would like to thank my fellow Councillors who have made my two year period as President a satisfying andpleasurable experience. In particular, I thank the mem-bers of the 2000-2002 Executive, David Gillis, as thethen President-Elect, Stephen Adelstein, our most mostefficient Treasurer, and Karl Baumgart, the society'sSecretary who has been ably assisted by Jill Smith in theSecretariat. I wish the incoming Council all the best in their stewardship of the Society. The 2000-2002 Council and our membership can feel justifiably proud of ASCIA'sefforts over the last two years. Finally, it gave me great pleasure to formally welcome Diana Bass as an Honorary Member of ASCIA. Dr Roger Garsia 2000-2002 ASCIA President 3ascian 2000-2002 ASCIA Council The use of MYOB accounting software will make financial management much easier, particularly in view of the GSTaccounting and reporting requirements. Chequesignatories will continue to be current membersof the ASCIA Executive (two to sign). Audits have taken longer than anticipated but it is expected that they will be completely up to date by theend of this year. Our Executive Officer will prepare theaccounts for audit. The intention for future years is tohave the audited accounts available at the time of theASCIA Annual General Meeting each year. Dr Stephen Adelstein ASCIA Honorary Treasurer n Treasurer's Report ASCIA has now received all the proceeds from ICACI 2000 and these are currently being held inshort-term deposits. Advicehas been requested fromthree financial planners andtheir suggestions will bepresented for considerationat the March 2003 Councilmeeting. A commitment has been made to The Children'sHospital Westmead to providefunding of $50,000 perannum for 5 years. 4ascia From L to R: Back: Dr William Smith, Dr Victoria Taylor, Dr David Gillis, Dr Roger Garsia, Dr Michael Sutherland, Dr David Fulcher, Dr Sean Riminton, Dr Richard Loh, Front: Dr Stephen Adelstein, Dr Karl Baumgart, Dr Richard Wong Absent: Dr Ray Mullins, Dr Glenn Reeves, Dr Mimi Tang, Prof. Warwick Britton, Dr Sheryl van Nunen, Dr Penny Fitzharris, Prof. J ames McCluskey and Tracey Strangerbrochures have been produced this year, after extensive review by the Education Committee and ASCIA members.The consumer health brochure is \"Hay fever treatment\"and the health professional's version is \"Management of Allergic Rhinitis\". These are now mounted on the website and available as brochures to be distributed by Astra Zeneca. Contact from the public via the email address (education@ allergy.org.au) has increased substantiallysince the AER brochures went into circulation. Mostenquiries are satisfied by referring them to specific website AER brochures for further information. Ray Mullins has been extremely helpful in assisting with these enquiries. Sponsorship Update This year we have gained the following new sponsors for AER and the ASCIA web site:GOLDAstra Zeneca SILVERBreathezy (Caaw International) The complete sponsorships generate in excess of $100,000 per annum. The increase in website visits and publicity generated over the past year is adequately covered in other reportsin this newsletter. 5ascia n Executive Officer's Report It is now almost 2 years since I assumed the role of Executive Officer,combining the Secretariatand Education responsibili-ties into the one position. Over the past six months I am pleased to report that I have been able to focusagain on the education role,particularly with the startof the ASCIA/DoHA Allergy and Asthma Project, which has consumed a great deal ofmy time. Once this project is completed I should havemore time available to devote to other priorities, whichI believe should include regular communication to allmembers to update them on AER initiatives. I am alsolooking forward to the possibility of facilitating theproduction of ASCIA's own materials to be used in theeducation of general practitioners, pharmacists andother interested groups (eg the Asthma Foundations),as suggested by Ray Mullins in his EducationCommittee report. As far as the administrative function is concerned, my main task currently is to produce the 2003 Members'Handbook early in the new year. I would appreciate any changes in members' details being forwarded to me as early as possible. AER Brochures A large number of ASCIA/AER brochures (55,000) havebeen in circulation by the end of 2002. The majority ofcopies have reached patients and health professionalsvia consultants' rooms. Two brochures, \"AllergyPrevention in Children\" and \"Immunotherapy\" have beenreprinted and several other titles may well need to bereprinted as stocks are dwindling. Other means of presenting the information prepared, such as posters, deserve consideration. Two more I am looking forward to another stimulating and productive year in 2003!

The production ofthe newsletter is a jointeffort and my thanks aredue to Dr Roger Garsia,Dr David Gillis, Jill Smithour Executive Officer, allof our colleagues who pre-pared reports and to DrConnie Katelaris. Thank you also to our sponsors. The first newsletter for 2003 is underway and contributions are very welcome. Dr Sheryl van Nunen Newsletter Editor n 13th Annual Scientific Meeting Report: Adelaide27-29 September 2002 ASCIA's 13th Annual Scientific Meeting was held in Adelaide in September of this year. Delegates were welcomed to this most successful and interesting meeting by Peter Roberts-Thompson who then handedover to William Smith, who in turn chaired presentationsby Mathew Vadas, Angel Lopez and Klaus Rabe in abasic sciences session which reviewed the topic of\"Biotherapeutics in Immunology and Allergy\". Frank Kette introduced the session in which Peter Friedmann, Karl Baumgart and Glenn Reeves discussedapproaches to recalcitrant urticaria, including novel therapies and the use of immunomodulatory drugs, a session which proved valuable for all clinicians. In the next session, chaired by Bob Heddle and Graham Solley, John Weiner presented an historical account ofjumper ant allergy, which was followed by a riveting pres-entation by Simon Brown of the results of a clinical trial of jumper ant venom immunotherapy for anaphylaxis. Bob Heddle then discussed risk factors for death in stinginginsect allergy and Simon Brown returned to outline theemergency management of anaphylaxis. A lively period ofdiscussion continued into the afternoon tea break. The first day of the meeting ended with a segment chaired by David Gillis and Glenn Reeves, devoted todrug allergy, during which Sepehr Shakib presentedintriguing insights into pharmacogenetics, PeterFriedmann related the hapten formation indrug allergy, using contact hyper-sensitivity phenomenaas a base for discussion and Ray Mullins closed with an update of his experience with allergic reactions tocomplementary medicines, a topic which never fails to provoke intense interest. That evening those who could attend the Welcome Reception at the South Australian Museum were treatedto a fascinating guided tour of some of the extensivecollection of indigenous cultural material held there in an informative display. The second day of the meeting commenced early with breakfast sessions by Klaus Rabe (kindly sponsored by UCB Pharma) updating us on the use of anti-IgE inallergic diseases, while David Goldblatt delivered a special paediatric immunology session discussingaspects of chronic granulomatous disease. Mike Gold then chaired an excellent suite of presentations entitled \"Atopic Dermatitis, Prevention and Treatment in 2002\", with Susan Prescott outliningprevention strategies, Ross Butler discussing the use ofprobiotics, Euan Tovey presenting the epidemiology ofallergen exposure in Australia and closing with PeterFriedmann summarising the use of allergen avoidanceand new agents in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A good crowd was in attendance for the excellent presentations, given largely by our trainees, in ClinicalGrand Rounds. Each of the participants deserves ourthanks for the thorough preparation and stimulating dis-cussion points prepared. The afternoon was devoted to a comprehensive update on immunisation, Kevin Forsyth chairing DonRoberton delivering his summary of immune responsesto vaccines in the young, with John Bradley then contrasting immune responses in the elderly. Roger Garsia examined immune responses in theimmunocompromised patient and finally David Goldblattgave us a glimpse of the future of conjugate vaccines. The posters were then reviewed prior to our Conference Dinner at the National Wine Centre, notable not only for the fine wine and delicious food, but also for an enjoyableand keenly contested quiz during the dinner. Fortunately, thequality of the wines served for us to enjoy at the dinner didnot depend upon the interactive winemaking \"skills\" many ofus demonstrated at the educational appetiser we enjoyed as a forerunner to the dinner ! The third and last day of the 13th Annual Scientific Meeting commenced with seven short presentations discussing immunodiagnostic tests with David Gillis and Ian Mackay valiantly trying to contain these veryinformative presentations to the time allowed. MaureenRischmueller examined the significance of the presence ofExtractable Nuclear Antigens (ENA) in Sjogren's syndrome, Sally Waterman discussed the significance of anti-muscarinic antibodies, Richard Wong dealt with B2-GP1 antibodies, Elizabeth Benson presented a summary of auto-immune hearing loss, StephenAdelstein told us of the relevance of anti-saccharo myces antibodies, Tony Ferrante presented selected infor- mation regarding cytokines and Glenn Reeves closed thesession by considering the utility of tryptase estimations. Following a well-earned morning tea break, Ian Mackay continued as a chairperson and was joined by Ann Kupafor a basic clinical session on Ocular Autoimmunity.Ocular immune privilege was discussed by KerynWilliams, with Richard Mills and Tony Hall giving masterlyand very well illustrated discourses on immunologicalconditions of the eye and the management of immuno-logical eye disease respectively. For the closing session of this ASM, a number of our col- leagues presented vignettes of their clinical experiencewith immunotherapy, to stimulate discussion of issuessurrounding the practice of immunotherapy in the imme-diate future. In addition, Jennie Hillas, from RichardThomson Pty Ltd updated us regarding the progress ofStallergenes' Alustal TGA application and detailed thecurrent use of Alustal in Australia. Dr Sheryl van Nunen 7ascian 14th Annual Scientific Meeting Preview:Melbourne 10-13October 2003 The 14th ASCIA Annual Scientific Meeting will be held in Melbourne fromFriday 10th- Sunday 12th October 2003 at the Sheraton Towers Hotel, Southbankwith a one day satellite meeting at the Sebel Lodge YarraValley on Monday 13th October 2003. The conference themes are food allergy, the origins of the atopic state, auto-immunity and diagnostic testingin immunology and immunotherapy for allergic diseases. This ASM will be held in association with the Diagnostic Immunology Discussion Group (DIDG), many of whomare members of ASCIA. International Guest Speakers PROFESSOR HUGH SAMPSON - Pr ofessor of Pediatrics at Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York,USA, is arguably currently the pre-eminent clinician scientist in the food allergy area. PROFESSOR MARVIN FRITZLER - Pr ofessor of Medicine, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, is aworld authority on auto- immunity and, in particular, auto-antigens and diagnostic testing for auto-immunity.Professor Fritzler's visit will be sponsored byImmunoconcepts, courtesy of the DIDG.A/PROFESSOR HANS JOERGEN MALLING - Allergy Unit, National University Hospital, Copenhagen,Denmark is an expert in allergen specific immunotherapywho has been involved in the WHO position statementon Allergen Immunotherapy and he has particular interests in the clinical aspects of immunotherapy including patient dosing regimens and safety. Satellite Meeting The Sebel Lodge Yarra Valley is around 50 minutes from the Melbourne CBD at the gateway to this famouswine-growing district. It boasts excellent accommodationand a Jack Nicklaus designed 18 hole golf course. Thesatellite meeting will consist of two streams. There willbe an auto- immunity stream known as \"St George in theYarra Valley\" which will be in association with the DIDGand focus on diagnostic testing in immunology. Theother, concurrent, stream will be \"Current Concepts inAllergen Immunotherapy\" which will look at scientific andclinical aspects of immunotherapy in the 21st century,with input (amongst others) from Hugh Sampson andHans Joergen Malling. SOCIAL PROGRAMME - in keeping with previous years, this should be an important and enjoyable part of the meeting. The conference dinner will be held at the Melbourne Aquarium and feature an address by Professor Suzanne Cory of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. On behalf of the Organising Committee, I am excited to be welcoming members of ASCIA to the 14th Annual Scientific Meeting in Melbourne and I hope it will be an outstanding conference with enough breadthto satisfy the diversity of interests amongst the ASCIAmembership. Dr Michael Sutherland Organising Committee 14th ASCIA ASM 8ascia n Revised AllergyDefinitions:WAO, EAACI, AAAAI Internationally there has been a growing movement to revise nomenclature used in Allergy/ Immunology toattempt a more uniform system. The Europeans have ledthis movement and the AAAAI and the WAO have alsoconvened working parties to examine this issue. As ASCIA may be asked to submit an opinion, members may wish to consider suggested revisions in - \"Position paper: A revised nomenclature for allergy An EAACI position the L Kowalski,N Mygind, J Ring, P van Cauwenberge, M van Hage-Hamsten, B Wuthrich Allergy 2001 : 56 : 813-814 Dr Connie Katelaris Position available Dr Vincent Crump would welcome enquiries from members or trainees regarding a position available in hispractice in Auckland.n New Food Labelling Laws in Australia The Australian and New Zealand Health Ministers decided in November 2000 that labels on most packaged food would be improved. These changes willapply to all foods manufactured or packaged after 20December 2002. The new labels will show : Information about the nutritional content of the food The percentage of the characterising ingredient of the food and Declarations of the presence of potential allergens in foods, however small the amount The Food Standards Code now contains a requirement in Standard 1.2.3 for the mandatory declaration in allcases of certain substances and products derived fromthem. For packaged foods, the information must appearon the label. In other cases, the information must beshown with the food display or provided to consumersupon request. The substances which must be declared are:Cereals containing gluten and their products, namely, wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybridised strains(other than when used for the manufacture of beerand spirits) Crustacea and their products Egg and egg products Fish and fish products Milk and milk products Nuts and sesame seeds and their products Added sulphites in concentrations of 10mg/Kg or more Royal jelly presented as a food or royal jelly present in a food* Bee pollen* Propolis* * Note:These substances are not normally used as ingredients or com- ponents of processed foods. 9ascia New pic?This declaration applies when these listed products are present as : An ingredient An ingredient of a compound ingredient A food additive or a component of a food additive A processing aid or a component of a processing aid Exemptions exist where the food is : Other than in a package In an inner package contained in an outer package which is labelled* Made and packaged on the premises from which it is sold Packaged in the presence of the purchaser Whole or cut fresh fruit or vegetables except sprout- ing seeds or similar products in packages which donot obscure the contents Delivered packaged and ready for consumption at the express order of the purchaser Sold at fund-raising events *Note:Inner packages which are individual portion packs require a declaration of the substances listed as needing to be declared. Any product derived from these allergens must be declared, irrespective of how highly refined or changed it might be, or whether it contains the allergen itself ornot. For example, tocopherols and lecithin derived fromsoybean oil will now be declared as soy tocopherols and soy lecithin. The Food Standards Code now requires that when contained in the ingredient list : For cereals-if wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt or a hybridised strain, the specific name of the cerealmust be used, not the generic term cereal For fats and oils-the specific name peanut, soybean or sesame must be declared, not just the genericterm vegetable oil For fish-if crustacean, the specific name of the crus- tacean must be used, not the generic term fish orcrustacean, however, for finned fish,the generic termfish appears to be acceptable For nuts-the specific name of the nut must be used, not the generic term nuts For starch-if it is derived from wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt or a hybrid (eg triticale) the specific name of thecereal must be used, not the generic term \"starch\" The new code is 'silent' on the use of 'may contain' statements. A joint position statement is being devel-oped by ANZFA (Australian and New Zealand FoodAuthority) in conjunction with the Australian Competitionand Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the New ZealandCommerce Commission(NZCC). The Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) have developed an industryCode of Practice for Allergen Management and Labellingwhich acknowledges that the use of 'may contain' statements should only be used as a last resort where contamination is documented, uncontrollable, sporadic and potentially hazardous. The implementationof effective cleaning procedures and good manufacturingprocesses focussed upon by this Code of Practice isaimed at reducing the risks associated with unintentionalcontamination of a food with an allergen. The AFGC Code of Practice document additionally notes that the declaration of alternative ingredients may belikewise restricting for food allergic individuals, as thispractice gives rise to the same disadvantages as a labelwhich states that a food \"may contain\" a known allergen. The Food Standards Code requires that all labelling statements are written or set out legibly and prominentlysuch as to afford a distinct contrast to the background. It should be noted that since 2001 all foods containing genetically modified material must be labelled. This isimportant, for example, in the brazil nut allergic whoprobably need to guard against ingesting soy geneticallymodified by the insertion of brazil nut trypsin. A full copy of the Food Standards Code may be viewed on the website at www.foodstandards.gov.au and a hard copy may be purchased from Anstat Pty Ltd PO Box 447 South Melbourne VIC 3205 The Australian Food and Grocery Council website outlin- ing their approach to food allergen risk assessment andlabelling may be viewed at www.afgc.org.au Dr Sheryl van Nunen 10ascian Committee Reports n State Representatives South Australia The ASM in September naturally kept us occupied for several months prior to the meeting. David Gillis, in particular, put in a great deal of time organising thatmost successful meeting. We have continued to have monthly dinner meetings, well supported by sponsorship from the pharmaceuticalindustry and by the local members. There are usually 14-18 at the meetings. Topics this year have included local anaesthetic allergy, with a common testing protocol being adopted by all hospitals in South Australia; a report on the KeystoneAsthma Meeting by Professor Kevin Forsyth; a talk on occupational asthma by Raffaele Scicchitano; aresearch report by Anthony Smith; a review of nasal antihistamines in conjunction with the launch of a newproduct and a report on anti-cardiolipin antibodies byDavid Gillis. Future plans are to discuss IVIG usage guidelines, and computer auditing of immunology practices. Local members of ASCIA led by Bob Heddle submitted a report to the \"Generational Review\" of the SouthAustralian DHS, to raise issues that we see as importantfor the development of immunology and allergy in SouthAustralia. We have experienced a particular surge of interest from Immunology and Allergy nurses, several of whom havejoined ASCIA as associate members and have beenattending the monthly meetings. The nurses have set up a bi-monthly meeting of their own and are very interested in furthering immunology and allergy education. Dr William SmithVictoria We continue to have bi-monthly workshops at the roomsof Dr John Bishop which provide an excellent forum fordiscussions of recent papers and also clinical cases. We had a well attended dinner in June, where Professor Colin Robertson from the Royal Children's Hospitaldiscussed the important Melbourne EpidemiologicalStudy of Childhood Asthma (MESCA). Dr Michael Sutherland New South Wales The Annual Grand Rounds was held at the CentenaryInstitute this year on a Friday night and this made it possible for the Central Coast and ACT members to attend. It was a very full programme, with great competition for the prize, won once again by Sandhya Limaye. The Annual General Meeting this year was somewhat swallowed by the RCPA Scientific Meeting at DarlingHarbour, and the NSW Committee will need to look toreplacing this meeting now that the administration ofAustralian State ASCIA activities has centralised nationally. The ASCIA NSW Annual Dinner was held again at the Banjo Paterson restaurant in Gladesville and was, asusual, most enjoyable. Dr Sean Riminton Queensland A monthly clinical morning meeting has been started byJane Peake and Pete Smith to discuss interesting and/ordifficult clinical cases. We have had four meetings sofar, and one useful outcome has been the identificationof a source of histamine for skin prick testing. As the 2004 ASM has now been confirmed as being in Queensland, an organising committee has been formedcomprising Jane Peake (who will be taking over as 11ascia12ascia 13ascia 'Chairperson from me), Pete Smith, Graham Solley, David Heyworth-Smith, Patrick Hogan and myself. Theproposed venue is the Marriott Resort at the Gold Coastand the proposed date is the first week of September.The 15th Annual Scientific Meeting will be held fromWednesday till Friday, followed by a satellite meetingover the weekend at the nearby Couran Cove Resort onSouth Stradbroke Island. I have handed over the position of Queensland State representative to Dr Jane Peake (who was the sole nominee for the position) who is continuing to pursueissues related to the formation of a state-wide PaediatricImmunology and Allergy service, following on from a veryhelpful letter from Dr Roger Garsia. Dr Richard Wong Tasmania and GP Liaison Representative The incidence of allergy continues to rise amongst ourpopulation. Thankfully, the general knowledge of allergyand its accompanying illnesses of rhinitis, asthma and eczema and other associated diseases is alsoincreasing. Various groups and various articles withinnewspapers are distributing a lot of information. Peopleare becoming more aware of the importance of allergy in managing these diseases and are seeking attentionfrom medical practitioners earlier. We have now had the St John's Ambulance school programme running successfully for several years.Increasing numbers of schools are involved. This continues to run smoothly without any problems. Various other groups eg FACTS have been establishedthroughout the state and we now have several food intolerance groups. These groups are all run by parentsto support parents and their families with allergies andfood intolerance. We have given multiple lecturesthroughout the state, we being my allergy nurse andmyself, mainly to breastfeeding mothers' associations,child health nurses and carers within cr\u00e8ches and carers for children with disabilities. Dr Victoria TaylorWestern Australia Western Australia ASCIA members have regular meetings, with a balance of both scientific and clinicalcontent. We have reviewed John Weiner's Epipen surveyresults and found these to be most helpful. In addition,we are all looking forward to the implementation of ouranaphylaxis education programme. Dr Richard Loh New Zealand Dr Penny Fitzharris has left New Zealand and I have succeeded her as the NZ representative. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the ASCIA meeting in Septemberdue to a prior commitment. Currently, the major concern in New Zealand is the severe shortage of specialists and services in Allergyand Immunology. Dr Fitzharris is yet to be replaced inWellington. The hospital has, however, agreed to fund apart-time adult immunology position which is yet to beadvertised. Dr John O'Donnell from Christchurch is currently over- seas on sabbatical leave. He is expected to return toNew Zealand in January 2003. Dr Brian Broom is theonly allergy specialist in the South Island and there are no public hospital specialists in the South Island currently. In Auckland there has been a problem with the funding of allergy and immunology services. The service atAuckland public hospital has been instructed by management to accept only patients with life-threateningproblems. Some patients are waiting over six months tobe seen. It is hoped the situation will be alleviated withthe return of Dr Marianne Empson from parental leave.The KIDS Foundation, the patient support group for children with primary immune deficiencies, is sponsoringthe visit of Professor Jerry Winkelstein, Head of thePediatric Immunology Division at the Johns Hopkins medical school. Professor Winkelstein is an expert incomplement disorders and will be visiting the four maincentres in New Zealand in February 2003. He will be giving a series of seminars to promote awareness of primary immune deficiency disorders and their management. 14asciaAllergy New Zealand, the patient support group, organised the visit of Professor Hugh Sampson last yearbut the visit had to be postponed because of a family crisis. It is now hoped Professor Sampson will be able tovisit New Zealand in late 2003. From a patient perspective, one of the highlights has been the government subsidy of loratadine. Threemonths supply can now be obtained for NZ$15 or less.This has significantly reduced a barrier to treatment inmany of our allergy sufferers. Dr Rohan Ameratunga n Clinical and Laboratory Practices In addition to the information presented by Dr Roger Garsia in the Retiring President's Report, Dr WilliamSmith, incoming CLPC Convenor, noted at the lastCouncil meeting that the first priority he has identified isthe production of a position paper on skin prick testing. Dr Roger Garsia and Dr William Smithn Paediatric Immuno-Deficiency Sub-committee In summary, a working party met earlier this year, which included Alyson Kakakios, Monica Falk, Matthew Cook,Warwick Britton and Sean Riminton. As noted in thePresidents' reports, issues discussed and resolved werethose of the impact of the new privacy legislation, theuse of a web-based selection process and the amalga-mation of existing databases, which is being reviewed byIT consultants. Sponsorship was discussed at theSeptember 2002 Council meeting. There was also noteda proposal for the Immunodeficiency sub-committee tobecome a full ASCIA committee with the chairpersonbeing a Council member and this will be considered at the 2003 AGM. Dr Sean Riminton and Professor Warwick Britton n Education In addition to the list of achievements presented in thereports by the Presidents, the Computer committee andour Executive Officer, the Education committee has Prepared media releases - February 2002-Allergic reaction to Echinacea- not to be sneezed at! - April 2002-Peanut and tree nut allergy - May 2002-Asthma and allergy - July 2002- Allergy, asthma and milk - September 2002- Hay fever treatment Contributed directly and/or as a resource to the following media - Asthma Update March and June 2002 asthma.research.org.au/news/media/ FACTS newsletter - RCPA article on laboratory testing for allergy - Articles on Echinacea allergy in Australian Doctor and Medical Observer - The Daily Telegraph - peanut allergy 15asciaForthcoming articles in Reader's Digest, Australian Prescriber, Good Medicine and the Pharmacy Assistants' Journal ASCIA-DoHA Allergy and asthma brochure project A number of ASCIA members have prepared evidence- based articles as part of the DoHA-Asthma project,which should see formal publication very soon. This project should promote our organisation as anappropriate source of professional information on allergy/immunology issues. Future plans We foreshadow additional educational topics including\"Allergic Reactions to Complementary Medicines\" (basedon the Mullins/Heddle presentation at the AdelaideASM) and a detailed look at non-validated allergy testing.

Dr Glenn Reeves 16ascian Paediatric Immunology National Asthma Council Update I was unable to attend the National Asthma Council (NAC) Board of Directors Meeting in February as thiscoincided with the Asthma Australia Macquarie BankNational Asthma Colloquium on Childhood Asthma. The activities of the NAC in the last half of this year are as follows : 1. The 2002 Asthma Management Handbook was launched by the Hon. Kay Patterson in March. The NAC is negotiating with its equivalent membersocieties to sell the Asthma Management Handbookin New Zealand as a special New Zealand edition. 2. The NAC have been commissioned by DoHA to prepare a number of position statements similar to those commissioned from ASCIA on Allergy andAsthma that will be funded from the 6th NationalHealth Priority monies. These include statements on Function in Asthma\" and\"Complementary and Asthma\". These will be completed along similar timelines to the ASCIA papers. 3. As the ASCIA representative on the NAC Board of Directors, I was invited to represent the NAC on the \"Healthy Homes\" Reference Group of Experts.\"Healthy Homes\" is a booklet prepared by theHealth Council to provide consumer awareness of environmental health issues relating to indoor air quality in the home. ASCIA is also directly represented by Ray Mullins in the Reference Group of Experts. Other members of this Group include The Carpet Institute, Master Builders Association,Housing Industry Australia, Environment Australia,RACP, the Home Renovation Industry, the RoyalAustralian Institute of Architects and the AustralianBuilding Control Board. 4. The NAC has produced a position paper \"Combination therapy and its role in the management of asthma\"which was sponsored by Glaxo Smith Kline and AstraZeneca. ASCIA-DoHA Allergy and Asthma Project Update: This project is progressing well. As at 1st September2002, the 4th drafts of both the consumer and healthprofessional brochures \"Allergy and Asthma\" werecirculated to all committee members for review by their constituents by mid-September. The core editorialcommittee (Connie Katelaris, Mimi Tang and Jill Smith)met at Westmead Hospital to look at all submissionsreceived and incorporate the suggested changes whereappropriate. Following a teleconference of the committee on 18th September a 5th draft produced in the format of the finalbrochure was circulated for further peer review. The drafts were derived from evidence based submis- sions by twelve invited contributors and all drafts and thereference list will be kept on file and a CD ROM will beavailable for future reference. To date all the objectivesand deadlines on the original timeline devised at theMarch steering committee have been met. The consumer brochure is shorter (18DL pages) than planned whilst the health professional brochure is longer(12 A4 pages) than anticipated (6 A4 pages). As the latter contains very well researched information, it hasbeen agreed that it would be a waste to exclude thisinformation for health professionals. The Steering Committee comprised: Dr Mimi Tang (Chairperson) Dr Connie Katelaris (Scientific Co-ordinator) Ms Jill Smith (Project Secretary) Dr Roger Garsia/Dr David Gillis (ASCIA Presidents) Ms Kristine Whorlow (NAC CEO) Ms Kathy Hope (NAC Project Officer) Dr Victoria Taylor (GP Representative) Mr Chris Forsey & Ms Janine Keough (DoHA representatives) Mr John Fleming (Asthma NSW/ Asthma Australia representative) 17asciaInvited contributors were: Allergy March & Allergen Triggers Dr Andrew Kemp & A/Prof Frank Thien Food allergy and intolerance Dr John Ruhno What is allergy and asthma and asthma and allergy statistics Dr Michael Sutherland History taking and when to consider allergy in asthma patients A/Prof Ron Walls Skin prick tests A/Prof Ray Mullins RAST Blood Tests Dr Dominic Mallon House dust mite including minimisation/avoidance of HDM Dr Janet Rimmer Allergen triggers and avoidance-animals, mould, pollen Dr Dianne Campbell Prevention of Asthma Dr Mimi Tang Medications and immunotherapy Dr Michael Gold & Dr Bob Heddle I have also proposed a motion to change the title of this position from ASCIA Paediatric ImmunologyRepresentative to ASCIA Paediatric Representative. Dr Mimi Tang n Advanced Trainees 2002n Associate Representative Renee Deleuil succeeds me as the AssociateRepresentative for 2002-2004. I would like to lend my support to A/Prof Ray Mullins' Education Committee's suggestions regarding thedevelopment of educational materials for ASCIAmembers' use. Tracey Stranger n Book review 'Allergy and Immunology Secrets' Ed: M & Belfus,Inc PhiladelphiaISBN 1-56053-414-1 A$95.15 This 271 page paperback is aimed at presenting in a question and answer format, knowledge required by\"housestaff\", primary care physicans and candidates forthe US Board examinations. A great deal of information is summarised in 20 chapters (ranging from 2-19 pages) by 23 contributors. The ques-tions posed by the authors are essentially practical andthe answers given are succinct and informative. The useof tables, bulleted lists and the incorporation of an excel-lent index (which occupies 14% of the book) help theauthors achieve their aims. Where information is given which has a purely local appli- cation, for example, pollen profiles or drug names specificfor the US or the use of Imperial or US measurements,the principles under discussion still apply. The best use of this publication, in Australia and New Zealand, in my opinion, would be for our trainees to scanthe contents and then refer to individual chapters as aquick reference to questions that may arise in clinical settings. Ron Walls' book remains a much betterresource for our primary carers.

The Swiss-born Italian pharmacologist, Daniel Bovet (1907-1992), discovered anti-histamines in 1933. This discovery was based on research he conducted with his colleague, the Spanish/French chemist, Ernest Fourneau (1872-1949). the effects of histamine both in vivo and in vitro. Four years later,Bovet and Anne Marie Staub of the Institut Pasteur, discovered that histamine H1-receptor antagonists were protective against the effects of histamine andsome of the symptoms of anaphylaxis. Later in Paris, Bernard Halpern (1904-1978) realised that compounds he was studying possessed histamineantagonist activity in bronchial and intestinal smoothmuscle. In 1942 he discovered the aniline dye derivativewhich was called Antergan, an H1-receptor antagonistwith anti-cholinergic properties and bronchodilatoreffects. This antihistamine, however, proved too toxic for clinical use. In 1944, Bovet characterised pyrilamine maleate \"his development of antihistamines in the treatment of allergy\", Daniel Bovet was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1957. \"I was fascinated by the fact that in nature, in the human body, no product existed to counteract theexcessive effects of histamine.\" Daniel Bovet. Anne Marie Staub later developed the ethylenediamine anti-histamines which by virtue of their lessened toxicity,offered more wide-ranging clinical utility, and today wehave available several antistamines, for either oral ortopical use, all of which have both excellent efficacy andan attractive side- effect profile. n Hysterical 19ascia Susannah Bass Clinically J Aust 1984 Supp. 144;5:13-4 2.

Diana's interest in clinically relevant pollens has been longstanding and her publications in this field spanalmost twenty years. Parietaria judaica pollen allergy was first described in this country by her and her longassociation with Dr Brian Baldo was very productive forboth of them. Some years ago now, Diana was awarded a Churchill Fellowship to further her knowledge of pollen, and whilethat time dedicated to this pursuit was well used, mostof her work has been done in the time others mightdevote to their leisure activities. Dr Peter Bass, also a member of ASCIA, and recently retired from their busy clinical practice, has supportedDiana in her pollen studies in a practical manner, servic-ing pollen counters and producing several wonderful pho-tographs of known allergenic plants. Diana has always been willing to share her knowledge and was especially helpful to Dr Ji Yan Yan, who hassince set up the first Allergy Clinic in Shanghai. Diana has very kindly given me a list of her publications for inclusion in the Newsletter and for Glenn Reeves topost on the website for use as an educational resource,especially by our trainees. 20ascia 18.
