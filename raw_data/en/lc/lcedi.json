That Clean Life now saves me hours of time and helps me deliver client plans that are catered to their individual needs. It is user-friendly and I appreciate the prompt and professional support should I have any questions. I love the ever-growing database of recipes, the pre-made programs and that there are frequent enhancements! - Noura Sheikhalzoor Registered Dietitian 5 out of 5 stars I've tried other meal planning software but That Clean Life is more user-friendly, easier to use and beautiful.

The nutrition filters are so brilliant. I can search for recipes based on amounts of magnesium, zinc and fibre, which is super helpful for my patients. The tags are also genius. They save me so much time, it's incredible. Why That Clean Life? What makes That Clean Life different? It's flexible. Provide the right nutrition guidance, for the right client, in the right way.
