Nonetheless, MM remains incurable for most patients, and a significant proportion of patients with MM experience relapses that require further treatment. The introduction of next-generation immunomodulating agents (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs), and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has widened treatment options; however, management of patients with relapsed and refractory MM (RRMM) requires a systematic approach. This review summarizes the published results of major clinical trials, as well as patient and disease-related factors, to help guide appropriate drug combinations and sequencing of therapy using currently available drugs. DEFINITIONS OF RELAPSE AND RELAPSED/REFRACTORY DISEASE [2](#ref2)], and in 2016, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) published a revised definition of relapsed MM [ [3](#ref3)]. Relapsed disease Biochemical relapse 25% increase from the lowest confirmed response of the monoclonal protein (M-protein) in the serum (absolute increase, 0.5 g/dL) or in the urine (absolute increase, 200 mg/d) 25% increase from the lowest confirmed response between involved and uninvolved serum-free light chains (absolute increase, >10 mg/dL) 10% increase of the absolute percentage of bone marrow (BM) plasma cells New soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions 50% (and 1 cm) increase in existing plasmacytomas or bone lesions, as measured serially according to the sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters (SPD) of the measured lesions Clinical relapse Direct indicators of increasing disease and/or end organ dysfunction such as hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesion (CRAB) features related to the underlying the start of the therapy and attributable to myeloma) Decreased hemoglobin level by 2 g/dL (not related to therapy or other non-myeloma-related conditions) Hyperviscosity related to serum paraprotein level Relapsed and refractory Primary RELAPSE AND REFRACTORY MULTIPLE MYELOMA [4](#ref4), [5](#ref5)]. SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH RRMM Age and frailty [6](#ref6)]. Although age itself is not an obstacle for treatment, very elderly and frail patients are prone to experiencing treatment-related adverse events, leading to shorter survival [ [7](#ref7)]. Various frailty assessment tools, including the IMWG geriatric assessment tool, have been developed to predict outcomes concerning frail patients [ [8](#ref8)]. In one Korean study, scores used to predict poor overall survival (OS) for frail patients involved those related to age (80 yr), the Eastern Cooperative Group performance status (ECOG PS) 3-4, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and the presence of comorbidities (2 comorbidities involving the heart, lung, or liver, cerebrovascular disease, and/or diabetes mellitus) [ [9](#ref9)]. The treatment goal for elderly and frail patients may focus more on symptom relief and the prevention of new myeloma-associated symptoms. Drug dose reductions and the selection of less intense regimens (such as doublet instead of triplet combinations) could be options more applicable to this patient group. Comorbidities Aggressiveness at relapse [10](#ref10), [11](#ref11)]. An elevated LDH level [ [12](#ref12)], a peripheral blood plasma cell count that does not fulfill the criteria for plasma cell leukemia (a peripheral blood plasma cell count of >20% of the total white blood cell count, and an absolute count of 2,000/L) [ [13](#ref13)], and a high plasma cell proliferative index at post-autologous stem-cell transplantation (post-auto-SCT) D+100 [ [14](#ref14)] are indicators for short survival. Several studies have recommended that the rapid onset of disease-related organ damage (hypercalcemia, renal failure, and bony complications), as well as the above listed factors predictive of rapid disease progression, be defined as \"aggressive disease\" that requires treatment intervention using the [ [4](#ref4), [5](#ref5), [15](#ref15)]. Cytogenetics [16](#ref16), [17](#ref17)]. Some as pomalidomide-dexamethasone (Pd, MM-003) daratumumab-bortezomib-dexamethasone (Dara-Vd) (CASTOR) [ [20](#ref20)], have significantly improved the poor outcomes of high-risk disease. Further, studies on Rd with or without carfilzomib (ASPIRE) [ [21](#ref21)], elotuzumab (ELOQUENT-2) [ [22](#ref22)], and daratumumab [ reported that these drugs improve progression-free survival (PFS) but not significantly. A summary of each trial concerning these high-risk cytogenetics affecting PFS is listed in Table. However, these results should not be compared directly due to the inconsistency of FISH methods and cut-offs in the different studies. Results of the major clinical trials in the experimental arm and in the high-risk cytogenetics group are summarized in [Tables 1](#T1)and [2](#T2). OPTIONS FOR ANTIMYELOMA TREATMENT IN RRMM Treatment indications and timing of therapy [5](#ref5)]. Relapses with acute onset and rapid progression of symptoms require a prompt initiation of treatment. [24](#ref24)]. This result indicates that therapeutic intervention at biochemical relapse before (re)appearance of clinical symptoms might be of benefit to patients in terms of PFS and OS. Treatment options for RRMM [25](#ref25)]. Repeated use of IMiDs is also a feasible option with an overall response rate (ORR) of 44%. The response rate of lenalidomide retreatment in previous lenalidomide responders has been reported to be 58% in one study [ [26](#ref26)]. Prior to retreatment, remaining toxicities due to previous therapy such as peripheral neuropathies should be considered. Reuse of previously prescribed drugs may require a less intense dosage and a change to administration schedules. Proteasome inhibitors [27](#ref27)], a better time-to-progression (TTP, 6.2 vs. 3.5 mo), and a 1-year OS (80% vs. 66%). Bortezomib is also active in patients with poor renal function with an acceptable toxicity profile. Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known adverse event of bortezomib treatment and its incidence can be reduced through subcutaneous administration [ [28](#ref28)]. For elderly patients, lower dose-intensity regimens (e.g., a weekly administration) have been reported to improve adherence to therapy in this vulnerable patient group [ [29](#ref29)]. Several combination regimens with Vd have shown improved efficacies with manageable toxicity profiles. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin with bortezomib significantly improved PFS (9.3 vs. 6.5 mo) and duration of response (10.2 vs. 7.0 mo) compared with bortezomib monotherapy in a phase III international trial [ [30](#ref30)]. In previous autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) recipients, a triple combination of thalidomide and Vd compared with thalidomide and dexamethasone demonstrated a significantly better PFS (19.5 vs. 13.8 mo) and nCR/CR rate (45% vs. 21%), but also showed higher grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity (MMVAR/IFM 2005-04) [ [31](#ref31)]. Vd has also been used as a backbone for combinations with new classes of drugs, such as daratumumab (Dara-Vd) and panobinostat (Pano-Vd). [32](#ref32)]. In 2015, carfilzomib plus Rd (KRd) showed markedly improved PFS (26.3 vs. 17.6 mo) and ORR (87% vs. 67%) (ASPIRE trial) [ [33](#ref33)]. The final survival analysis at a median follow-up of 67 months showed significantly better OS in the KRd group (48.3 vs. 40.4 mo) [ [34](#ref34)]. The KRd regimen showed favorable outcomes across age subgroups [ [35](#ref35)]. Kd also significantly improved PFS (18.7 vs. 9.4 mo), OS (47.6 vs. 40 mo), and ORR (77% vs. 62%) compared with Vd in the ENDEAVOR trial [ [36](#ref36)]. The published results of a recent interim analysis of the phase III A.R.R.O.W. trial compared once-weekly (20 mg/m2 day 1 during cycle 1; and 70 mg/m2 thereafter), twice-weekly [20 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 (cycle and 27 mg/m2 thereafter] doses of carfilzomib [ [37](#ref37)]. Patients in the once-weekly group showed better outcomes for PFS (11.2 vs. 7.6 mo) and ORR (62.9% vs. 40.8%) with similar safety profiles in both dosage arms. Subgroup analysis of Asian patients participating in the ENDEAVOR and A.R.R.O.W trials showed a comparable efficacy but increased (grade 3 or higher) cardiovascular toxicities in the carfilzomib treated group [ [38](#ref38)]. [19](#ref19)]. Notably, the efficacy of IRd was significant in high-risk cytogenetic risk groups (HR, 0.54; P=0.02). The toxicity profile was comparable in both study groups, although an ixazomib combination regimen showed a slightly higher rate of skin rash and peripheral neuropathy. A phase II/III study involving ixazomib-dexamethasone in combination with pomalidomide in patients with RRMM is currently ongoing (NCT 03170882). Novel PIs (oprozomib and marizomib) as single or combination chemotherapies have also shown promising efficacies in phase I studies [ [39](#ref39)- [41](#ref41)]. IMiDs [26](#ref26)]. A multicenter, real-world data study involving patients with RRMM treated with either a thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CTD) regimen or a thalidomide, melphalan, and prednisolone (MTP) regimen reported an ORR of 72% versus 65%, respectively, which was not significantly different. A combination regimen such as thalidomide, alkylating agent, and corticosteroid (TAS) showed a median PFS and OS of 10.4 months and 28.0 months, respectively. However, 10% of patients experienced severe infectious complications that warranted intensive supportive care during the TAS treatment [ [42](#ref42)]. While the use of thalidomide in the RRMM setting is now less frequent due to the advent of more potent drugs and due to its considerable side effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, and venous thromboembolism, thalidomide plus corticosteroid therapy with or without an alkylating agent could be an option in specific circumstances. [43](#ref43), [44](#ref44)]. Korean real-world experience of Rd showed an ORR of 43.6%, with 15.4% of patients showing a very good partial response or better, a median TTP, and an OS of 8 and 23 months [ [45](#ref45)]. A phase II trial involving a bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) regimen reported an ORR of 64% and a median PFS of 9.5 months in patients with RRMM [ [46](#ref46)]. Currently, triplet regimens using daratumumab (Dara-Rd), and elotuzumab (Elo-Rd) have shown better efficacy in phase III trials. [47](#ref47)]. The major side effect of Pd was myelosuppression and neutropenic fever. Among the high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, del(17p) appeared to benefit from pomalidomide trial) [ [48](#ref48)]. Cyclophosphamide is an option for lenalidomide-refractory heavily pretreated patients with MM, with a better ORR (64.7% vs. 38.9%) and PFS (9.5 vs. 4.4 mo) than Pd [ [49](#ref49)]. A real-world study conducted by the Korean Multiple Myeloma Working Group involving a Kd, Pd, and PCd regimen showed a better PFS in a PCd treated group compared with doublet combination chemotherapies in patients who had relapsed or who were refractory to 2 or more lines of therapies [ [50](#ref50)]. In the recent phase III OPTIMISSM trial, pomalidomide in combination with Vd (PVd) also demonstrated a better ORR (82.2% vs. 50%) and PFS (11.2 vs. 7.1 mo) than Vd, even in the lenalidomide-refractory subgroup [ [51](#ref51)]. Monoclonal antibodies [52](#ref52)] and the results have been confirmed in the phase II SIRIUS study [ [53](#ref53)]. A report on the combination of part 2 of the GEN501 and SIRIUS studies that included patients who had received a median of 5 prior lines of therapies showed an ORR of 31.1%, a median duration response of 7.6 months, a PFS of 4.0 months, and an OS of 20.1 months [ [54](#ref54)]. In the final results of the GEN501 and SIRIUS studies, the 3-year PFS was 19.6%, showing maintenance of a deep and durable response [ [55](#ref55)]. Approximately 50% of the patients were found to have experienced infusion-related reactions (IRR) during Dara administration, most of which occurred in the first infusion and were categorized as either grades 1 or 2. In a real-world study involving patients from Korean medical centers, the ORR and PFS in relation to Dara monotherapy was reported to be from 42.1% to 56.3% and from 2.7 to 6 months, respectively, with any grade IRR from 42.9% to 87.5%, which were mostly manageable [ [56](#ref56), [57](#ref57)]. [20](#ref20)] and with continuous Rd (POLLUX) [ [23](#ref23)] have proven their synergistic efficacy compared with a comparator arm. The POLLUX trial reported prolonged PFS (median not reached vs. 17.5 mo) and a better ORR (92.9% vs. 76.4%) in the Dara-Rd arm compared with Rd at 25.4 months follow-up. A PFS benefit in the Dara-Rd arm was observed across age subgroups and ISS stage [ [58](#ref58)]. In the 19.4 months of updated analysis from the CASTOR trial, 8 cycles of Dara-Vd followed by Dara maintenance improved PFS (16.7 vs. 7.1 mo) and ORR (83.8% vs. 63.2%) compared with Vd only. Dara-Vd was effective regardless of age, ISS stage, renal failure, and cytogenetic risk [ [59](#ref59)]. In the POLLUX and CASTOR trials, a significant rate of MRD negativity was achieved across both high and standard cytogenetic risk patients [ [60](#ref60)]. Phase III studies comparing Dara (intravenous or subcutaneous)-Pd with (APOLLO, NCT 03277105) are currently ongoing. [61](#ref61)]. However, elotuzumab combined with Rd showed significantly better efficacy, which was confirmed in the phase III ELOQUENT-2 trial. Elotuzumab plus Rd showed significantly better efficacy in terms of ORR (79% vs. 66%) and PFS (19.4 vs. 14.9 mo). Moreover, a better PFS was observed regardless of age group and renal failure [ [22](#ref22)]. Response was maintained even at 5-year follow-up [ [62](#ref62)]. Common adverse events were hematologic toxicity and fatigue, which were similar in both treatment groups, and IRR occurred in 10% of patients in the elotuzumab arm who were mostly categorized as either grade 1 or 2. Phase II studies on the efficacy of elotuzumab with Pd or Kd are currently ongoing. [63](#ref63)] or pomalidomide [ [49](#ref49)] and has recently shown efficacy with ixazomib [ [64](#ref64)]. Cyclophosphamide as a monotherapy or with dexamethasone can be administered via an oral or intravenous route, according to various doses and schedules. High-dose cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2 for 4 days) was found to have an ORR of 43% in advanced refractory MM in the period when no novel agents were available [ [65](#ref65)]. Melphalan is an historical remedy for MM, and is still used as a drug for conditioning therapy during autoSCT and in combination with bortezomib or thalidomide. It could be an alternative for non-affordable new agents or for those who have no other therapeutic options. In certain circumstances such as the aggressive progression of MM, multidrug combination chemotherapy may be needed such as and effective control of the disease. [69](#ref69)]. A dose-escalation trial involving refractory patients with MM after autoSCT reported an ORR of 55% and a median PFS of 8.5 months. From a real-world analysis in Korea, heavily pretreated patients with MM (median prior treatment, 5) who had been treated with bendamustine (120 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2) plus prednisone showed an ORR of 35% and a median OS of 5.5 months [ [70](#ref70)]. Bendamustine in combination with lenalidomide [ [71](#ref71)] and bortezomib [ [72](#ref72)] has also shown activity in patients with RRMM. Other food and drug administration (FDA)-approved drugs [73](#ref73)]. The major adverse events from the addition of panobinostat were cytopenia, diarrhea, and asthenia. Panobinostat has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with RRMM who failed to respond to bortezomib and lenalidomide; however, it has not been approved for use in Korea. [74](#ref74)] and has recently been approved by the US FDA. In highly refractory patients who were treated with a median of 7 regimens, the ORR was 26% with a median PFS and OS of 3.7 months and 8.6 months, respectively. Due to the promising results from the phase II clinical trial that evaluated selinexor plus Vd, a phase III trial comparing Vd with or without selinexor is currently underway (BOSTON trial, NCT03110562). Salvage transplantation [75](#ref75)]. Previous retrospective analyses have shown patients who relapsed >18-24 months after the first autoSCT may benefit from autoSCT after re-induction therapy [ [76](#ref76), [77](#ref77)]. Matched-pair analysis from the Korean myeloma registry has reported significantly longer OS (55.5 vs. 25.4 mo) for salvage autoSCT compared with systemic chemotherapy alone in patients who relapsed after upfront autoSCT [ [78](#ref78)]. A poor outcome could be predicted for patients who relapsed <18 months after their first autoSCT and ISS III. The only phase III German trial comparing re-induction Rd followed by salvage autoSCT and maintenance Rd with continuous Rd did not prove the efficacy of autoSCT as a salvage treatment in terms of ORR, PFS, and OS; however, patients with high-risk cytogenetics experienced improved survival after salvage autoSCT (HR, 2.71 for PFS and 4.22 for OS; P<0.001 for both) [ [79](#ref79)]. The role of salvage autoSCT is not clear in the era of frontline maintenance therapy and new drug triplet combinations in the RRMM setting. AlloSCT with reduced induced conditioning chemotherapy can be considered in young and fit patients who have high-risk cytogenetics. The largest outcome series, from European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation data, has reported a 3-year PFS of 41% and OS of 21% in the heterogeneous population of RRMM [ [80](#ref80)]. Recent registry-based analysis comparing salvage autoSCT and alloSCT in patients with RRMM showed no significant advantage in terms of alloSCT in this setting; however, long-term survivors were only observed among alloSCT recipients [ [81](#ref81)]. TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR RRMM [Fig. 1](#F1)). Biochemical relapse not fulfilling the IMWG criteria for progressive disease may be followed up every 2 months, with close monitoring for the appearance of myeloma-related symptoms. Biochemical relapse that has met the IMWG criteria and clinical relapses should proceed to treatment. Aggressive biology (rapid onset of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency and skeletal events, newly appearing extramedullary plasmacytoma, doubling of M-protein concentration, elevated LDH levels, elevated peripheral blood plasma cell counts, and a high plasma cell proliferation index) may be better treated with at least triplet combinations of novel agents, which are able to elicit a rapid and deep response. Patients in deep and durable responses, such as those with a response duration of >24 months to frontline therapy, from 18 to 24 months after autoSCT without maintenance, and from 36 to 48 months after autoSCT with maintenance, can be retreated with previously prescribed drugs or undergo salvage HDT with autologous stem cell support [ [4](#ref4)]. Drugs that were previously refractory should be avoided. Patients refractory to bortezomib triplets and Rd) Kd, while lenalidomide-refractory patients should be treated with Kd or Vd with or without daratumumab. Double-refractory patients to IMiDs and PIs can benefit from "}
