The more you understand how you operate inside the reality of you, the more empowered you are to choose to act in alignment with your purpose. Being spiritual feels like less sabotage, less stuckness, more fulfillment, and freedom in this dimension we call life. When you achieve spiritual healing you truly are at your highest self, living with intention, in touch with your inner higher guide, living to leave this world better than you found it, living for love and unity. In touch with Gaia, and looking internally instead of outward for your answers. Spiritual healing encompasses the totality of the universe, which are the tools vibrational light energy, God/Creator, source energy has provided man. You become a healer once you honor the calling upon your life to be used by Great Spirit, to surrender, to work only for the Creator, to help your fellow man heal and live a more fulfilling life. It works by finding an honorable teacher that has been ordained, and lives the life you see as spiritual and true. It begins by you following with honor, valor, and gratitude before stepping up to become the teacher when Great Spirit says it's time. What is Spiritual Healing? Spiritual healing is an alternative treatment performed by one or more practitioners that aims to improve or heal any number of patient ailments. Many differing modalities of spiritual healing currently exist in the world. As a form of holistic medicine, spiritual healing claims to help relieve a wide range of physical, mental, or emotional conditions, from physical illness to depression. Placing their hands on the patient, spiritual healers channel energy from practitioner to patient in order to heal the afflicted area. It is important to note, however, that spiritual healing is a subjective alternative that will have different results for each person. What do spiritual healers do? If you are pursuing spiritual healing as a form of treatment, or with the interest of becoming a practitioner, it is important to understand how personal the treatment process is with each client. No one size fits all treatments There is no single set approach when it comes to developing a client's spiritual healing treatment plan. Practitioners will build a unique plan for each individual to suit their needs. A client could be seeking relief from mental or physical issues caused by inner or external events. This means that practitioners must rely on the bond that they have built with a client in order to best address their needs. Diagnosis and treatment plans Spiritual healers understand the necessity of having a unique approach toward diagnosis and treatment for each client. The practitioner together with the client will come up with a treatment plan that will target what the client would like to accomplish during and after treatment. According to an expert energy teacher \"While many allopathic practices break a patient down into parts, and then 'treat' the part, an alternative therapist should look at their client as a whole being with many moving parts involved and approach care from that perspective,\" said Dr. Lola Scarborough, teacher, and trainer at Healing Hut based in League City, Texas. Once a treatment plan is agreed upon, a wide spectrum of therapeutic strategies is offered to the client. These strategies can range from talk therapy to simple meditative practices, or even one or more of the massage specialties out there, and acupuncture in some instances. Becoming a spiritual healer What you'll study You can find certificate and diploma programs in holistic spiritual healing available through a variety of specialized healing institutes. You should expect your spiritual healing courses to cover some of the following topics: - Theory and history of spiritual healing - Anatomy, physiology, and disease - Healing movements and practice - Energy bodies and flow - Working with particular clients, including children and pregnant women - Advising clients on self-care practices - Spiritual healing professionalism and code of conduct Additional courses may be offered depending on the specialty of focus. Those pursuing spiritual healing should research programs carefully to find an institute that specializes in their area of interest while also promoting a healthy spiritual learning environment. Programs with a more generalized focus may aim to teach students about the associated alternative forms of therapy that also contribute to becoming a well-educated spiritual healer. For example, many programs will educate students in psychotherapy or even yoga and physical mobility techniques. Earning additional education in these similar alternative fields of therapy can contribute to candidates becoming more well-rounded spiritual healers in the future. Average length of study Training programs for aspiring healers may take on average 6 months to two years to complete\u2014 but this will depend upon the program you choose and the format in which it's offered. Some programs may have more in-depth requirements, while others may offer shorter programs with a less heavy focus on spiritual healing traditions and techniques. Many of these educational programs typically involve a series of weekend or week-long retreats with space in between to allow students to absorb class teachings and practice what they've learned. Average tuition Since there are so many different types of programs specializing in spiritual healing, potential students may find a range of tuition fees. Programs that take longer and have more completion requirements can cost up thousands of dollars. Other weekend programs, or shorter educational retreats, may have lower tuition and associated costs. Spiritual healing certification At the end of your spiritual healing training, you will receive a certificate or diploma indicating that you've met the requirements for practicing as a professional healer. Students already certified in other holistic health professions might be able to earn continuing education credits for spiritual healing classes. There are no state-certified boards or organizations that oversee the certification standards of spiritual healers. The certification requirements and standards are established by the issuing program, educational institution, or retreat organizers. Is there a demand for this career? Due to the public's interest in alternative therapies, those who pursue a career in spiritual healing may be surprised at the growth this sector could enjoy in the near future. A 2017 Pew Research study says, \"About half of Americans report having tried some form of alternative medicine, such as herbal remedies, acupuncture, chiropractic treatment or energy therapies, at some point during their lifetime.\" The National Institute of Health released a report in 2013 with data showcasing the growing usage of complementary and alternative medicine in cancer patients specifically. \"Among 316 participants, 193 (61.3%) reported (complementary and alternative medicine) CAM use following diagnosis.\" [1, 2] Not only is there an interest in alternative medicine for those with serious conditions, there is a growing popularity among healthy individuals, which bodes well not just for employability for practitioners but opportunities for personal growth and job satisfaction too. Spiritual healer salary Alternative medicine practitioner salaries vary widely based on a number of factors, including: - geographic location, - experience, - and employer type. Those who wish to increase their salary as a private practice spiritual healer may need to grow their clientele through self-promotion, advertising, and networking. Some holistic health practitioners will choose to become self-employed and supplement their income by teaching professional training programs, speaking at public events, or writing books about their discipline. Is a spiritual healing career right for you? This path requires self-motivation and resourcefulness, using fundamentals such as anatomy and physiology as well as alternative energy flow and healing traditions. A big part of the job is a willingness to work closely with people enduring a wide range of emotional, mental, and physical health conditions. If you can see yourself investing deeply in each client's treatment needs, then this career may be for you. \"One must hold one's self to the highest standards and always have the best interests of the client at the core of one's practice,\" said Scarborough. In addition to the aforementioned massage techniques, prospective spiritual healers may also benefit from learning about becoming a Reiki master as well as how an alternative form of touch therapy known as polarity therapy works. Only you can decide on the ultimate path you follow.
