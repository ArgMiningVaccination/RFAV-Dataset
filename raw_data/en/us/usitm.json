To assist with the following steps, the COPS Office is providing an Application Checklist that can be found in table 2 on page 19. 10 1. Obtain or confirm a DUNS number 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide Estimated timeframe: up to five business days to obtain the DUNS number The Federal Government requires that all applicants for federal awards, with the exception of individuals other than sole proprietors, have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number prior to application submission. The DUNS number is used to identify related organizations that are receiving funding under awards and to provide consistent name and address data for electronic award application systems. A DUNS number may be obtained by telephone at 866- 705-5711 or via the Internet at fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number The DUNS number is a unique nine -or thirteen -digit identification number provided by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). The DUNS number is site-specific. Therefore, each distinct physical location of an entity (such as branches, divisions, and headquarters) may be assigned a different DUNS number. Organizations should try to keep DUNS numbers to a minimum. In many instances, a central DUNS number with a DUNS number for each major division , department , or agency that applies for an award may be sufficient. You should verify that you have a DUNS number or take the steps needed to obtain one as soon as possible, if there is a possibility you will be applying for future federal awards. If you already have a DUNS number. If you, as the entity applying for a federal award agreement, previously obtained a DUNS number in connection with the federal acquisition process or requested or had one assigned to you for another purpose, you should use that number on all of your applications. It is not necessary to request another DUNS number from D&B. You may request D&B to supply a family tree report of the DUNS numbers associated with your organization. Organizations should work with D&B to ensure the right information is on the report. Organizations should not establish new numbers but use existing numbers and update or validate the information associated with the number. If you are not sure whether you have a DUNS number, call D&B using the toll-free number 866-705-5711 and indicate that you are a federal award applicant or prospective applicant. D&B will tell you if you already have a number. If you do not have a DUNS number, D&B will ask you to provide the information listed in the following section and will immediately assign you a number free of charge. To obtain your DUNS number The requestor may obtain a DUNS number via the Internet at fedgov.dnb.com/webform . The requestor may also obtain a DUNS number via telephone at 866- 705- 5711. The phone is staffed from 8:00 a.m.to 6:00 p.m. (local time of the caller when calling from within the contiguous United States). Calls placed outside of those hours will receive a recorded message requesting the caller to call back between the operating hours. The process to request a number takes about 5-10 minutes. A DUNS number will be assigned at the conclusion of the call. You will need to provide the following information: Legal name of your organization Headquarters name and address for your organization Doing business as (DBA) or other name by which your organization is commonly known or recognized Physical address, city, state, and ZIP code Mailing address (if separate from headquarters and/or physical address) 11 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide Telephone number Contact name and title Number of employees at your physical location Managing your DUNS number D&B periodically contacts organizations with DUNS numbers to verify that their information is current. Organizations with multiple DUNS numbers may request a free family tree listing from D&B to help determine what branches or divisions have numbers and whether the information is current. Please call the dedicated toll-free DUNS number request line at 866- 705-5711 to request your family tree. D&B recommends that organizations with multiple DUNS numbers have a single point of contact for controlling DUNS number requests to ensure that the appropriate branches or divisions have DUNS numbers for federal purposes. As a result of obtaining a DUNS number you have the option to be included on D&B 's marketing list that is sold to other companies. If you do not want your name or organization included on this marketing list, request to be de -listed from D&B 's marketing file when you are speaking with a D&B representative during your DUNS number telephone application. Obtaining a DUNS number is absolutely free for all entities doing business with the Federal Government. This includes award and cooperative agreement applicants or prospective applicants and federal contractors. Be certain to identify yourself as a federal award applicant or prospective applicant. 2. Register in the SAM database or confirm SAM number Est imated timeframe: up to 10 bus iness days to complete (if you do not have an EIN, the process can take up to 5 weeks) In addition, all applicants are required to maintain current registrations in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. The SAM database replaces the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as the repository for standard information about federal financial assistance applicants, recipients, and subrecipients. DOJ requires that all applicants (other than individuals) for federal financial assistance maintain current registrations in the SAM database. Applicants must update or renew their SAM registration annually to maintain an active status.

The separate budget narrative should thoroughly and clearly describe every category of expense listed in the budget detail worksheets contained in section 14 of the application . The COPS Office expects proposed budgets to be complete, cost effective, and allowable (e.g., reasonable, allocable, and necessary for project activities). An applicant should demonstrate in its separate budget narrative how it will maximize cost effectiveness of award expenditures. Budget narratives should generally describe cost effectiveness in relation to potential alternatives and the goals of the project. For example, a budget narrative should detail why planned in-person meetings are necessary, or how technology and collaboration with outside organizations could be used to reduce costs, without compromising quality. Consideration will be given to budget proposals that maximize the direct funding that supports project activities. The budget narrative should be mathematically sound and correspond clearly with the information provided in the budget detail worksheets. The narrative should explain how the applicant estimated and calculated all costs and how those costs are necessary to the completion of the proposed project. The narrative may include tables for clarification purposes but need not be in a spreadsheet format.

Figure 4. Travel/training/conference budget worksheet 43 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide Section 14.F. Contracts/Consultants Contract costs Contracts include goods or services that directly contribute to the implementation or enhancement of the project. The applicant should distinguish clearly between subawards and contracts in allocating any funds to other entities. Pursuant to 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.330, a subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of the federal award, and a contract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the recipient 's own use. The substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement in determining whether the recipient of the pass - through funds is a subrecipient or a contractor. Keep in mind that the awarding and monitoring of contracts must follow documented procurement procedures, including full and open competition, pursuant to the procurement standards in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.317- 200.326, and the issuance of subawards must meet the requirements of 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.331. In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition when feasible. For the purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS Office award, recipients must follow their own policies and procedures on procurement as long as those requirements conform to the federal procurement requirements set forth in the uniform administrative requ irements (2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.317 - 200.326). Consistent with the uniform administrative requirements that prohibit procurement practices that restrict competition, recipients and subrecipients may not discriminate against any person or entity on the basis of a person or entity 's status as an \"associate of the Federal Government \" (or on the basis of a person or entity 's status as a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary of an associate of the F ederal Government). The term \" associate of the F ederal Government \" means any person or entity engaged or employed (in the past or at present) by or on behalf of the F ederal Government as an employee, contractor, subcontractor, award recipient, subrecipient, agent, or otherwise. Any recipient of an award will be responsib le for moni toring subawards and contracts in accordance with all applicable statutes, regulations, and guidelines. Primary recipients will be responsible for oversight of subrecipient/partner spending and monitoring specific performance measures and outcomes attributable to the use of COPS Office funds. All sole source procurements of goods and services (those not awarded competitively) in excess of $250,000 require prior approval from the COPS Office. Typically unallowable contract costs include the following : Construction costs Maintenance and/or service contracts that extend the life of the award period (multiyear contracts and extended warranties are allowable but must be paid in full within the initial award period and must not exceed the award period) Completing section 14.F. contract costs 1.

The use of a consultant should be more economical than direct employment. Compensation for individual consultant services procured under a COPS Office award must be reasonable and allocable in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles, and consistent with that paid for similar services in the marketplace. The services should be commensurate with the rate or salary paid by the primary employer. Unless otherwise approved by the COPS Office, independent consultant rates will be approved based on the salary a consultant receives from his or her primary employer, as applicable, up to $650 per day (or $81.25 per hour) . Please note that this does not mean that the rate can or should be as high as $650 for all consultants. If individuals receive fringe benefits from their primary employer, such fringe benefit costs should not be included in the calculation of consultant rates. A consultant rate justification will need to be submitted for review and approval to the COPS Office for any consultants paid more than $650 per day prior to incurring any costs. Determinations of approval will be made on a case -by-case basis. Typically unallowable consultant costs include the following: Compensation of federal employees \u2014this category of unallowable costs includes salary payments, consulting fees, or other compensation to full-time federal employees .

Requests that may fall under the \"other \" category include officer overtime, rent (see next paragraph for more details), or software purchases. Rental costs are generally allowable under the TRGP -TA program when the costs are not included in indirect costs. Applicants should list square footage cost in the budget. The amount must be based on the space that will be allocated to implement the COPS Office project, not the costs of the entire rental space. Rental costs are not allowable for property owned by the applicant or if the applicant has a financial interest in the property . In this case only the costs of ownership, including maintenance costs, insurance, depreciation, utilities, etc., are allowable costs. The applicant must indicate in the budget narrative whether or not they own the space that will be rented.

Other costs budget worksheet Section 14.H. Indirect costs Over vie w of indirect costs Indirect costs means those costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective, and not readily assignable to a particular project but necessary to the operation of the organization and the performance of the project. Examples of costs usually treated as indirect include those incurred for facility operation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative salaries. If a cognizant federal agency has approved your negotiated indirect cost rate, the negotiated rate must be accepted by all federal awarding agencies , unless otherwise capped by federal statute or regulation . Indirect cost rates may vary depending on your cognizant federal agency determinations. In some cases, project budgets may include more than one rate, particularly when offsite activity is conducted at a location other than the organizations premises. Note: Ensure the indirect calculation is in accordance with your organization 's indirect cost rate agreement. Expired indirect cost rate agreement If your indirect cost rate agreement has expired, either you must renegotiate the rate or you may request a one- time extension from your cognizant agency. The negotiated cost rate may be extended for up to four years. Once the cognizant federal agency has approved your extension, you must abide by the rate for the agreed -upon time period. No further negotiations regarding indirect cost rates may occur until the extension has expired. At the end of the extension period, you must then negotiate a new indirect cost rate. No approved plan If you are a nonfederal entity that has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, except for those nonfederal entities described in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Appendix VII to Part 200, paragraph D.1.b., you may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10 percent of modified total direct costs (MTDC) which may be used indefinitely. When using this method, cost must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs, but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. Also, if this method is chosen, then it must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as you choose to negotiate an indirect cost rate (which may be done at any time). See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.414(f). 51 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide If you elect to negotiate an indirect cost rate with your cognizant federal agency, a special condition will be added to the award prohibiting the obligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until an indirect cost rate has been approved by your cognizant Federal agency, and the appropriate notification has been made retiring the special condition. For assistance with identifying the appropriate cognizant federal agency for indirect costs, please contact the OCFO Customer Service Center at 800- 458- 0786 or at ask.ocfo@usdoj.gov . If DOJ is the cognizant federal agency, applicants may obtain information needed to submit an indirect cost rate proposal at https://www.ojp.gov/funding/Apply/Resources/IndirectCosts.pdf . Exception: If you are a unit of local government in which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has not assigned a cognizant Federal agency, then you are not required to submit your indirect cost proposal, unless the awarding agency requires a copy of the proposal. Please see the appropriate Appendix section in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as listed above. Approval of indirect cost rates for subrecipients As the direct recipient, you are responsible for approving indirect cost rates for your subrecipients if funded. Such rates must be consistent with the requirements of 2 C.F.R. Part 200. The COPS Office will not approve indirect cost rates beyond the direct recipient level; however, subrecipients who are also direct recipients of Federal awards may already have a Federally approved indirect cost rate. If your subrecipient has negotiated an indirect cost rate with the Federal government, then that rate applies. The subrecipient rates should not be included in this section, but rather under Section 14.F. Calculating direct cost base The following direct cost bases may be used as a distribution base: Modified total direct cost (MTDC) \u2014This base includes all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and subawards up to the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs, and the portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000. Other items may only be excluded when necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs, and with the approval of the cognizant agency. Direct salaries and w ages \u2014This base includes only the costs of direct salaries and wages incurred by the organization. Direct salaries and w ages plus fringe b enefits \u2014This base includes the costs of direct salary , wages and fringe benefits incurred by the organization. 52 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide Exclusions in direct cost bases Applicants should pay particular attention to the two areas listed below to ensure that the ir indirect cost rate application is in compliance with the existing requirements of the government -wide award rules set out in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circular and regulations: $25,000 Subcontract/Subaward limitation. For institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations, indirect cost rates negotiated on the basis of modified total direct costs may only be applied against the first $25,000 of any subcontract or subaward under the agreement. This limitation must be applied to all conference related subcontracts and subawards, including those with hotels and travel agents. (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.400 et seq.) Participant s upport c osts. For nonprofit organizations, in accordance with 2 C.F.R. part 200, Appendix IV to 2 Part 200, paragraph B.2.c. \u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations: \"The distribution base may be total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as [contracts or] subawards for $25,000 or more), direct salaries and wages, or other base which results in an equitable distribution. The distribution base must exclude participant support costs as defined in \u00a7 200.75 Participant support costs. \" Please note that only employees of the nonprofit organization are excluded from the definition of participant support costs. Costs related to contractors of the nonprofit organization who are acting in the capacity of a conference trainer/instructor/presenter/facilitator are considered participant support costs.

Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of a recipient 's COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions. Monitoring Federal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office be monitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS Office is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of award implementation \u2014compliance and programmatic benefits \u2014are part of the mon itoring process coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice . Awarded agencies will be responsible for submitting Programmatic Progress Reports on a semi -annual basis and Federal Financial Reports on a quarterly basis. In addition, awarded agencies will be responsible for the timely submission of a final Closeout Report and any other required final reports. All COPS Office recipients will be required to participate in such award monitoring activities of the U.S. Department of Justice, including but not limited to the COPS Office, the Office of the Inspector General, or any entity designated by the COPS Office. Please note that the COPS Office may take a number of monitoring approaches, such as site visits, enhanced office- based award reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, and periodic surveys to gather information and to ensure compliance. The COPS Office may seek information including, but not limited to, your organization 's compliance with nonsupplanting and both programmatic and financial requirements of the award , and your organization 's progress toward achieving your community policing strategy. Program and monitoring specialists as well as auditors are particularly interested in confirming that the purchase of items and/or services is co nsistent with the applicant 's approved award budget as reflected on the Financial Clearance Memo randum and Final Funding Memorandum. If awarded funds, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for information pertaining to your award in preparation for any of the above -referenced award monitoring activities. Please feel free to contact your COPS Office Program Manager to discuss any questions or concerns you may have regarding the monitoring, reporting, and evaluation requirements. 81 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide Program evaluation Though a formal assessment is not a requirement, awarded organizations are strongly encouraged to conduct an independent assessment of their respective award -funded projects. Project evaluations have proven to be valuable tools in helping organizations identify areas in need of improvement, providing data of successful processes , and reducing vulnerabilities. Selected award recipients shall be evaluated on the local level or as part of a national evaluation, pursuant to guidelines established by the Attorney General. Such evaluations may include assessments of individual program implementations. In selected jurisdictions that are able to support outcome evaluations, the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities may be required. Outcome measures may include crime and victimization indicators, quality of life measures, community perceptions, and police perceptions of their own work. 82 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide Audit Requirement The Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principle s, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards at 2 C.F.R.

Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a) All applications submitted to the COPS Office (including all attachments to applications) are subject to the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and to the Privacy Act. By law, DOJ may withhold information that is responsive to a request if DOJ determines that the responsive information is protected from disclosure under the Privacy Act or falls within the scope of one or more of the nine statutory exemptions under FOIA. DOJ cannot agree in advance of a request pursuant to the FOIA not to release some or all portions of an application /award file. In its review of records that are responsive to a FOIA request, the COPS Office will withhold information in those records that plainly falls within the scope of the Privacy Act or one of the statutory exemptions under FOIA. (Some examples include certain types of information in budgets, and names and contact information for project staff other than certain key personnel.) In appropriate circumstances, the COPS Office will request the views of the applicant/recipient that submitted a responsive document. For example, if the COPS Office receives a request pursuant to the FOIA for an application submitted by a nonprofit organization, for-profit organization, or an institution of higher education, or a request for an application that involves research, the COPS Office typically will contact the applicant/recipient that submitted the application . The COPS Office ask the applicant/recipient to identify \u2014quite precisely \u2014any particular information in the application that the applicant/recipient believes falls under a FOIA exemption, the specific exemption it believes applies, and why. After considering the submission by the applicant/recipient, the COPS Office makes an independent assessment regarding withholding information.

Conference and event guidance Conference and Event Approval, Planning, and Reporting FAQ Prior Approval I. Approximately how long should it take to adequately complete the Conference & Events Submission form? The amount of time required to adequately complete the Conference & Events Submission Form will vary depending on the complexity of the proposed event. A small event (in terms of number of attendees, total cost, etc.) may require only an hour or two to complete the form because the event is basic/routine and data are not required in all of the available categories. On the other hand, a large event (in terms of number of attendees, multiple sessions occurring at the same time, etc.) may require several hours or days depending on the amount of required data (categories) and level of justication needed to support the event. Regardless of the size of any event, the supporting justication should be sucient to support the agency 's mission for conducting the event. II. Which types of events do not require prior approval? Currently there are six types of events that do not require prior approval: 1. Conferences held by grant recipients. (Note: Conferences held by cooperative agreement recipients do require prior approval.) 2. Law enforcement operational activities, including staging, surveillance, investigation, intelligence, and undercover activities. 3. Routine operational meetings (e.g., sta meetings or all -hands meetings) if held in a federal facility, if held by cooperative agreement recipients in a non -federal facility that does not charge for its use, and if there are neither costs to the DOJ for logis tical conference planning nor government -provided food or beverages. In all three of these instances, the answer to all the questions on the Prior Approval Not Required Checklist must be \"No.\" Site visits are considered routine operational meetings regardl ess of location so long as there are no costs to the DOJ for meeting rooms, logistical conference planning, or food and beverages. 4. Testing activities where the primary purpose of the event is to evaluate an applicant 's qualications to perform certain duties necessary to his or her job. This includes rearms and weaponry prociency testing and certications. A majority of the event must be devoted to administering and taking the test. Testing activities that are incidental to a training course or conference or are given upon its completion do require prior approval. 5. Video conferences and webinars where there are neither costs to the DOJ for logistical conference planning nor government -provided food or beverages. 6. Technical assistance visits where travel was made by an individual or a small group of project sta members to provide training or technical assistance to a particular entity; in this instance, the answer to all the questions on the Prior Approval Not Required Checklist must be \"No.\" III. Where should time staff spent working on the conference that is not related to planning be captured? Time spent working on a conference by sta or contractors can be classied as either logistical planning time or programmatic planning time. Programmatic planning includes time spent on activities such as 119 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide developing the conference content and agenda, identifying and recruiting subject matter experts, and preparing written materials. Logistical planning includes time spent on tasks such as selecting a venue, ordering and setting up audio -video equipment, securing hotel rooms, processing registrations, providing onsite support during the event, and undertaking other non -programmatic functions. IV. If a cooperative agreement recipient or contractor is able to obtain a no- cost site for the event, are we still required to look into other facilities and provide justication for not selecting the other facilities? Yes. Cooperative agreement recipients and contractors should compare three or more facilities in a location. Facilities being compared should have provided a cost estimate and be able to accommodate the event as detailed in the requirements. A desired hotel may oer an incentive of no overall facility cost (e.g., for meeting rooms or audio- visual equipment) but may not be economical in other cost comparison items such as the availability of lodging at per diem rates, travel distance for attendees, etc. Also, recipients and contractors should maintain written documentation justifying their decision to select the chosen location in the event of a future audit. V. Is there a timeframe after the COPS Oce accepts a conference request that a cooperative agreement recipient or contractor can expect notication of approval? Each event request (meeting, conference, webinar, etc.) is uniqu e in reference to how it will accomplish the COPS Oce 's mission. The key to any conference request moving through the review process depends on whether the package is complete. A complete package contains a detailed cost analysis and sucient justication to support all categories within the package. Example: An event is submitted for approval and consists of the following categories: printing and distribution, meals and incidental expenses (M&IE), lodging, transportation, and trainer or facilitator costs . The package contains a detailed cost analysis of each cost category (e.g., one trainer at $450 per day x 2 days = $900) and adequate justication explaining the purpose of the event and the role of the trainer. This package can move through the review pr ocess in a few days and allow ample time for travelers to make reservations, if the package was submitted within the required timeframe. However, if the trainer or facilitator 's costs in the submitted package exceed the COPS Oce 's threshold and if support ing justication was not included, a delay may occur while this justication is being retrieved. To avoid delays in the approval process, all recipients and contractors should adhere to the timeframe requirements for the dollar amount of their proposed ev ent. VI. Once an event is approved, how do we handle any increases or decreases in the amount of attendees originally proposed on the cost analysis spreadsheet submitted to the DOJ for approval? After receiving notication of approval from the COPS Office, all subsequent changes prior to the start day of the event should be sent to the COPS Oce Conference Costs email address , as appropriate. Example: If the COPS Office approved on 9/1/2019 an event scheduled for 12/15/2019, the cooperative agreement recipient or contractor should notify the COPS Office of any changes in attendees as soon as possible (preferably 30 days or more in advance). This scenario holds true for changes to the start and end date, location, and any other cost -related category. VII. Does the $25 per person per day limit for meeting rooms and audio- visual costs also include service fees and taxes? Yes. The cost allowed for conference space and audio -visual equipment and services (fees and taxes) is limited to $25 per day per attendee and is not to exceed a cumulative total cost of $20,000. Total costs are dened as direct and indirect costs. 120 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide VIII. What if there are multiple meetings occurring within the larger event oered to all the attendees? Is the $25 per day per attendee limit applicable to each meeting? Example: A general session meeting contains all attendees and later breakout sessions are oered to the groups. Can each breakout session have its own $25 per person per day limit? No. Despite the multiple meetings oered within the larger event, the COPS Office considers and approves this type of situation to be a single event. IX. Can we accept complimentary food and beverage? Yes. Complimentary food and beverages may be accepted if oered to everyone. Example: Hotel W oers a complimentary continental breakfast to all its overnight customers regardless of any status they may have with the hotel chain. This type of complimentary oer is considered a business strategy of the hotel to promote an increase in overnight stays. You are not required to reduce your M&IE by the value of the food and beverage it oered to all customers as noted in this example. X. Are the thresholds ($8,750 for logistical planner, $35,000 for programmatic planner, and $2 0,000 for conference space and audio -visual equipment and services) a cumulative cost for the entire event or a per day cost? The cost allowed for conference space and audio -visual equipment and services (fees and taxes) is limited to $25 per day per atte ndee and is not to exceed a cumulative total cost of $20,000. The cost allowed for a logistical planner is the lesser of $50 per attendee or $8,750 per event. The cost allowed for a programmatic planner is the lesser of $200 per attendee or $35,000 per eve nt. XI. To whom should I submit event requests? For all COPS Oce events, the form should be sent to the COPS Office Conference Costs email address . Please do not send questions or other correspondence to this email address. This mailbox should be used only for the submission of conference forms and supporting documentation (e.g., hotel contracts). XII. How far in advance do I have to submit an event for review and approval? Requests for confer ences costing $100,000 or less, and not exceeding any cost thresholds (conference space and audio -visual equipment and services, logistical conference planner, and programmatic conference planner), must be submitted to the COPS Office 90 calendar days in a dvance of the earliest of the following: Start date of the conference; Deadline for signing conference -related contracts; or Obligation of funds for conference costs (except for minimal costs required to assemble and submit the approval request). Requests for conferences costing more than $100,000, or exceeding any one cost threshold (conference space and audio -visual equipment and services, logistical conference planner, or programmatic conference planner), must be submitted to the COPS Office 120 calendar days in advance of the earliest of the following: Start date of the conference; Deadline for signing conference -related contracts; or Obligation of funds for conference costs (except for minimal costs required to assemble and submit the approval request). 121 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide If approval requests are submitted less than the required number of days in advance (as noted above), the COPS Oce, in its sole discretion, may consider the late requests but cannot ensure the requests will receive a decision in time to avoid having to cancel the conference (particularly if any issues arise with specic items of cost in the request). Cancellation costs associated with conference requests that are submitted for late prior approval may be determined to be unallowable costs by the COPS Offic e. XIII. What are the most common mistakes made on the forms so that I can avoid them in the future and increase the likelihood of a quick review and approval decision for my event? The following are the most common mistakes found: Inaccurate calculation of daily per diem. Daily per diem rates for locations across the nation can be found on the GSA website. Ensure the daily rate used in the calculations corresponds to the specic location and dates of the meeting. In addition, remember that travel days are reimb ursed at a slightly lower rate than meeting days. The lower rates must be used for days of travel both before and after the event. Table 1 includes these lower rates: Table 1. Per diem rates Full per diem rate organization has its own formal, written travel policy, your event submissions can reflect that policy instead of the rates in the chart above. In these instances, state that you have a formal, written travel policy, and clearly explain the rates in the policy and how the corresponding numbers in your submission were derived. Insucient explanation and justication of transportation costs. Remember to break out and briefly describe and justify the transportation costs that are included. Example: If participants are flying to your event and the tickets are being paid for with DOJ funding, you should include the anticipated number of people flying multiplied by the estimated cost per ticket. If cars will be rented, you should include a brief justication for why rental cars are being used instead of another form of ground transportation, such as taxis or shuttles. Insucient explanation and justication of audio -visual costs. All audio -visual costs should be broken out and briefly described. The quantity of equipment to be rented (number of microphones, projectors, etc.) should be included, along with relevant costs and a brief justication for why the proposed equipment is required to conduct a successful meeting. A discussion of how the audio - visual servic es provider was selected should be included (for example, did you obtain three quotes?). Insucient explanation and justication of printing costs. Proposed printing costs for participant materials should also be itemized and briefly described. Specically, it is important to articulate why printed materials are needed instead of making materials available electronically (at low or no cost) to attendees before or after the event. 122 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide Insucient explanation and justication of shipping costs. Provide an itemization of these costs, along with a brief description of why the equipment and other materials being shipped are essential to hosting a successful conference. Insucient explanation and justication of consultant costs. The maximum daily rate for subject matte r experts who are being reimbursed for their time is noted in the Consultant Contractor Fact Sheet . Describe all consultant costs in detail, and include a brief yet compelling justication f or the proposed costs. Daily rates for subject matter experts above the maximum daily rate require prior approval by the COPS Oce and DOJ. In cases where higher rates are included in the event submission, written documentation of prior approval is required and should be attached. XIV. Should I continue to exclude all food and beverage costs in my event submissions? Yes. The inclusion of food and beverage costs will delay the review process, and these costs are not likely to be approved. The only exception is when the location of the conference does not allow attendees to obtain food or beverages on their own or when this restriction would greatly disrupt the conference schedule. If you believe your event qualies for such a rare exception, contact your Program Manager to discuss it before completing and submitting your form. If meals are included in your event submission, remember that attendees must subtract the meal costs from the M&IE reimbursement for the days on which the meals will occur. XV. Can you summariz e what I can do to prevent follow -up questions about my submitted events that delay the review and approval process? As a general rule, explain how you derived every cost that you include in the conference submission form. For lines that do not provide space for you to add descriptive narrative, include your explanations and specic cost breakdowns in a separate tab or in a separate document that is submitted with the form. In addition, include the cooperative agreement or contract number on the form. XVI. What events qualify for the expedited review process? There is no expedited review process. Every eort is made to review all events as quickly as possible. Most delays result from a need for additional information. Event requests are prioritized for review by balancing the following three criteria: 1. The start date of the event; 2. The date the event submission was received by COPS Oce; and 3. The overall cost and complexity of the event. For example, conferences requiring approval by the assistant attorney general 's administration and the deputy attorney general (over $100,000 - $250,000) typically take longer to process, as they must go through COPS Oce and DOJ reviews, result in more questions, and are more likely to have issues related to cost thresholds. 123 2020 Tribal Resources Grant Program - Technical Assistance (TRGP -TA) Program Application Guide Reportin g XVII. Where can I nd the most updated version of the conference reporting form to use for my submissions? The most updated version of the conference reporting form can be found under the Training Resources for award recipients section on the COPS Office Trai ning page at https://cops.usdoj.gov/training . XVIII. If I have a question about conference reporting, to whom should I send it? Send your questions to your designated Program Manager. They are great resources and will be happy to assist you. XIX. Are we expected to have our sta track their time hour for hour for time spent on the event for planning, etc., or are reasonable estimates adequate for cost reporting purposes? Post -event reports must contain actual costs, not estimates. These costs should include logistical and programmatic planner sta time spent on these activities and any contracted planner costs. XX. With conference cost reports now being due 30 days after the event, how should we handle costs for invoices that have not been received yet? Many invoices (such as for hotels) are not received within 30 days after the event. Should estimates be included on the cost report? All conference costs for events held by cooperative agreement recipients or contractors costi ng more than $20,000, or where more than 50% of attendees are DOJ employees, must be reported within 45 calendar days after the last day of the event . XXI. On the DOJ Conference & Events Submission Form under \" A. General Conference Information, \" is item 19, \" Reporting Period, \" the period in which the actual cost of the event is being reported, or should this be based on the end date of the event? This reporting requirement is based on the end date of the event. All conference costs for events held by cooperative agreement recipients or contractors costing over $20,000, or where more than 50% of attendees are DOJ employees, must be reported within 45 calendar days after the last day of the event. Example: A COPS Oce - approved conference was conducted from 3/16/2019 through 3/20/2019.

Community policing begins with a commitment to building trust and mutual respect between police and communities. It supports public safety by encouraging all stakeholders to work together to address our nation 's crime challenges. When police and communities collaborate, they more effectively address underlying issues, change negative behavioral patterns, and allocate resources. Rather than simply responding to crime, community policing focuses on preventing it through strategic problem - solving approaches based on collaboration. The COPS Office awards grants to hire community policing officers and support the development and testing of innovative policing strategies. COPS Office funding also provides training and technical assistance to community members and local government leaders, as well as all levels of law enforcement. Since 1994, the COPS Office has invested more than $14 billion to add community policing officers to the nation 's streets, enhance crime fighting technology, support crime prevention initiatives, and provide training and technical assistance to help advance community policing. Other achievements include the following: To date, the COPS Office has funded the hiring of approximately 130,000 additional officers by more than 13,000 of the nation 's 18,000 law enforcement agencies in both small and large jurisdictions. Nearly 700,000 law enforcement personnel, community members, and government leaders have been trained through COPS Office- funded training organizations. To date, the COPS Office has distributed more than eight million topic- specific publications, training curricula, white papers, and resource CDs and flash drives. The COPS Office also sponsors conferences, roundtables, and other forums focused on issues critical to law enforcement.
