It's one of the most effective ways to use healing crystals, as their energy is perfect for entering deep, trance-like states of bliss. Meditation is becoming extremely popular in the West, with an array of apps, blogs, and tutorials designed to spread awareness about its benefits. If somehow you aren't up to speed, then here's a brief walkthrough. Meditation For Beginners It's common knowledge, if not widely utilized, that meditation is good for our well-being. It helps us calm down, relax, and let go of things that are leading us astray. It can also be used to elevate our levels of consciousness, creating a deeper state of awareness that helps connect us with the universe.But how do you actually do it? It's simple. You find somewhere quiet, you get comfortable and you close your eyes. When this happens, you'll probably get a lot of thoughts flying around, ranging from \"Why am I doing this?\" to \"Did I leave the gas on?\" The art of mastering your inner thoughts lies in your ability to observe without interacting. Don't respond to your internal questions. Watch them unravel but do not engage. After some time, thoughts will slow down and the big empty space will become more apparent. You can sit here for a while and feel the peace of not having internal dialogue, or you can choose to shift your honed focus to your pre-decided intention. If at any point, you find yourself caught up in your thoughts, it's okay. It's absolutely fine! Simply acknowledge that you lost track and bring your concentration back. There's no need to feel bad about it. It happens to everybody. Return to observation mode and disengage once again. How Do Crystals Help With Meditation? Now you're more familiar with the state we're talking about, you can probably already see how crystals can help bring you there. It's encoded in their DNA. The best healing crystals bring with them a type of warm energy that's highly conducive to this state of heightened awareness. Meditation stones are particularly helpful when it comes to programming intentions. Each crystal has its own qualities and it's up to you to decide which one works best for your needs. Do you want to find that state of peace and just rest there? Or do you want to program your subconscious mind to help you reach your goals? Maybe you'd like to be more productive, more successful, more bold... It's all possible if you pick the right crystal. How To Use Crystals For Meditation In general, you want to hold the stone in your hands and bring your attention away from your thoughts and onto the crystal. Can you feel its energy? Does it feel cold on your palm? Is it smooth or rugged? Don't answer the questions with thoughts. Simply observe the crystal through non-visual senses. Focus on the stone and envision its power as a bright light that vibrates and fills you with every breath. Inhale deeply and exhale deeply. If you choose to set intentions while meditating, you can do so. Focus on your breath and the energy of the crystal. You'll reach that deep relaxed state that we talked about earlier. Here, you can begin to shift your focus to your intention. Visualize it in detail. Build a clear image in your head and be very specific. The more lucidly you can envision your goal, the more of a reality it becomes. Once you feel you've spent enough time there, then slowly open your eyes. Continue monitoring your breath as you adjust back to normal, then carry on with your day. Your intention is being downloaded to the subconscious mind and you may see strange 'coincidences' related to it the more you practice. Another way to use crystals for meditation is to let them rest on your chakras. Locate which chakra you wish to work with and assign it a crystal that has a similar energy. Lie down and follow the same technique as before, only leave the stone on the chakra (or multiple chakras) instead. Feel the energy flow through your body and imagine it expanding with each breath. Which Crystals Are Best For Meditation? Any crystal can be used to help you meditate. You literally have the entire crystal kingdom to choose from. Results will vary from person to person, depending on your own energy and what you hope to gain. Having said that, there are a few that stand out.
