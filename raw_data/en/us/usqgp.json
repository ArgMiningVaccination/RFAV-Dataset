CD8+ T cells outnumber CD4+ cells in multiple sclerosis lesions associated with disease progression, but the pathogenic role and antigenic targets of these clonally expanded effectors are unknown. Based on evidence that demyelination is necessary but not sufficient for disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS), we previously hypothesized that CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells specific for neuronal antigens directly drive the axon and neuron injury that leads to cumulative neurologic disability in MS patients. We now show that demyelination induced expression of MHC class I on neurons and axons and resulted in presentation of a neuron-specific neoantigen These effectors surveilled the CNS in the absence of demyelination but were not retained. However, upon induction of demyelination via cuprizone intoxication, neuroantigen-specific CD8+ T cells proliferated, accumulated in the CNS, and damaged neoantigen-expressing neurons and axons. We further report elevated neuronal expression of MHC class I and 2-microglobulin transcripts and protein in gray matter and white matter tracts in tissue from patients with MS. These findings support a pathogenic role for autoreactive anti-axonal and anti-neuronal CD8+ T cells in MS progression. Benjamin D.S. Clarkson, Ethan M. Grund, Miranda M.

Howe Even when successfully induced, immunological tolerance to solid organ remains vulnerable to inflammatory insults, which can trigger rejection. In a mouse model of cardiac allograft tolerance in which infection with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) precipitates rejection of previously accepted grafts, we showed that recipient CD4+ TCR75 cells reactive to a donor MHC Class I-derived peptide become hypofunctional if the allograft is accepted for > 3 weeks. Paradoxically, infection-induced transplant rejection was not associated with transcriptional or functional reinvigoration of TCR75 cells. We hypothesized that there is heterogeneity in the level of dysfunction of different allospecific T cells, depending on duration of their cognate antigen expression. Unlike CD4+ TCR75 cells, CD4+ TEa cells specific for a peptide derived from donor MHC Class II, an alloantigen whose expression declines post-transplantation but remains inducible in settings of inflammation, retained function in tolerant mice and expanded during Lm-induced rejection. Repeated injections of alloantigens drove hypofunction in TEa cells and rendered grafts resistant to Lm-dependent rejection. Our results uncover a functional heterogeneity in allospecific T cells of distinct specificities post-tolerance induction and reveal a strategy to defunctionalize a greater repertoire of allospecific T cells, thereby mitigating a critical vulnerability of tolerance.

Chong, Donor-recipient (D-R) mismatches outside of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) contribute to kidney allograft loss, but mechanisms remain unclear, specifically for intronic mismatches. We quantified non-HLA mismatches at variant-, gene-, and genome-wide scales from SNP of D- Rs from two well-phenotyped transplant cohorts: Genomics of Chronic Allograft Rejection Organ Transplantation-01/17 gene-level screening in GoCAR the top-ranked gene where D-R mismatches associated graft loss A previously unreported, intronic, LIMS1 haplotype of 30 SNPs independently associated with DCGL in both cohorts. Haplotype mismatches showed a dosage effect, and minor-allele introduction to major- allele-carrying recipients showed greater hazard of DCGL. The LIMS1 haplotype and the previously reported LIMS1 SNP rs893403 are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in immune cells for GCC2 (not LIMS1), which encodes a protein involved in mannose-6-phosphase receptor (M6PR) recycling. Peripheral blood and T-cell transcriptome analyses associated GCC2 gene and LIMS1 SNPs with the TGFB1-SMAD pathway, suggesting a regulatory effect. In vitro GCC2 modulation impacted M6PR-dependent regulation of active TGFB1 and downstream signaling in T-cells. Together, our data locus T-cells. Zeguo Sun, Zhongyang Zhang, Khadija Banu, Ian W.

Menon Consumption of low dietary potassium, common ultra-processed foods, activates the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) via the WNK-SPAK kinase pathway to induce salt retention and elevate blood pressure (BP). However, it remains unclear how high potassium \"DASH-like\" diets inactivate the cotransporter and whether this decreases BP. A transcriptomic screen identified Ppp1C, encoding PP1A, as a potassium up-regulated gene, and its negative regulator, Ppp1r1a, as a potassium-suppressed gene in the kidney. PP1A directly binds to and dephosphorylates NCC when extracellular potassium is elevated. Using mice genetically engineered to constitutively activate the NCC-regulatory kinase SPAK and thereby eliminate the effects of the WNK-SPAK kinase cascade, we confirmed that PP1A dephosphorylates NCC directly in a potassium-regulated manner. Prior adaptation to a high potassium diet was required to maximally dephosphorylate NCC and lower BP in the constitutively active SPAK mice, and this was associated with potassium-dependent suppression of Ppp1r1a, and dephosphorylation of its cognate protein, Subunit inhibition of I1 drives NCC dephosphorylation, providing a mechanism to explain how high dietary K+ lowers BP. Shifting signaling of PP1A in favor of activation of WNK-SPAK may provide an improved therapeutic approach for treating salt-sensitive hypertension. Paul Richard Grimm, Anamaria Tatomir, Lena L.

Moor JCI This Month is a digest of the research, reviews, and other features published each month. The lungs are regularly exposed to airborne irritants, pathogens, and other sources of inflammation that cause injury to the lung epithelium and its underlying structure. Repair and regeneration are essential for healthy lung function throughout life, yet these processes can also influence development and progression of acute and chronic conditions. Series editor Suzanne Herold developed this review series on lung inflammatory injury and tissue repair to reveal the many cell populations involved in normal and aberrant reparative responses. Ranging from discussion of lung stroma and vasculature to adaptive and innate immune systems, the reviews in this series describe the many complex mechanisms that influence pathogen-, inflammation-, and aging-driven injury to the lung and can contribute to aberrant healing, resolution of inflammation, and fibrosis. Reviews also discuss a wide range of potential therapies targeting injury and repair processes that represent promising progress toward better clinical options for patients with acute and chronic lung conditions.
