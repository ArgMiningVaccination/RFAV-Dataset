The Third Party Administrators for this Plan are UMR, Inc. (hereinafter \"UMR\") for medical claims, and TrueScripts for pharmacy claims. The Third Party Administrators do not assume liability for benefits payable under this Plan, since they are solely claims-paying agents for the Plan Administrator. The employer assumes the sole responsibility for funding the Plan benefits out of general assets; however, Employees help cover some of the costs of covered benefits through contributions, Deductibles, out-of-pocket amounts, and Plan Participation amounts as described in the Schedule of Benefits. All claim payments and reimbursements are paid out of the general assets of the employer and there is no separate fund that is used to pay promised benefits. Some of the terms used in this document begin with capital letters, even though such terms normally would not be capitalized. These terms have special meaning under the Plan. Most capitalized terms are listed in the Glossary of Terms, but some are defined within the provisions in which they are used. Becoming familiar with the terms defined in the Glossary of Terms will help You to better understand the provisions of this Plan. Each individual covered under this Plan will be receiving an identification card that he or she may present to providers whenever he or she receives services. On the back of this card are phone numbers to call in case of questions or problems. This document contains information on the benefits and limitations of the Plan and will serve as both the Summary Plan Description (SPD) and Plan document. Therefore it will be referred to as both the SPD and the Plan document.

The Co- pay is typically a flat dollar amount and is paid at the time of service or when billed by the provider. Co- pays do not apply toward satisfaction of Deductibles. Co-pays apply toward satisfaction of in-network and out-of-network out-of-pocket maximums. The Co-pay and out-of-pocket maximum are shown on the Schedule of Benefits. DEDUCTIBLES A Deductible is an amount of money paid once per Plan Year by the Covered Person before any Covered Expenses are paid by this Plan. A Deductible applies to each Covered Person up to a family Deductible limit. When a new Plan Year begins, a new Deductible must be satisfied. Deductible amounts are shown on the Schedule of Benefits. Pharmacy expenses do not count toward meeting the Deductible of this Plan. The Deductible amounts that the Covered Person incurs for Covered Expenses will be used to satisfy the Deductible(s) shown on the Schedule of Benefits. The Deductible amounts that the Covered Person incurs at all benefit levels (whether Incurred at an in- network or out-of-network provider) will be used to satisfy the applicable benefit level's total individual and family Deductible. Any amount that the Covered Person pays for Covered Expenses during the last three months of the prior Plan Year, and that are used to satisfy the individual and family Deductible for that year, will also be applied toward current Plan Year individual and family Deductible requirement. PLAN PARTICIPATION Plan Participation is the percentage of Covered Expenses that the Covered Person is responsible for paying after the Deductible is met. The Covered Person pays this percentage until the Covered Person's (or family's, if applicable) annual out-of-pocket maximum is reached. The Plan Participation rate is shown on the Schedule of Benefits. Any payment for an expense that is not covered under this Plan will be the Covered Person's responsibility. ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUMS The annual out-of-pocket maximum is the most the Covered Person pays each year for Covered Expenses. There are separate in-network and out-of-network out-of-pocket maximums for this Plan. Annual out-of-pocket maximums are shown on the Schedule of Benefits. Amounts the Covered Person incurs for Covered Expenses will be used to satisfy the Covered Person's (or family's, if applicable) annual out-of-pocket maximum(s). If the Covered Person's out-of-pocket expenses in a Plan Year exceed the annual out-of-pocket maximum, the Plan pays 100% of the Covered Expenses through the end of the Plan Year. The following will not be used to meet the out-of-pocket maximums: Penalties, legal fees and interest charged by a provider. Expenses for excluded services. Any charges above the limits specified elsewhere in this document. Out-of-Network Co-pays and Plan Participation amounts for Prescription products. -19- 7670-00-413019 Expenses Incurred as a result of failure to comply with prior authorization requirements for Hospital confinement. Any amounts over the Usual and Customary amount, Negotiated Rate or established fee schedule that this Plan pays. The eligible out-of-pocket expenses that the Covered Person incurs at all benefit levels (whether Incurred at an in-network or out-of-network provider) will be used to satisfy the total out-of-pocket maximum. NO FORGIVENESS OF OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES The Covered Person is required to pay the out-of-pocket expenses (including Deductibles, Co-pays or required Plan Participation) under the terms of this Plan. The requirement that You and Your Dependent(s) pay the applicable out-of-pocket expenses cannot be waived by a provider under any \"fee forgiveness\", \"not out-of-pocket\" or similar arrangement. If a provider waives the required out-of-pocket expenses, the Covered Person's claim may be denied and the Covered Person will be responsible for payment of the entire claim. The claim(s) may be reconsidered if the Covered Person provides satisfactory proof that he or she paid the out-of-pocket expenses under the terms of this Plan. -20- 7670-00-413019 OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES AND MAXIMUMS Benefit Plan(s) 002 DEDUCTIBLES A Deductible is an amount of money paid once per Plan Year by the Covered Person before any Covered Expenses are paid by this Plan. A Deductible applies to each Covered Person up to a family Deductible limit. When a new Plan Year begins, a new Deductible must be satisfied. Deductible amounts are shown on the Schedule of Benefits. Generally, the applicable Deductible must be met before any benefits will be paid under this Plan. However, certain covered benefits may be considered Preventive / Routine Care and paid first dollar. The Deductible amounts that the Covered Person incurs for Covered Expenses, including covered Pharmacy expenses, will be used to satisfy the Deductible(s) shown on the Schedule of Benefits. The Deductible amounts that the Covered Person incurs at all benefit levels (whether Incurred at an in- network or out-of-network provider) will be used to satisfy the applicable benefit level's total individual and family Deductible. PLAN PARTICIPATION Plan Participation is the percentage of Covered Expenses that the Covered Person is responsible for paying after the Deductible is met. The Covered Person pays this percentage until the Covered Person's (or family's, if applicable) annual out-of-pocket maximum is reached. The Plan Participation rate is shown on the Schedule of Benefits. Any payment for an expense that is not covered under this Plan will be the Covered Person's responsibility. ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUMS The annual out-of-pocket maximum is the most the Covered Person pays each year for Covered Expenses. There are separate in-network and out-of-network out-of-pocket maximums for this Plan. Annual out-of-pocket maximums are shown on the Schedule of Benefits. Amounts the Covered Person incurs for Covered Expenses will be used to satisfy the Covered Person's (or family's, if applicable) annual out-of-pocket maximum(s). If the Covered Person's out-of-pocket expenses in a Plan Year exceed the annual out-of-pocket maximum, the Plan pays 100% of the Covered Expenses through the end of the Plan Year. The following will not be used to meet the out-of-pocket maximums: Penalties, legal fees and interest charged by a provider. Expenses for excluded services. Any charges above the limits specified elsewhere in this document. Out-of-Network Co-pays and Plan Participation amounts for Prescription products. Expenses Incurred as a result of failure to comply with prior authorization requirements for Hospital confinement. Any amounts over the Usual and Customary amount, Negotiated Rate or established fee schedule that this Plan pays. The eligible out-of-pocket expenses that the Covered Person incurs at all benefit levels (whether Incurred at an in-network or out-of-network provider) will be used to satisfy the total out-of-pocket maximum. -21- 7670-00-413019 NO FORGIVENESS OF OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES The Covered Person is required to pay the out-of-pocket expenses (including Deductibles, Co-pays or required Plan Participation) under the terms of this Plan. The requirement that You and Your Dependent(s) pay the applicable out-of-pocket expenses cannot be waived by a provider under any \"fee forgiveness\", \"not out-of-pocket\" or similar arrangement. If a provider waives the required out-of-pocket expenses, the Covered Person's claim may be denied and the Covered Person will be responsible for payment of the entire claim. The claim(s) may be reconsidered if the Covered Person provides satisfactory proof that he or she paid the out-of-pocket expenses under the terms of this Plan. The Covered Person's ability to contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA) on a tax favored basis may be affected by any arrangement that waives this Plan's Deductible. -22- 7670-00-413019 ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES You are responsible for enrolling in the manner and form prescribed by Your employer. The Plan's eligibility and enrollment procedures include administrative safeguards and processes designed to ensure and verify that eligibility and enrollment determinations are made in accordance with the Plan. From time to time, the Plan may request documentation from You or Your Dependents in order to make determinations for continuing eligibility. The coverage choices that will be offered to You will be the same choices offered to other similarly situated Employees. WAITING PERIOD If eligible, You must complete a Waiting Period before coverage becomes effective for You and Your Dependents. A Waiting Period is a period of time that must pass before an Employee or Dependent becomes eligible for coverage under the terms of this Plan. You are eligible for coverage on the date listed below under the Effective Date section, upon completion of 60 days calendar days of regular employment in a covered position. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS An eligible Employee is a person who is classified by the employer on both payroll and personnel records as an Employee who regularly works full-time 30 or more hours per week, plus all elected County officials serving his or her current term in office, but for purposes of this Plan, it does not include the following classifications of workers except as determined by the employer in its sole discretion: Leased Employees. Independent Contractors as defined in this Plan. Consultants who are paid on other than a regular wage or salary basis by the employer. Members of the employer's Board of Directors, owners, partners, or officers, unless engaged in the conduct of the business on a full-time, regular basis. For purposes of this Plan, eligibility requirements are used only to determine a person's initial eligibility for coverage under this Plan. An Employee may retain eligibility for coverage under this Plan if the Employee is temporarily absent on an approved leave of absence, which is combined with the employer's short-term disability policy, with the expectation of returning to work following the approved leave as determined by the employer's leave policy, provided that contributions continue to be paid on a timely basis. COBRA is not applicable until short-term disability is exhausted. Employees who meet eligibility requirements during a measurement period as required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) regulations will have been deemed to have met the eligibility requirements for the resulting stability period as required by the ACA regulations. The employer's classification of an individual is conclusive and binding for purposes of determining eligibility under this Plan. No reclassification of a person's status, for any reason, by a third party, whether by a court, governmental agency, or otherwise, without regard to whether or not the employer agrees to such reclassification, will change a person's eligibility for benefits. An eligible Dependent includes: Your legal spouse, provided he or she is not covered as an Employee under this Plan. For purposes of eligibility under this Plan, a legal spouse does not include a Common-Law Marriage spouse, even if such partnership is recognized as a legal marriage in the state in which the couple resides. An eligible Dependent does not include an individual from whom You have obtained a legal separation or divorce. Documentation on a Covered Person's marital status may be required by the Plan Administrator. -23- 7670-00-413019 A Dependent Child until the Child reaches his or her 26th birthday. The term \" Child\" includes the following Dependents: A natural biological Child; A stepchild; A legally adopted Child or a Child legally Placed for Adoption as granted by action of a federal, state, or local governmental agency responsible for adoption administration or a court of law if the Child has not attained age 26 as of the date of such placement; A Child under Your (or Your spouse's) Legal Guardianship as ordered by a court; A Child who is considered an alternate recipient under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO).

Eligibility Criteria: To be an eligible Totally Disabled Dependent Child, the following conditions must all be met: A Totally Disabled Dependent Child age 26 or over must be unmarried. NON-DUPLICATION OF COVERAGE: Any person who is covered as an eligible Employee will not also be considered an eligible Dependent under this Plan. RIGHT TO CHECK A DEPENDENT'S ELIGIBILITY STATUS: The Plan reserves the right to check the eligibility status of a Dependent at any time throughout the year. You and Your Dependent have an obligation to notify the Plan should the Dependent's eligibility status change during the Plan Year. Please notify Your Human Resources Department regarding status changes. EXTENDED COVERAGE FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN A Dependent Child may be eligible for extended Dependent coverage under this Plan under the following circumstances: The Dependent Child was covered by this Plan on the day before the Child's 26th birthday; or The Dependent Child is a Dependent of an Employee newly eligible for the Plan; or The Dependent Child is eligible due to a special enrollment event or a Qualifying Status Change event, as outlined in the Section 125 Plan. -24- 7670-00-413019 The Dependent Child must also fit the following category: If You have a Dependent Child covered under this Plan who is under the age of 26 and Totally Disabled, either mentally or physically, that Child's health coverage may continue beyond the day the Child would otherwise cease to be a Dependent under the terms of this Plan. You must submit written proof that the Child is Totally Disabled within 30 calendar days after the day coverage for the Dependent would normally end. The Plan may, for three years, ask for additional proof at any time, after which the Plan may ask for proof not more than once per year. Coverage may continue subject to the following minimum requirements: The Dependent must not be able to hold a self-sustaining job due to the disability; and Proof of the disability must be submitted as required (Notice of Award of Social Security Income is acceptable); and The Employee must still be covered under this Plan. A Totally Disabled Dependent Child older than 26 who loses coverage under this Plan may not re-enroll in the Plan under any circumstances. IMPORTANT: It is Your responsibility to notify the Plan Sponsor within 60 days if Your Dependent no longer meets the criteria listed in this section. If, at any time, the Dependent fails to meet the qualifications of a Totally Disabled Dependent, the Plan has the right to be reimbursed from the Dependent or Employee for any medical claims paid by the Plan during the period that the Dependent did not qualify for extended coverage. Please refer to the COBRA Continuation of Coverage section in this document. Employees have the right to choose which eligible Dependents are covered under the Plan. EFFECTIVE DATE OF EMPLOYEE'S COVERAGE Your coverage will begin on the later of the following dates: If You apply within Your Waiting Period, Your coverage will become effective the first day of the month following the date You complete Your Waiting Period.

In no event will Your Dependent be covered prior to the day Your coverage begins. ANNUAL OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD During the annual open enrollment period, eligible Employees will be able to enroll themselves and their eligible Dependents for coverage under this Plan. Covered Employees will be able to make changes in coverage for themselves and their eligible Dependents. Coverage Waiting Periods are waived during the annual open enrollment period for covered Employees and covered Dependents changing from one Plan to another Plan or changing coverage levels within the Plan. If You and/or Your Dependent becomes covered under this Plan as a result of electing coverage during the annual open enrollment period, the following will apply: The employer will give eligible Employees written notice prior to the start of an annual open enrollment period; and This Plan does not apply to charges for services performed or treatment received prior to the Effective Date of the Covered Person's coverage; and The Effective Date of coverage will be August 1 following the annual open enrollment period. -26- 7670-00-413019 SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PROVISION Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act This Plan gives each eligible person special enrollment rights if the person experiences a loss of other health coverage or a change in family status as explained below. The coverage choices that will be offered to You will be the same choices offered to other similarly situated Employees.

NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR PREMIUM ASSISTANCE UNDER MEDICAID OR CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM A current Employee and his or her Dependents may be eligible for a special enrollment period if the Employee and/or Dependents are determined eligible, under a state's Medicaid plan or state child health plan, for premium assistance with respect to coverage under this Plan.

RESCISSION OF COVERAGE As permitted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Plan reserves the right to rescind coverage. A rescission of coverage is a retroactive cancellation or discontinuance of coverage due to fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact. A cancellation/discontinuance of coverage is not a rescission if: it has only a prospective effect; or it is attributable to non-payment of premiums or contributions; or it is initiated by You or Your personal representative. REINSTATEMENT OF COVERAGE If Your coverage ends due to termination of employment, leave of absence, reduction of hours, or layoff and You qualify for eligibility under this Plan again (are rehired or considered to be rehired for purposes of the Affordable Care Act) within 13 weeks from the date Your coverage ended, Your coverage will be reinstated. If Your coverage ends due to termination of employment, leave of absence, reduction of hours, or layoff and You do not qualify for eligibility under this Plan again (are not rehired or considered to be rehired for purposes of the Affordable Care Act) within 13 weeks from the date Your coverage ended, and You did not perform any hours of service that were credited within the 13-week period, You will be treated as a new hire and will be required to meet all the requirements of a new Employee. Refer to the information on the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act for possible exceptions, or contact Your Human Resources or Personnel office. -30- 7670-00-413019 COBRA CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE Important: Read this entire provision to understand a Covered Person's COBRA rights and obligations. The following is a summary of the federal continuation requirements under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as amended. This summary generally explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to You and Your family, and what You and Your Dependents need to do to protect the right to receive it. When You become eligible for COBRA, You may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. This summary provides a general notice of a Covered Person's rights under COBRA, but is not intended to satisfy all the requirements of federal law. Your employer or the COBRA Administrator will provide additional information to You or Your Dependents as required. You may have other options available to You when You lose group health coverage. For example, You may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, You may qualify for lower costs on Your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, You may qualify for a 30-day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which You are eligible (such as a spouse's plan), even if that plan generally does not accept Late Enrollees. The COBRA Administrator for this Plan is: UMR INTRODUCTION Federal law gives certain persons, known as Qualified Beneficiaries (defined below), the right to continue their health care benefits beyond the date that they might otherwise lose coverage. The Qualified Beneficiary must pay the entire cost of the COBRA continuation coverage, plus an administrative fee. In general, a Qualified Beneficiary has the same rights and obligations under the Plan as an active participant. A Qualified Beneficiary may elect to continue coverage under this Plan if such person's coverage would terminate because of a life event known as a Qualifying Event (outlined below). When a Qualifying Event causes (or will cause) a Loss of Coverage the Plan must offer COBRA continuation coverage. Loss of Coverage means more than losing coverage entirely. It means that a person ceases to be covered under the same terms and conditions that are in effect immediately before the Qualifying Event. In short, a Qualifying Event plus a Loss of Coverage allows a Qualified Beneficiary the right to elect coverage under COBRA. Generally, You, Your covered spouse, and Your Dependent Children may be Qualified Beneficiaries and eligible to elect COBRA continuation coverage, even if You or Your Dependent is already covered under another employer-sponsored group health plan or is enrolled in Medicare at the time of the COBRA election. COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE FOR QUALIFIED BENEFICIARIES The length of COBRA continuation coverage that is offered varies based on who the Qualified Beneficiary is and what Qualifying Event is experienced as outlined below. If You are an Employee, You will become a Qualified Beneficiary if You lose coverage under the Plan because either one of the following Qualifying Events happens: Qualifying Event Length of Continuation Your employment ends for any reason other than Your gross misconduct up to 18 months Your hours of employment are reduced up to 18 months -31- 7670-00-413019 (There are two ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage may be extended. See the section below entitled \"The Right to Extend the Length of COBRA Continuation Coverage\" for more information.) The spouse of an Employee will become a Qualified Beneficiary if he or she loses coverage under the Plan because any one of the following Qualifying Events happens: Qualifying Event Length of Continuation The Employee dies up to 36 months The Employee's hours of employment are reduced up to 18 months The Employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct up to 18 months The Employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both) up to 36 months The Employee and spouse become divorced or legally separated up to 36 months The Dependent Children of an Employee will become Qualified Beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because any one of the following Qualifying Events happens: Qualifying Event Length of Continuation The parent -Employee dies up to 36 months The parent-Employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct up to 18 months The parent -Employee's hours of employment are reduced up to 18 months The parent-Employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both) up to 36 months The parents become divorced or legally separated up to 36 months The Child loses eligibility for coverage under the plan as a Dependent up to 36 months Note: A spouse or a Dependent Child newly acquired through birth or adoption during a period of continuation coverage is eligible to be enrolled as a Dependent. The standard enrollment provision of the Plan applies to enrollees during continuation coverage. A Dependent other than a newborn or newly adopted Child who is acquired and enrolled after the original Qualifying Event, is not eligible as a Qualified Beneficiary if a subsequent Qualifying Event occurs. COBRA NOTICE PROCEDURES THE NOTICE(S) A COVERED PERSON MUST PROVIDE UNDER THIS SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION In order to be eligible to receive COBRA continuation coverage, covered Employees and their Dependents have certain obligations with respect to certain Qualifying Events (including divorce or legal separation of the Employee and spouse or a Dependent Child's loss of eligibility for coverage as a Dependent) to provide written notices to the administrator. Follow the rules described in this procedure when providing notice to the administrators, whether to Your employer or to the COBRA Administrator. A Qualified Beneficiary's written notice must include all of the following information (a form for notifying the COBRA Administrator is available upon request): The Qualified Beneficiary's name, current address, and complete phone number, The group number and the name of the Employee's employer, A description of the Qualifying Event (i.e., the life event experienced), and The date the Qualifying Event occurred or will occur. -32- 7670-00-413019 Send all notices or other information required by this Summary Plan Description in writing to: UMR COBRA ADMINISTRATION PO BOX 1206 WAUSAU WI 54402-1206 Phone Number: (800) 207-1824 For purposes of the deadlines described in this Summary Plan Description, the notice must be postmarked by the deadline. In order to protect Your family's rights, the Plan Administrator should be informed of any changes to the addresses of family members. Keep copies of all notices You send to the Plan Administrator or COBRA Administrator. COBRA NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND ELECTION PROCESS EMPLOYER OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF THE QUALIFYING EVENT Your employer will give notice to the COBRA Administrator when coverage terminates due to the Employee's termination of employment or reduction in hours, the death of the Employee, or the Employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits due to age or disability (Part A, Part B, or both). Your employer will notify the COBRA Administrator within 30 calendar days of when one of these events occurs. EMPLOYEE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF THE QUALIFYING EVENT The Covered Person must give notice to the Plan Administrator in the case of divorce or legal separation of the Employee and a spouse, a Dependent Child ceasing to be eligible for coverage under the Plan, or a second Qualifying Event. The covered Employee or Qualified Beneficiary must provide written notice to the Plan Administrator in order to ensure rights to COBRA continuation coverage. The Covered Person must provide this notice within the 60-calendar-day period that begins on the latest of: The date of the Qualifying Event; or The date on which there is a Loss of Coverage (or would be a Loss of Coverage) due to the original Qualifying Event; or The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary is informed of this notice requirement by receiving this Summary Plan Description or the General COBRA Notice. The Plan Administrator will notify the COBRA Administrator within 30 calendar days from the date that notice of the Qualifying Event has been provided. The COBRA Administrator will, in turn, provide an election notice to each Qualified Beneficiary within 14 calendar days of receiving notice of a Qualifying Event from the employer, the covered Employee, or the Qualified Beneficiary. MAKING AN ELECTION TO CONTINUE GROUP HEALTH COVERAGE Each Qualified Beneficiary has the independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. A Qualified Beneficiary will receive a COBRA election form that should be completed in order to elect to continue group health coverage under this Plan. A Qualified Beneficiary may elect COBRA coverage at any time within the 60-day election period. The election period ends 60 calendar days after the later of: The date Plan coverage terminates due to a Qualifying Event; or The date the Plan Administrator provides the Qualified Beneficiary with an election notice. -33- 7670-00-413019 A Qualified Beneficiary must notify the COBRA Administrator of his or her election in writing in order to continue group health coverage and must make the required payments when due in order to remain covered. If the Qualified Beneficiary does not choose COBRA continuation coverage within the 60-day election period, group health coverage will end on the day of the Qualifying Event. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND DATE COVERAGE BEGINS No claims will be paid under this Plan for services the Qualified Beneficiary receives on or after the date coverage is lost due to a Qualifying Event. If, however, the Qualified Beneficiary has not completed a waiver and decides to elect COBRA continuation coverage within the 60-day election period, group health coverage will be reinstated retroactively to the date coverage was lost, provided the Qualified Beneficiary makes the required payment when due. Any claims that were denied during the initial COBRA election period will be reprocessed once the COBRA Administrator receives the completed COBRA election form and required payment. If a Qualified Beneficiary previously waived COBRA coverage but revokes that waiver within the 60-day election period, coverage will not be retroactive to the date of the Qualifying Event but instead will become effective on the date the waiver is revoked. PAYMENT FOR CONTINUATION COVERAGE Qualified Beneficiaries are required to pay the entire cost of continuation coverage, which includes both the employer and Employee contributions. This cost may also include a 2% additional fee to cover administrative expenses (or in the case of the 11-month extension due to disability, a 50% additional fee). The cost of continuation coverage is subject to change at least once per year. If Your employer offers annual open enrollment opportunities for active Employees, each Qualified Beneficiary will have the same options under COBRA (for example, the right to add or eliminate coverage for Dependents). The cost of continuation coverage will be adjusted accordingly. The initial payment is due no later than 45 calendar days after the Qualified Beneficiary elects COBRA as evidenced by the postmark date on the envelope. This first payment must cover the cost of continuation coverage from the time coverage under the Plan would have otherwise terminated, up to the time the first payment is made. If the initial payment is not made within the 45-day period, then coverage will remain terminated without the possibility of reinstatement. There is no grace period for the initial payment. The due date for subsequent payments is typically the first day of the month for any particular period of coverage. However, the Qualified Beneficiary will receive specific payment information, including due dates, when the Qualified Beneficiary becomes eligible for and elects COBRA continuation coverage. If, for whatever reason, any Qualified Beneficiary receives any benefits under the Plan during a month for which the payment was not made on time, the Qualified Beneficiary will be required to reimburse the Plan for the benefits received. If the COBRA Administrator receives a check that is missing information or contains discrepancies regarding the information on the check (e.g., the numeric dollar amount does not match the written dollar amount), the COBRA Administrator will provide a notice to the Qualified Beneficiary and allow him or her 14 days to send in a corrected check. If a corrected check is not received within the 14-day timeframe, then the occurrence will be treated as non-payment and the Qualified Beneficiary(ies) will lose coverage under the Plan in accordance with the Plan language above. Note: Payment will not be considered made if a check is returned for non-sufficient funds. -34- 7670-00-413019 A QUALIFIED BENEFICIARY'S NOTICE OBLIGATIONS WHILE ON COBRA Always keep the COBRA Administrator informed of the current addresses of all Covered Persons who are or who may become Qualified Beneficiaries. Failure to provide this information to the COBRA Administrator may cause You or Your Dependents to lose important rights under COBRA. In addition, written notice to the COBRA Administrator is required within 30 calendar days of the date any one of the following events occurs: The Qualified Beneficiary marries. Refer to the Special Enrollment Provision section of this SPD for additional information regarding special enrollment rights. A Child is born to, adopted by, or Placed for Adoption by a Qualified Beneficiary. Refer to the Special Enrollment Provision section of this SPD for additional information regarding special enrollment rights. A final determination is made by the Social Security Administration that a disabled Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled. Any Qualified Beneficiary becomes covered by another group health plan or enrolls in Medicare Part A or Part B. Additionally, if the COBRA Administrator or the Plan Administrator requests additional information from the Qualified Beneficiary, the Qualified Beneficiary must provide the requested information within 30 calendar days. LENGTH OF CONTINUATION COVERAGE COBRA coverage is available up to the maximum periods described below, subject to all COBRA regulations and the conditions of this Summary Plan Description: For Employees and Dependents: 18 months from the Qualifying Event if due to the Employee's termination of employment or reduction of work hours. (If an active Employee enrolls in Medicare before his or her termination of employment or reduction in hours, then the covered spouse and Dependent Children will be entitled to COBRA continuation coverage for up to the greater of 18 months from the Employee's termination of employment or reduction in hours, or 36 months from the earlier Medicare Enrollment Date, whether or not Medicare enrollment is a Qualifying Event.) For Dependents only: 36 months from the Qualifying Event if coverage is lost due to one of the following events: The Employee's death. The Employee's divorce or legal separation. The former Employee's in Medicare. A Dependent Child's loss of eligibility as a Dependent as defined by the Plan. THE RIGHT TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE While on COBRA continuation coverage, certain Qualified Beneficiaries may have the right to extend continuation coverage provided written notice is given to the COBRA Administrator as soon as possible, but no later than the required timeframes stated below. Social Security Disability Determination (For Employees and Dependents) : A Qualified Beneficiary may be granted an 11-month extension to the initial 18-month COBRA continuation period, for a total maximum of 29 months of COBRA, in the event that the Social Security Administration determines the Qualified Beneficiary to be disabled either before becoming eligible for, or within the first 60 days of being covered by, COBRA continuation coverage. This extension will not apply if the original COBRA continuation was for 36 months. -35- 7670-00-413019 If the Qualified Beneficiary has non-disabled family members who are also Qualified Beneficiaries, those non-disabled family members are also entitled to the disability extension. The Qualified Beneficiary must give the COBRA Administrator a copy of the Social Security Administration letter of disability determination before the end of the 18 month period and within 60 days of the later of: The date of the Social Security Administration disability determination; The date the Qualifying Event occurs; The date the Qualified Beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage due to the original Qualifying Event; or The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary is informed of the requirement to notify the COBRA Administrator of the disability by receiving this Summary Plan Description or the General COBRA Notice. Note: Premiums may be higher after the initial 18-month period for persons exercising this disability extension provision available under COBRA. If the Social Security Administration determines the Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled, the Qualified Beneficiary must notify the Plan of that fact within 30 days after the Social Security Administration's determination. Second Qualifying Events (Dependents Only): If Your family experiences another Qualifying Event while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and Dependent Children in Your family who are Qualified Beneficiaries may receive up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if notice of the second event is provided to the COBRA Administrator. This additional coverage may be available to the spouse or Dependent Children who are Qualified Beneficiaries if the Employee or former Employee dies, becomes entitled to Medicare (Part A, Part B or both) or is divorced or legally separated, or if the Dependent Child loses eligibility under the Plan as a Dependent. This extension is available only if the Qualified Beneficiaries were covered under the Plan prior to the original Qualifying Event or in the case of a newborn Child being added as a result of a HIPAA special enrollment right. Dependents acquired during COBRA continuation (other than newborns and newly adopted Children) are not eligible to continue coverage as the result of a subsequent Qualifying Event. These events will lead to the extension only when the event would have caused the spouse or Dependent Child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first Qualifying Event not occurred. You or Your Dependents must provide the notice of a second Qualifying Event to the COBRA Administrator within a 60-day period that begins to run on the latest of: The date of the second Qualifying Event; or The date the Qualified Beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage due to the second Qualifying Event; or The date on which the Qualified Beneficiary is informed of the requirement to notify the COBRA Administrator of the second Qualifying Event by receiving this Summary Plan Description or the General COBRA Notice. COVERAGE OPTIONS OTHER THAN COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE There may be other coverage options for You and Your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov . -36- 7670-00-413019 EARLY TERMINATION OF COBRA CONTINUATION COBRA continuation coverage may terminate before the end of the above maximum coverage periods for any of the following reasons: The employer ceases to maintain a group health plan for any Employees. (Note that if the employer terminates the group health plan under which the Qualified Beneficiary is covered, but still maintains another group health plan for other, similarly situated Employees, the Qualified Beneficiary will be offered COBRA continuation coverage under the remaining group health plan, although benefits and costs may not be the same.) The required contribution for the Qualified Beneficiary's coverage is not paid within the timeframe expressed in the COBRA regulations. After electing COBRA continuation coverage, the Qualified Beneficiary becomes entitled to and enrolled in Medicare. After electing COBRA continuation coverage, the Qualified Beneficiary becomes covered under another group health plan. The Qualified Beneficiary is found not to be disabled during the disability extension. The Plan will terminate the Qualified Beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage one month after the Social Security Administration makes a determination that the Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled. Termination for cause, such as submitting fraudulent claims. SPECIAL NOTICE (Read This If Thinking Of Declining COBRA Continuation Coverage) At the time of a COBRA Qualifying Event, a Qualified Beneficiary has two primary options. The first is to waive his or her right to COBRA and make an election for coverage, whether group health coverage or insurance coverage through the individual market or the exchanges, in accordance with his or her HIPAA special enrollment rights. Please refer to the Special Enrollment Provision section for further details. The second option is to elect COBRA continuation coverage. If COBRA continuation coverage is elected, the continuation coverage must be maintained (by paying the cost of the coverage) for the duration of the COBRA continuation period. If the continuation coverage is not exhausted and maintained for the duration of the COBRA continuation period, the Qualified Beneficiary will lose his or her special enrollment rights. It is important to note that losing HIPAA special enrollment rights may have adverse effects for the Qualified Beneficiary since it will make it difficult to obtain coverage, whether group health coverage or insurance coverage through the individual market or the exchange. After COBRA continuation coverage is exhausted, the Qualified Beneficiary will have the option of electing other group health coverage or insurance coverage through the individual market or the exchange, in accordance with his or her HIPAA special enrollment rights. DEFINITIONS Qualified Beneficiary means a person covered by this group health Plan immediately before a Qualifying Event. A Qualified Beneficiary may be an Employee, the spouse of a covered Employee, or the Dependent Child of a covered Employee. This includes a Child who is born to or Placed for Adoption with a covered Employee during the Employee's COBRA coverage period if the Child is enrolled within the Plan's Special Enrollment Provision for newborns and adopted Children. This also includes a Child who was receiving benefits under this Plan pursuant to a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) immediately before the Qualifying Event. Qualifying Event means Loss of Coverage due to one of the following: The death of the covered Employee. -37- 7670-00-413019 Voluntary or involuntary termination of the covered Employee's employment (other than for gross misconduct). A reduction in work hours of the covered Employee. Divorce or legal separation of the covered Employee from the Employee's spouse. (Also, if an Employee terminates coverage for his or her spouse in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, then the later divorce or legal separation may be considered a Qualifying Event even though the ex-spouse lost coverage earlier. If the ex-spouse notifies the Plan or the COBRA Administrator in writing within 60 calendar days after the divorce or legal separation and can establish that the coverage was originally eliminated in anticipation of the divorce or legal separation, then COBRA coverage may be available for the period after the divorce or legal separation.) The covered former Employee becomes enrolled in Medicare. A Dependent Child no longer qualifies as a Dependent as defined by the Plan. Loss of Coverage means any change in the terms or conditions of coverage in effect immediately before a Qualifying Event. Loss of Coverage includes a change in coverage terms, a change in plans, termination of coverage, partial Loss of Coverage, an increase in Employee cost, and other changes that affect terms or conditions of coverage. Loss of Coverage does not always occur immediately after a Qualifying Event, but must always occur within the applicable 18- or 36-month coverage period. A Loss of Coverage that is not caused by a Qualifying Event may not trigger COBRA rights.

The Plan Administrator: RUSH COUNTY EMPLOYEES 101 E 2ND ST RUSHVILLE IN 46173 The COBRA Administrator: 7670-00-413019 UNIFORMED SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT OF 1994 INTRODUCTION Employers are required to offer COBRA-like health care continuation coverage to persons in the armed service if the absence for military duty would result in a loss of coverage. Employees on leave for military service must be treated as if they are on leaves of absence and are entitled to any other rights and benefits accorded to similarly situated Employees on leaves of absence or furloughs. If an employer has different types of benefits available depending on the type of leave of absence, the most favorable comparable leave benefits must apply to Employees on military leave. Reinstatement following a military leave of absence may not be subject to Waiting Periods. COVERAGE The maximum length of health care continuation coverage required under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) is the lesser of: 24 months beginning on the day that the uniformed service leave begins, or A period beginning on the day that the service leave begins and ending on the day after the Employee fails to return to or reapply for employment within the time allowed by USERRA. USERRA NOTICE AND ELECTION An Employee or an appropriate officer of the uniformed service in which his or her service is to be performed must notify the employer that the Employee intends to leave the employment position to perform service in the uniformed services. An Employee should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. The Employee is excused from giving notice due to military necessity, or if giving notice is otherwise impossible or unreasonable under the circumstances. Upon notice of intent to leave for uniformed service, Employees will be given the opportunity to elect USERRA continuation. Dependents do not have an independent right to elect USERRA coverage. Election of, payment for, and termination of the USERRA extension will be governed by the same requirements set forth under the COBRA Continuation of Coverage section, to the extent the COBRA requirements do not conflict with USERRA. PAYMENT If the military leave orders are for a period of 30 days or less, the Employee is not required to pay more than the amount he or she would have paid as an active Employee. For periods of 31 days or longer, if an Employee elects to continue health coverage pursuant to USERRA, such Employee and covered Dependents will be required to pay up to 102% of the full premium for the coverage elected. EXTENDED COVERAGE RUNS CONCURRENTLY Employees and their Dependents may be eligible for both COBRA and USERRA at the same time. Election of either the COBRA or USERRA extension by an Employee on leave for military service will be deemed an election under both laws, and the coverage offering the most benefit to the Employee will generally be extended. Coverage under both laws will run concurrently. Dependents who choose to independently elect extended coverage will be deemed eligible for the COBRA extension only because they are not eligible for a separate, independent right of election under USERRA. -39- 7670-00-413019 PROVIDER NETWORK The word \"Network\" means an outside organization that has contracted with various providers to provide health care services to Covered Persons at a Negotiated Rate. Providers who participate in a Network have agreed to accept the negotiated fees as payment in full, including any portion of the fees that the Covered Person must pay due to the Deductible, Plan Participation amounts, or other out-of-pocket expenses. The allowable charges used in the calculation of the payable benefit to participating providers will be determined by the Negotiated Rates in the network contract. A provider who does not participate in a Network may bill Covered Persons for additional fees over and above what the Plan pays. Knowing to which Network a provider belongs will help a Covered Person determine how much he or she will need to pay for certain services. To obtain the highest level of benefits under this Plan, Covered Persons should receive services from In-Network providers. However, this Plan does not limit a Covered Person's right to choose his or her own provider of medical care at his or her own expense if a medical expense is not a Covered Expense under this Plan, or is subject to a limitation or exclusion. To find out to which Network a provider belongs, please refer to the Provider Directory, or call the toll-free number that is listed on the back of the Plan's identification card. The participation status of providers may change from time to time. If a provider belongs to one of the following Networks, claims for Covered Expenses will normally be processed in accordance with the In-Network benefit levels that are listed on the Schedule of Benefits: RUS - Rush County Employees with UHC Choice Plus For services received from any other provider, claims for Covered Expenses will normally be processed in accordance with the Out-of-Network benefit levels that are listed on the Schedule of Benefits. These providers charge their normal rates for services, so Covered Persons may need to pay more. Covered Persons are responsible for paying the balance of these claims after the Plan pays its portion, if any. EXCEPTIONS TO THE PROVIDER NETWORK RATES Some benefits may be processed at In-Network benefit levels when provided by Out-of-Network providers. When Out-of-Network charges are covered in accordance with Network benefits, the charges may be subject to the Usual and Customary charge limitations. The following exceptions may apply: Ambulance Transportation services will be payable at the In-Network level of benefits when provided by an Out-of-Network provider. (Applies to Benefit Plan(s) 001) Covered services (including Preventive Services) provided by a radiologist, anesthesiologist, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or pathologist will be payable at the In-Network level of benefits when services are provided at a Network facility even if the provider is an Out-of-Network provider. Covered services provided by a Physician (excluding surgeons) during an Inpatient stay will be payable at the In-Network level of benefits when provided at an In-Network Hospital. Provider Directory Information Each covered Employee, COBRA participant, and Child or guardian of a Child who is considered an alternate recipient under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order will automatically be given or electronically provided a separate document, at no cost, that lists the participating Network providers for this Plan. The Employee should share this document with other covered individuals in his or her household. If a covered spouse or Dependent wants a separate provider list, he or she may make a written request to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge to cover the cost of furnishing complete copies to the spouse or other covered Dependents. -40- 7670-00-413019 TRANSITIONAL CARE Certain eligible expenses that would have been considered at the In-Network benefit level by the prior claims administrator, but that are not considered at the In-Network benefit level by the current claims administrator, may be paid at the applicable In-Network benefit level if the Covered Person is currently under a treatment plan by a Physician who was a member of this Plan's previous PPO but who is not a member of the Plan's current PPO in the Employee's or Dependent's network area. In order to ensure continuity of care for certain medical conditions already under treatment, the In-Network medical plan benefit level may continue for 90 days for conditions approved as transitional care. Examples of medical conditions appropriate for consideration for transitional care include, but are not limited to: Cancer if under active treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

The Plan has two components: (1) this document which describes the Prescription benefits available through the Plan (\"Rx Program\"); and (2) the medical component administered by UMR (\"Medical Component Plan\"). Prescription benefits provided under the Rx Program are described in this document and are exclusively provided under and subject to the terms of this document, except as specifically provided herein. Non-Prescription medical benefits are available under the Medical Component Plan. Under no circumstance shall benefits be covered under both the Rx Program and the Medical Component Plan. This document and the Medical Component Plan are deemed to be the Plan document and summary Plan description.

Retail Pharmacy As a Covered Person in the Medical Component Plan, You are eligible for Prescription benefits under the Rx Program. Your eligibility for benefits under the Rx Program ends on the date Your coverage ends under the Medical Component Plan. The Rx Program uses a network of preferred pharmacies (\"Participating Providers\") that have contracted with the Rx Program to charge Covered Persons reduced fees for covered Prescription drugs. In addition, certain drugs must be purchased at designated pharmacies. TrueScripts Managements Services, LLC (\"TrueScripts\") provides Claims processing and ministerial services for the Rx Program (but is not an insurer). Any reimbursement by the Rx Program is determined per Prescription (\"Script\") by the reimbursement levels described herein, which is applied to each covered drug charge and is shown on the Schedule of Benefits. Prescriptions that exceed the identified per Prescription annual limit will be excluded and not considered eligible expenses under the Plan or this Rx Program. If a drug is purchased from a nonparticipating pharmacy or a Participating Pharmacy when the Covered Person's ID card is not used, the Covered Person must pay the entire cost of the Prescription, including Co-pay, and then submit the receipt for direct reimbursement to TrueScripts at 513 E. South St., Washington, IN 47501 or www.truescripts.com, subject to the terms of the Rx Program. Participating Pharmacy The Rx Program has a network of participating retail pharmacies. You can find a local retail pharmacy by visiting www.TrueScripts.com and navigating to the Pharmacy Locator section or by calling TrueScripts at (844) 257-1955.

These drugs are listed on the formulary that can be found at www.truescripts.com or by calling TrueScripts at (844) 257-1955. Reimbursement Levels Benefits for eligible drugs are available for Prescription drugs that are considered a Covered Expense as set forth in this document. The Rx Program pays benefits at different levels based upon Prescription drug tiers as described below, subject to other exclusions described later in this summary. All Prescription drugs covered by the Rx Program are categorized into these tiers on the Preferred Drug Formulary (PDF). The tier status of a Prescription drug can change periodically, as frequently as monthly, based on TrueScripts' Prescription Drug Formulary Management Committee's periodic tier decisions. When that occurs, You may pay more or less for a Prescription drug, depending on its tier assignment. Since the Prescription Drug Formulary may change periodically, for the most current information, call TrueScripts at (844)-257-1955. See the separate section below for Specialty Drugs. Each tier is assigned a reimbursement level which is the amount the Rx Program pays. You will also pay a Co-pay/Coinsurance when You visit the Pharmacy. As an example, here is how the tier system works with 3 tiers: Generic Tier is the lowest Co-pay. For the lowest out-of-pocket expense, You should consider Generic Drug Tier drugs if You and Your Physician decide they are appropriate for Your treatment. Preferred Brand Tier is Your middle Co-pay. Consider a Preferred Brand Tier drug if no Generic Tier drug is available to treat Your condition. Non-Preferred Brand Tier if applicable is Your highest Co-pay. The drugs in Non-Preferred Brand Tier are usually costlier. Sometimes there are alternatives available in the Generic Tier or Preferred Brand Tier. You are responsible for Your Deductible, if any, and also paying the lowest of: The applicable Co-pay; The network pharmacy's Usual and Customary Charge for the Prescription drug; or The Prescription drug charge that TrueScripts agreed to pay the network pharmacy. Pharmacy benefits apply only if Your Prescription is for an eligible expense. For excluded charges, You are responsible for paying 100% of the cost, and those charges do not count towards Deductibles or maximum out of pocket. Amounts more than the Rx Program's specialty drug per script maximum are excluded. TrueScripts will assist Covered Persons seeking reimbursement from third party resources but makes no guarantees. Other programs or services, which may reduce a Covered Person's Co-pay as outlined below, may be implemented by the Plan Administrator or procedurally changed by TrueScripts if, in their discretion and management of the plan, the program or service will benefit the Plan and Covered Person and there is a likelihood that Plan and/or Covered Person expenses will be reduced over the longer term.

If a Covered Person is eligible for a rebate, discount, or reimbursement from a manufacturer or third party, and does not apply for this rebate, discount, or reimbursement, the number of Scripts associated with that rebate, discount, and/or reimbursement will be excluded unless/until the Covered Person completes and submits an Affidavit establishing that the Covered Person did not apply and stating the reason(s) for the failure to apply or provides evidence that any application for such rebate, discount, and/or reimbursement was denied, All exclusions and limitations under the Medical Component Plan, and In accordance with the preferred formulary and procedures implemented by TrueScripts, as modified from time to time, certain Prescriptions will be deemed processed under the Major-Medical portion of the Medical Component Plan, and, therefore excluded under the Prescription program. All other Prescriptions covered by the Rx Program are excluded by the Major-Medical provisions of the Medical Component Plan. Deductibles and Out-of-Pocket Maximums The following amounts do not accrue towards the total Covered Expenses that are the responsibility of the Covered Person and do not accumulate toward the applicable Deductible and/or Out-of-Pocket Maximum: Premiums, Expenses that are excluded under the Rx Program, Expenses in excess of the reasonable and customary charges for services or supplies, Expenses in excess of any maximum quantity list in the Rx Program, Penalties, Expenses reimbursed, waived, or covered through manufacturer or third-party assistance programs or discount programs, Expenses for Brand-name drugs above the applicable Generic Co-pay the Covered Person would have paid as outlined in the \"Dispensed As Written Drug Provision.\", and/or Any cost related to a drug that is partially or wholly excluded. -63- 7670-00-413019 Prior Authorization Requirement TrueScripts has been retained by the Plan Administrator to provide prior authorization services for a particular set of drugs. The Plan has approved a predetermined set of criteria to be applied to this prior authorization process. In order for a drug which is subject to prior authorization to be covered by this Rx Program; the pharmacist, Covered Person, or Physician must call the TrueScripts Customer Care Department to obtain prior authorization before the drug is purchased. TrueScripts will fax the Physician the necessary forms to obtain the information necessary to determine whether or not the drug will be a Covered Expense, based upon the predetermined set of criteria and the information supplied by the Physician. TrueScripts will notify the pharmacy/Covered Person or Physician who submitted the request for prior authorization within 72 hours (once the letter of Medical Necessity is received from the Physician) that the drug is or is not covered by the Plan. The request for prior authorization is considered to be a pre-service claim as described in the U.S. Department of Labor Regulations 2560.503-1 (issued November 21, 2000). TrueScripts authorization is not a guarantee that the drug is eligible for payment under the Rx Program or Plan. The Rx Program may include a step therapy program which promotes the utilization of certain Preferred Drugs in specific drug categories such as cholesterol lowering statins and proton pump inhibitors (gastro- intestinal agents); however, others may be identified. Certain drugs have been identified which will not be covered under the Rx Program if the step therapy program has not been followed and a prior authorization obtained. The step therapy program requires documentation from a Physician that the Covered Person has tried a minimum number of alternative drug treatments and that they did not successfully treat the Covered Person's condition. If a medication the Covered Person is taking is identified as a step therapy drug, the Covered Person is not required to change medications, but it will not be covered under the Rx Program unless approved through TrueScripts. For more Information on this step therapy program, please contact TrueScripts at (844) 257-1955 or visit www.truescripts.com. For a list of drugs that require prior authorization, please visit www.truescripts.com or by calling (844) 257-1955.

Utilization Management can determine Medical Necessity, shorten Hospital stays, improve the quality of care, and reduce costs to the Covered Person and the Plan. The Utilization Management procedures include certain Prior Authorization requirements. The benefit amounts payable under the Schedule of Benefits of this SPD may be affected if the requirements described for Utilization Management are not satisfied. Covered Persons are responsible for ensuring the provider calls the phone number on the back of the Plan identification card to request Prior Authorization at least two weeks prior to a scheduled procedure in order to allow for fact-gathering and independent medical review, if necessary. Special Notes: The Covered Person will not be penalized for failure to obtain Prior Authorization if a Prudent Layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect that the absence of immediate medical attention would jeopardize the life or long-term health of the individual. Covered Persons who have received care on this basis are responsible for ensuring the provider contacts the Utilization Review Organization (see below) as soon as possible by phone or fax within 24 hours, or by the next business day if on a weekend or holiday, from the time coverage information is known. If notice is provided past the timeframe shown above, the extenuating circumstances must be communicated. The Utilization Review Organization will then review the services provided. This Plan complies with the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act. Prior Authorization is not required for a Hospital or Birthing Center stay of 48 hours or less following a normal vaginal delivery or 96 hours or less following a Cesarean section. Prior Authorization may be required for a stay beyond 48 hours following a vaginal delivery or 96 hours following a Cesarean section. UTILIZATION REVIEW ORGANIZATION The Utilization Review Organization is: UMR DEFINITIONS The following terms are used for the purpose of the CARE (Care Management) section of this SPD. Refer to the Glossary of Terms section of this SPD for additional definitions. Prior Authorization is the process of determining benefit coverage prior to a service being rendered to an individual member. A determination is made based on Medical Necessity criteria for drugs, supplies, tests, procedures, and other services that are appropriate and cost-effective for the member. This member-centric review evaluates the clinical appropriateness of requested services in terms of the type, frequency, extent, and duration of stay. Utilization Management is the evaluation of the Medical Necessity, appropriateness, and efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, and facilities under the provisions of the applicable health benefits Plan. This management is sometimes called \"utilization review.\" Such assessment may be conducted on a prospective basis (prior to treatment), concurrent basis (during treatment), or retrospective basis (following treatment). -71- 7670-00-413019 SERVICES REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION Call the Utilization Management Organization before receiving services for the following: Inpatient stays in Hospitals, Extended Care Facilities, or residential treatment facilities. Partial hospitalizations. Home Health Care. Durable Medical Equipment, excluding braces or orthotics, over $1,500 or Durable Medical Equipment rentals over $500 per month. Prosthetics over $1,000. Qualifying Clinical Trials. Chemotherapy (cancer diagnosis). Dialysis. Inpatient stays in Hospitals or Birthing Centers that are longer than 48 hours following normal vaginal deliveries or 96 hours following Cesarean sections. Organ and tissue transplants. This Plan includes benefits for human organ and tissue transplantation that require Prior Authorization from the Organ Transplant Group Policy underwritten by Tokio Marine HHC. These benefits are fully explained in the Organ Transplant Group Policy underwritten by Tokio Marine HHC. Radiation therapy. Outpatient surgery not performed in a Physician's office. Note that if a Covered Person receives Prior Authorization for one facility, but then is transferred to another facility, Prior Authorization is also needed before going to the new facility, except in the case of an Emergency (see Special Notes above). PENALTIES FOR NOT OBTAINING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION A non-Prior Authorization penalty is the amount that must be paid by a Covered Person who does not call for Prior Authorization prior to receiving certain services. A penalty of $250 may be applied to applicable claims if a Covered Person receives services but does not obtain the required Prior Authorization. The phone number to call for Prior Authorization is listed on the back of the Plan identification card. The fact that a Covered Person receives Prior Authorization from the Utilization Review Organization does not guarantee that this Plan will pay for the medical care. The Covered Person must be eligible for coverage on the date services are provided. Coverage is also subject to all provisions described in this SPD, including additional information obtained that was not available at the time of the Prior Authorization. Medical Director Oversight . A UMR CARE medical director oversees the concurrent review process. Should a case have unique circumstances that raise questions for the Utilization Management specialist handling the case, the medical director will review the case to determine Medical Necessity using evidence-based clinical criteria. Complex Condition CARE Referrals . During the Prior Authorization review process, cases are analyzed for a number of criteria used to trigger case-to-case management for review. Complex Condition CARE opportunities are identified by using a system-integrated, automated and manual trigger lists during the Prior Authorization review process. Other Complex Condition CARE trigger points include the following criteria: length of stay, level of care, readmission, and utilization, as well as employer referrals or self-referrals. Our goal is to intervene in the process as early as possible to determine the resources necessary to deliver clinical care in the most appropriate care setting. -72- 7670-00-413019 Retrospective Review . Retrospective review is conducted upon request and a determination will be issued within the required timeframe of the request, unless an extension is approved. Retrospective reviews are performed according to our standard Prior Authorization policies and procedures and a final determination will be made no later than 30 days after the request for review. Complex Condition CARE (Case Management) Complex Condition CARE services are designed to identify catastrophic and complex Illnesses, transplants, and trauma cases. Participants are identified using system-integrated, automated and manual trigger lists, including the Prior Authorization review process. Other Complex Condition CARE trigger points include the following criteria: length of stay, level of care, readmission, and utilization, as well as employer referrals or self-referrals. UMR CARE nurse managers work directly with the patient, the patient's family members, the treating Physician, and the facility to mobilize appropriate resources for the Covered Person's care. Our philosophy is that quality care from the beginning of the serious Illness helps avoid major complications in the future. -73- 7670-00-413019 CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE Kidney Resource Services (KRS) Kidney Resource Services (KRS) provides access to a preferred provider dialysis network and support from a UMR CARE Nurse Manager by collaborating with the Covered Person to delay the progression of the disease to renal failure. UMR Complex Condition CARE End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) specialty nurses focus on clinical support and treatments. If a Covered Person chooses to seek services at a KRS preferred provider, the Covered Person must contact UMR Complex Condition CARE at 866-494-4502. -74- 7670-00-413019 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS Coordination of Benefits (COB) applies whenever a Covered Person has health coverage under more than one Plan, as defined below. It does not however, apply to prescription benefits. The purpose of coordinating benefits is to help Covered Persons pay for Covered Expenses, but not to result in total benefits that are greater than the Covered Expenses Incurred. The order of benefit determination rules determine which plan will pay first (which is the Primary Plan). The Primary Plan pays without regard to the possibility that another plan may cover some expenses. A Secondary Plan pays for Covered Expenses after the Primary Plan has processed the claim. The balance remaining after the Primary Plan's payment, not to exceed the Covered Person's responsibility, is the amount that will be used in determining the benefits payable under the Secondary Plan. The Deductible, Co-pays, or Plan Participation amounts, if any, will be applied before benefits are paid on the balance. The Plan will coordinate benefits with the following types of medical or dental plans: Group health plans, whether insured or self-insured. Hospital indemnity benefits in excess of $200 per day. Specified disease policies. Foreign health care coverage. Medical care components of group long-term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care. Medical benefits under group or individual motor vehicle policies (including no-fault policies). See the order of benefit determination rules (below). Medical benefits under homeowner's insurance policies. Medicare or other governmental benefits, as permitted by law, not including Medicaid. See below. However, this Plan does not coordinate benefits with individual health or dental plans. Each contract for coverage is considered a separate plan. If a plan has two parts and COB rules apply to only one of the two parts, each of the parts is treated as a separate plan. If a plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered an allowable expense and a benefit paid. When this Plan is secondary, and when not in conflict with a network contract requiring otherwise, covered charges will not include any amount that is not payable under the primary plan as a result of a contract between the primary plan and a provider of service in which such provider agrees to accept a reduced payment and not to bill the Covered Person for the difference between the provider's contracted amount and the provider's regular billed charge. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES The first of the following rules that apply to a Covered Person's situation is the rule that will apply: The plan that has no coordination of benefits provision is considered primary. When medical payments are available under motor vehicle insurance (including no-fault policies), this Plan will always be considered secondary regardless of the individual's election under Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage with the auto carrier. If an individual is covered under one plan as a Dependent and another plan as an Employee, member, or subscriber, the plan that covers the person as an Employee, member or subscriber (that is, other than as a Dependent) is considered primary. The Primary Plan must pay benefits without regard to the possibility that another plan may cover some expenses. This Plan will deem any Employee plan beneficiary to be eligible for primary benefits from his or her employer's benefit plan. -75- 7670-00-413019 The plan that covers a person as a Dependent is generally secondary. The plan that covers a person as a Dependent is primary only when both plans agree that COBRA or state continuation coverage should always pay secondary when the person who elected COBRA is covered by another plan as a Dependent. See continuation coverage below. Also see the section on Medicare, below, for exceptions. If an individual is covered under a spouse's Plan and also under his or her parent's plan, the Primary Plan is the plan of the individual's spouse. The plan of the individual's parent(s) is the Secondary Plan. If one or more plans cover the same person as a Dependent Child: The Primary Plan is the plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: - The parents are married; or - The parents are not separated (whether or not they have been married); or - A court decree awards joint custody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered either of the parents the longest is primary. If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the Child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that plan is primary. This rule applies to claim determination periods or plan years starting after the plan is given notice of the court decree. If the parents are not married and reside separately, or are divorced or legally separated, (whether or not they have ever been married), the order of benefits is: - The plan of the custodial parent; - The plan of the spouse of the custodial parent; - The plan of the non-custodial parent; and then - The plan of the spouse of the non-custodial parent. Active or Inactive Employee: If an individual is covered under one plan as an active Employee (or Dependent of an active Employee), and is also covered under another plan as a retired or laid-off Employee (or Dependent of a retired or laid-off Employee), the plan that covers the person as an active Employee (or Dependent of an active Employee) will be primary. This rule does not apply if the rule in the third paragraph (above) can determine the order of benefits. If the other plan does not have this rule, this rule is ignored. Continuation Coverage Under COBRA or State Law: If a person has elected continuation of coverage under COBRA or state law and also has coverage under another plan, the continuation coverage is secondary. This is true even if the person is enrolled in another plan as a Dependent. If the two plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if one of the first four bullets above applies. (See the exception in the Medicare section.) Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage: The plan that has covered the person as an Employee, member, subscriber, or retiree the longest is primary. If an active Employee is on leave due to active duty in the military in excess of 30 days, the plan that covers the person as an active Employee, member, or subscriber is considered primary. If the above rules do not determine the Primary Plan, the Covered Expenses may be shared equally between the plans. This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been primary. -76- 7670-00-413019 MEDICARE If You or Your covered spouse or Dependent is also receiving benefits under Medicare, including through Medicare Prescription drug coverage, federal law may require this Plan to be primary over Medicare. When this Plan is not primary, the Plan will coordinate benefits with Medicare. The order of benefit determination rules determine which plan will pay first (which is the Primary Plan). The Primary Plan pays without regard to the possibility that another plan may cover some expenses. A Secondary Plan pays for Covered Expenses after the Primary Plan has processed the claim. The balance remaining after the Primary Plan's payment, not to exceed the Covered Person's responsibility, is the amount that will be used in determining the benefits payable under the Secondary Plan. The Deductible, Co-pays, or Plan Participation amounts, if any, will be applied before benefits are paid on the balance. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES FOR MEDICARE This Plan complies with the Medicare Secondary Payer regulations. Examples of these regulations are as follows: This Plan generally pays first under the following circumstances: You continue to be actively employed by the employer and You or Your covered spouse becomes eligible for and enrolls in Medicare because of age or disability. You continue to be actively employed by the employer, Your covered spouse becomes eligible for and enrolls in Medicare, and Your spouse is also covered under a retiree plan through his or her former employer. In this case, this Plan pays first for You and Your covered spouse, Medicare pays second, and the retiree plan pays last. For a Covered Person with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), this Plan usually has primary responsibility for the claims of a Covered Person for 30 months from the date of Medicare eligibility based on ESRD. The 30-month period may also include COBRA continuation coverage or another source of coverage. At the end of the 30-month period, Medicare becomes the primary payer. Medicare generally pays first under the following circumstances: You are no longer actively employed by an employer; and You or Your spouse has Medicare coverage due to age, plus You or Your spouse also has COBRA continuation coverage through the Plan; or You or a covered family member has Medicare coverage based on a disability, plus You also have COBRA continuation coverage through the Plan. Medicare normally pays first; however, COBRA may pay first for Covered Persons with ESRD until the end of the 30- month period; or You or Your covered spouse has retiree coverage plus Medicare coverage; or Upon completion of 30 months of Medicare eligibility for an individual with ESRD, Medicare becomes the primary payer. (Note that if a person with ESRD was eligible for Medicare based on age or other disability before being diagnosed with ESRD and Medicare was previously paying as the Primary Plan, the person may continue to receive Medicare benefits on a primary basis). Medicare is the secondary payer when no-fault insurance, Workers' Compensation, or liability insurance is available as primary payer. -77- 7670-00-413019 TRICARE If an eligible Employee is on active military duty, TRICARE is the only coverage available to that Employee. Benefits are not coordinated with the Employee's health insurance plan. In all instances where an eligible Employee is also a TRICARE beneficiary, TRICARE will pay secondary to this employer-provided Plan. RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under this Plan and other plans. The Plan may obtain the information it needs from or provide such information to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying those rules and determining benefits payable under this Plan and other plans covering the person claiming benefits. The Plan need not tell, or obtain the consent of, any person to do this. However, if the Plan needs assistance in obtaining the necessary information, each person claiming benefits under this Plan must provide the Plan any information it needs to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. REIMBURSEMENT TO THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATION A payment made under another plan may include an amount that should have been paid under this Plan. If it does, the Plan may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as if it were a benefit paid under this Plan. The Plan will not have to pay that amount again. RIGHT OF RECOVERY If the amount of the payments made by the Plan is more than the Plan should have paid under this COB provision, the Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the persons it paid or for whom the Plan has paid, or from any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the Covered Person. -78- 7670-00-413019 RIGHT OF SUBROGATION, REIMBURSEMENT AND OFFSET The Plan has a right to subrogation and reimbursement. References to \"You\" or \"Your\" in this Right of Subrogation, Reimbursement, and Offset section include You, Your estate, Your heirs, and Your beneficiaries unless otherwise stated. Subrogation applies when the Plan has paid benefits on Your behalf for an Illness or Injury for which any third party is allegedly responsible. The right to subrogation means that the Plan is substituted to and will succeed to any and all legal claims that You may be entitled to pursue against any third party for the benefits that the Plan has paid that are related to the Illness or Injury for which any third party is considered responsible. The right to reimbursement means that if it is alleged that any third party caused or is responsible for an Illness or Injury for which You receive a settlement, judgment, or other recovery from any third party, You must use those proceeds to fully return to the Plan 100% of any benefits You receive for that Illness or Injury. The right of reimbursement will apply to any benefits received at any time until the rights are extinguished, resolved, or waived in writing. The following persons and entities are considered third parties: A person or entity alleged to have caused You to suffer an Illness, Injury, or damages, or who is legally responsible for the Illness, Injury, or damages. Any insurer or other indemnifier of any person or entity alleged to have caused or who caused the Illness, Injury, or damages. The Plan Sponsor in a Workers' Compensation case or other matter alleging liability. Any person or entity who is or may be obligated to provide benefits or payments to You, including benefits or payments for underinsured or uninsured motorist protection, no-fault or traditional auto insurance, medical payment coverage (auto, homeowners', or otherwise), Workers' Compensation coverage, other insurance carriers, or third party administrators. Any person or entity against whom You may have any claim for professional and/or legal malpractice arising out of or connected to an Illness or Injury You allege or could have alleged were the responsibility of any third party. Any person or entity that is liable for payment to You on any equitable or legal liability theory. You agree as follows: You will cooperate with the Plan in protecting the Plan's legal and equitable rights to subrogation and reimbursement in a timely manner, including, but not limited to: Notifying the Plan, in writing, of any potential legal claim(s) You may have against any third party for acts that caused benefits to be paid or become payable. Providing any relevant information requested by the Plan. Signing and/or delivering such documents as the Plan or our agents reasonably request to secure the subrogation and reimbursement claim. Responding to requests for information about any accident or Injuries. Making court appearances. Obtaining our consent or our agents' consent before releasing any party from liability or payment of medical expenses. Complying with the terms of this section. -79- 7670-00-413019 Your failure to cooperate with the Plan is considered a breach of contract. As such, the Plan has the right to terminate or deny future benefits, take legal action against You, and/or set off from any future benefits the value of benefits the Plan has paid relating to any Illness or Injury alleged to have been caused or caused by any third party to the extent not recovered by the Plan due to You or Your representative not cooperating with the Plan. If the Plan incurs attorneys' fees and costs in order to collect third party settlement funds held by You or Your representative, the Plan has the right to recover those fees and costs from You. You will also be required to pay interest on any amounts You hold that should have been returned to the Plan. The Plan has a first priority right to receive payment on any claim against a third party before You receive payment from that third party. Further, our first priority right to payment is superior to any and all claims, debts, or liens asserted by any medical providers, including, but not limited to, Hospitals or Emergency treatment facilities, that assert a right to payment from funds payable from or recovered from an allegedly responsible third party and/or insurance carrier. The Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights apply to full and partial settlements, judgments, or other recoveries paid or payable to You, Your representative, Your estate, Your heirs, or Your beneficiaries, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or characterized. Payments include, but are not limited to, economic, non-economic, pecuniary, consortium, and punitive damages. The Plan is not required to help You to pursue Your claim for damages or personal Injuries and no amount of associated costs, including attorneys' fees, will be deducted from our recovery without the Plan's express written consent. No so-called \"fund doctrine\" or \"common-fund doctrine\" or \"attorney's fund doctrine\" will defeat this right. Regardless of whether You have been fully compensated or made whole, the Plan may collect from You the proceeds of any full or partial recovery that You or Your legal representative obtain, whether in the form of a settlement (either before or after any determination of liability) or judgment, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or characterized. Proceeds from which the Plan may collect include, but are not limited to, economic, non-economic, and punitive damages. No \"collateral source\" rule, any \"made-whole doctrine\" or \"make-whole doctrine,\" claim of unjust enrichment, nor any other equitable limitation will limit our subrogation and reimbursement rights. Benefits paid by the Plan may also be considered to be benefits advanced. If You receive any payment from any party as a result of Illness or Injury, and the Plan alleges some or all of those funds are due and owed to the Plan, You and/or Your representative will hold those funds in trust, either in a separate bank account in Your name or in Your representative's trust account. By participating in and accepting benefits from the Plan, You agree that: Any amounts recovered by You from any third party constitute Plan assets (to the extent of the amount of Plan benefits provided on behalf of the Covered Person); You and Your representative will be fiduciaries of the Plan with respect to such amounts; and You will be liable for and agree to pay any costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) Incurred by the Plan to enforce its reimbursement rights. The Plan's rights to recovery will not be reduced due to Your own negligence. Upon the Plan's request, You will assign to the Plan all rights of recovery against third parties, to the extent of the Covered Expenses the Plan has paid for the Illness or Injury. The Plan may, at its option, take necessary and appropriate action to preserve the Plan's rights under these provisions, including, but not limited to, providing or exchanging medical payment information with an insurer, the insurer's legal representative, or other third party; and filing suit in Your name or Your estate's name, which does not obligate the Plan in any way to pay You part of any recovery the Plan might obtain. -80- 7670-00-413019 You may not accept any settlement that does not fully reimburse the Plan, without its written approval. The Plan has the authority and discretion to resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of the language stated herein. In the case of Your death, giving rise to any wrongful death or survival claim, the provisions of this section apply to Your estate, the personal representative of Your estate, and Your heirs or beneficiaries. In the case of Your death, the Plan's right of reimbursement and right of subrogation will apply if a claim can be brought on behalf of You or Your estate that can include a claim for past medical expenses or damages. The obligation to reimburse the Plan is not extinguished by a release of claims or settlement agreement of any kind. No allocation of damages, settlement funds, or any other recovery, by You, Your estate, the personal representative of Your estate, Your heirs, Your beneficiaries, or any other person or party will be valid if it does not reimburse the Plan for 100% of its interest unless the Plan provides written consent to the allocation. The provisions of this section apply to the parents, guardian, or other representative of a Dependent Child who incurs an Illness or Injury caused by any third party. If a parent or guardian may bring a claim for damages arising out of a minor's Illness or Injury, the terms of this subrogation and reimbursement clause will apply to that claim. If any third party causes or is alleged to have caused You to suffer an Illness or Injury while You are covered under this Plan, the provisions of this section continue to apply, even after You are no longer covered. In the event that You do not abide by the terms of the Plan pertaining to reimbursement, the Plan may terminate benefits to You, Your Dependents, or the subscriber; deny future benefits; take legal action against You; and/or set off from any future benefits the value of benefits the Plan has paid relating to any Illness or Injury alleged to have been caused or caused by any third party to the extent not recovered by the Plan due to Your failure to abide by the terms of the Plan. If the Plan incurs attorneys' fees and costs in order to collect third party settlement funds held by You or Your representative, the Plan has the right to recover those fees and costs from You. You will also be required to pay interest on any amounts You hold that should have been returned to the Plan. The Plan and all administrators administering the terms and conditions of the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights have such powers and duties as are necessary to discharge its duties and functions, including the exercise of its discretionary authority to (1) construe and enforce the terms of the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights and (2) make determinations with respect to the subrogation amounts and reimbursements owed to the Plan. -81- 7670-00-413019 GENERAL EXCLUSIONS Exclusions, including complications from excluded items, are not considered covered benefits under this Plan and will not be considered for payment as determined by the Plan.

The Plan provisions will be applied consistently with respect to similarly situated individuals. Pre-Determination A Pre-Determination is a determination of benefits by the Claims Administrator, on behalf of the Plan, prior to services being provided. Although Pre-Determinations are not required by the Plan, a Covered Person or provider may voluntarily request a Pre-Determination. A Pre-Determination informs individuals of whether, and under which circumstances, a procedure or service is generally a covered benefit under the Plan. A Covered Person or provider may wish to request a Pre-Determination before Incurring medical expenses. A Pre-Determination is not a claim and therefore may not be appealed. A Pre- Determination that a procedure or service may be covered under the Plan does not guarantee the Plan will ultimately pay the claim. All Plan terms and conditions will still be applied when determining whether a claim is payable under the Plan. TYPE OF CLAIMS AND DEFINITIONS Pre-Service Claim needing prior authorization as required by the Plan and stated in this SPD. This is a claim for a benefit where the Covered Person is required to obtain approval from the Plan before obtaining the medical care, such as in the case of prior authorization of health care items or services that the Plan requires. If a Covered Person or provider calls the Plan for the sole purpose of learning whether or not a claim will be covered, that call is not considered a Pre-Service Claim, unless the Plan and this SPD specifically require the person to call for prior authorization. (See \"Pre-Determination\" above.) The fact that the Plan may grant prior authorization does not guarantee that the Plan will ultimately pay the claim. Note that this Plan does not require prior authorization for urgent or Emergency care claims; however, Covered Persons may be required to notify the Plan following stabilization. Please refer to the CARE (Care Management) section of this SPD for more details. A condition is considered to be an urgent or Emergency care situation if a sudden and serious condition occurs such that a Prudent Layperson could expect the patient's life would be jeopardized, the patient would suffer severe pain, or serious impairment of the patient's bodily functions would result unless immediate medical care is rendered. Examples of an urgent or Emergency care situation may include, but are not limited to: chest pain; hemorrhaging; syncope; fever equal to or greater than 103\u00b0 F; presence of a foreign body in the throat, eye, or internal cavity; or a severe allergic reaction. Post-Service Claim means a claim that involves payment for the cost of health care that has already been provided. Concurrent Care Claim means that an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or for a specified number of treatments has been approved by the Plan. PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE Personal Representative means a person (or provider) who may contact the Plan on the Covered Person's behalf to help with claims, appeals or other benefit issues. A minor Dependent must have the signature of a parent or Legal Guardian in order to appoint a third party as a Personal Representative. -89- 7670-00-413019 If a Covered Person chooses to use a Personal Representative, the Covered Person must submit proper documentation to the Plan stating the following: the name of the Personal Representative, the date and duration of the appointment, and any other pertinent information. In addition, the Covered Person must agree to grant his or her Personal Representative access to his or her Protected Health Information. The Covered Person should contact the Claim Administrator to obtain the proper forms. All forms must be signed by the Covered Person in order to be considered official. PROCEDURES FOR SUBMITTING CLAIMS Most providers will accept assignment and coordinate payment directly with the Plan on the Covered Person's behalf. If the provider will not accept assignment or coordinate payment directly with the Plan, the Covered Person will need to send the claim to the Plan within the timelines outlined below in order to receive reimbursement. The address for submitting medical claims is on the back of the group health identification card. A Covered Person who receives services in a country other than the United States is responsible for ensuring the provider is paid. If the provider will not coordinate payment directly with the Plan, the Covered Person will need to pay the claim up front and then submit the claim to the Plan for reimbursement. The Plan will reimburse the Covered Person for any covered amount in U.S. currency. The reimbursed amount will be based on the U.S. equivalency rate that is in effect on the date the Covered Person paid the claim, or on the date of service if the paid date is not known. A complete claim must be submitted in writing and should include the following information: Covered Person's/patient's ID number, name, sex, date of birth, Social Security number, address, and relationship to Employee Authorized signature from the Covered Person Diagnosis Date of service Place of service Procedures, services, or supplies (narrative description) Charges for each listed service Number of days or units Patient account number (if applicable) Total billed charges Provider billing name, address, telephone number Provider's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) Signature of provider Billing provider Any information on other insurance (if applicable) Whether the patient's condition is related to employment, an auto Accident, or another Accident (if applicable) Assignment of benefits (if applicable) TIMELY FILING Covered Persons are responsible for ensuring that complete claims are submitted to the Third Party Administrator as soon as possible after services are received, but no later than 24 months from the date of service. If Medicare or Medicaid paid as primary in error, the timely filing requirement may be increased to three years from the date of service. A Veterans Administration Hospital has six years from the date of service to submit the claim. A complete claim means that the Plan has all of the information that is necessary in order to process the claim. Claims received after the timely filing period will not be allowed. -90- 7670-00-413019 INCORRECTLY FILED CLAIMS (Applies to Pre-Service Claims only) If a Covered Person or Personal Representative attempts to, but does not properly, follow the Plan's procedures for requesting prior authorization, the Plan will notify the person and explain the proper procedures within five calendar days following receipt of a Pre-Service Claim request. The notice will usually be oral, unless written notice is requested by the Covered Person or Personal Representative. HOW HEALTH BENEFITS ARE CALCULATED When UMR receives a claim for a service that has been provided to a Covered Person, it will determine if the service is a covered benefit under this group health Plan. If the service is not a covered benefit, the claim will be denied and the Covered Person will be responsible for paying the provider for these costs. If the service is a covered benefit, UMR will establish the allowable payment amount for that service, in accordance with the provisions of this SPD. Claims for covered benefits are paid according to an established fee schedule, according to a Negotiated Rate for certain services, or as a percentage of the Usual and Customary fees. Fee Schedule : Generally, a provider is paid the lesser of the billed amount or the maximum fee schedule for the particular covered service, minus any Deductible, Plan Participation rate, Co-pay, or penalties that the Covered Person is responsible for paying. If a network contract is in place, the network contract determines the Plan's allowable charge used in the calculation of the payable benefit. Negotiated Rate : On occasion, UMR will negotiate a payment rate with a provider for a particular covered service, such as transplant services, Durable Medical Equipment, Extended Care Facility treatment, or other services. The Negotiated Rate is what the Plan will pay to the provider, minus any Co- pay, Deductible, Plan Participation rate, or penalties that the Covered Person is responsible for paying. If a network contract is in place, the network contract determines the Plan's Negotiated Rate. Usual and Customary (U&C) - reimbursement for Covered Expenses received from providers, including Physicians or health care facilities, who are not part of Your network are determined based on one of the following: Fee(s) that are negotiated with the Physician or facility; or The amount that is usually charged by health care providers in the same geographical area (or greater area, if necessary) for the same services, treatment, or materials; or 140 percent of the published rates allowed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the same or similar service within the geographic market. A gap methodology may be utilized when CMS does not have rates published for certain procedural codes; or 50 percent of the provider's billed charges when unable to obtain a rate published by CMS and/or gap methodology does not apply. When covered health services are received from a non-network provider as a result of an Emergency or as arranged by Your Plan Administrator, eligible expenses are amounts negotiated by Your Plan Administrator or amounts permitted by law. Please contact Your Plan Administrator if You are billed for amounts in excess of Your applicable Plan Participation, Co-pays, or Deductibles. The Plan will not pay excessive charges or amounts You are not legally obligated to pay. -91- 7670-00-413019 NOTIFICATION OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION If a claim is submitted by a Covered Person or a provider on behalf of a Covered Person and the Plan does not completely cover the charges, the Covered Person will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form that will explain how much the Plan paid toward the claim, and how much of the claim is the Covered Person's responsibility due to cost-sharing obligations, non-covered benefits, penalties, or other Plan provisions. Please check the information on each EOB form to make sure the services charged were actually received from the provider and that the information appears to be correct. If You have any questions or concerns about the EOB form, call the Plan at the number listed on the EOB or on the back of the group health identification card. The provider will receive a similar form for each claim that is submitted. TIMELINES FOR INITIAL BENEFIT DETERMINATION UMR will process claims within the following timelines, although a Covered Person may voluntarily extend these timelines: Pre-Service Claims: A decision will be made within 15 calendar days following receipt of a claim request, but the Plan may have an extra 15-day extension when necessary for reasons beyond the control of the Plan, if written notice is given to the Covered Person within the original 15-day period. Post-Service Claims: Claims will be processed within 30 calendar days, but the Plan may have an additional 15-day extension when necessary for reasons beyond the control of the Plan, if written notice is provided to the Covered Person within the original 30-day period. Concurrent Care Claims: If the Plan is reducing or terminating benefits before the end of the previously approved course of treatment, the Plan will notify the Covered Person prior to the coverage for the treatment ending or being reduced. Emergency and/or urgent care claims as defined by the Affordable Care Act: The Plan will notify a Covered Person or provider of a benefit determination (whether adverse or not) with respect to a claim involving Emergency or urgent care as soon as possible, taking into account the Medical Necessity, but not later than 72 hours after the receipt of the claim by the Plan, and deference will be made to the treating Physician. A claim is considered to be filed when the claim for benefits has been submitted to UMR for formal consideration under the terms of this Plan. CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSING LOSS OR DENIAL OF PLAN BENEFITS Claims may be denied for any of the following reasons: Termination of Your employment. A Covered Person's loss of eligibility for coverage under the health Plan. Charges are Incurred prior to the Covered Person's Effective Date or following termination of coverage.

Failure to comply with prior authorization requirements before receiving services. Misuse of the Plan identification card or other fraud. Failure to pay premiums if required. -92- 7670-00-413019 The Employee or Dependent is responsible for charges due to Deductible, Plan Participation obligations, or penalties. Application of the Usual and Customary fee limits, the fee schedule, or Negotiated Rates. Incomplete or inaccurate claim submission. Application of utilization review. Procedures are considered Experimental, Investigational or Unproven. Other reasons as stated elsewhere in this SPD. ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATION (DENIED CLAIMS) Adverse Benefit Determination means a denial, reduction, or termination of a benefit, or a failure to provide or make payment, in whole or in part, for a benefit. It also includes any such denial, reduction, termination, rescission of coverage (whether or not, in connection with the rescission, there is an adverse effect on any particular benefit at that time), or failure to provide or make payment that is based on a determination that the Covered Person is no longer eligible to participate in the Plan. If a claim is being denied, in whole or in part, and the Covered Person will owe any amount to the provider, the Covered Person will receive an initial claim denial notice, usually referred to as an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form, within the timelines described above. The EOB form will: Explain the specific reasons for the denial. Provide a specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial was based. Provide a description of any material or information that is necessary for the Covered Person to perfect the claim, along with an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, if applicable. Provide appropriate information as to the steps the Covered Person may take to submit the claim for appeal (review). If an internal rule or guideline was relied upon, or if the denial was based on Medical Necessity or Experimental, Investigational, or Unproven treatment, the Plan will notify the Covered Person of that fact. The Covered Person has the right to request a copy of the rule/guideline or clinical criteria that were relied upon, and such information will be provided free of charge. APPEALS PROCEDURE FOR ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS If a Covered Person disagrees with the denial of a claim or a rescission of coverage determination, the Covered Person or his or her Personal Representative may request that the Plan review its initial determination by submitting a written request to the Plan as described below. An appeal filed by a provider on the Covered Person's behalf is not considered an appeal under the Plan unless the provider is a Personal Representative. First Level of Appeal : This is a mandatory appeal level. The Covered Person must exhaust the following internal procedures before taking any outside legal action. The Covered Person must file the appeal within 180 days of the date he or she received the EOB form from the Plan showing that the claim was denied. The Plan will assume that the Covered Person received the EOB form seven days after the Plan mailed the EOB form. The Covered Person or his or her Personal Representative will be allowed reasonable access to review or copy pertinent documents, at no charge. The Covered Person may submit written comments, documents, records, and other information related to the claim to explain why he or she believes the denial should be overturned. This information should be submitted at the same time the written request for a review is submitted. The Covered Person has the right to submit evidence that his or her claim is due to the existence of a physical or mental medical condition or domestic violence, under applicable federal nondiscrimination rules. -93- 7670-00-413019 The review will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted that relates to the claim. This will include comments, documents, records, and other information that either were not submitted previously or were not considered in the initial benefit decision. The review will be conducted by individuals who were not involved in the original denial decision and are not under the supervision of the person who originally denied the claim. If the benefit denial was based, in whole or in part, on a medical judgment, the Plan will consult with a health care professional with training and experience in the relevant medical field. This health care professional may not have been involved in the original denial decision, and may not be supervised by the health care professional who was involved. If the Plan has consulted with medical or vocational experts in connection with the claim, these experts will be identified upon the Covered Person's request, regardless of whether or not the Plan relies on their advice in making any benefit determinations. After the claim has been reviewed, the Covered Person will receive written notification letting him or her know if the claim is being approved or denied. In the event of new or additional evidence, or any new rationale relied upon during the appeal process in connection with a claim that is being appealed, the Plan will automatically provide the relevant information to the Covered Person. The notification will provide the Covered Person with the information outlined under the \"Adverse Benefit Determination\" section above. Second Level of Appeal : This is a voluntary appeal level. The Covered Person is not required to follow this internal procedure before taking outside legal action. A Covered Person who is not satisfied with the decision following the first appeal has the right to appeal the denial a second time. The Covered Person or his or her Personal Representative must submit a written request for a second review within 180 calendar days following the date he or she received the Plan's decision regarding the first appeal. The Plan will assume that the Covered Person received the determination letter regarding the first appeal seven days after the Plan sent the determination letter. The Covered Person may submit written comments, documents, records, and other pertinent information to explain why he or she believes the denial should be overturned. This information should be submitted at the same time the written request for a second review is submitted. The Covered Person has the right to submit evidence that his or her claim is due to the existence of a physical or mental medical condition or domestic violence, under applicable federal nondiscrimination rules. The second review will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted that relates to the claim that either were not submitted previously or were not considered in the initial benefit decision. The review will be conducted by individuals who were not involved in the original denial decision or the first appeal and are not under the supervision of those individuals. If the benefit denial was based, in whole or in part, on a medical judgment, the Plan will consult with a health care professional with training and experience in the relevant medical field. This health care professional may not have been involved in the original denial decision or first appeal, and may not be supervised by the health care professional who was involved. If the Plan has consulted with medical or vocational experts in connection with the claim, these experts will be identified upon the Covered Person's request, regardless of whether or not the Plan relies on their advice in making any benefit determinations. After the claim has been reviewed, the Covered Person will receive written notification letting him or her know if the claim is being approved or denied. In the event of new or additional evidence, or any new rationale relied upon during the appeal process in connection with a claim that is being appealed, the Plan will automatically provide the relevant information to the Covered Person. The notification will provide the Covered Person with the information outlined under the \"Adverse Benefit Determination\" section above. -94- 7670-00-413019 Regarding the above voluntary appeal level, the Plan agrees that any statutory limitations that are applicable to pursuing the claim in court will be put on hold during the period of this voluntary appeal process. The voluntary appeal process is available only after the Covered Person has followed the mandatory appeal level as required above. This Plan also agrees that it will not charge the Covered Person a fee for going through the voluntary appeal process, and it will not assert a failure to exhaust administrative remedies if a Covered Person elects to pursue a claim in court before following this voluntary appeal process. A Covered Person's decision about whether to submit a benefit dispute through this voluntary appeal level will have no effect on his or her rights to any other benefits under the Plan. If you have any questions regarding the voluntary level of appeal, including applicable rules, a Covered Person's right to representation (i.e. to appoint a Personal Representative), or other details, please contact the Plan. Appeals should be sent within the prescribed time period as stated above to the following address(es). Note: Post-Service Appeal Request forms are available at www.UMR.com to assist you in providing all the recommended information to ensure a full and fair review of your adverse benefit determination. You are not required to use this form.

In addition, if any new or additional evidence is relied upon or generated during the determination of the appeal, the Plan will provide such evidence to You free of charge and sufficiently in advance of the due date of the response to the Adverse Benefit Determination. If such evidence is received at a point in the process where we are unable to provide You with a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to the end of the period stated below, the time period will be tolled to allow You a reasonable opportunity to respond to the new or additional evidence. The timelines below will apply only to the mandatory appeal level. The voluntary appeal level will not be subject to specific timelines. Pre-Service Claims: Within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the medical circumstances, but no later than 30 calendar days after the Plan receives the request for review. Post-Service Claims: Within a reasonable period of time, but no later than 60 calendar days after the Plan receives the request for review. Concurrent Care Claims: Before treatment ends or is reduced. -95- 7670-00-413019 RIGHT TO EXTERNAL REVIEW If, after exhausting Your internal appeals, You are not satisfied with the final determination, You may choose to participate in the external review program. This program applies only if the Adverse Benefit Determination involves: Clinical reasons; The exclusions for Experimental, Investigational, or Unproven services; Determinations related to Your entitlement to a reasonable alternative standard for a reward under a Wellness Program; Determinations related to whether the Plan has complied with non-quantitative treatment limitation provisions of Code 9812 or 54.9812 (Parity in Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Benefits); or Other requirements of applicable law. This external review program offers an independent review process to review the denial of a requested service or procedure (other than a pre-determination of benefits) or the denial of payment for a service or procedure. The process is available at no charge to You after You have exhausted the appeals process identified above and You receive a decision that is unfavorable, or if UMR or Your employer fails to respond to Your appeal within the timelines stated above. You may request an independent review of the Adverse Benefit Determination. Neither You nor UMR or Your employer will have an opportunity to meet with the reviewer or otherwise participate in the reviewer's decision. If You wish to pursue an external review, please send a written request to the following address: UMR EXTERNAL REVIEW APPEAL UNIT PO BOX 8048 WAUSAU WI 54402-8048 Your written request should include: (1) Your specific request for an external review; (2) the Employee's name, address, and member ID number; (3) Your designated representative's name and address, if applicable; (4) a description of the service that was denied; and (5) any new, relevant information that was not provided during the internal appeal.

Any requests for an independent review must be made within four months of the date You receive the Adverse Benefit Determination. You, or an authorized designated representative may request an independent review by contacting the toll-free number on Your ID card or by sending a written request to the address on Your ID card. The independent review will be performed by an independent Physician, or by a Physician who is qualified to decide whether the requested service or procedure is a qualified medical care expense under the Plan. The Independent Review Organization (IRO) has been contracted by UMR and has no material affiliation or interest with UMR or Your employer. UMR will choose the IRO based on a rotating list of approved IROs. In certain cases, the independent review may be performed by a panel of Physicians, as deemed appropriate by the IRO. Within applicable timeframes of UMR's receipt of a request for independent review, the request will be forwarded to the IRO, together with: All relevant medical records; All other documents relied upon by UMR and/or Your employer in making a decision on the case; and All other information or evidence that You or Your Physician has already submitted to UMR or Your employer. -96- 7670-00-413019 If there is any information or evidence that was not previously provided and that You or Your Physician wishes to submit in support of the request, You may include this information with the request for an independent review, and UMR will include it with the documents forwarded to the IRO. A decision will be made within applicable timeframes. If the reviewer needs additional information in order to make a decision, this time period may be extended. The independent review process will be expedited if You meet the criteria for an expedited external review as defined by applicable law. The reviewer's decision will be in writing and will include the clinical basis for the determination. The IRO will provide You and UMR and/or Your employer with the reviewer's decision, a description of the qualifications of the reviewer, and any other information deemed appropriate by the organization and/or required by applicable law. If the final independent decision is to approve payment or referral, the Plan will accept the decision and provide benefits for such service or procedure in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan. If the final independent review decision is that payment or referral will not be made, the Plan will not be obligated to provide benefits for the service or procedure. You may contact the Claims Administrator at the toll-free number on Your ID card for more information regarding Your external appeal rights and the independent review process. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND AUTOPSY The Plan may require that a Covered Person have a physical examination, at the Plan's expense, as often as is necessary to settle a claim. In the case of death, the Plan may require an autopsy unless forbidden by law. RIGHT TO REQUEST OVERPAYMENTS The Plan reserves the right to recover any payments made by the Plan that were: Made in error; or Made after the date the person's coverage should have been terminated under this Plan; or Made to any Covered Person or any party on a Covered Person's behalf where the Plan Sponsor determines the payment to the Covered Person or any party is greater than the amount payable under this Plan.

Any Covered Person who willfully and knowingly engages in an activity intended to defraud the Plan is guilty of fraud. The Plan will utilize all means necessary to support fraud detection and investigation. It is a crime for a Covered Person to file a claim containing any false, incomplete, or misleading information with intent to injure, defraud, or deceive the Plan. In addition, it is a fraudulent act when a Covered Person willfully and knowingly fails to notify the Plan regarding an event that affects eligibility for a Covered Person. Notification requirements are outlined in this SPD and other Plan materials. Please read them carefully and refer to all Plan materials that You receive (e.g., COBRA notices). A few examples of events that require Plan notification are divorce, a Dependent aging out of the Plan, and enrollment in other group health coverage while on COBRA. (Please note that the examples listed are not all-inclusive.) These actions will result in denial of the Covered Person's claim or in termination of the Covered Person's coverage under the Plan, and are subject to prosecution and punishment to the full extent under state and/or federal law. Each Covered Person must: File accurate claims. If someone else-such as the Covered Person's spouse or another family member-files claims on the Covered Person's behalf, the Covered Person should review the claim form before signing it; Review the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form. The Covered Person should make certain that benefits have been paid correctly based on his or her knowledge of the expenses Incurred and the services rendered; Never allow another person to seek medical treatment under his or her identity. If the Covered Person's Plan identification card is lost, the Covered Person should report the loss to the Plan immediately; Provide complete and accurate information on claim forms and any other forms. He or she should answer all questions to the best of his or her knowledge; and Notify the Plan when an event occurs that affects a Covered Person's eligibility. In order to maintain the integrity of this Plan, each Covered Person is encouraged to notify the Plan whenever a provider: Bills for services or treatment that have never been received; or Asks a Covered Person to sign a blank claim form; or Asks a Covered Person to undergo tests that the Covered Person feels are not needed.

Coverage will be continued for up to the greater of: The leave period required by the federal FMLA and any amendment; or The leave period required by applicable state law. An Employee may choose not to retain group health coverage during an FMLA leave.

NEWBORNS' AND MOTHERS' HEALTH PROTECTION ACT Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance generally may not restrict benefits for any Hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or the newborn Child to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a Cesarean section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending Physician (i.e., Your Physician, nurse, midwife, or physician assistant) after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans and insurers may not set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48-hour (or 96-hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a Physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, or to reduce Your out-of-pocket costs, You may be required to obtain precertification.
