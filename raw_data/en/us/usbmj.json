Protecting your skin from UV rays is essential to your skin's health. SPF products help combat signs of aging, sunspots, and skin cancer\u2014but too many chemical sunscreens use filler ingredients that can do more harm in the long run. Some ingredients can even cause bleaching, allergic reactions, and contribute to skin cancer. So, what toxic ingredients should you avoid in sunscreen products? - Oxybenzone - Parabens - PABA - Homosalate - Octinoxate [Physical sunscreen](https://www.colorescience.com/category/physical-sunscreen) is a safe alternative to defend against UV light and environmental aggressors while reducing the likeliness of breakouts and irritation. Rather than absorbing into the skin and converting UV rays into heat like chemical sunscreen, our non-toxic sunblock** sits on top of the skin. The active ingredients, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, are organic minerals with natural repellent properties that reflect and refract light from the sun away from your body. The minerals form a barrier to shield the skin externally while added nutrients hydrate and heal from the inside-out. DOES NON-TOXIC FACE SUNSCREEN CONTAIN OXYBENZONE? Not when you shop with Colorescience! We only offer [sunscreen without oxybenzone](https://www.colorescience.com/category/sunscreen-without-oxybenzone) because non-toxic suncare should never harm you or the environment around you. It's one of the most common toxins found in chemical sunscreen and should be high on your red flag radar. The chemical forms colorless crystals that act as a filter to protect your skin from UV light, similar to PABA, and can also be absorbed by the skin. Oxybenzone has proven to disrupt the endocrine system and mimic hormones, potentially causing endometriosis and reproductive harm. It can also contribute to infertility in men and early puberty in girls, and has been found in urine and breast milk samples. That means you have the potential to pass the chemical onto you and the environment you live in. In fact, one drop of oxybenzone in an Olympic-sized pool is enough to kill a coral reef*\u2014explaining why states like Hawaii and the Virgin Islands have banned chemical SPF outright. You don't need to be swimming in the ocean to harm its ecosystem, though; if you wash it off in the shower, it can cause environmental harm by entering nearby water systems and impacting the surrounding wildlife. If it sounds alarming, it should be. Ditch the scary chemicals and make the switch to Colorescience. We offer non-toxic sunscreen for the face and body, so you can save yourself the hassle of reading hard-to-pronounce ingredients on the backs of every SPF label at the store. IS PABA PRESENT IN NON-TOXIC SUNSCREEN? PABA (also known as para-aminobenzoic acid) is a naturally occurring chemical found in folic acid as well as various foods, so you might think it's a safe ingredient to use in sunscreen. It was introduced as a way to absorb UV rays in chemical sunscreens in the 1950s, but numerous studies have since suggested that PABA is not safe for topical application. Similar to oxybenzone, it absorbs into skin and raises numerous health concerns. It's also shown to break down when exposed to sunlight leading to free radicals, damaged DNA, and potentially cancerous skin cells. Excessive doses of PABA can cause toxicity and liver damage, and people who are sensitive to the harsh chemical may experience skin reactions, nausea, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and stupor. Rather than gambling on your body's tolerance level and risking accumulative damage, choose Colorescience for [PABA-free sunscreen](https://www.colorescience.com/category/paba-free-sunscreen) to protect your skin and prevent toxicity.
