Park Road, London, N.W.LAnthroposophy, a way of thought rather than a body of dogma, springs from the work and teachingof Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). He spoke of it as \"a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe The aim of this Annual is to publish writings which bring the outlook of Anthroposophy to bear on ques tions and activities relevant to the present time. The title derives from a reference by Rudolf Steiner to an old Persian legend. \"Djemjdid was a king who led his people from the north towards Iran, and who received from the God, whom he called Ahura Mazdao, a golden dagger, by means of which he was to full his mission on earth .... It represents a force given to man whereby he can act upon and transform external nature \".Faith, Love, Hope: I T H E T H I R D R E V E L A T I O N T O M A N K I N D Rudolf jSteiner Two Lectures {hitherto untranslated) given at Niirtiberg, December 2-3,1911 * These lectures were given by Rudolf Steiner during a period of intense productive activity, involving many journeys. In March and April, 1911, he had given fundamental lectures in Prague and in Italy.In . une he gave in Copenhagen the short but pregnant course on\" The Spiritual Guidance of Humanity.\" In August the rst per- forman^ was given in Munich of his second Mystery Play , \" TheSoul's Probation.\" In October the course \"From Jesus to Christ\" was given in Karlsruhe; here he gave the fundamental spiritual concepts for the understanding of the Resurrection of Christ. Withthe exception of the course on St. Mark's Gospel, which followed in September 1912, the great courses on the Gospels had already beengiven during the preceding years, from 1908 onwards. Dr. Steiner u many places about the renewed experience ofthe Christ in the twentieth century; in the Karlsruhe course he described in detail the work of Christ as lord of human destiny\u2014a theme taken up again in these Niirnberg lectures. For some years the most signicant gure among the group of students of Rudolf Steiner resident at Niirnberg had been Michael Bauer, the friend and biographer of the poet. Christian Morgenstern. Not long before these lectures were given, Michael Bauer had come to know Dr. Friedrich Rittelmeyer, who had become widely known in Germany as a preacher and pastor, working from Niirnberg. Through Bauer, Rittelmeyer came to Rudolf Steiner himself. These lectures may well have been among the rst by Rudolf Steiner that Rittelmeyer could have heard. Certainly we may nd in them an indication of the great mysteries of destiny that worked in these encounters, and which led towards the foundation, eleven years later, of the Christian Community. For example, Rudolf Steiner describes in these lectures the meaning of the altar in early Christianity. The theme of Faith, Love and Hope appears in a wonderful way in the second Mystery Play. At about this time Rudolf Steiner gave lectures under this title in other places also, for example in Vienna. A. B. T I I S e v e n i n g a n d t o - m o r r o w e v e n i n g w e a r e g o i n g t o a t t e m p t acoherent study of the being of man, and of his connection with the occult foundations of the present time and the near future. From various indications I have given here you will have grasped that to-day we are, to some extent, facing a new revelation,a new announcement to mankind. If we keep in mind the recent periods of man's evolution, it may well be that we shall best under stand what is approaching if we connect it with two other important revelations. In doing so we shall be considering, it is true, only what has been revealed to mankind in times relatively near to our own. * From a shorthand report, unrevised by the lecturer. Published by per mission of the Rudolf Steiner-Nachlassverwaltung, Dornach, Switzerland.These three revelations\u2014^the one now to come and the two others\u2014may be best understood when compared with the early development of a child. Observing the child rightly, we nd thaton its rst coming into the world it has to be protected and cared for \"by those around it; it has no means of expressing what is going on within it or of formulating in thought what affects its soul. To begin with, the child cannot speak, cannot think; everything mustbe done for it by those who have received it in their midst. Then it starts to speak. Those who watch it attentively\u2014this is men tioned in my book. The Education of the Ch/W\u2014will know that rst it imitates what it hears; but that in the early days of talking it has no understanding which can be attributed to thinking. What the child says does not arise out of thought, but the other way round. It learns to think by talking; learns gradually to apprehend in clear thought what previously it was prompted to say out of the obscure depths of feeling. Thus we have three successive periods in the child's develop ment\u2014a first period when it can neither speak nor think, a second when it can. speak but not yet think, and a third when it becomes conscious of the thought-content in what it says. With these three stages in the child's development we may compare what mankindhas gone through\u2014^and has still to go through\u2014since about 1,500 years before the Christian era. * The rst revelation of which we can speak, as coming to man kind during the present cycle of time, is the revelation proceeding from Sinai in the form of the Ten Commandments. Anyone going more deeply into the signicance of what was revealed to mankind in these commandments will nd great cause for wonder. The fact is, however, that men take these spiritual treasures so much for granted that little thought is given to them. But those who reflect upon their signicance have to own how remarkable it is that inthese Ten Commandments something is given which has spread through the world as law; something which in its fundamental character still holds good to-day and forms the basis of the law in all countries, in so fer as, during the last 1,000 years, they have gradually adopted modern civilisation. Something all-embracing, grand, universal, is revealed to mankind as if in these words: Thereis a primal Being in the spiritual world whose image is here on earth\u2014^the Ego. This Being can so infuse His own power into the human ego, so pour Himself into it, that a man is enabled to con form to the norms, the laws, given in the Ten Commandments. The second revelation came about through the Mystery of Gol gotha. What can we say about this Mystery ? What can be said was indicated yesterday in the public lecture, \"From Jesus to Christ\". It was shown there how we have to trace back all men in their bodily nature to the original human couple on earth. And 2as we can understand men in their bodily nature only as descend ing through the generations from this couple, so, in order rightly to understand the greatest gift coming to our ego, we have to trace this fact, that must sink more and more into our ego during earthly existence, back to the Mystery of Golgotha. It need not here concern us that in this connection the old Hebrew tradition has a different conception from that of present- day science. If we trace back men's blood-relationship, their bodily relation, to that original human couple, Adam and Eve, who once lived on earth as the rst physical personalities, the primal forebears of mankind, and if we must therefore say that the blood flowing in men's veins goes back to that human pair, we can ask: Where must we look for the origin of the most precious gift bestowed on our soul, that holiest, most valuable gift, which accomplishes in the soul never-ending marvels and makes itself known to our conscious ness as something higher than the ordinary ego within us ? For the answer we must turn to what arose from the grave on Golgotha. In every human soul that has experienced an inner awakening there lives on what then arose, just as the blood of Adam and Eve con tinues to live in the body of every human being. We have to see a kind of fountain-head, a primal fatherhood, in the risen Christ\u2014the spiritual Adam who enters the souls of those who have experienced an awakening, bringing them, for the rst time, to the fullness of their ego, to what gives life to their ego in the right way. Thus, just as the life of Adam's body lives on in the physical bodies of all men, what arose from the grave on Golgothaflows in like manner through the souls of those who nd the path to it. That is the second revelation given to mankind; they are enabled to learn what happened through the Mystery of Golgotha. If in the Ten Commandments men have received guidance from outside, this guidance may be compared to what happens to the child before it can either speak or think. What is done for the child by its environment is achieved by the old Jewish law for all mankind who until then have, as it were, lacked the power of speaking and thinking. People, however, have now learnt to speak\u2014or, rather, have learnt something that may be compared with a child's learning to speak: they have gained knowledge of the Mystery of Golgotha through the Gospels. And the way in which they rst understood the Gospels may be compared with how a child learns to speak. Through the Gospels there has come to. human souls and human hearts some degree of understanding for the Mystery of Golgotha, which has found its way into human feelings and percep tions, and into the soul-forces arising in us when, for example, we allow the deeply signicant, intuitive scenes and pictures drawn from the Gospels by great painters to work upon us. It is the same with traditional pictures\u2014pictures of the adoration of the Child by the Shepherds or by the Wise Men from the East; of the flight into 3Egypt, and so on. All this leads back in the end to the Gospels; it has reached men's understanding in such a way that they may be said to have leamt to speak, in their fashion, about the Mystery of Golgodia.M this connection we are now moving towards the third period, which may be compared with how the child leams the thought- content in its own speech and can become conscious of it. We are approaching the revelation which should give us the full content, the thought-content, of the Gospels\u2014all they contain of soul and spirit. For at present the Gospels are no better understood than the child understands what it says before it can think. In the con text of world-history people are meant to learn through Spiritual Science, to reflect upon the thoughts in the Gospels; to let the whole deep spiritual content of the Gospels work upon them for the rst time. This indeed is connected with a further great event which manldnd can feel to be approaching, and which they will experience before the end of this twentieth century. This event can be brought before our souls in somewhat the following way : If once again we enter into the nature of the Mystery of Golgotha, we realise that those elements of the Christ which rose from the grave of Golgotha have remained with the earth, so that they can directly affect every human soul, and can in each soul awaken the ego to a higher stage of existence. Speaking thus of the Mystery of Golgotha we may say: Christ then became the Spirit of the earth and since that time has remained so. In our day, however, a change in relation of the Christ to men is coming, an important change connected with what all of you have come to know something about-^he new revelation to men erf the Christ. * This revelation can also be characterised in another way. For this indeed we must turn to what happens when a man goes through the gate of death. (This is something that could not be described in books, but must now be spoken of.) When a man has passed through the gate of death, has experienced the backward survey over his previous earthly life and has come to the point when his etheric b^y is laid aside and the time has come for his Kamaloka, he is rst met by two gures. Usually only one is mentioned, but to complete the picture\u2014and this is a reality for every true occultist \u2014we must say that before his Kamaloka the man is confronted by two gures, ^^at I am now telling you holds good, it is true, only for men of the West, and for those who, during the last 1,000 years, have been connected with Western culture. The man after death is confronted by two figures. One of these is Moses\u2014the man knows quite clearly that it is Moses who stands before him, holding out the tables of the law. In the Middle Ages they spoke of Moses\" with his stem law\". And in his soul the man is keenly aware of how far in his inmost being he has transgressed against this law.The other gure is \" the Cherubim with the flaming sword \", who pronounces judgment on these transgressions. That is an experiencea man lias after death. Thus, in accordance with our Spiritual Science, it can be said that there is a kind of settlement of the man's karmic account by these two figures\u2014Moses with the stern law and the Cherubim with the flaming sword. In our time, however, a change is approaching, an important change which can be described in this way. Christ is becoming Lord of Karma for all those who, after death, have experienced what has just been discussed. Christ is entering upon His judgeship. Let us look more closely into this fact. From the world-conception of Spiritual Science we all know that a karmic account is kept of our life; that there is a certain balancing of the deeds standing on the credit side of the account\u2014'the sensible deeds, the fine deeds, those that are good\u2014and, on the other side, the bad, ugly, lying deeds and thoughts. Now it is important, on the one hand, that in the further course of a man's earthly life he should himself adjust the balance oi this karmic account. But this living out of the result of his good and splendid deeds, or those that are bad, can be done in many different ways. The particular adjustment in our future life is not always determined after the same pattern. Suppose someone has done a bad action; he must compensate for it by doing a good one. This good action, however, can be achieved in two ways, and it may require the same effort on the man's part to do good to a few people only as to benet a considerable number. To ensure that in future, when we have found our way to Christ, our karmic account will be balanced\u2014^inserted in the cosmic order\u2014^in such a way that the settlement of it will benefit as many people as possible\u2014^that will be the concern of Him who in our time is becoming Lord of Karma\u2014^it will be the concern of the Christ. This taking over by Christ of the judging of a man's deeds is a result of His direct intervention in human destiny. This interven tion is not in a physical body, 'but on behalf of those men on earth who will increasingly acquire the capacity of perceiving Him. There will be people, for instance, who, while carrying out some deed, suddenly become aware\u2014there will be more and more cases of this from now on, during the next 3,000 years\u2014of an urge to refrain from what they are doing, because of a remarkaible vision. They will perceive in a dreamlike way what appears to be an action of their own; yet they will not be able to remember having done it. Those who are not prepared for such a thing to happen in the course of their evolution will look upon it merely as imagination run wild or as a pathological condition of the soul. Those, how ever, who are sufciently prepared through the new revelation com ing in our time to mankind through spiritual science\u2014through, that is, this third revelation during the atest cycle of mankind\u2014will realise that all this points to the growing of new human faculties 4 5enabling men to see into the spiritual world. They will also realise that this picture appearing to their soul is a forewarning of the fcarmic deed that must be brought about\u2014either in this life on earth or in a later one\u2014^to compensate for what they have done. In short, people will gradually achieve, through their own efforts, the faculty for perceiving in a vision the karmic adjustment, the compensating deed, which must come about in future. From this fact it can be seen that in our time, too, we should say, as did John the Baptist by the Jordan: Change your state of soul, for the time is coming when new faculties will awake in men. But this form of karmic perception will arise in such a way that here and there the gure of the etheric Christ will be directly visible to some individual\u2014the actual Christ as He is living in the astral world\u2014not in a physical body, but as for the newly awakened faculties of men He will manifest on earth; as counsellor and protec tor of those who need advice, help or solace in the loneliness of their lives. The time is coming when human beings, when they feel depressed and miserable, for one or other reason, will increasingly nd the help of their fellows less important and valuable. This is because the force of individuality, of individual life, will count for more and more, while the power of one man to work helpfully upon the soul of another, which held good in the past, will tend constantly to diminish. In its stead the great Counsellor will appear, in etheric form. The best advice we can be given for the future is, therefore, to make our souls strong and full of energy, so that with increased strength, the further we advance into the future, whether in this incamation-r-and certainly this apiplies to the young people of to-day\u2014or in the next, we may realise that newly^awakened facul ties give us knowledge of the great Counsellor who is becoming at the same time the judge of a man's karma; knowledge, that is, of Christ in His new form. For those people who have already pre pared themselves here for the Christ-event of the 20th century, it will riiake no difference whether they are in the physical body, when this event becomes a widespread experience, or have passed through the gate of death. Those who have passed through will still have the right understanding of the Christ-event and the right connection with it, but not those who have thoughtlessly passed by this third great forewarning to mankind given through Spiritual Science. Forthe Christ-event must be prepared for here on earth in the physical body. Those who go through the gate of death without giving even a glance into Spiritual Science during their present incarnation, will have to wait until their next before gaining a right understanding of the Christ-event. It is an actual fact that those who on the physical plane have never heard of the Christ-event are unable to come to an understanding of it between death and rebirth. They, tod, must wait until they can prepare for it on their return to thephysical plane. When, therefore, their present incarnation ends at death, these men in their essential being remain unconcerned in face of the mighty event referred to\u2014the taking over of the judge ship by Christ and the possibility of His intervening, in an etheric body, directly from the astral world in the evolution of mankind,and His becoming visible in various places. It is characteristic of human evolution, however, that old attri butes of men. not closely connected with spiritual evolution, gradually lose signicance. When we consider human evolutionsince the Atlantean catastrophe we can say: Among the great differ entiations prepared during the Atlantean Age, present-day men have become accustomed to those of race. We can still speak, in a certain sense, of an old Indian race, of an old Persian race, of an Egyptian or a Graeco-Latin one, and even of something in our owntime corresponding to a fth race. But the concept of race in rela tion to human evolution is ceasing to have a right meaning. Some thing that held good in earlier times will no longer do so in thesixth culture-epoch which is to follow our own\u2014^namely, that it is essential to have some spatial ceptre from which to spread the cul ture of the epoch. The important thing is the spreading of Spiritual Science among men; without distinction of race, nation, or family. In the sixth culture-epoch those who have accepted Spiritual Science will come out of every race, and will found, throughout the earth, a new culture no longer based on the concept of race\u2014that concept will have lost its signicance. In short, what is important in the world of Maya, the external world of space, vanishes away; we must learn to recognise this in the future course of our spiritual-scientic movement. At the beginning this was not understood. Therefore we see how, when we read Olcott's book. The Buddhist Catechism, which once did good service, we have the impression that races always go on like so many wheels. But for the coming time such concepts are losing their signicance. Everything subject to limitations of space will lose signicance. Hence anyone who thoroughly under stands the meaning of human evolution understands also that the coming appearance of Christ during the next 3,000 years does notentail Christ being restricted to a body bound by space, nor limited to a certain territory. Neither will His appearance be liinited by an inability to appear in more than one place at a time. His help willbe forthcoming at the same moment here, there, and everywhere. And as a spiritual being is not subject to the laws of space, anyonewho oan be helped by Prist's direct presence is able to receive that help at one end of the earth just as well as another person at the opposite end. Onlv those unwilling to recognise the progress of We have now described the facts concerning the third revelation' and how this revelation is already in process of throwing new ligMraankmd towards spirituality, and what gradually transforms all the most important events into the spiritu^\u2014only these persons can . ijV'declare that what is implied by the Christ-being is limited to a physical body. %>on the Gospels. The Gospels are the language, and, in relation to^ them, Anthroposophy is the thought-content. As language is related to a child's full consciousness, so are the Gospels related to the new revelation that comes directly from the spiritual world\u2014related, in effect, to what Spiritual Science is to become for mankind. We must be aware that we have in fact a certain task to full, a task of understanding, when we come\u2014^st out of the soul's unconscious depths, and then ever more clearly\u2014to discern our connection with Anthroposophy.We must look upon it, in a sense, as a mark of distinction bestowed by the World-Spirit, as a sign of grace on the part of the creative, guiding Spirit of the world, when to-day our heart urges us towards this new announcement which is added, as a third revelation, to those proclaimed from Sinai and then from the Jordan. To learn to know man in his entire being is the task given in this new announcement\u2014^to perceive ever more deeply that what we are principally conscious of is sheathed around by other members ofman's being, which are nevertheless important for his life as a whole. * It is necessary for our friends to learn about these matters from the most various points of view. To-day we will begin by rst say ing a few words about man's inner being. You know that if we start from the actual centre of his being, from his ego, we come next to the sheath to which we give the more or less abstract name of astral body. Further out we nd the so-called etheric body, and still further outside, the physical body. From the point of view of real life we can speak about the human sheaths in another way, and to-day we will take directly from life what can, it is true, be learnt only from occult conceptions, but can be understood through un prejudiced observation. Many of those who, on account of their so-called scientic worldnconception, have become arrogant and overbearing, now say:\" The ages erf faith are long past; they were t for mankind in their stage of childhood but men have now progressed to knowledge. To^ay people must have knowledge of everything and should no longer merely believe.\" Now that may sound all very well, but it does not rest on genuine understanding. We must ask more ques tions about such matters than merely whether in the present course of human evolution knowledge has been gained through ordinary science. These other questions ^ust be put: Does faith, as such, mean anything for mankind ? 'May it not be part of a man's very nature to believe ?Naturally, it might be quite possible that people should want, for some reason, to dispense with faith, to throw it over. But just as a man is allowed for a time to play fast and loose with his health without any obvious harm, it might very well be\u2014and is actuallyso\u2014^that people come to look i^n faith merely as a cherished gift to their fathers in the past, which is just as if for a time they were recklessly to abuse their health, thereby using up the forces they once possessed. When a man looks upon faith in that way, how ever, he is still\u2014where the life-forces of his soul are concerned\u2014 living on the old gift of faith handed down to him through tradition.It is not for man to decide whether to lay aside faith or not; faith is a question of life-giving forces in his soul. The important point is not whether we believe or not, but that the forces expressed in the word * faith' are necessary to the soul. For the soul incapable of faith become withered, dried-up as the desert. There were once men who, without any knowledge of natural science, were much cleverer than those to-day with a scientic world-conception. They did not say what people imagine they wouldhave said: \"I believe what I do not know.\" They said: \"I believe what I know for certain.\" Knowledge is the only foundation of faith. We should know in order to take increasing possession of those forces which are forces of faith in the human soul. In our soul we must have what enables us to look towards a super-sensible world, makes it possible for us to turn all our thoughts and concep tions in that direction. If we do not possess forces such as are expressed in the word 'faith', something in us goes to waste; we wither as do the leaves in autumn. For a while this may not seem to matter\u2014then things begin to go wrong. Were men in reality to lose all faith, they wouldsoon see what it means for evolution. By losing the forces of faith they would be incapacitated for nding their way about in life; their very existence would be undermined by fear, care, and anxiety. To put it briefly, it is through the forces of faith alone that we can receive the life which should well up to invigorate the soul. This is because, imperceptible at rst for ordinary consciousness, there lies in the hidden depths of our being something in which our true ego is embedded. This something, which immediately makes itself felt if we fail to bring it fresh life, is the human sheath where the forces of faith are active. We may term it the faith-soul, or\u2014as I prefer\u2014 the faith-body. It has hitherto been given the more abstract name of astral body. The most important forces of the astral body are those of faith, so the term astral body and the term faith-body are equally justied.A second force that is also to be found in the hidden depths of a man's being is the force expressed by the word ' love'. Love is not only something linking men together; it is also needed by them as individuals. When a man is incapable of developing the force of love he, too, becomes dried-up and withered in his inner being. 8 9We have merely to picture to ourselves someone who is actually so great an egoist that he is unaible to love. Even where the case isless extreme, it is sad to see people who nd it difcult to love, who pass through an incarnation without the living warmth that lovealone can generate\u2014love for, at any rate, something on earth. Such persons are a distressing sight, as in their dull, prosaic way, they go through the world. For love is a living force thatstimulates something deep in our being, keeping it awake and alive \u2014an even deeper force than faith. And just as we are cradled in a body of faith, which from another aspect can be called the astral body , so are we cradled also in a body of love, or, as in Spiritual Science we called it, the etheric body, the body of life-forces. For the chief forces working in us from the etheric body, out of the depths of our being, are those expressed in a man's capacity for loving at every stage of his existence. If a man could completely empty his toeing of the force of love\u2014ibut that indeed is impossiblefor fe greatest egoist, thanks be to God, for even in egoistical striving there is still some element of love. Take this case, for example: whoever is unable to love anything else can often begin,if he is sufciently avaricious, by loving money , at least substituting for charitable love another love\u2014albeit one arising from egoism. For were there no love at all in a man, the sheath which should be sustained by love-forces would shrivel, and the man, empty of love, would actually ^rish; he would really meet with physical death. This shrivefng of the forces of love can also be called a shrivell ing of the forces belonging to the etheric body; for the etheric body is the same as the body of love. Thus at the very centre of a man's being we have his essential kernel, the ego, surrounded by its sheaths; rst the body of faith, and then round it the body of love. * If we go further, we come to another set of forces we all need in life, and if we do not, or cannot, have them at all\u2014well, that is very distinctly to be seen in a man's external nature. For the forceswe need emphatically as life-giving forces are those of hope, of condence in the future. As far as the physical world is concerned, p^ple cannot take a single step in life without hope. They certainly make strange excuses, sometimes, if fey are unwilling to acknowledge that human beings need to know something of what happens between death and rebirth. They say: \"Why do we needto faiow that, when we don't know what will happen to us here from one day to another ? So why are we supposed to know whattakes place between death and a new birth ? \" But do we actually know nothing about the following day ? We may have no Imow- ledge of what is important for the details of our super-sensible life,or , to speak more bluntly , whether or not we shall be physicallyalive. We do, however, know one thing\u2014that if we are physically alive the next day there will be morning, midday , evening, just as 10there are to day . If to-day as a carpenter 1 have made a table, it will still be there to-morrow; if I am a shoemaker, someone will be able to put on to-morrow what I have made to-day; and if I have sown seeds I know that next year they will come up. We know about the future just as much as we need to know. Life would be impossible in the physical world were not future events to be preceded by hope in this rhythmical way . Would anyone make a toble to-day without being sure it would not be destroyed in the night; would anyone sow seeds if he had no idea what would become of them? It is precisely in physical life that we need hope, for everything is upheld by hope and without it nothing can be done. The forces of hope, therefore, are connected with our last sheath as human beings, with our physical body. What the forces of faith are for our astral body, and the love-forces for the etheric, the forces of hope are for the physical body. Thus a man who is unable to hope, a man always despondent about what he supposes the future may bring, will go through the world with this clearly visible in his physical appearance. Nothing makes for deep wrinkles, those deadening forces in the physical body, sooner than lack of hope. The inmost kernel of our being may be said to be sheathed in our faith-body or astral body , in our body of love or etheric body , and in our hope-ibody or physical body; and we comprehend the true signicance of our physical body only when we bear in mind that, in reality, it is not sustained by external physical forces ofattraction and repulsion\u2014that is a materialistic idea\u2014but has in it what, according to our concepts, we know as forces of hope. Our physical body is built up by hope, not by forces of attraction and repulsion. This very point can show that the new spiritual-scienticrevelation gives us the truth. What then does Spiritual Science give us ? By revealing the all- embracing laws of karma and reincarnation, it gives us something which permeates us with spiritual hope, just as does our awareness on the physical plane that the sun will rise to-morrow and that seeds will eventually grow into plants. It shows, if we understand karma, that our physical body, which will perish into dust when we have gone through the gate of death, can through the forces permeatingus with hope be re-built for a new life. Spiritual Science lls men with the strongest forces of hope. Were this Spiritual Science, this new revelation for the present time, to be rejected, men naturally would return to earth in future all the same, for Itfe on earth would not cease on account of people's ignorance of its laws. Human beings would incarnate again; but there would be something very strange about these incarnations. Men would gradually become a race with bodies wrinkled and shrivelled all over, earthly bodies which would nally be so crippled that people would be entirely incapacitated. T o put it briefly, in future incarnations a condition 11of dying away, of withering up, would assail mankind if their con sciousness, and from there the hidden depths of their being right down into the physical body, were not given fresh life through the power of hope. This power of hope arises through the certainty of knowledge gained from the laws of karma and re-incarnation. Already thereis a tendency in human beings to produce withering bodies, which in future would become increasingly rickety even in the very bones. Marrow will be brought to the bones, forces of life to the nerves, by this new revelation, whose value will not reside merely in theoriesbut in its life-giving forces\u2014^aibove all in those of hope. Faith, love, hope, constitute three stages in the essential being of man; they are necessary for health and for life as a whole, for with out them we cannot exist. Just as work cannot be done in a dark room until light is obtained, it is equally impossible for a human being to carry on in his fourfold nature if his three sheaths are not permeated, warmed through, and strengthened by faith, love, andhope. For faith, love, hope are the basic forces in our astral body ,our etheric body, and our physical body. And from this one instance you can judge how the new revelation makes its entry into the world, permeating the old language with thought-content. Are not these three wonderful words urged upon us in the Gospel revelation, these words of wisdom that ring through the ages faith, love, hope ? But little has been understood of their whole coimection with human life, so little that only in certain places has their right sequence been observed. It is true that faith, love, hope, are sometimes put in this correct order; but the si^icance of the words is so little appreciated thatwe often hear faith, hope, love, which is incorrect; for you cannot say astral body , physical body , etheric body , if you would give themtheir right sequence. That would be putting things hig^edy-piggle- d y , a s a c h i l d w i l l s o m e t i m e s d o b e f o r e i t u n d e r s t a n d s t h e t h o u g h t -content of what is said. It is the same with everything relating to the second revelation. It is permeated throughout with thought; and we have striven to permeate with thought our explanation of the Gospels. For what have they meant for people up to now ? Theyhave been something with which to fortify mankind and to ll them with great and powerful perceptions, something to inspire men to enter into the depth of heart and feeling in the Mystery of Golgotha.But now consider the simple fact that people have only just beguiito reflect upon the Gospels, and in doing so they have straightway found contradictions upon which Spiritual Science alone can helpto throw light. Thus it is only now that they are beginning to lettheir souls be worked on by the thought-content of what the Gospels ^ve them in language of the supersensifble worlds. In this connection we have pointed out what is so essential and of such conse quence for our age: the new appearance of the Christ in an etheric 12body, for his appearance in a physical body is ruled out by the whole character of our times. Hence we have indicated that the Christ, in contradistinction as it were to the suffering Christ on Golgotha, is appearing now as Christ triumphant, Christ the Lord of Karma. This has been fore shadowed by those who have painted Him as the Christ of the Last Judgment. Whether painted or described in words, something .is represented which at the appointed time will come to pass.In truth, this begins in the 20th century and will hold good until the end of the earth. It is in our 20th century that this judginent, this ordering of Karma, begins, and we have seen how innitely important it is for our age that this revelation should come to menin such a way that even concepts such as faith, love, hope, can be given their true valuation for the rst time. * John the Baptist said: Change your mood of soul, the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. That is, take to yourselves the human ego that need no longer aibstain from approaching the spiritual world\u2014 a saying which points clearly to what is here in question, namely , that with the event of Palestine the time came for the supersensible to pour light into the ego of man, so that into his ego the heavens are able to descend. Previously, the ego could come to men only by sinking into their unconscious. But those who interpret every thing materialistically say: The Christ, reckoning with the weak nesses, errors and prejudices of His contemporaries, even foretold,like the credulous people of His time, that the millennium would be realised or that a great catastrophe would fall upon the earth. Neither of these events, however, came about. There was indeed a catastrophe, but perceptible only to the spirit. The credulous andsuperstitious, who believe Christ to have foretold how His actual coming would be from the clouds, interpreted His meaning in a materialistic way. T o-day, also, there are people who thus interpret what is to be grasped only in spirit, and when nothing happens in a materialsense they judge the matter in just the same way as was done in the case of the millennium. How many indeed we nd to-day who, speaking almost pityingly of those events, say that Christ wasinfluenced by the beliefs of His time and looked for the impending approach to earth of the Kingdom of Heaven. That was a weakness on Christ's part, they say , and then it was seen\u2014and remarked upon even by distinguished theologians\u2014that the Kingdom of Heaven has not come down on earth. It may be that men will meet our new revelation, too, in such a way that after a time, when the enhancement of men's faculties isin full swing, they will say, \" Well, nothing has come of all these predictions of yours\", not realising that they just cannot see what is there. Thus do events repeat themselves. Spiritual Science is 13meant to gather together a large number of people, until fullment comes for what has been said by those with a right knowledge of how during this century the new revelation and the new super sensible facts are appearing in human evolution. They will then continue their course in the same way, becoming ever more signi cant throughout the next 3,000 years, until important new weighty facts are once more revealed to mankind.Faith, Love, Hope: II T O W A R D S T H E S I X T H E P O C H Rudolf Steiner Y e s t e r d a y w e t r i e d t o g a i n a c o n c e p t i o n o f t h e i m p o r t a n c e i nhuman life of what may be termed the supersensible revelation of our age. We indicated that this was to be reckoned the third revelation in the most recent cycle of mankind, and should, in a cer tain sense, be regarded as in sequence to the Sinai revelation and the revelation at the time of the Mystery of Golgotha. We ought not to look upon this feature of our age as something affectingus merely theoretically or scientically; as Anthroposophists we must rise to an ever fuller realisation that men, in their evolution, are neglecting something essential if they hold aloof from all that is being announced to us now and will be announced in the future. Itis quite appropriate that at rst the external world should pass this by. or even treat it as sheer fantasy; and quite natural also that, to begin with, many people should not pay attention to the harmful consequences of disregarding what is here in question. But Anthroposophists should be clear that the souls in human bodies to-day , irrespective of what they absorb at present, are approaching an ineluctable future. What I shall have to say concerns every soul, for it is part of the whole trend of change in our time.The souls incorporated to-day have only recently advanced to the stage of that genuine ego-consciousness which has been in preparation during the course of evolution ever since the oldAtlantean period. But for the people of those ancient days, up to the time when the great change was intimated by the Mystery of Golgotha, this ego-consciousness was gradually freeing itself from a consciousness of which present-day people no longer have any real knowledge. To-day modern men generally distinguish only between our ordinary condition of being awake and the state of sleep, when consciousness is in complete abeyance. Between thesestates they recognise also the intermediate one of dreaming, butfrom the present-day standpoint they can regard it only as a kindof aberration, a departure from the normal. Through dream- pictures certain events from the depths of the soul-life rise into consciousness; but in ordinary dreaming they emerge in such anobscure form that the dreamer is scarcely ever able to interpret rightly their very real bearing on deep supersensible processes inhis life of soul. In order to grasp one characteristic feature of this intermediate state \u2014a state well understood in earlier times\u2014let us take an ordinary dream of which a scientic modern investigator of dreams,able to interpret it only supercially and in a materialistic way , has 15 GB\u20142made a regular conundrum. A highly signicant dream! You see, I am taking my example from the science of dreams, which\u2014 as I have mentioned before\u2014has to-day been given a place, little understood though it is, among sciences such as chemistry amd physics. The following dream, a characteristic one, has beenrecorded. I might easily have taken my example from similar, unpublished, dreams; but I would like to deal with one which raises certain problems for present-day commentators, who have no key to such matters. Now the case is this. A married couple had a much beloved son, who was growing up to the joy of his parents. One day he fell ill, and his condition worsened in a few hours to such a degree that, at the end of this one day, he passed through the gate of death. Thus for the ordinary experience of this couple, their son was abruptly snatched from them, and the son himself torn from a life full of promise. The parents, naturally, mourned their son. During the months following there was a great deal in the dreamsof both husband and wife to remind them of him. But, quite a long time\u2014many, many months\u2014after his death, there came a night when his father and mother had exactly the same dream. They dreamed that their son appeared to them saying he had been buried alive, having only been in a trance, and that they merely had to look into the matter to be convinced that this was true. The parents told each other what they had thus dreamed on the same night, and such was their attitude to life that they imme diately asked the authorities for permission to have their son's body disinterred. In such matters, however\u2014conditions being as they are\u2014authorities are not easily persuaded; the request was refused. The parents had this further cause for grieving. Now the investigator who gave his account of the dream, and could think of it only in a materialistic way, was faced with great difculties. To begin with it is very easy to say: Yes, this is quite intelligible. The parents were thinking so much about their son that it is obvious they would both have dreamt of him. But the puzzling thing was that they should have had the same dream ointhe same night. The investigator nally explained it in a remark able way which is bound to seem very forced to anyone reading it. He said: We can only assume that one parent had the dream, awd the other, hearing it when awake, got the idea that he (or she) had dreamt it also. To present-day consciousness this interpretation at rst seems fairly obvious, but it doesnt gp very deep. I have expressly mentioned that for anyone well-versed in dream- experiences there is nothing unusual in several people having the same dream at the same time. Let us try now to look into this dream-experience from the point of view of Spiritual Science. The results of spiritual investigation show how a man who has gone through the gate of death lives on as an individuality in the spiritual world. We know, too, 16that there are denite connections between every thing and every being in the world, and that this is evident in the link that unites those who have departed with people still on earth, when the latter lovingly concentrate thoughts on their dead. There is no question of there not being a connection between those on the physical plane and those who have left it for the supersensibleworld. There is always a connection when thoughts are turned at all to the dead by those left on the physical plane\u2014a connection that may continue even when their thoughts are directed elsewhere. But the point is that human beings, organised as they are now for life on the physical plane, are unable when awake to become conscious of these bonds. Having no knowledge of a thing, how ever, does not justify denying its existence; that would be a very supercial conclusion. On that basis, those now sitting in this room and not seeing Nuremberg could easily prove there is no such place. So we must be clear that it is only because of their present-day organisation that men know nothing of their connectionwith the dead; it exists all the same. However, knowledge of what is going on in the depths of thesoul can occasionally be conjured up into consciousness, and this happens in dreams. It is one thing we have to reckon with when considering dream-experiences. Another thing is the knowledgethat passing through death is not the sudden leap imagined by those knowing nothing about it; it is a gradual transition. What occupiesa soul here on earth does not then vanish in a moment. What a man loves, he continues to love after his death. But there is no possibility of satisfying a feeling which depends for its satisfactionon a physical body. The wishes and desires of the soul, its joys, sorrows, the particular tendencies it has during incorporation in a physical body\u2014these naturally continue even when the gate ofdeath has been passed. We can therefore understand how strong was the feeling in this young man, meeting with death when quite unprepared, that he would like to be still on earth, and how keen was his longing to be in a physical body. This desire, working as a force in the soul, lasted on for a long, long time during his Kamaloka. Now picture to yourselves vividly the parents, with their thoughts engrossed by this beloved dead son. Even in sleep the connecting links were there. Just at the moment when both fatherand mother began to dream, the son, in accordance with the state of his soul, had a particularly keen desire that we may perhaps clothe in these words: \"Oh! If only I were still on earth in a physical body.\" This thought on the part of the dead son sank deep into his parents' soul, but they had no special faculty for understanding what lay behind the dream. Thus the imprint of the thought on their life of soul was transformed into familiar images. Whereas, if they could have clearly perceived what the son was pouring into their souls, their interpretation would have 17been: \"Our son is longing just now for a physical body.\" In fact, the dream-image clothed itself in words they understood\u2014\"He has been buried alive!\"\u2014which hid the truth from them. Thus, in dream-pictures of this kind we should not look for an exact replica of what is real in the spiriutal worlds; we must expect the actual objective occurrence to be veiled in accordance with the dreamer's degree of understanding. To-day it is the peculiar feature of the dream-world that\u2014if we are unable to go into these matters more deeply\u2014we can no longer regard its pictures as faithful copies of what underlies them. We are obliged to say: Something is always living in our soul behind the dream-picture,and this picture can be looked upon only as a still greater illusion than the external world confronting us when we are awake. It is only in our time that dreams are appearing to people in this guise; strictly speaking only since the events in Palestine, when ego-consciousness took on the form it has now. Before then, the pictures appeared while men were in a state different from either waking or sleeping\u2014a third state, more like the one prevailingin the supersensible world. Human beings lived with the dead in spirit far more than is feasible nowadays. There is no need tolook back many centuries before the Christian era to realise what a countless nuniber of people were then able to say: \"The dead are certainly not dead; they are living in the supersensible world. I cam perceive what they are feeling and seeing, what they now actually are. This holds good also for the other Beings in the supersensible world; those, for instance, whom we know as the Hierarchies.\" Thus, for human beings in certain states between waking and sleeping, these were experiences of which the last degenerateechoes linger on in dreams. Hence it was very important that men should then feel this disappearance of something they once possessed. In that traditional epoch of human evolution, when the great events were taking place in Palestine, there was indeed cause for saying: \" Change your mood of soul; quite different times are coming for mankind.\" And among the changes was this\u2014^that the old possibility of seeing into the spiritual world, of personally experiencing how matters stood with the dead and with all other spiritual beings, was going to pass away. The history of those olden days offers ample evidence of this living with the dead\u2014^notably in the religious veneration arising everywhere in the form 6t ancestor-worship. This was foundedon belief in the reality and activity of those who had died. And whereas it continued almost everywhere during the transitional period, men's experience was this, though perhaps not put clearly into words: \"Formerly our souls could rise to the world we call that of the spirit, and we were able to dwell among the higher Beings and with the dead. But now our dead leave us in quiteanother sense; they disappear from our consciousness and the old vivid contact is no more.\" We come here to something exceptionally difcult to grasp, but the intelligent mind, the intelligent soul, can learn to do so. It was the early Christians who felt most vividly the loss of direct psychical contact with the dead, and it was this that made their worship of God so full of meaning, so innitely deep and holy. They com pensated for what was lost by the reverent feeling they brought to their religious ceremonies; when, for instance, they sacriced at the graves of their dead or celebrated the Mass, or observed any other religious rite. In fact, it was during this period of transition, when consciousness of the dead was seen to be wanting, that altars took the shape of cofns. Thus it was with a feeling for mortal remains of this kind\u2014unlike that of the ancient Egyptians\u2014^that the service of God, the service of the spirit, was reverently per formed. As I have said, this is something not easy to understand. We need, however, only observe the form of an altar, and allow our hearts to respond to this gradual change in men's whole out look, and feeling and understanding will then arise for the change and its consequences. We see. therefore, that slowly, gradually, the present state of the human soul was brought about. From indications given yesterday it can be gathered that what has thus come into beingwill again be succeeded by a different state, for which people are already developing faculties. The example I gave you yesterdayof how a man will see, in a kind of dream picture, his future karmic compensation for . some deed, means the re-awakening of faculties that will lead the soul once more to the spiritual worlds. In relation to earthly evolution as a whole, the intermediate state when the soul has been cut off from the supersensible world, will prove to be comparatively short. It had to come about for men to be able to acquire the strongest possible forces for their freedom. But something else of which I have spoken was bound up with the whole progress of human evolution\u2014that only in this way was a man able to acquire a feeling of the ego within him; to have, that is, the right ego-consciousness. The farther men advance into the future, the more rmly will this ego-consciousness establish itself within them, always increasing in signicance. In other words, the force and self-sufciency of men's indviduality will be increasingly accentuated, so that it becomes neecssary for them to nd in themselves their own effective support. Thus we see that the ego-consciousness men have to-day does not go back as far as is usually imagined. Only a few incarnations ago, men had no ego^eeling such as is characteristic of them to-day. And as the ego- feeling is intimately connected with memory, we need not be surprised that many people should not have begun, as 18 19yet, to look back on their previous Jncarnations. Because of the incarnations on earth. That is true, and should not be treated undeveloped state of this feeling for his ego during early childhood, lightly . On the other hand, those who see friends and acquaintancesa man does not even remember what happened to him then; so it they care for showing no inclination towards Anthroposophy can seems quite comprehensible that, for the same reason, he is unable say: \"If I 'become a good Anthroposophist myself, I shall tmd an yet to remember his earlier incarnations. But now we have come early opportunity, with the forces remaining to me after death, toto the point when man has developed a feeling for his ego, and the prove helpful to these souls \"\u2014provided the living link we haveforces are unfolding which will make it necessary in our coming spoken of is there. And because the interval between death and incarnations to remember those that have gone before. The days ' rebirth is becoming shorter, these souls, too, will have the oppo^-are drawing near when people will feel bound to admit: \" We have tunity of absorbing the Mystery-truths that must be absorbed it strange glimpses into the past, when we were already on the earth torment is to be avoided in men's coming incarnations. All is not.,but living in another bodily form. We look back and have to say yet lost.that we were already then on earth.\" And among the faculties We have, therefore, to look upon Anthroposophy as a real appearing more and more in human beings will be one which power; while on the other hand we must not be unduly grieved orarouses the feeling: It can oidy be that I am looking back on earlier pessimistic about the matter. It would be mistaken optimism to incarnations of my own. say: \"If that is how things are, I need not accept the truths of Just think how in the human souls now on earth the inner force Spiritual Science till my next incarnation\" If everyone were to say is already arising which will enable them, in their next incarnations, that, when gradually the next incarnations come, there would be to look back and to recognise themselves. But for those who have too few opportunities for effective aid to be given. Even if thosenot become familiar with the idea of re-incamation this looking wishing for Anthroposophy can now receive its truths from onlyback will be a veritable torment. Ignorance of the mysteries of quite a few people, the situation will be different for the countless repeated earthly lives will be actually painful for these human hosts of those who, in a comparatively short time, will be eagerlybeings; forces in them are striving to rise and bear witness to turning to Anthroposophy . A countless number of Anthroposophi^searlier times, but this cannot happen because all knowledge of these will then be needed to make these truths known, either here on theforces is refused. Not to learn of the truths now being proclaimed physical plane, or\u2014if they are not incarnated\u2014from higher planes, through Spiritual Science does not mean neglecting\u2014let us say\u2014 That is one thing we must learn from the whole chararter ofmere theories; it is on the way to making a torment of life in the great change now taking place. The other is that all this hasfuture incarnations. In these times of transition, accordingly, to be experienced by the ego so that it should rely in^easingly something is happening; the slow preparation for it can be gathered upon itself, becoming more and more independent. The self-from our second Mystery Play, \" The Soul's Probation,\" where we reliance of the ego must come for all souls; but it will mean disasterare shown earlier incarnations of the characters portrayed\u2014in- for those who make no effort to leam about the great ^iritual carnations of only a few centuries before. The event was then truths, for the increasing individualism will be felt by them as already in preparation; and now, thanks to the wisdom of cosmic isolation. On the other hand, those who have made themselves guidance, human beings will be given positive opportunities of familiar with the deep mysteries of the spiritual world will therebymaking themselves familiar with the truths of the Mysteries. nd a way to forge ever stronger spiritual bonds be^een souls.At present comparatively few nd their way to Spiritual Science; Old bonds will be loosened, new ones formed. All this is immment, their number is modest compared with that of the rest of mankind. but it will be gradual. I t m a y b e s a i d t h a t i n t e r e s t i n A n t h r o p o s o p h y i s n o t y e t v e r y w i d e - * spread. But, in our age, the law otf re-incamation is such thatthose now going through the world apathetically, ignoring what , living at present in the Mth post-Atlante^ period,experience can tell about the need for exploring the riddles of life, will be followed by a sixth and then by a seventh, when awill incarnate again in a relatively short time, and thus have ample catastrophe will come upon us, just a\u00ae o\"\u00ae between the opportunity for absorbing the tmths of Spiritual Science. That is Atlantean and post-Atlantean periods. When the lectmes on thehow it stands. So that when perhaps we see around us people we Ap^alypse were given here m Nuremberg, you heard a descriptum esteem, people we love, who will have nothing to do with Anthro catastrophe, of how it will resemble and how it will posophy, are even hostile towards it, we ought not to take it too \u00ae^\u00ae Atlantis.much to heart. It is perfectly true, and should be realised by observe life around us, we might express the particular Anthroposophists, that refusing to look into Spiritual Science or feature of our age in this way: The most active element in human Anthroposophy, means preparing a life of torment for future beings to-day is their intellectualism, their intellectual conception 20 21of the world. We are living altogether in an age of intellectualism. It has been brought about through quite special circumstances, and we shall come to understand these if we look back to the time before our present fth post-Atlantean culture-epoch, the Greco- Latin, as it is called. That was the remarkable period when human beings had not reached their present state of detachment from the outer manifestations of nature and knowledge of the world. But at the same time it was the epoch in which the ego descended among men. The Christ-event had also to happen in that epoch, because, with Him, the ego made its descent in a special way. What then is our present experience? It is not just of the entering-in of the ego; we now experience how one of our sheaths casts a kind of reflection upon the soul. The sheath to which yesterday we gave the name of \" faith^body\" throws its reflection on to the human soul, in this fth epoch. Thus it is a feature of present-day man that he has something in his soul which is, as it were, a reflection of the nature of faith of the astral body. In the sixth post-Atlantean epoch there will be a reflection within man of the love-nature of the etheric body, and in the seventh, before the great catastrophe, the reflection of the nature of hope of the physical body. For those who have heard lectures I am giving in various places just now, I would note that these gradual happenings have been described from a different point of view both in Munich and in Stuttgart; the theme, however, is always the same. What is now being portrayed in connection with the three great human forces, Faith, Love, Hope, was there represented in direct relation to the elements in a man*s life of soul; but it is all the same thing. I have done this intentionally, so that Anthroposophists may grow accustomed to get the gist of a matter without strict adherence to special words. When we realise that things can be described from many different sides, we shall no longer pin so much faith on words but focus our efforts on the matter itself, knowing that any description amounts only to an approximation of the whole truth.This adherence to the original words is the last thing that can help us to get to the heart of a matter. The one helpful means is to harmonise what has been said in successive epochs, just as we learn about a tree by studying it not from one direction only but from many different assets. Thus at present it is essentially the force of faith of the astral body which, shining into the soul, is characteristic of our time.Someone might say: \"That is rather strange. You are telling us now that the ruling force of the age is faith. We might admit this in the case of those who hold to old beliefs, but to-day so many people are too mature for that, and they look down on such oldbeliefs as belonging to the childish stage of human evolution.\" It may well be that people who say they are monists believe they donot believe, but actually they are more ready to do so than those calling themselves believers. For, though monists are not conscious of it, all that we see in the various forms of monism is belief of the blindest kind, believed by the monists to be knowledge. We cannot describe their doings at all without mentioning belief. And, apart from the belief of those who believe they do not believe, wend that, strictly speaking, an endless amount of what is most important to-day is connected with the reflection the ^astral bodythrows into the soul, giving it thereby the character of ardent faith. We have only to call to mind lives of the great men of our age, Richard Wagner's for example, and how even as an artist he was rising all his life to a denite faith; it is fascinating to watch this in the development of his personality. Everywhere we look to-day, the lights and shadows can be interpreted as the reflection of faith in what we may call the ego-soul of man. * Our age will be followed by one in which the need for love will cast its light. Love in the sixth culture-epoch will show itself in a very different form-different even from that which can be called Christian love. Slowly we draw nearer to that epoch; and by making those in the Anthroposophical Movement familiar withthe mysteries of the cosmos, with the nature of the various indi vidualities both on the physical plane and on the higher planes, we try to kindle love for everything in existence. This is not done somuch by talking of love, as by feeling that what is able to kindle love in the soul is prepared for the sixth epoch by Anthroposophy. Through Anthroposophy the forces of love are specially arousedin the whole human soul, and that is prepared which a man needs for gradually acquiring a true understanding of the Mystery of Golgotha. For it is indeed true that the Mystery of Golgotha came to pass; and the Gospels have evoked something which yesterday was likened to how children learn to speak. But the deepest lesson\u2014the mission of earthly love in its connection with the Mystery of Golgotha\u2014has not yet been grasped. Full under standing of this will be possible only in the sixth post-Atlantean culture-epoch, when people grow to realise more and more that the foundations for it are actually within them, and out of their innermost being\u2014in other words, out of love\u2014do what should be done Then the guidance of the Commandments will have been outlived and the stage reached that is described in Goethe's words: \"Duty\u2014when one loves the commands one gives to oneself.\"When forces wake in our souls which impel us to do what we should through love alone, we then discover in us something that must gradually become widespread in the sixth culture-epoch. Then in a man's nature quite special forces of the etheric body will make themselves known. To understand what it is that must come about increasingly in 22 23this way, we have to consider it from two sides. One side has certainly not come yet and is only dreamt of fcy the most advanced in spirit; it is a well-dened relation between custom, morals, ethics and the understanding, intellectuality. To-day a man may be to a certain extent a rascal, yet at the same time intelligent and clever. He may even use his very cleverness to further his knavery. At present it is not required of people to combine their intelligence with an equals degree of morality. To all that we have been anticipating for the future this must be added\u2014that as we advance, it will no longer be possible for these two qualities of the human soul to be kept apart, or to exist in unequal measure. A man who, according to the reckoning-up of his previous incarnation, has become particularly intelligent without being moral, will in his new incarnation possess only a stunted intelligence. Thus, to have equal amounts of intelligence and morality in future incarnations he will be obliged, as a consequence of universal cosmic law, to enter his new incarnation with an intelligence that is crippled, so that immorality and stupidity coincide. For immorality has a crippling effect upon intelligence. In other words, we are approach ing the age when morality and what has now been described forthe sixth post-Atlantean epoch as the shining into the ego-soul of the love-forces of the etheric body, point essentially to forces having to do with harmonising those of intelligence and morality. That is the one side to be considered. The other side is this\u2014^that it is solely through harmony of this kind, between morality, custom, and intelligence, that the whole depth of the Mystery of Golgotha is to be grasped. This will comeabout only through the individuality who before Christ-Jesus came to earth prepared men for that Mystery, developing in his successive incarnations ever greater powers as teacher of the greatest of all earthly events This individuality, whom in his rank as Bodhisatva we call the successor of Gautama Buddha, was incarnated in the personality living about a hundred years before Christ under the name of Jeshu ben Pandira. Among his many students was one who had at that time already, in a certain sense, written down a prophetic version of the Matthew Gospel, and this, after the Mystery of Golgotha had been enacted, needed only to be given a new form. There have been, and will continue to be, frequent incorpora tions of the individuality who appeared as Jeshu ben Pandira, until he rises from the rank of Bodhisatva to that of Buddha. According to our reckoning of time this will be in aibout 3,000 years, when a sufcient number of people will possess the above-mentioned faculties, and when, in the course of a remarkable incarnation of the individual who was once Jeshu ben Pandira, this great teacher of mankind will have become able to act as interpreter of the Mystery of Golgotha in a very different way from what is possible to-day. It is true that even to-day a seer into the supersensibleworlds can gain some idea of what is to happen then; but the ordinary earthly organisation of man cannot yet provide a physical body capable of doing what that teacher will be able to do approximately 3,000 years hence. There is, as yet, no human language through which verbal teaching could exert the magicaleffects that will spring from the words of that great teacher of humanity. His words will flow directly to men's hearts, into theirsouls, like a healing medicine; nothing in those words will be merely theoretical. At the same time the teaching will contain to an extent far greater than it is possible to conceive to-day\u2014a magical moral force carrying to hearts and souls a full convictionof the eternal, deeply signicant brotherhood of intellect and morality. This great teacher, who will be able to give to nien ripe for it the profoundest instruction concerning the nature of the Mystery of Golgotha, will fulfil what Oriental prophets have always said\u2014 that the true successor of Buddha would be, for all mankind, the greatest teacher of the good. For that reason he has been calledin oriental tradition the Maitreya Buddha. His t^k will be to enlighten human beings concerning the Mystery of Golgotha, andfor this he will draw ideas and words of the deepest signicance from the very language he will' use. No human language to-daycan evoke any conception of it. His words will imprint into men s souls directly, magically, the nature of the Mystery Golgotha. Hence in this connection also we are approaching what we may call the future moral age of man; in a certain sense we could designate it as a coming Golden Age. Even to-day, however, speaking from the ground of Anthro- posophy , we point in full consciousness to what is destined tocome aibout\u2014how the Christ will gradually reveal Himself to ever- higher powers in human beings, ,and how the teachers, who up tonow have taught only individual peoples and individual men, will become the interpreters of the great Christ-event for all who are willi'ng to listen. And we can point out how, through the dawning of the age of love, conditions for the age of morality are prepared. Then will come the last epoch, during which human souls will receive the reflection of what we call hope; when, strengthened through the force flawing from the Mystery of Golgotha and fromthe age of morality , men will take into themselves forces of hope. This is the most important gift they need tn order to face the next catastrophe and to begin a new life, just as was done in this present post-Atlantean a^e. When in the nal post-Atlantean epoch our external culture, with its tendency to calculation, will have come to a climax, bringing no feeling of satisfaction, but leaving those who have not developed the spiritual within them to confront their culture in utter desolation\u2014then out of spirituality the seed of hope will be 24 25sown, and in the next period of human evolution this will grow to maturity. If the spirit is denied all possibility of imparting to men's souls what it can give, and what the Anthroposophical Movement has the will to coinvey, this external culture might for a short while be able to hold its own. Ultimately, however, people would ask themselves what they had gained and say: \"We have wireless installations\u2014^undreamt of by our ancestors\u2014^to transmit our thoughts all over the earth, and what good does it do us? The most trivial, unproductive thoughts are sent hither and thither, and human ingenuity has to be strained to the utmost to enable us to transport from some far distant region, by means of all kinds of perfected appliances, something for us to eat; or to travel at high speeds round the globe. But in our heads there is nothing worth sending from place to place, for our thoughts are cheerless; more over, since we have had our present means of communication, they have become even more cheerless than when they were conveyed in the old snail-like fashion.\" In short, despair and desolation are all that our civilisation can spread over the earth. But, in the last culture-epoch, souls whohave accepted the spiritual in life will have become enriched, as if on the ruins of the external life of culture. Their surety that this acceptance of the spiritual has not been in vain will be the strongforce of hope within them\u2014hope that after a great catastrophe a new age will come for human beings, when there will appear in extemd life, in a new culture, what has already been prepared spiritually within the soul. Thus, if we permeate our whole being with Spiritual Science, we advance step by step, in full consciousness, from our age of faith, through the age of love and that of hope, to what we can see approaching us as the highest, truest, most beautiful, of all human souls.

I write thinking of his many friends, some of whom have asked for a biography, but perhaps more of those who know little of the history and geography of the Anthro posophical Movement, to which so great a part of his life was devoted, believing that it is those who come with the forces of the future in their souls, who will carry on his work; for he, like Rudolf Steiner, was born, as the saying goes, \" before his time.\" His friends were a multitude, many distinguished, many quite unknown. They all contributed to the many-coloured tapestry of his life, so I refrain from mentioning names wherever possible. George Adams von Kaufmann was born on February 8, 1894, not, like his sister, in Australia, but soon after his parents had movedto Maryampol in eastern Galicia. the part of Poland which belonged to the old Hapsburg Monarchy. It was a Slavonic region on the frontier of which Rudolf Steiner was born and lived as a child. Very soon the family settled in the village of Solotwina, near thelittle Ruthenian or Ukrainian town of Stanislawbw in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, where his father was an early pioneer in the oil industry. Solotwina remained the family home until towards the end of the second World War when, shortly before his father's death, the country was overrun by the Russians. His father, George von Kaufmann, came from a German family on the paternal side; his father had been the Hanoverian consul in Melbourne. His mother was from a well-established Birmingham family named Adams, living in Edgbaston. His father had marriedthis young English girl and, full of adventurous spirit, had carried her off with him to Australia and thence to Poland. Von Kaufmann was a virile, masterful man, of a very practical nature. He had an active choleric will, which in his zeal could be ruthless and even cruel. At the same time he was an ideaUst and a deeply religious man, and had above all a great regard for the philosophy he found expressed in the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson.The marriage came to grief when George was about 2^ years old. The young wife was childlike and poetic and quite unpractical. Full of love towards her children, she delighted with them in the * Translation by George Adams: \" When science reaches maturity of knowledge, religion will again have vital power.\" 27flowers and the birds, but was untted to run the kind of household in a foreign land required by her husband. She was very unhappy, and in the end he sent her back to England, closing his mind to any attempts at reconciliation. George and his sister Kate, and a baby boy who then died, were deprived of their mother, who completely disappeared from their lives until, as a grown man, George found her again in England in the 1930's, a few years before she died. Von Kaufmann married a second time\u2014a gay and spirited young German girl. \"Solotwina Mother\", as she came to be called, together with her own boy,* who was born when George was seven years old, brought a strong and beautiful German element into the home, surrounding the two older children too with care and love, enriching their lives with the width of her personality. Their father was proud of his British nationality and wished the children to be educated accordingly; English was the language mainly spoken at home. George learned some German as he went along, which he perfected later on; Ruthenian he heard all about him, picking up enough to understand the dialect of the peasants; Polish also, but he only learned it thoroughly when in England during the second World War he worked as an interpreter. Hehimself attributed the easy mobility and versatility in the realm of language, with which in later life he mastered many languages, including Russian, to his early upbringing in these Slavonic parts, where, as he said, he breathed in the atmosphere of a land which through the prevailing social relationships was permeated with the forces of various languages and dialects but not bound to any one in particular. It is, however, signicant for his life that in all this variation of the spoken word which surrounded the little boy, it was through English above all that the creative, formative processes of language came to him. A series of English governesses looked after the education of the two older children until, when George was eleven years old, his father took him to England and, looking for a good, non-conformist education for his son, nally settled him in Mill Hill School. As a little boy George was shy and very melancholy; sadness or hard words quickly moved him to tears. His sister tells of how in their childhood games and quarrels he would use his sts in retaliation, but was never the aggressor. Small and slight of build, with a large head and great round eyes, he looked out on the world around him and dreamed his way into it. He experienced the comings and goings of a hospitable household, with wide interests and international business connections, and also the simple life of the Ruthenian villages\u2014a life deeply rooted in the soil. Through his father, the boy must have seen the effects of a * Augustus WilKam von Kaufmann, who changed his name to Mann. He joined the Rudolf Steiner educational movement in its early beginnings in England and continues to work at Michael Hall School in Sussex.determined and creative will upon a sleeping land and its under nourished population, where all the work was still done by hand or with primitive methods. Though afraid of his choleric father, who often lost his temper, he loved and respected him, admiring his adventurous, pioneering spirit. There were the never-to-;be-forgotten drives in the sleigh, wrap ped in furs, through the glistening, snowbound countryside, perhaps to the distant town, where the eastern Jewish shopkeepers, bearded and ringletted, plied their trades among the Ruthenian peasantry. At other seasons the drives would be in the carriage or buggy over indescribably rough roads, where it might be necessary to ford a river so deep that with the cracking of the whip the horses would be urged through the rising water and the passengers would have to hold their feet high up out of the stream. The rivers and streams, and the various ways of crossing them, either by fording or often when on foot by balancing along a log bridge high above the torrent with only a thin wire or not even that to hold on to, remained as a vivid memory in later life. At such times, or when he w-as allowed to drive the horses himself, the boy was glad to show his father that he had no fear. Even in quite recent years George Adams would ford a mountain stream, bare footed, with a heavily laden rucksack, over stones and shingle, leaping from rock to rock and balancing with surprising strengthand skill against the force of the flowing water. His love of walking barefoot, which he often did for hours in his beloved mountains, remained with him all his life. He loved to feel the earth under his feet, which were hardened to its touch, and to experience them as sense-organs which found their way , even inthe dark, over the earthy paths. Even as a very little boy George was passionately fond of natural things. His sister tells of the little collections he would make of rocks and stones and flowers and little things he found. He loved to wander for hours, not understanding why he should come home for meals, in the beautiful Carpathian country, a land of light and birchtrees, and on the nearby mountains' great virgin pine forests. Wild flowers abounded in summer and hard frosts and sunlit snow in winter, with the streams now rushing in torrents, now trickling in the sunburnt sand. There was a day when as quite a little boy he had been allowed to go off alone in the snowand was later found exhausted and half-conscious and brought home. His father encouraged independent undertakings. Often in later life he would walk or climb to the limit of his endurance in his eagerness to reach the many summits or cover the many miles he had set before him. By preference he would alwaysleave the path and strike across open country , meeting each obstacle as he came to it. To follow him up a mountainside, scrambling from rock to rock, from slope to slope, pushing up through the undergrowth and at last reaching the summit, was to climb a 28 29mountain the hard way. And then to go down behind him, to see the amazing speed at-which he would run down a steep mountain side at the end of a long day, was an experience in itself. He had a great friend in his sturdy, surefooted mountain pony. They would struggle up through the forest to where, on the heights,the trees gave way to great boulder-strewn open spaces; it was as though a great giant had been at play. The rocks were coveredwith a beautiful, brilliant greenish lichen. It was wonderful to lie on the rocks in the warm sun, perhaps to camp there or simply bivouac for the night and watch the marmots and the mountain goats. Wolves too were not unknown in those mountains, and the wild boar, but they rarely came near a man. Sometimes from afar he would hear the sound of singing\u2014am a n ' s v o i c e s i n g i n g a R u t h e n i a n p e a s a n t s o n g w i t h a s t u r d y r h y t h m . Describing it years later, he would sing it too, with wonderfulenthusiasm. The singer was the overseer , directing drilling opera tions from the derrick at the oil-well. Perched above the borehole he could see the men heaving together at the great wooden beam of the primitive drilling mechanism, and he controlled the rhythmand speed of their movement by the rhythm of the song! George remembered too the disastrous moments, when the flow of oil was not to be contain^, when in a mighty upward surge it carried derrick and gear with it into the air and might continue to flow for days before being controlled. Such were the experiences of man's life on Earth which came to meet the child born into a country at the threshold of East and West. In later life he was unceasingly thankful for the forces he received in childhood, which he felt he retained to a very great degree, giving him the particular quality of strength he needed forhis life. It was to be a life of sustained striving, inspired by vigorous spiritual ideals; it rarely took the easy way , always striking away from the accepted, orthodox paths, and often meeting with a great lack of understanding. Rarely did he speak of the obstacleswith which his path was beset, but always, with deep thankfulness, of the great goodness and wonder of life. Until the turn of war made it impossible, he often returned to this land of his childhood, and for the whole of his life it was to the majesty of the high mountains to which he returned for a renewal of strength in body and soul. Poised as he was, as a man, in a body of exceptional beauty and stature, with a springing, resilient gait, it was the open, childlike countenance, beaming with pleasure and love, over which would come the stern, sad look ofthe spirit who has touched eternity, which spoke to the hearts of so many men and women and endeared him to them.At public school, George was unhappy . Intelligent and quickto learn, he was well above the average intellectually; physically hewas slow and he developed late. He disliked the compulsory 30CLENT. SUMMER 1956 F r o m a m a p f h o i b y T h e o d o r S c l m e i i k .organised games inlenseiy and was not athletic. He was consciousof his large head and small body and he suffered pder the tendency to brutality of the English public school\u00bb with its fagging system. As a cadet he was a very good shot. There were highlights apart from his intellectual successes, such as shooting for the School at Bisley , or when once, in a eld with a master and a group of boys, they were surprised by an attacking bull, and little von Kaufmannheld a rearguard action while the rest scrambled to safety, and then he saved himself, too. Almost every holiday, even at Christmas and Easter, he returned home to Poland alone\u2014more than two days and two nights by train across Europe\u2014which he greatly enjoyed. The further east, the more primitive the journey became, until, after the last stage through the Polish country, crowded among the local peasants and the Jews in the wooden compartment with seats all round the walls and an extraordinary profusion of luggage and farm produce, children and animals, in the central space, he would be met by his father at the little station. Then would come the joy of riding, per haps on horseback, perhaps with the family in the carriage or inthe sleigh, the last three hours or so of the long journey , enjoying the familiar smell of the horses and the welcoming countryside. His father was glad to recognise his son's outstanding mental ability, but was often very impatient with him, for in practical mat ters he was slow and sometimes awkward. A story he liked to tell, never minding to bring the laugh upon himsel when as a little boy he was eating the local peasant bread which had large holes in it, his father teased, \" Don't eat the holes, Georgie, they're bad for you!\" And little George puzzled long and often over the problem of how to eat the bread without eating the holes! This childlike picture was typical of the man. He always took things and peopleat their face value, with no ulterior thoughts or motives; he looked honestly at all the facts as he saw them, believing only what he could see for himself; and he was never at home with satire. It was one of the qualities which made him such a sound scientic thinker. CAMBRIDGE From Mill Hill School he won a scholarship to Cambridge, and in 1912 went up to Christ's College to read Chemistry. Here he was in his element. His great eagerness for knowledge and his wide interests in life were satised. He used the opportunities to the full and led an active social life as well as a studious one, making many contacts with his fellow human beings towards whom lie had always an abounding sense of love. He came to be known as one of the most capable thinkers in Cambridge at that time and gained an honours degree in the science tripos, staying up to do research in chemistry. At Cambridge the two great themes which were to be the underlying motives for his life came to meet him and began to take 31 GB\u20143shape in his mind: 'the social problems of our time, and the spiritualrenewal of a one-sidedly materialistic science. He plunged deeply into the world of social reform, of social ethics, and freedom erf thought and expression, and was active in the pacist movement during the rst World War. Knowing all men as equals before God and always respecting the right of the other man to his own opinions and beliefs, he experienced acutely the evils of class distinction, coupled with capitalism, with its restrictive tendency to rule by domination and to hold back the growing urge for the recognition of individual human rights. Hewas really, as he put it himself, a few days before he died, a militant revolutionary. In his studies at the University his attention became focussed on the need to overcome monism in scientic thinking. He saw the deeply rooted monism in science to be its strength, stemming from the belief that the whole universe must be explicable on a simple principle\u2014that of the atom\u2014pervading all things. He admired the tenacity and perseverance in research in modern science and the integrity of scientic thinking. But he saw that science, having found in one form of thought the key to a wide range of phenomena, was tending more and more to erect this thought-form into a principle to which all other scientic thoughts must conform. Deeply as he respected all his life what he regarded as an essentially spiritual striving, he was already conrmed in the belief that theuniverse is not only one, but manifold, and that the forms of thought which underlay the science of his time were insufcient to compass the living whole. As he often said later, if bound to one type of fundamental thought-form\u2014the analytical one, leading to the atom \u2014we lose the faculty of looking at other aspects of nature with fresh, childlike vision, and of discerning in the language of phenomena other ideas, and other forms of wisdom. Seeking along new paths and inspired especially by the works of A. N. Whitehead among others, he was helped by a number of his contemporaries, among them Bertrand Russell, and the mathematician G. H. Hardy, whom he once described as \" a poet of pure mathematics\". He was led to change his syllabus in mid-stream to include a certain amount of mathematics. For this he was always grateful, because he came to see that essential to, and stillmore basic than, the necessary fundamental changes in the mathe matical approach to phenomena which were already taking place\u2014 including, for instance, the work of Einstein\u2014were the new thought-forms to be derived from the school of geometry variously known as projective geometry , modern (as distinct from ancient) synthetic geometry, or, as it was called among nineteenth-century writers, the \" geometry of position.'* Dating back to the seventeenth century, modern geometry flowered in the early nineteenth century through the work of French 32geometricians: Poncelet, Gergonne, Michel Chasles and Staudt in Germany; Cayley, Sylvester and W. K. Clifford in England, to mention but a few of the brilliant thinkers all over Europe to whom, as a child of its time, projective geometry was born. This geometry does^not take its start from the forms of thought which were hitherto regarded as the rst essential of all spatial notions, namely those of length and of the right angle, upon which are based the cubical forms fundamental to the architecture -of earthly space. In the new geometry these concepts are not primary, but secondary; for it penetrates the space-creative process, appre hends \"space in becoming\", before it reaches the condition in which, so to speak, it \u2014 or its contents\u2014can be weighed and measured. The basic law in the new geometry, known as the \" Principle of Duality \" (as point is to plane, so is plane to point, with the straight line mediating in perfect balance between the two), admits of an original concept of all space and spatial processes, far deeper andmore potent than the old Euclidean concept, and comes near the realm of all-prevailing archetypes. Propounded, like most of contemporary mathematics, in a highlyabstract form and therefore unobserved by many even mathe matically gifted scholars, this geometry has remained rather hiddenand obscure; its signicance had not dawned. It has until now had comparatively little influence on scientic thinking generally, although the deep connection of projective geometry with mwhanicsis one of the main themes in the early work of A. N. TOitehead, notably in his Universal Algebra (Cambridge University Press, 1898). As we well know to-day, the immense attractions which for many reasons lay in the analjrtical eld have drawn scientic thought and'the resulting technical developments arising therefrom along one-sided and as such often questionable channels. To a soul, a thinker, poised as this one was, more lightly in the saddle of the intellect, ^in in the depths of his being rather to the spirit of movement than to that of form, and seeking with a re of idealism the harmony between the outer world of natural science and a fuller, more spiritual world of inner experience, there seemed to be in modern projective geometry a ground whereupon there stood for pure, disinterested thought a doorway open to other, more balanced modes of cognition. I quote from an article* written many years later a passage reflecting in his own words what mayhave been the quality of experience which at that time foreshadowed what for him was to come: \"To an imaginative mind the wisdom and beauty of the structural relations of space revealed at this level can be over- * Space and Counterspace: George Adams, M.A., in The Faithful Thinker, Centenary Essays on the Work and Thought of Rudolf Steiner (Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1961). 33whelming. I think in this connection Herbert Spencer came as near as he ever did to that feeling of abysmal awe and wonder which is the natural response of the human soul when face to face with the spiritual world. Spencer was even stunned by the reflection that before there was anything at all of the concrete sense- perceptible world, whether evolved or created, throughout all eternity the sublime truths and harmonies revealed by projective geometry must have been prevailing.\" He proceeds in this article to quote from Spencer's essay entitled \"Ultimate Questions\" {Facts and Comments, 1902): There is one aspect of the Great Enigma, to which little attention seems given, but which has of late years more frequently impressed me. . . . Perhaps the question may in later years be raised, as it has been in myself, by some of the more conspicuously marvellous truths,now grouj^ under the title of \"The Geometry of Position\". Many of these are so astounding that but for the presence of ocular proof they would be incredible; and by their marvellousness, as well as bytheir beauty, they serve, in some mdnds at least, to raise the unanswerable question\u2014How come there to exist among the parts of this seeminglystructureless vacancy we call Space, these strange relations? . . . Weare obliged to recognise these as having belonged to Space from all eternity. And then comes the thought of this universal matrix itself, antec^ng alike creation or evolution, whichever be assumed; andinnitely transcending iboth, alike in extent and duration; since both, ifconceived at all, must be conceived as having had beginnings, while Space had no beginning. ... Of late years the consciousness thatwithout origin or cause infinite Si\u00bbce has existed and must ever exist, produces in me a feeling from which I shrink. Such words echo the feelings experienced some years earlier by another modem thinker and expressed years later in his auto biography . In The Story of My Life Rudolf Steiner was to writeof the relief and wonder that dawned on his soul when as a youth he met the thought-forms of projective geometry , which unlocked for him the prison of a nite and rigid conception of space. Here was the realm in which George Kaufmann (in his republican spirit he soon discarded the \"von\") was to work for most of his life. At the outbreak of the rst World War in 1914, the student at Cambridge found himself thrown upon his own resources and for the duration of the war was cut off from his home in Poland. It was at this time that a friend in the Theosophical Movement put into his hands Rudolf Steiner's Occult Science, which he read right through during an unforgettable holiday by the sea. T o quote again his own words, written (in German) many years later: \"Thework impressed me because, contrary to other books I had read which came from the side of Theosophy, this book did not in any way attempt to keep in line with the accepted ideas of modern science; yet at every turn the author illumined the ground upon which he stood with complete scientic clarity. With this book one knew where one was and felt: the author experiences the 34scientic spirit from within, and respects it. All that was con nected with the spiritual content of the book\u2014it was the English edition, with a photograph of Rudolf Steiner sitting with clasped hands, looking the reader straight in the eyes, yet at the same time gazing far away into space\u2014^m^e an impression of timelessness upon me. It seemed to speak from beyond the bounds of all recountable time.\" It was at this time that George Kaunann was actively involved . in the idealistic struggle on behalf of pacism, which for him, with his British nationality and German name, took a very real form. He was in prison twice as a conscientious objector, and had to be removed from prison after hungerstrike. There was an occasion when, true to his own convictions, he walked out of a guardroom when no one happened to be looking, and lived for some time with friends\u2014as he said, \" out of sight, out of mind.\" It was in connec tion with the movement for conscientious objection that he met his friend, Mary Fox, who was a mennber of the Quakers. She was later to become his wife. THE MEETING WITH RUDOLF STEINER In 1916 he joined the \"Emerson Group\" in London of the Anthroposophical Society, and he took the rst opportunity afterthe war to visit Rudolf Steiner in Dornach, Switzerland. This was at the end erf September 1919. The immediate cause of his visit was his burning interest in Rudolf Steiner's ideas for social reform and concerning his book The Threefold Commonwealth. He has written (in German) at some length of this episode in his life in the article, \" Rudolf Steiner in England,\" contained in the book of collected recollections by students Rudolf waiting to meet Rudolf Steiner, he was allowed to help at the as yet primitive stages of the great wooden carving at which Rudolf Steiner in his spare time was working. This is a statue of the Christ\u2014the \"Representative of Man\"\u2014between Lucifer and Ahriman, the Devil of Light and the Lord of Darkness. As George Kaufmann stood on the scaffolding hacking the rough wood with mallet and chisel, Rudolf Steiner came up the steps to meet him and held out his hand. This was the encounter with the man to whose service the whole of the rest of his life was devoted; with and for him he went through great experiences and hard trials. From the rst he was struck by Rudolf Steiner's universality and many-sidedness. In the years to come he had many oppor tunities of experiencing the immense width of his personality; in the above-mentioned article he describe Rudolf Steiner as the * Translated in full as a special number of The Golden Blade, 1958. 35simple friend and adviser, and the Initiate from Timeless Realms.In private conversations he was a'ble to speak of personal difculties and ideals, questions concerning the great social struggle going on among mankind and also concerning his own scientic aspirations. He experienced the deep silence which shone from Rudolf Steiner's count^arice, the impression he gave of absolute quiet as he listened, so that it was as though all depended on oneself as to what one said and how one formulated it. And he knew the wonderful warmth and encouragement which came from Rudolf Steiner and, above all, .the way he left everything to the freedom of the individual. He describes how, at his own request, Rudolf Steiner gave him guidance on the spiritual path, and a morning and evening meditation based on the opening words of St. John's Gospel, which he said would be entirely within his own freedom to undertake. Other actions, he said, however much they may appear to be the result of a free decision, are nonetheless partially determined by one's destiny, whereas the meditation is theone entirely free deed in the course of the day. Concerning the career of scientic research upon which he was about to embark, George Kaufmann received from Rudolf Steiner conrmation and encouragement. Rudolf Steiner also emphasised the signicance of the thought-forms of projective geometry for science. But under the immediate impression of the war years and of the social breakdown in middle and eastern Europe, the social problems seemed of rst importance; in their rst and also in subsequent meetings Rudolf Steiner directed him at rst towards tasks in the social rather than, to begin with, in scientic elds. In later years he thought that this was probably because Rudolf Steiner saw the need in him of a greater spiritual maturity to counterbalance what might then have been a far too intellectual approach to the scientic quekions at his heart.Thus it was that for some years George Kaufmann's life took a turn which appeared to leave aside his scientic career. Early in 1920 he and Mary Fox were married in Berlin on their way to join the English and American Quakers in the Friends' War Relief organisation woi'king in Poland, wliere the population was suff^ingfrom hunger and typhus. In the autumn of 1920 they were both present at the opening of the First Goetheanum, the uniquely builtwooden building, intended to express in forms of art the cosmicWord speaking to men in our age, which had been erected duringthe war years under Rudolf Steiner's direction by many members of the warring nations. THE ANTHROPOSOPHICAL MOVEMENT In England, George Kaufmann joined with friends in the attempt to bring to life the ideas of the Threefold Commonwealth, which proposed to try to change the close interdependence of the three 36main spheres, the spiritual or cultural, the sphere of rights, and the sphere of economics. It was an effort which\u2014also in the hands of Rudolf Steiner on the Continent\u2014was destined to founder. From it remained, however, the educational movement of the Rudolf Steiner Schools, which has since grown world-wide, and in con nection with which\u2014^as well as the work in Curative Education\u2014 the name of Rudolf Steiner is known more than in any other context. From this time on, men from many countries and walks of life were coming to Rudolf Steiner for help and inspiration towards the change they felt to be urgently necessary in modem times in their various vocations, if life were to become more spiritual again, but in a truly modem sense. Thus there arose new ventures in art and science. Besides bringing new inspiratfon to all the artistic work, the work in social science, in education and curative education (the two should not be confus^ with one another), Rudolf Steiner gave indications and fostered new developments in medicine, agriculture, nutrition and in research generally into the realm of life. He always waited for the free initiative to come from those who soughtrenewal in their own specialized elds. On his own initiative, however, in an incredible zeal of untiring and continuous activity, he gave out more and more as time went on, the results of his own spiritual investigations as a seer into the worlds of the Spirit. Not spiritualism, nor indeed any \"ism\" unless made so by his followers,came from the word of Rudolf Steiner, but the Wisdom of Man and of the Universe\u2014\"Anthroposophia,\" as he came to call it, reluctantly having to give it a name\u2014the spiritual teachings embodied from the past in the many world-religions and reaching also to the far future, but now to be set in the context of our modern, scientically minded age. Into this great work, and in particular to the task of introducing it into England, George Kaufmann threw himself unstintingly. He had to experience his father's lack of understanding and distmst of the direction he was taking, even his actual hostility towards the work, disappointed as he was that his son should, as he thought, be throwing away the chances of a brilliant career. Towards the end of his life, however, before the second war parted them, his father became reconciled to his son's chosen way of life. In the fortunes\u2014or misfortunes\u2014of business, he was no longer well-to-do; George Kaufmann was forgoing a remunerative career, so fromthe early beginnings of his work for Rudolf Steiner he lived in very different nancial circumstances. He and Mary Kaufmann were always able to live in a simple, modest way , helped by the friends who wished to sustain them in their wholetime work for the Anthroposophical Movement.For Mary there began the long years of work as librarian and translator, devoted to.the needs of the many English friends who found their way into the Movement. George worked, now in 37England, now in Dornach where he spent a great deal of his time. Gipsy spirit as he always was, he was tied to no spot on earth and rarely had a home really his own. He will be remembered by thousands all over the world, a loved gure with his rucksack always on his back, even when dressed for lecturing, to carry perhaps a single book\u2014he loved to have his hands free. In the very early days in Dornach, brfore he enjoyed the continued hospitality of Ws friend. Dr. Vreede, he sometimes lived in a littlecave on the wooded hillsides aibove the Goetheanum, climbing back alone to his starry solitudes at night. Untiring and unceasing in his efforts, travelling, lecturing, inter preting, he was a moving spirit in the effort to help build up the anthroposophical work and the forms it should take in manycoimtries and particularly in England. Here it was that an outstanding feature of his whole life arose. He foimd a remarkable aptitude for interpreting Rudolf Steiner as he spoke or lectured. From aU accounts this must have been some thing quite out of the ordinary; he would stand up, so young a man, at intervals in a lecture divided into three parts, and repeat again in beautiful English and with the utmost devotion, almostword for word what Rudolf Steiner had just spoken in German in a lecture of vast spiritual content. He made a few pictorial notes of his own creation and for the rest relied on his prodigious memory and spoke with great vitality and condence. In all he interpreted about 110 lectures, besides many conferences and conversations. For him and for those present it was an unforgettable experience, and Rudolf Steiner never failed to express his great gratitude, for, as he once insisted, he knew this woi<k of interpreting to be a sacrifice\u2014''ein grosses Opfer'*\u2014on the part of the one who per formed it with such enthusiasm. T H E F O U N D AT I O N S T O N E During the night in which 1922 passed over into 1923 therecame the moment when he stood with many friends by Rudolf Steiner as they watched the First Goetheanum, the tremendous work of love, rise up in flames, to be totally destroyed as an earthly form. George Kaufmann witnessed Rudolf Steiner's undaunted courage and faith in the ultimate victory of the Spirit, as he went on with his work without a moment's break, redoubling his energies, while his inspiration grew. Then, at the end of that year, there came the planting of the Spirit for which the great building, with its Pentagon-Dodecahedronas foundation stone, had stood on Earth, into the social working together of men. Between 24th December 1923 and 1st January 1924 George Kaufmann was present in Dornach, with members of many nations, when Rudolf Steiner \"laid in the hearts of the mem bers\" the Foundation Stone of a new-formed AnthroposophicalSociety. On Easter Monday, a few months before, Rudolf Steiner had said: We have not to content ourselves with vaguely humanistic dreatnings, looking only for the unity in all things. ... It is essential for us human beings so to partake in the Worldnprocess that we experience the living passage from unity to trinity\u2014^from the One to the Three\u2014and then again from the Three to the One. For in achieving the faculty... to apprehend the archetypal Three\u2014die Urdreiheit\u2014^in all existence, we receive this into the prevailing mood and condition of our soul. We realise that all life is based on the activity and interplay of primaltrinities of being. . . . And then we have an inspiration\u2014an impelling force at once of Nature and of the Spirit\u2014to bring the threefold ordering into all life, the life we see and recognise around us and, too,the life which we ourselves bring forth in action. In the last resort it depends on the bringing-in of this Threefold Impulse, whether the forces of disintegration and decline in mankind's evolution can now be transmuted into forces of new life and resurrection. Upon this impulse Rudolf Steiner founded the Anthroposophical Society, and in his opening words, from which the following words are taken, he drew attention to it: To gjve the Anthroposophical Society a form such as the Anthro posophical Movement needs for its true cultivation, was the purpose ofthe Christmas Foundatdon Meeting at the Goetheanum. ... A Society of this kind can have no abstract guiding lines or statutes. Its real basis is already given: it is the insight into the spiritual world, which we ^11 Anthroposophia. In this a large number of human beings are nding content and inspiration for their ideals in spiritual life. The union in a society with others of like mind is what their souls are needing. For in the mutual give and take in spiritual matters, humanlife unfolds its truest essence. It is natural and right that those who want to make Anthroposophia an integral part of their life ^ould desire a Society through which to foster it Yet, rooted as it is in the knowledge that has been gained of the spiritual world, this is but the root. The branches and the leaves, the flowers and the fruits of Anthroposophia grow into every eld ofhuman Kfe and action. . . . Thus it begets a multitude of practical and vital tasks; but these can only nd their way into the wider circles of mankind if fostered and developed rst in a Socie^. The actual \" Laying of the Foundation Stone\" took place on Christmas morning, 1923. A Foundation Stone in an ideal and spiritual sense, the ground in which it was laid was the hearts and souls of those united in the Society; as Rudolf Steiner said, it was itself to be the mood and spirit springing of its own accord from the anthroposophical way of life. He gave it outer form and shape in a long verse or meditation, based on the Threefold nature of Man\u2014Head, Heart and Limbs\u2014in his relationship to the cosmic Trinity. It is the Foundation Stone of Wisdom, Love, and Deed. To quote Rudolf Steiner again: There could be perceived . . . and brought from the Spiritual Worlds while the dread storms of war were surging through the world . . . that Threefoldness of Man whereby throughout his being\u2014in spirit.soul and body\u2014.he can now call to life in a new form the \"Know thyself\" . . Man will perceive and comprehend this Trinity of Being and thus know himself: free individual Man within tiie wielding work of the Gods throughout the Cosmos, working as individual Man within the \"All-World-Being of Man\" for the World's future. Out of the signs of the present Tinie he will thus renew the word of the ancient Mysteries: \"Know thyself!\"* This epitomizes Rudolf Steiner's task in this incarnation, his new and original contribution in the renewal the Mysteries. Amid the Mystery Wisdom of all time was to be set in modern form the knowledge of Threefold Man. Qose to Rudolf Steiner in this task\u2014^not in the intimate way in which many of his followers were close to him, but in this, the essential spirit of his mission\u2014 stood the human being of whom we are now telling. This was during the three last years of Rudolf Steiner's life\u2014 when towards the end he was regularly giving four or ve lectures a day, besides personal interviews\u2014during which he was in England ve times and often for quite long periods. George Kaufmann had occasion to witness the direct way in which Rudotf Steiner spoke of spiritual things in England, where he experienced a * spiritualrealism ' among people who, having overcome their agnosticism or their spiritual pride, were ready to receive at its face value what the spiritual teacher had to tell, listening silently, without great need for discussion. The Britisher's feeling of himself as an individual, his capacity for extreme tolerance, even in the heat of a battle, and hischildlike receptivity for something new gave Rudolf Steiner the opportunity to make some of his most important revelations in England. He spoke in England, for instance, of the Celtic Mysteries, of the Mystery of the Archangel Michael, the renewal of the Mystery of Golgotha. From England he awaited the initiative ofmen and women who work directly out of a particular aspect of modem consciousness which he called the ' Consciousness or Spiritual Soul.' There came the great lecture cycles, under titles such as True and False Paths of Spiritual Investigation; Evolution of the World and Man; The Spiritual Ground of Education.In the above-mentioned article, \" Rudolf Steiner in England.\" insight is given into how Rudolf Steiner approached and what he expected from Great Britain, as distinct from what might arise for the future out of the forces of the continental countries. T H E S C I E N T I F I C T A S K Involved as George Kaufmann was in all this, he had not abandoned his scientic ideals. He heard Rudolf Steiner repeatedly and urgently calling for a new and active thinking, speaking of the needfor bridges to be built between spiritual and natural science and Ti. and the preceding quotations are from the little book entitledThe Foundation Stone, by George Adams (Anthroposophical Publishing Company, London, 1957).between the different sciences themselves, which were becoming more and more specialized and materialistic, remote from a rela tion to life. For instance, on one occasion he said it would be necessary to have qualied doctors of medicine, well-versed in higher mathema tics, for there were fundamental discoveries concerning the meta morphoses of the human organism, which would be attainable only by such combination. He also often referred to projective geomdtryas affording an excellent training for the required mobility of thinking. Again and again Rudolf Steiner brought mathematical and spatial concepts to bear in his descriptions of living matter and its behaviour, of the way in which living organisms are imbued with forces which work in an opposite way from the rigid, centric forces which prevail in the inorganic world\u2014the etheric or ethereal forces, or, as he called them, the sunlike forces, in contrast to those of earthly gravity.He described the Earth as a living organism, the plant life cover ing a given region opening like a kind of sense organ to the universe,as though the Earth were opening her eyes to the cosmic inuences in summer and withdrawing again in winter. The vegetative life expresses itself quite differently when exposed or not to the intensive working of the sun's rays, at one time unfolding into form and growing more complex, at another concentrating even into a point, becoming centred in itself, in seed or germ: We may describe this contrast truly as a law of nature ... In all this there is a quality of expansion and of contraction, or gathering into a centre. Here we begin to apprehend the relationships of space itself in a directly qualitative aspect. This is the very thing which we must practise in the development of our ideas, if we would make essential progress in this sphere.* In the medical handbook. Fundamentals of Therapy, by Rudolf Steiner and Dr. Ita Wegman, concerning the \" Phenomena of Life,\" it is described how living things have an altogether different orienta tion from those in the inorganic realm. Whereas the latter are entirely subject to the forces of gravity, radiating outward from the essence of material substance, in the phenomena of life the living substance appears to be lifted away from the gravitational eld, and is subject to forces working from without inward, from the periphery towards the relative centre: It is, indeed, only as a constituent of the Earth-body that any sub stance has the nature which chemistry discovers in it. And when it comes to life, it must cease to be a mere iportion of the earth; it leavesits community with the earth and is gathered up into the forces that rayinward to the earth from all sides\u2014from beyond the earthly realm. * The Relationship of the Different Realms of Science to Astronomv 1-18 Jan., 1921. 4041He describes these forces as being, not radial in quality, but planar rather than point-centred ones, coming in towards the Earth from all sides, working in interplay with the forces from the Earth, plastically moulding and interpenetrating the earth forms as they arise. S PA C E A N D C O U N T E R S PA C E He spoke not only of forces working in an opposite spatial man ner. but of an opposite kind of space, which he related to the Sun, saying that such a concept of space and its forces, added to and complementing the old concepts, was essential for a true under standing of all kinds of natural phenomena. Of the nature of the Sun and its forces, in polar relation to those of the Earth, he said that this will never he understood with the ideas derived from Cartesian Geometry and the three dimensions of space as we know them: You may conceive that the inside of -the Sun, as we are wont to call it, is of such nature that its phenomena are not driven from the centre outward but on the contrary .... that the processes go inward and, so to speak, gradually lose themselves towards the central point to which they tend, just as phenomena that issue from the Earth lose themselves outward in ei^nding spheres, into the wide expanse Only when we enter thus into the qualitative aspect, only when we we are prepared, in the widest sense of the word, to unfold a kind of qualitative mathematics, shall we make essential progress .... Here Ishould only like to add that there is a possibility, notably for pure nrathematioians, to nd the transition to a qualitative mathnnatics. Indeed this possibility exists in a high degree in our time. We need but consider Analytical Geometry with its manifold results in relation to Synthetic Geometry\u2014to the real inner experience of Projective Geometry. True, ithis will only give us the beginning, but it is a very, very good beginning. .. . Rudolf Steiner called this space of the Sun the Gegenraum or \"Counterspace\" and saw in it the source of those forces which bring vitality to the Earth. He called them, according to an older terminology, ether forces or etheric forces, or sometimes ethereal forces. The Sun-space is hollow\u2014empty physically but filled with light and life. The forces of space and counterspace are interwoven over the Earth, and in their interplay life comes into being. He urged the mathematicians and scientists among his audiences tomake every effort to come to grips with these scientic tasks, if the onesidedly materialistic phase of sdence is to be overcome. More over, he saw clearly that until such changes come about in scien tic thinking and in the forms of civilisation based upon it, mankind Will nd no solution to the social questions. To a mind imbued with the thought-forms of Projective Geometry, Rudolf Steiner's lectures, even the most profoundly esoteric of his communications, awaken thought again and again along these lines. What might otherwise be difcult to understand becomes easier with such thoughts at one's command, with a 42schooling in the laws of polarity and metamorphosis, and with conceptions which in all exactness contrast with rigid, self-con tained, and essentially centric forms and processes. Rudolf Steiner's meaning in those years was often obscure to his hearers, perhaps all the more when he held concentrated courses for scientically trained audiences. On one occasion, coming out of a lecture, George Kaufmann heard a colleague behind him say that it would be a hundred years before people would begin to understand what Rudolf Steiner was meaning. T owards the end of his life, he him self said to a colleague that the difculty did not lie in nding the answers', they were there in multitude in the new mathematics, but that the difficult thing was to ask the correct question of nature\u2014 a most characteristic utterance. On March 30, 1925, Rudolf Steiner died, leaving his followers shocked and disunited. There followed years of intense work, with many disappointments. When in England, George Kaufmanntravelled round, lecturing to groups, small and large, rejoicing in the warm and friendly hospitality he received in many homes and bringing to them unforgettable experiences. At Dornach he workedin the School of Spiritual Science, established there by Rudolf Steiner and led after his death by the ve remaining persons with whom, besides himself, he had created a * Vorstand,' or leading body of men and women: Albert Steffen, Marie Steiner, Dr. Elisabeth Vreede, Dr. Guenther Wachsmuth, and Dr. Ita Wegman. In 1932 George Kaufmann was elected a Member of the London Mathematical Society. He was a Member for life of the Chemical Society.It was particularly Dr. Elisabeth Vreede who supported and greatly encouraged George Kaufmann in his scientic work. In February/March, 1933, in the perodical Natura, published by theMedical Section at the Goetheanum, under the leadership of Dr . Ita Wegman, George Kaufmann rst published his essay Von dem aetherischen Raum (Raum and Gegenraum). It was followed shortly afterwards by an English translation.* It put forward for the rst time the theory of space and counterspace, based on modern projective geometry in the light of Spiritual Science. This is the preliminary statement of an entirely original contribution to scientic thinking; George Kaufmann's researches led him to believe that it had not hitherto been attempted. Some years later, and quite independently. Professor Louis Locher-Emst, of Winterthur and ofthe Goetheanum in Switzerland, undertook the same work and came to the same conclusions, set out however in a more axiomatic and mathematical form. * In the Quarterly Review \"Anthroposophy,\" Michaelmas and Christ mas, 1933, Physical and Ethereal Spaces by George Adams Kaufman, M.A. (Cantab.). Early in 1964 this article will be published as a booklet withillustrations by the Verkg Freies Geistesleben, Stuttgart, and it is hoped soon to republish the English translation. 43In 1933 there appeared in English the booklet entitled Space and the Light of Creation, and in 1934, published by the Mathe m a t i c a l - A s t r o n o m i c a l S e c t i o n a t t h e G o e t h e a n u m u n d e r t h e l e a d e r ship of Dr. Vreede, the voluminous work Strahlende Weltgestaltung. Synthetic Geometry in the light of Spiritual Science. It was to have been followed by a second volume containing the developed work on the theory of Physical and Ethereal Spaces; in fact, this did not appear until years later, and then in a quite different form. Indeed, this work fell at that time into the calamitous gap caused by the breaking asunder of Rudolf Steiner's followers after his death, which took nal effect in 1935. Two of the original Vorstand members. Dr. Wegman and Dr. Vreede, had to leave the Vorstand, and at the same time a number of members were excluded from the Society in Dornach, including George Kaufmann, whose militant spirit in the cause of tolerance and respect for the freedom of the individual led him into the forefront of the controversy. A great split divided the Movement in Dornach and spread in conse quence throughout the Societies of the various countries. George Kaufmann's work at the Goetheanum was dropped andhis book was never reviewed. His work being so far mainly expressed in the German language, its full signicance was not understood in England, even though it shone through the lectures and courses for which he was always so much in demand. In March, 1935, just before George Kaufmann returned from the nal disastrous meeting in Dornach, I came into the Movement. In these weeks the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain suffered the loss of its Chairman, D. N. Dunlop, a deeply spiritual leader and friend. He also was one who experience the com munity of all men, and in the obituary* George Kaufmann wroteof him at that time there shines through much that can also be said of his own destiny. In D. N. Dunlop's passing, he lost a valued friend. I, too, had had Occult Science put into my hand\u2014by the librarian I later knew to be Mary Kaufmann\u2014and had read it avidly, always with the feeling that I must read it as quickly as possible, in order to recall what I already knew. In a very short time I had met George Kaufmann and was working with him. He was for a brief period Secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain,and I had just completed a secretarial training in English, French and German, so it was naturally supposed that I was working as his secretary. In fact, I was helping him in certain concerns for the Movement with which he was then engaged, and very soon saw the eagerness with which at every possible moment he would turn to his scientic work. At once he began to teach me the truths of projective geometry, and I saw how fundamental these thought-forms were to the teach- * Our Community in Anthroposophical Movement. Vol. XII, No. 7.ings of Spiritual Science. Trained neither mathematically nof scientically, I had always loved geometry, and he taught me sys tematically through the years\u2014not algebraically, but pictorially, as was always his method\u2014^first projective geometry and then his fur ther development from it, the science of physical and ethereal spaces. I resolved to help him to develop this work further and tomake it more accessible to others. For the remaining 28 years of his life I worked with him in this task, to which more and more of his time was to be devoted. Untiringly he widened and deepened his access to Spiritual Science and continued to lecture and give courses generally. Among the titles of articles written at this time, the following show in what directions his spirit moved: The Mysteries of the Rose-Cross, Christ In the Power of Memory and In the Power of Love, Souls of the Nations, Christ and the Earth Now, at the end of his life, a great amount of material remains, as witness to his indefatigable labours\u2014geometrical models, files of notes, manuscripts which he did not think fit for publication\u2014 many beginnings, apart from his published works. It was his great concern towards the end of his life\u2014how much he had only begun and not been able to nish. He never tired of working, disliking to sit idle even for a few minutes, unless engaged in interesting con- vereation. Walking was always his relaxation; he passionately enjoyed good music, and loved a good lm, but if time and money permitted he would walk and climb in the high mountains, choos ing the granite. He kept abreast of the news and all the topical questions, otherwise he worked most of all day and almost every day; even on a holiday there would often be work or an accumula tion of correspondence. It was his life, and he loved it. He was at once the most serious and the most gay of companions. He would often burst into a sally of Ruthenian or Russian song, and his bois terous laugh was always just under the surface\u2014it competed with the sound of nailed shoes on the pavements which revealed the vigour of his stride. People would often look back, to take another look at the man. His long memory held an abundance of jokes; he loved fairy-tales and to repeat simple and obvious things as though at that moment they were quite new to him. T H E S E C O N D W A R In the pre-war years George Kaufmann was acutely aware of the disasters impending through the increasing growth of reaction ary and dictator governments, and he was appalled at the com promising and dilatory way in which the democratic countries, par ticularly the British, were dealing with the situation. At the outbreak of the second World War he volunteered for non-combatant military service and was sent\u2014^as Captain Kairfmann\u2014to Oldham, as interpreter in a war prisoner's camp. It was a refreshing experi ence, and this strangely serious and warm-hearted companion, with 44 45his uncompromising attention to the detail and spirit of his duties, evidently puzzled and endeared himself to the hard-headed Man chester business men who were his colleagues. A belated following up of his German connections led, however, after about six months,to his resigning his commission. It was as a result of this experi ence that in 19^ he changed his name to George Adams. He spent the rest of the >yar years in London, as monitor for the Polish overseas broadcasting service ^onsored by the B.B.C. At this period he learned several Slavonic languages all at the same time, as one would learn to master a theme with its variations, or the related keys in music. He made many interesting friends among his colleagues at Bush House, British and Slavonic. During the acute stages of the war he was active in Civil Defence, with regular hours on duty, when he would be called out at night into London's burning streets. He so much enjoyed the ready wit, the comrade ship, and the essentially human philosophy of his cockney colleagues.He kept in close touch with anthroposophical activities and con tinued throughout the duration of the war to read in London and elsewhere the Lessons of the Esoteric Class\u2014^lectures of the ' First Class of the School of Michael,' established by Rudolf Steiner\u2014the responsibility for and true conduct of which, in England, had been given to him by Dr. Wegman after Rudolf Steiner's death. He sus tained this work until three years before his death. THE PLANT BETWEEN SUN AND EARTH Amid all his many activities he still worked hard at his scienti c tasks. In fact, the war years gave him added opportunity, freed as he was from general anthroposophical lecturing. The B.B.C. required what amounted to only two days and a night each week, and he spent a great deal of time in the Reading Room of the British Museum\u2014a much-loved place of work throughout his life. Our collaboration continued. He was seeking a renewal of the thought-forms of chemistry and physics by applying the theory of physical and ethereal spaces, and working to develop this science further. He was held spellbound in his researches into thermos dynamics. Honest thinker as he was, he felt that his own academic training hindered as well as helped him. A number of times he tried to teach me the fundamentals of chemistry and physics; he even set up a small experimental laboratory at Rudolf Steiner House in London. But he was constantly held back in this eld, experiencing his own thinking still too tied to the accepted analytic^ concepts. For two years after the war we worked in a large room in Rudolf Steiner House, supported by a grant from the Anthropo sophical Society in Great Britain. At last the importance erf his scientic work was beginning to be recognised. During this time it transpired that the plant world was to be the central theme of our work. For years we had watched the plants, knowing that thesecret was there, but knowing also that there is no spiritual reality in superimposing a theory on the phenomenon. As followers of Rudolf Steiner's Goetheanistic methods, we knew that the phenomenon must reveal its secret, its underlying Idea, to the awakened eye. And so it was that one day in the spring of 1947, walking in Regent's Park past the freshly budding hedges, George Adams sud denly stopped and literally shouted at me,\" There it is! Of course itis an ethereal space!\" And he continued to describe in geometrical terms how the sprouting shoot\u2014the associated group of little planar leaves, or a single leaf, opening out conically from the growing point, becoming ever larger as they diminish in vitality\u2014is indeeda physical manifestation in living substance of a process which is really taking place in an ' ethereal space'\u2014in fact, in the space andwith the forces of the 'growing-point.' Such a 'point,' like a seed or a germinating embryo, is small physically , yet mighty ethereally! It was an exact analogy to the concept derived from higher mathe matics. From this moment the work on plants developed rapidly; each morning after sleep it had grown apace\u2014even as it is with the growing plant. We studied botany systematically . Very soon, oncethe key was given, we saw how in the polarity of root and shoot the lemniscatory process, which always arises in the interplay ^ forcesand forms of space and counterspace, was again and again being revealed through the gesture of the forms, as a process in the development of the higher plant. The wild plants taught the secret. It was the Dandelion which rst revealed itself as the embodi ment of a lemniscatory process. The gesture of its form\u2014roots piercing the dark soil radially, leaves enveloping with their outspread planes the sunlit hollows into which the flowers will grow; and between these two, at the transition from soil to light and air, the primal node or hypocotyl. This latter, even in the inner structure of the higher plant, is a crossing point at the changeover from root to shoot. T o understand this, one must know the lemniscate (or gure-of- eight curve) developing as the outcome of a functional process in continuous movement, taking place in an alternating rhythm of contraction and expansion between two opposite types of focus\u2014 indeed, between an earth-like and a sun-like focus. The same mathematical process will result in all manner of variation or meta morphosis of the original form. Projective geometry provides amuch more fundamental and qualitative approach to metamorphosis in the living kingdoms of nature than does the mere study and com parison of the nished forms, for it not only allows of a more qualitative understanding of the form itself, but also of the formative principles underlying it. Moreover, it suggests a quite new approach to the understanding of the behaviour of living substancein plant and animal. It inspires, for instance, the thought that per-haps in the space around a growing point, virgin substance\u2014sub stance which was not as yet earthly substance\u2014is, as it were, precipitated, growing forth into physical manifestation in the germinating centres. The Dandelion gives an almost ohild-like pictoe of the 'Sun' which shines within thpse hollow spaces. In truth, all life arises in the interplay of Sun-forces with the Earth.* It is, scientically, a daring pronouncement, requiring the courage of great conviction. But the discovery was made by one whose years of thinking in terms of polarity and metamorphosis had opened his eyes to other aspects of the gesture of natural forms. Without this it is hard for the would-ibe scientist to look with renewed insight, and it was a long and diflhcult task to bring this work into a t form for publication on an accepted scientic level. Always scientically sceptical, and a Strictly honest thinker, George Adams shrank from a too easy or imaginative description, even to help the reader over difcult mathematical passages. Through the very enthusiasm of the way he spoke, he was always able to carry his audiences with him, though as time went on he found it more and more difcult to set down in print the results of his so widely ranging researches. T H E G O E T H E A N S C I E N C E F O U N D AT I O N In 1947 George Adams moved to the Midlands of England. His friends there, Friedrich Geuter and Michael Wilson, brought this about; they were founders of the Suneld Children's Homes at Qent, near Birmingham, founded on Rudolf Steiner's indications for Curative Education. Michael Wilson had long been keenly interested in Goethean theories in science, particularly in optics and colour, and George Adams and he had often hoped that one day the chance might come to work together. The chance was given at the time of Mrs. Theodora Wilson's death. Michael Wilson had already been freed from some of the responsibility for the Homes, at Fried Geuter's suggestion. Now he, together with George Adams, formed a Trust: the Goethean Science Foundation, to support a new endeavour. For all these years we have inde^ been grateful for this Foundation, and for a wonderfully quiet place in which to live and work. A few monthslater Mary Adams left her beloved Library at Rudolf Steiner House and was invited as librarian to the Suneld Children's Homes, where she still works as a well-loved friend. At about this time George Adams took the opportunity which was offered to rejoin the Society in Dornach. This he did individually, as an expression of goodwill and of his determination to work with all friends wherethis was possible. In Clent the work on plants continued, becoming in fact a fur ther development of Goethe's Theory of the Metamorphosis of * See George Adams and Olive Whicher: The Plant between Sun and Earth, \u00a7\u00a7 16-30.Plants, together with some collaboration with Michael Wilson in researches in the eld of optics and the theory of colour. In these elds no work was published from our side, though many seeds lie dormant. It is beyond the scope of this article to deal in any measure with the results of George Adams' unceasing endeavours in various branches of science to direct scientic thinking into more spiritual channels. The work on the plant, published under our joint author ship, will speak for itself to the interested reader. In 1949 there appeared The Living Plant and the Science of Physical and Ethereal Spaces', in 1952 The Plant between Sun and Earth, with blaok and white and coloured illustrations; in 1960 in German a much fuller work. Die Pflanze in Raum and Gegenraum: Elemente einer neuen Morphologie, illustrated in black and white. A folder of coloured illustrations, already printed for this book but not included, is at the time of writing just appearing, entitled Pflanze, Sonne, Erde* It is accompanied by a short text, which it is hoped also to print in English. We worked closely together writing these books, both in the text and in the illustrations, sometimes sharing chapters. I helped to shorten and simplify his overlong manuscripts; he con trolled my too unscientic statements and put my German into shape, and there is very much of his work in the geometrical drawings.In 1951 George Adams visited America. From that year on ward we were often on the Continent, especially in Dornach, in connection with the work of the Natural Scientic and the Mathe matical Sections at the Goetheanum, and with the mathematician. Dr. Georg Unger who, in 1956, founded in Dornach the Mathema- tisch-Physikalisches Institut, of which George Adams was an enthusiastic supporter. He contributed to its journal t some of his fundamental researches into physics, notaibly in mechanics. We also collaiborated with Dr. Alex Leroi, of Arlesheim, in connection with his work on cancer research and treatment. T H E L A S T T A S K There remains only the brief word which can be written about what for George Adams was of the deepest concern and to which he devoted the last of his forces in this life. Arising out of the work with our friends on the Continent and in particular through our connection with Dr. Leroi, there came into being a research centre in the Black Forest, controlled by a small number of people who formed themselves into the Verein ir Bewegungsforschung *The books in English were published by the Goethean Science Foundation; those in German by the Verlag Freies Geistesleben, Stuttgart. Zielweg 34. into Movement). The main object in therst place is in connection with research into the true nature of water and its behaviour. George Adams' work is regarded by these friends to be essential to their work. Theodor Schwenk, who as a trained experimenter in hydrodynamics has for some years directed research in the laboratories of the Weleda in Germany, the Swiss pharmaceutical rm estaiblished under the guidance of Rudolf Reiner, leads the experimental work in the new Foundation, estab lished in 1961. Its sponsor is Dr. Hanns Voith, of the rm of Voith in Heidenheim. He rst met George Adams when as a young man he was interpreting for Rudolf Steiner in the First Goetheanum. Little or nothing can yet be said of this work, for it is in its beginnings and results wUl be published in due course. It was George Adams' life-long desire to see the new theories concerningthe forces of ^ace and counterspace put into practice technically . The aim in this particular aspect of the work is to nd methods of purifying and revitalizing exhausted and contaminated water, based not on chemical methods, but on an advanced development of the old method of allowing or causing water to move, so that it may purify itself. George Adams' work consists in nding ways of movement for water, taking into account not only its relation to gravity, but also its inherent anti-gravitational nature. To this end the theory of physical and ethereal spaces and forces is being used in experimental work. It was another courageous undertaking. In August, 1959, George Adams had suffered a serious coronaiy occlusion, from which he recovered unexpectedly well. (One of his activities, while lying in hospital for six weeks in Ripon, was to learn by heart all the verses in their sequence of Rudolf Steiner's Calendar of the Soul.) His illness changed the rhythm of his life, but the last three years were, more than any, full of achievement and promise. In 1961, the Rudolf Steiner Centenary year, his activities were redoubled and included three lectures to large audiences at the Goetheanum, in Stuttgart and London. We travelled back and forth between the Black Forest and England, more or less dividing our time between the two. George Adams' physical strength gradually lessened; his spiritual stature and his great inner vitality and unbounded love of life increased. Conserving his forces, he nevertheless worked very hard; he could never become an invaUd\u2014rather than that, he wanted to go on, even into the Beyond. THE SOCIAL QUESTION He was always grateful for whatever life brought, with all its setbacks and many trials, and above all for its hospitality towards him. He described how he experienced an inflow of vital, life-giv ing forces when enjoying the kind hospitality which was so oftenextended to him throughout life. \"Many beings!\" was a favouriteexclamation, accompanied perhaps with a great sigh, his head in his hands, which was always a sign of his overwhelming feeling of thankfulness. Many beings had indeed accompanied him through life. Few, if any, of his friends know how widely his ever positive and integrating influence extended among the human beings whose destiny it was to meet him. George Adams not only thought the Sun-spaces and Sun-activi ties, but he lived them; he tried to unite the worlds of the light and the worlds of the darkness and so nd the ultimate Balance. He was an intensely individual person and he had a great need to return to the silence of being quite alone; yet his love and sympathetic activity extended on all sides. Many have experienced how, when asked a question, he would sit silent for so long, but the answer, when it came, was gathered, as it were, from the whole realm out of which the question was asked; it did not spring from his own immediate reaction, from his own centre; and he never answered dogmatically. His counsel was much sought in committee, becausehe would come to decisions taking in the whole circle of possibili ties; weighing-up the situation, he would include also the point of view of those with whom he might have been in opposition, and he often helped to avoid the ego-to-ego clashes which arise from a too self-centred * point of view.' Imbued as he was with the kind of thinking and experiencing which comes from a spiritualised geometry and mathematics, his consciousness of the interweaving of planar forces, working towards a common goal, as weU as of earthly point-centres, tending to thrust out at one another, told him the real meaning of Brotherhood\u2014^^of the community where each stands as an individual, yet all are interwoven in the Whole. The time is past when kings rule by decree from a central throne. Neither, however, is it in the true spirit of our time for individual initiative to be levelled to a grey uniformity. In the forms of social life to be sought in the future, individuals must work side by side, yet achieving a common accord. United in the circle of their activity, they will work together in freedom, each vwth his own task, yet always conscious of the common bond. Such groups or communities will be really like * Sun-centres.' Just as Rudolf Steiner describes the Sun as receiving into itself the cosmic influ ences of the worlds of planets and stars, to pour it all forth again in bounty upon the Earth, so too will it be in the forming of social life among men. Like the tangents of a circle, interwoven with one another, the individualities forming a community\u2014such as a * Vor- stand' or a College of Teachers\u2014will form a 'Sun-centre,' and from the forces thus engendered, our social undertakings will flourish and grow. Our conception of Threefold Man will be more truly spiritual, and out of this will arise the understanding necessary for the building of a new social order, that of the Threefold Com monwealth. At the end of his life George Adams made the revision of a partialtranslation he had made in earlier years of Occult Science. Mary Adams helped him by translating the remaining two chapters. With her help, too, he published Verses and Meditations (Anthroposophi- cal Publishing Co., London) with an introduction and notes, Rudolf Steiner's original words being set side by side with a beautiful Eng lish rendering, their intention and use being explained in the intro duction in eloquent fashion. He often said how for his scientic work he needed to return again and again to the well-springs of Anthroposophia, and referred to the way Mary Adams had so often helped him by producing just at the right moment a word or a lecture or other reference. The long, cold winter of 1962-63 put an extra strain on his heart, including as it did three journeys to London in the bitterest of the weather. \" N O W T H E D A Y I S O V E R \" The last four weeks of his life were spent in Edgbaston, Birming ham, in the house of Dr. Lothar Marx and his family. Longing to regain his strength to return to the Continent, he was forced to rest. Active in spirit, he read a great deal and was planning for the future o f o u r s c i e n t i c w o r k . H e l e a r n e d o f t h e d e a t h o f G u e n t h e r Wachsmuth and concerned himself about the writing of a suitable tribute to him. Often gay and with his usual humour, he was how ever deeply concerned for our Movement and also for all that was going on in the world at large. On what proved to be his last afternoon, he was reading a lecture* in which Rudolf Steiner is saying that one of the most essential aspects of Spiritual Science will be the awakening of man to the knowledge that in his life of feeling and willing he is closely united with the world in which the so-call^ Dead are living, though in his present-day consciousness he is unaware of this in his thinking. In reality this world is around us, just as the chairs and tables of the physical world are around us when we are asleep, though we are not conscious of them. A time will come when for the understand ing of history on earth men will reckon with the forces of thosewho have passed through the Gate off Death and are in the life between Death and Rebirth. The knowledge of the united existence of all humanity in this way, he says, wiU give a new shade of mean ing to the whole of the cultural life of mankind in times to come. Commenting on Rudolf Steiner*s description of the way this con scious awareness could arise between an individual Soul on Earth and a Soul in the Spiritual World, George Adams said, \"Isn't it wonderful that this, too, is a lemniscatory process!\" He had to see his forces waning, particularly in the last two days. As so often in his life, in moments of fatigue he would rejoice in simple things. A children's hymn had come into his * Lecture III in Earthly Death and Cosmic Life, Berlin, 1918. 52mind; he had learned the words by heart and liked us to sing them softly together, when he did not sleep: Now the day is over. Night is drawing nigh; Shadows of the evening, Steal across the sky During the night, the last verse had just sounded into the silence that followed: Glory to the Father, Glory to the Son;And to Thee, blest Spirit, Whilst ail ages run. It was in the early hours of March 30, 1963, the anniversary of the day on which Rudolf Steiner died. The weight of his body fell from him; the wings of his Angel had borne him aloft to take him back to the Sun-spheres, from whence he will return with renewed forces to take up again his task on Earth. To quote his own words, written in 1953 in a Golden Blade article entitled The Threefold Structure of the World: \"So too the gate of death: when man looks out into the starry spaces, not as mere physical emptiness but as the ocean of the ethereal, he will relate himself in a quite different way to that future moment when his ethereal body will be released from physical anchorage and on the wings of the expanding ether he will sail forth again into the spiritual realm whence he came.\" * * * O thou who lived among us And as friend To every soul and creature, plant and stone Thy love of thought and heart and will outpoured; Go thou thy way in elds of Spirit-land, Climb thou the Heights thy striving Spirit scanned From this Earth's vantage-point.

Only by understanding the nature of this process, he said, could men hope to bring some order and harmony into human evolution. Otherwise, civilisation would stumble from one social catastrophe to another. The second world war was a further such catastrophe, and since then, mankind seems to have been balancing precariously on the brink of still greater disasters. Thus Rudolf Steiner's demand that we should understand contemporary events is more urgent than ever. Steiner sometimes summed up the essence of the situation by saying that humanity as a whole is beginning to \"cross theThreshold.\" (See e.g., 5-14 April, 1919).* It is a simple phrase for a very complex process.How is this process related to the turbulent events of our time ? In the last years of his life, Rudolf Steiner gave, not so much an answer to this question, as an indication of how to answer it. He created the vast carving now in the Goetheanum: the central Christ gure stands upright, holding Ahriman and Lucifer in a dynamic balance, as though to create a central space where the human individual can breathe the air of true freedom. Steiner also called the central gure \"The Representative of Humanity.\" The carving makes visible the spiritual ideal to which humanity must hold while crossing the Threshold. The essence of this ideal is the creation of a central realm where the human individual can stand upright and experience freedom, while the forces of Lucifer and Ahriman are held in balance. This realm can be sustained only with the help of the \"Sun of Christ\" (in the words of the Foundation Stone verse). It is a realm within the human soul\u2014but in the lectures cited above Steiner says that as humanity crosses the threshold, the soul will need the support of a corresponding balance in outer social forms.Behind many of the tumultuous events of to-day, one can discern a kind of battle swirling round this central realm, both within indi viduals and in society. In these same lectures, Rudolf Steiner describes the rst world war as a symptom of just such a strug^e. He traces the conflict back to the time of Goethe and Schiller, when the culture of central Europe achieved a certain flowering. But the Goethean impulses were not truly recognised and taken up *Six lectures, of which only the fth has been translated, under the title of \"Spiritual Emptiness and Social Life\", in the Golden Blade, 1954. 54by the world at large, and the culture began to decline. Behind this decline, and to an important extent responsible for it, was a kind of alliance between certain Ahrimanic and Luciferic influences. Steiner describes how the Luciferic impulses were at work, in particular, in the great houses of the landed aristocracy of central Europe, typied by the house Hapsburg. In this aristocracy there still lived unchristianised forces from the old central Europe, before the forests were cleared. In contrast, powerful Ahrimanic impulses were active in the industrial revolution, with its emerging proletariat and expanding factory towns. It is an alliance between these Ahrimanic and Luciferic streams which has gradually eroded the Goethean culture and destroyed the old central Europe. This destruction has reached a certain climax in our century. Steiner describes the rst world war as part of this destructive process, and a direct outcome of an \"alliance\" between the impulses at work in the old landed aristocracy and in the new industrial society. To-day, we can look back on the second world war as a further act in this drama. For the effect of this convulsion was to carty the destruction of central Europe to a certain conclusion. Hitler's declared intention was to create a kind of super-Central Europe. But the outcome of his actions was the establishment of the Iron Curtain. The war ended with the old Central Europe sliced in two, and the two halves have been drawn apart into the orbits of Moscow and Washington. But, as the old Central Europe declined, a new impulse was bom in it: Rudolf Steiner brought Spiritual Science into Ibe world. The cultural impulses of Goethe and Schiller were reborn in a new form, not as part of a geographically limited culture, but as the starting- point of a new culture for mankind as a whole. At the same time, there are signs that the Luciferic-Ahrimanic alliance which eroded Goethean culture is manifesting in new forms, which we must learn to recognise. In particular, I believe that the \"alliance\" is coming to expression in the remarkable linking of science and industry which is so characteristic of the past few decades, and which is having such far-reaching effects on our society. The main purpose of this essay is to develop this sugges tion. * Until recently, science was still a remote, largely academic activity, pursued by small numbers of scholarly men. Its ideal was pure Imowledge, understanding of nature for its own sake.In Britain, this tradition of academic science continues to be remarkably strong. The most brilliant scientists still tend to gather in universities and pursue \" pure \" research, even though the facili ties and the pay may be relatively poor. The pure scientists are widely regarded\u2014and often regard themselves\u2014as the aristocracy of the scientic community. 55In contrast, applied scientists and engineers tend to be regarded as a kind of proletariat of science. Although engineering is now a highly scientic profession, the word \" engineer \" still vaguely sug gests a man with a spanner and dirty blue overalls, \"good with hishands \" but not specially good with his head.\" Pure \" science has created a vast conceptual edice, a grandiose picture of the world which has a certain shining splendour. It con veys the impression that there are very few dark comers of ignorance left, and that these will soon be banished. But it is undoubtedly a Luciferic light that conveys this god-like sensation of understanding almost everything. The technologist, by contrast, is interested in scientic concepts not for their elegance or beauty, but for their utility. He is less concerned to understand the world than to control it. He judges a theory by the ease with which it can be tested in practice and set to work. It matters little whether an idea is \"trae\" so long as it is use ful. This habit of regarding ideas as a source of power rather than of understanding bears the unmistakea'ble signature of Ahriman. During the last 30 years, however, science and technology have entered into an increasingly intimate alliance. The modern engineer has become highly dependent on the ndings of laboratory research, while the \"pure\" scientists, in demanding ever more elaborate equipment, are increasingly dependent on &st-class engineering. Thus the scientic technology which is now gathering speed has emerged from a fusion between two originally very different streams: the \"disinterested\" pure scientists, rooted in the universities, and the \" practical\" engineers, descendants of the old craftsmen whose work has been transformed by the industrial revolution. It is a fusion of forces that start from the head with forces that originate in the will. This fusion has been stimulated, almost created, by social and poilitcal events of the twentieth century. This becomes particularly clear if one examines two particular developments, the atomic bomb\u2014which emerged from \"pure\" science\u2014and the rocket missile, which emerged from advanced engineering. During the rst decades of this century, the major adventure of pure science was the dissection of matter into atoms and sub-atomic particles. This work was centred almost entirely in Europe, especially in Copenhagen, Cambridge, Gottingen, Berlin, Vienna, Rome and Paris. When one reads of the life of atomic physicists at these centres during the 1920s, one is reminded a little of the cultural flowering in the time of Goethe. They formed an idealistic international community, burning with enthusiasm and richly endowed with remarkable individuals. The rise of Hitler cast a shadow over their lives, for many\u2014 including Albert Einstein\u2014were Jews, and were forced to flee.With Einstein's departure for America, it was widely felt that the centre of gravity of science had moved from Central Europe to the West. The crucial discoveries which led to the release of atomic ene^y were made towards the end of 1938, just as Europe was heading into war. The wartime atmosphere of fear and distrust then provided precisely the right atmosphere for translating these academic discoveries into practice\u2014even though many of the scientists involved had begun to realise what this would imply. The war-time Manhattan Project for developing the bomb brought together, for the rst time, some of the most outstanding physicists and some of the best engineers in the world. The \" aristocrats \" of science found themselves allied with the driving energies of practical men of action, engineers and generals. It is nevertheless true to say that in the release of atomic energy, the conceptual advances were primary; translating the concepts into practice was secondary. The atomic bomb is an \"aristocratic\" achievement. In contrast, the giant rockets, which were also pioneered in war time, when German engineers develo'ped the V-2, are primarily achievements of technology. They embody few new concepts, but a great deal of \" know-how.\" They call for a kind of industrialised craftsmanship, and individuals have emerged with a certain genius for making these complex machines work. Since the war, these two products\u2014the most refined products of \"pure\" science and of engineering respectively\u2014have themselvesbecome allied. The linking of rocket and atomic bomb has created the weapon which dominates the military and political scene to-day. It is just this combination which sustains the Iron Curtain, and produces a kind of paralysis across Central Europe. The alliance between science and technology, stimulated in particular by the activities of Hitler, has rigidied the division of Central Europe. But the alliance has also released a surge of new discovery and invention which is profoundly affecting society. In this connection, it is worth looking more closely at the effects of rockets and atomic energy , for they reveal a curious and instructive polarity .When an atomic bomb explodes, it produces a reball which shines with a kind of terrible glory. It is as though something of the Luciferic light which illumines the concepts behind it should shine forth directly for a brief moment. In its outward aspect, the atomic bomb can seem an inspiration of Lucifer. Yet in the way it is used, and in its consequences, it is entirely the instrument of Ahriman. It is the most total instrument of power ever wielded by man. One may feel that its by-products, the radio active d^ris, have an ageing effect on the earth, and that\" fall-out\" is a kind of physical counterpart of the fear which these weapons inspire. It has given rise to new military strategies\u2014the \" balance of terror\", \"graduated deterrence\", etc.\u2014^which have a kind of 5657mechanical but totally inhuman logic. The end\u2014\" defending free dom\"\u2014^is held to justify the means\u2014almost complete mutual destruction. With the large rockets, the situation is reversed in a curious way. In their outward aspect, these devices appear as a whollyAhrimanic ii^iration. They combine a fantastic yet controlled power in their engines with a cold electronic \"brain\" in their guidance systems. - A rocket engine looks like a kind of mechanical digestive tract, which swallows fuel at a furious rate and produces great jets of flame, like a violent impulse of will, to drive the rocket upwards. In the nose, mechanical eyes and feelers peer into the sky, sense the movements and acceleration, and set the machine precisely on course.Yet the use of rockets for space exploration is impelled by a child-like but burning enthusiasm. The rocket engineers see the exploration of space as a vast new step in the evolution of man,whKh will establish him as master beyond the limits of his planet. It is almost a religious impulse\u2014^to make man a kind of god\u2014 which res the space enthusiasts. TOs child-like enthusiasm is particularly apparent in the Russian approach to space exploration. Eminent Russian Acade micians will indulge in flights of futuristic speculation which make western academic scientists squirm inwardly. The machinery of the Soviet State, with its tendency to cen tralised authority and its emphasis on groups rather than on individuals, clearly derives from an Ahrimanic impulse. But this has been grafted, like a kind of mechanical armour, on to a people whose inward impulses are deeply religious\u2014^a religiosity which Lucifer can attem]^ to lead astray. In America, there is in some respects an opposite situation. The ou^Md ideals of American society are treated almost as religious principles. \"Freedom\" and \"democracy\" are ultimate virtues, \"Communism\" is totally evil. Yet America has pioneered mass- production, developed mass-persuasion by advertising and propa ganda to a ne art, and elevated mechanical efciency into a major virtue. The most powerful Ahrimanic impulses are clearly at work within American society. The aim of these remarks is not to criticise American or Russian society, but to underline what seems to be a fundamental charac teristic of the Luciferic-Ahrimanic \"alliance.\" Wherever the one impulse is more outward, the other is to be found working more inwardly, and vice versa. Let us now consider where this alliance, in so far as it is expressed in scientic technology, may be leading. The triumph of pure science (the release of atomic energy) and the triumph Of engineering (the exploration of space) have trans formed the status of science in the eyes of politicians the world over. Science, both pure and applied, is now seen as the major 58source of power, both military and economic. The national purse strings are wide open, and scientists are allied with massive indus trial resources as never before. This is why the atomic physicists can plan and build vast machines such as the \" synchrotrons\" near Geneva and at Brook- haven in America, for probing still further into the anatomy of matter. Since the 1940s, atomic physics has become bewilderingly com plex, and has raised more new problems than it has solved. Butthere are signs that the next ve years will bring important new developments, in which the still vaster machines now being planned will play a part. One of the most remarkable facts about atomic physics is that although it is now dealing with entities of almost unimaginable smallness, and intervals of time where a millionth of a second seems as long as a day in ordinary life, new facets of this \"universe within \" are continually opening up. Atomic research is a kind of exploration into the \" innities within.\" This exploration coincides with an opposite one\u2014the immense effort to break out into space and explore the planetary system. But whereas atomic research must wait on new concepts to make progress, space research is dependent on new technology. Yet here there is a remarkable paradox. For it is the effort which is apparently centred in the conceptual life which has released mighty physical forces; while the effort which is centred in tech nology is producing considerable conceptual upheavals. Space research has begun to change our picture of the universein quite far-reaching ways. The nineteenth century universe was dark, cold and silent. Hot balls of gas were scattered through this space, and some of them were circled by a few lumps of rock called planets. Since then, but especially in the past ve years, space research has been rapidly lling this \" void \" with all kinds of surging, inter weaving forces. The focus of attention is now the \" magnetosphere \"\u2014a volume of space surrounding the earth where the earth's magnetic eld predominates. It is found to be egg-shaped, and it interacts, especially at its outer surface, in a very sensitive way , to influencesfrom the sun. The earth, with its magnetosphere, is now pictured as enfolded within the atmosphere of the sun, and as living in a complex community with it.The understanding of this interrelationship is only in its begin nings\u2014'but it belongs to the approach to the Threshold. The time is passing when humanity needed the experience of total isolation in the universe. Space research is to-day abolishing this isolation in purely physical terms, and it seems certain to cause similar upheavals in 59scientic ideas about the nature of the moon, the planets, and per haps even the stars.The efforts to send men into space and to the moon may pro duce the most far-reaching conceptual upheavals of all. There are already some small signs that men orbiting the earth experience changes in their perceptions. Two of the American astronauts have reported what seems to be a greatly enhanced acuity of vision,which is not so far explained in ordinary terms. Such experiences may be dismissed as hallucinations. But if ventures further into space have more far-reaching effects on consciousness, the scienti c picture of the human mind could be profoundly changed. At present, ideas about consciousness have a nineteenth century character\u2014static, mechanical, unchanging. Meanwhile, one must ask what may emerge from the explora tion into the \" innities within.\" This must be entirely speculative \u2014but I think one should be prepared for the possibility that atomic energy is not the last of the forces to be released from this explora tion into matter. There are indeed hints in some of Rudolf Steiner's writings of far-reaching discoveries still to come. (See, for instance, the lecture, fVas: tut der Engel in unserem Astralleib ? (Zurich, 9 Oct., 1919).! * Rudolf Steiner sometimes spoke with great earnestness of the danger that mankind could cross the Threshold without becoming aware of the fact. Yet this is just what the scientic-technological alliance could help to achieve. For it is beginning to reveal spiritual realities in such a way that they are interpreted by men in purely material terms. Through space research, mankind is now becoming aware, for instance, that the earth is intimately interwoven with the rest of the universe. Through atomic research, he is becoming aware that thoughts\u2014concepts\u2014can release mightyforces. Yet the \" thoughts \" which release atomic energy are held to be \" neutral,\" no different from thoughts about the familiar world of nature we perceive with our senses; and the forces of the \" mag- netosphere \" are regarded as fundamentally the same as those found at ground level. In \"The Spiritual Guidance of Mankind,\" Rudolf Steiner describes how humanity must cross the threshold in a two-fold way. During life, most people can survey only the walking hours betweenbirth and death. Crossing the threshold means, in a certain way, beginning to survey the realms before birth and after death. It is striking that science and technology are bringing a kind of carica tured encounter with these two thresholds. The great effort of applied science and technology to explore space is impelled by a Luciferic dream, which urges man to nd his 1 The Work of the Angels in Man's Astral Body (Rudolf Steiner Press).way into those shining realms from which he descended at birth. It is an effort to return to \"the heavens.\" The spacemen crouch in their curious womb-like capsules and undergo a kind of initiation. One can even suspect that these space flights include a physical caricature of spiritual ordeals. Is it farfetched to see the experience of greatly enhanced gravity during the initial acceleration, so that each part of the body weighs four or ve- times more than normal, as a kind of ordeal by earth ? Then, sud denly, the astronaut is floating weightless, as though in a vast ocean, undergoing an \" ordeal by water.\" As he circles the earth, he must also keep control of his soul life, hold back fear, and calmly observe what is happening. He must survive a trial in the astral-soul element, an ordeal by \"air.\" His \"initiation\" is completed with an \" ordeal by re,\" as he plunges back into the earth's atmosphere and survives the heat of re-entry. In contrast, the emergence of atomic energy, the product of\" pure \" science, has brought mankind as a whole face-to-face with death. Until now, each individual had to come to terms with his own forthcoming death. To-day, atomic weapons force men to contemplate the possibility of the death of humanity. But this, too, is a caricature of what should be a spiritual process. In connection precisely with the destruction of Goethean culture in Central Europe, Rudolf Steiner said that in order to cross the Threshold, mankind must undergo a spiritual death, so that something new may be bom. It is the aim of the Luciferic-Ahrimanic \" alliance\" to divert mankind's attention from a real spiritual evolution which he is embarking on, so that he crosses the Threshold unawares. Instead of penetrating spiritually beyond death and before birth, his atten tion is being diverted by spectres of physical death and dreams of a mechanical exploration of the heavens. Why is it that pure science brings a kind of encounter with death, while applied science generates an urge to escape from the earth ? In a Christmas lecture. Die Zwei Weihnachtsverkundigungen^ (1.1.21) Rudolf Steiner describes the origins of the faculties nowused for pure and applied science. The mathematical thinking of to-day he says, derives from the clairvoyant faculties used by theThree kings to perceive the approaching birth of the Christ. They were faculties on which a true astrology was based, so that the sages from the East could look outwards at the stars and perceivethe spiritual realities working behind them. T o-day , Rudolf Steiner says, these faculties manifest as a purely inward ability to think mathematically. Pure science, naathematical science, is thus a metamorphosed remnant of the mighty faculties of the Kings. 1 Translated in the collection of eight lectures on Christmas (Rudolf Steiner Press). 6061The Shepherds, unlike the Kings, received their sumnions to the Nativity while asleep. Rudolf Steiner tells us that they possessed clairvoyant faculties connected more with the metabolic pole of nmn, so that, looking inwards and downwards, they drew their visions from a deep connection with the earth. These faculties manifest to-day in all materialistic experiment. Technology and applied science, with the outward-going urge to manipulate the earth, make use of a metamorphosed renmant ofthe faculties of the Shepherds. In the Oberufer Christmas plays, the Kings are usually repre sented as two older men and one younger; the Shepherds, in con trast, include two younger and one older. This indicates how the spiritual stream represented by the Kings, who draw their wisdom from the stars, is more connectedwith the forces of old age. While the Shepherds, who call on the earth-mother for their knowledge, are more link^ with the forces of youth. To-day, the pure scientists, who have inherited a remnant of thefaculties of the Kings, are leading mankind towards a materialistic encounter with death, towards the threshold which lies at the end of human life. While the technologists, using metamorphosed Shepherd faculties, are striving with child-like enthusiasm to carry mankind into the heavens, using a kind of mechanical womb. This caricatured initiation threatens to distract attention from a spiritual crossing of the Threshold into the worlds which lie before birth, and may bring great conceptual confusion about the nature of extra terrestrial realms, the moon, planets and stars. This may help us to understand Rudolf Steiner's statement, in the Christmas lecture quoted above, that the pre-Christian Shepherds and Kings faculties work to-day in opposite directions. Before the Mystery of Golgotha, it was the Kings who were concerned with thestars. And they could use their faculties to perceive the forces working from the stars down on -to the earth, the forces which lead souls from the heavens into earthly incarnation. Thus they could see the \"Star\" of their previous spiritual teacher, Zarathustra, as it approached the earth for its most important incarnation. T o-day the faculties of the Kings work inwards, carrying human thought deep into matter, where death-bringing forces are encoun tered. The Shepherds' faculties were drawn from deep within the human being, and revealed something of the life of the etheric body of the earth. But to-day the remnants of these forces are urging mankind to escape the earth and explore the stars\u2014although in a purely physical way. It is clear enough that in this great metamorphosis of the King- faculties to mathematical thinking, and of Shepherd-faculties to the instincts of applied science, much has been lost. For the Kings 62were above all wise, while the Shepherds possessed great powers of reverence and devotion. Pure science to-day is a structure of knowledge without wisdom. Indeed, the whole concept of wisdom has become very dim. But even now, the word still implies the passage of time, a certain period of ripening. It is characteristic of modern science that there is no place for such ripening processes in its activities. A scientist who has an idea hastens to publish it, even in the most tentative form, so that it may be registered as \" his,\" and credited to his academic account. The haste and pressure which dominate even the \"purest\" science to-day ensure that new theories and ideas for experiments are poured into the world without considering their implications. Applied science, on the other hand, often displays a certain brutality\u2014:the opposite of reverence and devotion. There is some thing breathtaking about a huge machine like a jet engine. But in such a machine, metals and other materials are placed under strains which would have instantaneously shattered the gentler machines of earlier times. In the application of science to agriculture, pest-control and the like, a similar brutality is often apparent. And in medical and surgical experiments, it is now becoming possible to manipulate and interfere with living processes in unprecedented ways. Scientists often feel instinctively that there are limits beyond which such inter ference may not go. But lacking the soul-forces of devotion and reverence, such qualms seldom advance to a clear perception of moral realities, and are easily dissected by intellectual arguments. It is a central characteristic of Rudolf Steiner's spiritual science that it calls for both reverence and wisdom. It can come alive in the soul only when supported by these two forces. Wisdom is the fruit of meditation\u2014and the essence of meditation is repetition over a period of time. Concepts which are released too soon into the world cannot further the evolution of humanity; but if they are allowed to grow old in the right way , they can mature into a kingly wisdom. In \" Knowledge of the Higher Worlds \", however, Rudolf Steiner emphasises that every step in knowledge must be accompanied bythree steps in morality . The moral path begins, so to speak, with reverence and devotion. Rudolf Steiner has emphasised their special importance in childhood for the development of the moral life later on. If pure science and applied science are to help humanity to cross the Threshold, they must summon these two qualities\u2014^wisdom and reverence\u2014to their aid. These are the forces which can dissolve and redeem the Luciferic-Ahrimanic alliance which is now at work in such subtle and complex ways within scientic thinking and scien tic doing. 63 GB\u20145This fact is summed up by Rudolf Steiner in the nal lines of the Foundation Stone Meditation. The Light which enlightens the wise heads of Kings can mature knowledge into wisdom. The Light which brings warmth to simple Shepherds' hearts can purify the will-forces of childhood, so that they become the basis of moral deeds. The last lines of the Meditation are a prayer that this Light should imbue our hearts and heads, so that our deeds on earth may bear fruit, so that human evolution may follow the right path. In his book on the Foundation Stone, Zeylmans van Bmmichoven has described how in this fourth section of the Meditation there is a metamorphosis of the Christ statue which was mentioned at the beginning of this essay The statue shows the Representative of Humanity holding the Luciferic and Ahrimanic beings apart in a dynamic balance, so that they can no longer form an alliance. They can act only so that their forces can be transformed through the Light Divine, the Sun of Christ, into positive fruits for the evolution of humanity. In the Meditation, Ahriman and Lucifer are not mentioned, for, as Dr. Zeylmans says, they are here, in a sense, already overcome. But the process through which this victory is achieved is explicitly described. There are thus to be found in the Christ statue and in the Foundation Stone Meditation a profound source of help for meet ing the most central and pressing problems of our times. The Meditation can help us understand how the hasty concepts of pure science must be replaced by thoughts which are ripened medita tively into wisdom, so that humanity is not led by Ahriman to a premature and purely physical encounter with death. It shows, too, how warmth of heart is needed to generate reverence for the earth which is the only basis for a truly moral technology. This warmth can redeem the Luciferic dreams of using technology to escape from earth into the eternities of space, and transform them into ideals which can truly serve the spiritual realities of man's nature and his destiny on earth. ^ Der Grundstein, F. W. Zeylmans van Emmichoven, 2nd ed., Verlag Freies Geistesleben, Stuttgart, 1962. A translation has lately been pub lished by the Rudolf Steiner Press. See in this connection the chapter, \"The New Isis.\"The Lord's Prayer A d a m B i t t l e s t o n T h e r e m u s t b e v e r y m a n y p e o p l e a t t h e p r e s e n t t i m e w h o s e l d o mor never pray. This applies not only to those who have ceased to believe in traditional Christianity, and have found no other faith, in which prayer would have a necessary place; many who continue to believe, and many too who have struggled through to a fresh understanding of Christianity, either nd themselves continually failing in their efforts to pray, or are uncertain about the real nature of prayer. When the Bishop of Woolwich, in his booklet. Honest to God, described how little all the devotional books to which he has turned in the course of years have helped him, he was probably the spokesman of many in our time. It seems that something has happened comparatively recently which has profoundly shaken men's condence in their capacity to pray. Man faces a universe that appears to have extended to an immensity beyond all imagining in space and in time. There seems no reason to suppose that what goes on in the consciousness of one small human being can reach to any Spirit, or have any signicance for the universe. And there is a widespread feeling among modern men that were they able to nd a God behind this majestic universe, it would be fantastically presumptuous to press upon Him their personal needs and wishes. On the other hand, there is a deep longing to communicate in some way, to reach out beyond the narrow human consciousness with all its restlessness and anxiety. And we see that many turn hopefully towards some form of meditation or concentration, somemethod that seems to promise a means of transcending everyday perceptions, everyday thoughts and feelings. Countless peoplesearch in the past for examples, which might reveal how this is to be achieved. And yet there is always the doubt whether any teach ing from the past will meet the new questions and difculties that are arising in the present. It would be quite supercial, however, to suppose that in earlier centuries men everywhere found it quite natural and easy to pray . There is evidence of the contrary where we would perhaps least expect to nd it. There were civilisations in the ancient world whichwere little concerned with private prayer; but among the Israelites there is ample evidence of a great tradition of prayer going back totheir beginnings as a people. And yet it is plain that the disciples of Christ Jesus, men steeped in this tradition, found prayer, in practice, very difcult. At the outset of their discipleship theyreceive, according to St. Matthew, far-reaching instruction about prayer in the Sermon on the Mount. And yet at a much later stageafter the T ransguration, one of the disciples says, according to St*Luke: \"Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.\" And St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. Luke agree in describing the tragic failure of the disciples to support their Lord in prayer at Geth- semane. In both St. Matthew and St. Luke versions of the Lord's Prayer are given, as part of the essential instruction about the achievement of true prayer. And in both Gospels the context shows that it is possible to learn from the Lord's Prayer what kind of asking is rightand justied; in what sense, in fact, petition to God is to be under stood as part of man's duty. In the Sermon on the Mount it is said, just before the words of the Lord's Prayer are given: \" Your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.\" And the teaching on prayer given in Luke 11 is summed up in the words: \"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him.\" Thusthe Lord's Prayer is distinguished from an asking which has the purpose of expressing what we need. In so far as it is a matter of asking, it is an expression of our willingness to be changed, to make ourselves ready to receive the Holy Spirit. But here men of the present encounter a whole bundle of dif culties. Although through the centuries the Lord's Prayer has given innite comfort and support, experience shows that very few people to-day feel at all sure about its meaning, once they really begin toconsider it. And how many people to-day, whether members of a branch of a Christian Church or not, are prepared to speaik with condence about the Holy Spirit? An outstandingly able and practical Christian recently devised what he regarded as an essential Creed, in which there was no mention of the Holy Spirit\u2014and he was prepared to defend this omission. K we seek a teacher in our time whose whole conception of the world is lled with faith in the Holy Spirit, and who is able to describe in clear ideas the relation of the Spirit to individual man, we can nd him in Rudolf Steiner. And it is in his work that we can discover the resolution of many dilemmas confronting human beings when they try to pray at the present time. For Rudolf Steiner is both able to look back into the past, to the great teachers and founders of religions, with the most intimate comprehension; and also most thoroughly aware of the conscious and unconscious effects which scientic thought has had upon man's relationship to the Divine in recent times. Relatively early, before most of the great cycles of lectures whichhave since become widely known, Rudolf Steiner gave a lecture on the Lord's Prayer, in Berlin on January 28, 1907. It was printed soon afterwards, and has been much read and translated. A few years later, when he spoke in detail aibout the life of Jesus, he showed that the Lord's Prayer is deeply rooted in the experiences among the teachers of the Jews, among the pagan religions in the 66wider environment, and among the communities of the Essenes, which life brought to Jesus of Nazareth before the Baptism in Jordan. Dr. Zeylmans van Bmmichoven, in the last edition of his book, Der Grundstein (now available in English), has described how intimately the great meditation given by Rudolf Steiner at Christ mas, 1923, as Foundation Stone of the Anthroposophical Society he then inaugurated, is related to the Lord's Prayer. And we learn of his daily use of a version of the Prayer during his last illness. T H E S E V E N F O L D F O R M In the Berlin lecture Rudolf Steiner gave as a form, which could indicate the basic structure of the prayer, a triangle above a square. The triangle stands for the rst three petitions: \"Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\" He described these petitions as concerned with elements of the human being which are still to be developed, of which man as yet has only the rst beginnings. These elements Rudolf Sterner sometimes called, particularly in the earlier years of his teaching, by eastern na.mes\u2014Manas, Buddhi, Atma. He used also names in German, which can be rendered literally in English as Spirit-Self, Life-Spirit, Spirit-Man. In their completeness, these will representthe ultimate spirkualisation of what he described as the astral body, the ethereal body, and the physical body. The square stands for the remaining petitions, from \"Give us this day our daily bread \" onwards. These he relates to the physical body, the ethereal body and the astral body as they are in our present experience, and to the central element of human indivi duality, the Ego. Such relations can come to have effective meaning for us only when the terms used for the elements of man's being cease to appear remote and abstract, and grow to have a rich and immediate con tent. This can happen only when we see how they illuminate human life in the most varied ways, helping us to understand every kind of experience which we can encounter, from apparently trivial every day things to the mysteries of birth and death. K, then, these relationships are remembered when the Lord's Prayer is used, it is evident that it will become something like ameditation upon man's being, bringing before the spirit's eye what we are and what we can become. But it may seem as if it would then lose its character as a prayer, something spoken to a Divine Power who is thought of as listening to what goes on in the human soul. It may be felt, too, that in this way a great deal of the direct simple meaning of the Prayer will be abandoned.Yet for those who feel themselves to have lost the capacity for prayer, this may be the necessary way towards a renewed sense ofcontact with the spiritual world; to dwell at rst on something that is regarded simply as an idea, or as a sequence of thoughts, upon 67which the mind seeks to concentrate all its attention. And if the thought or sequence of thoughts has been well chosen, we can beginto observe that there is a quickening process going on within us, which concerns parts of our being of which we are not generally aware. And while the physical body gives us to-day a sense of relative isolation from all other things and beings, these more subtle, invisible elements of man's being are interwoven with the active powers of the spiritual world, and tend to remind us that our isolation is very much an illusion. However simple and incomplete our practice of meditation may seem to us, there may well come moments when we can become condent that a power of the spiritual world is indeed gazing down upon what is happening in our souls. Rudolf Steiner spoke\u2014as did the works attributed to Dionysius the i^eopagite and the general mediaeval tradition\u2014of nine ranks of spiritual beings, the heavenly Hierarchies. Of these the nearest to man are the Angels, guardians of individual men, the Archangels, inspirers of communities, and the Archai, who bring the impulsesfor whole civilisations. In studying the Lord's Prayer we are par ticularly concerned with these beings, because it is they who have gone on ahead of man in the development of the qualities to which the rst three petitions refer. And the more these petitions come to life for us, the more our consciousness is gradually drawn into that realm where the creative power of these spirits is at work. It may seem as if such a line of thought were quietly abandon ing any claim that man can pray to God, and substituting a prayer which can be shared in some way with an Angel or Archangel. But the true Spirits of the Hierarchies are to be thought of, as the Bible often shows, as organs of the Divine. Where a human being has good hearing and is attentive, we do not complain that we cannot speak to him, but only to his ears. The Angels are messen gers of God; and what they hear, is heard by the Ground of the World, the heavenly Father. NAME The rst petition, \"Hallowed be Thy Name\", is related by Rudolf Steiner to the puried astral body, the Spirit-Self. We grow aware of the astral body in the rst place through the ever-changing life of our wishes and emotions. But in the Niirnberg lectures on FaitK Hope and Love, Rudolf Steiner says that the essential nature of the astral bodv is to be found in Faith; not a faith regarded as an alternative to knowledge, but one which makes knowledge real and effective. We meet at the present time chiefly a kind of Knowledge which remains something external, both to the thingknown and to the knower; a piling up of information which gives power without participation. A hallowed or beloved name belongsto a process of knowl^ge through which the knower can enter and share the life and purpose of the being named. Here thought doesnot remain a shadowy picture received from outside; it is an active and selfless use of our inner resources, that they may reveal to us the meaning of the world, which would otherwise remain a great unanswered question.\" Our Father, Who art in the heavens \" must become and remain an empty phrase if human knowledge in general is without life; and in particular, if space and time remain for us a bare framework, unrelated to the events and beings they contain. The difliculties . about a God \" out there in space \" arise because our general con ceptions of space are barren and undifferentiated; the New Testa ment can speak of \"the heavens\" and even number them (as St. Paul does when he speaks of \" the third heaven \") because the space around the earth was thought of as growing more and more trans parent for the spiritual realms which indeed permeate everything,but are veiled by the solid matter of earth. In our age, the Archangel Michael battles with the forces which would darken the astral body of man, so that a redeemed human thinking can achieve living conceptions of space and time, in whichthe Divine is revealed. In this way the soul can come to honour again the Name of a Father Who is both the origin of all things, and Who continually grants and sustains the freedom of His creatures. It is such a Father as this, and not the tyrant gure against which Blake and Shelley and many others have rebelled, that Christianity originally proclaimed\u2014as in the parable of the Prodigal Son. The rst petition of the Lord's Prayer looks towards growing knowledge of this Father, and faith in Him; it is indeed an asking, yet one which can be fullled only through man's active knowledge and faith. KINGDOM Living knowledge brings man into the realm of the Angels, who bear within them the Spirit-Self, as man will do only in the far future. It is the Archangels, who are the guardians not only of individuals, but of whole communities, who reveal in the present the nature of Life-Soirit. The rst beginnings of Life-Spirit are developed by men not as separate individuals, but by their share inwhat exerts its effect upon communities; Rudolf Steiner gave as examples the effect of great works of art or of true religious rituals.In every enduring human relationship some transformatinn nf the ethereal body comes about; and where the relationship lives in ireedom, there is a hp.pinning of the \"Kingdnm \" Rudolf Steiner describes in the Niirnberg lectures the basic quality of the ethprpal body ^I^ve; thus in the absence of Love the forces that sustainhuman efflence wither , as the astral bodv grows dark without Faith. Insight into these facts would have the most far-reaching elect on human civilisation; and in one sense these petitions of the Lord's Prayer are concerned with the growth of this insight. 6869It is relevant, however, to ask at this point: \" Who is meant in the Lorf s Prayer by' we'\" ? The \" our \" of \" Our Father \" is taken up explicitly in the last four petitions; but it is implicit also in therst t^ee. It is through us that these things are to happen; all of them involve in some way a Christian community. If we are pray ing or meditating alone, it is easy to substitute \" me \" unconsciously, particularly in the last three petitions. And if we try to strengthen our awareness that \"we\" is really meant, how widely should it be extended ? To all humanity, living and dead ? Or should we take, to have a more concrete picture, the circle of those human beings we actually know ? Once there was a \"we\" to which each human being felt himself belonging, by nature: those who shared the same blood. For the people of Israel, \" we \" had long meant quite denitely the descen dants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But when the Lord's Prayer was given to Christ's disciples, a community was growing up among them which stood in a certain radical contrast to the community of the blood; it was based on free decision, which involved indeed an increasingly drastic rejection of the authority of those who by their descent were priests and leaders in Israel. The \"we\" of the \"Our Father\" cannot be meant to shut anyone out; but the community in it is founded not on natural relationships but on the power of the soul to recognise Clurist. It will be good to think of this both in a way that extends over a great multitude, of the living and of the dead, and also to apply it sometimes to a quite specic small group of people, even of two or three. Wherever the individual \"I am \" is able to transcend itself, in the light of Christ, in friendship and compassion, the Kingdom draws near. WILL In the third petition, the rhythm of the Prayer alters; there are added, to the four words in Greek which echo the structure of the previous petitions, six more, which can be literally rendered in the order of the Greek, \"as in heaven, also on earth.\" (\"Heaven\" is here singular, not plural as at the beginning of the Prayer. This is usual where heaven and earth are directly compared.) The word \"earth\" prepares for the transition to the sentences that are con cerned with the tension of our present existence. Yet the third petition as a whole reaches out to the greatest prophetic vision of all; to the ultimate reconciliation of all being in God, the new Jerusalem. The words \"Thy Will be done\" have sometimes been under stood as if they meant that everything that is happening is in accordance with God's will, and should be accepted in this sense. But the context, in the Sermon on the Mount, makes it abundantly clear that the primary sense is quite different; men are in every way failing to do God's will, or setting themselves against it. The Sermon 70on the Mount ends with the contrast of the two houses, built on rock and on sand; the man who carries out in action what Christ has described, and the man who does not\u2014whose fall is great, a tragedy in the sight of the universe. The exercise of the human will involves Nature with it. The earth can be redeemed by human actions, or given more completely into the power of the adversary. Man's physical body and sur rounding Nature are not as separate as they appear; they share one another's destiny. They are both permeated by the great Hope for - man's growth to spiritual maturity; that he may become inwardly, what is already implicit in the Divinely ordered form of the temple of his body. It has widely been taken for granted, during recent centuries, that stone, plant and animal exist only to satisfy human needs; that they have, so to speak, no hopes of their own. Human work everywhere is shaped almost entirely according to this presumption. It does much to make our economic life the spiritual prison which it is. And yet everywhere men long to treat stone, plant and beast with reverence for their own characters and needs; to carry out a will based not simply on human desires but in accordance with the cosmic order. Those hierarchical beings who are beyond the Archangels, the Archai, have the innermost kinship with such objective, world- serving will. Ihev work to bring into each succeeding civilisation selfless and universal purposes. In ery devotion they span the immense abyss, from highest heaven to depths of earth, stirring the passing days that they may remember the beginning and the end.To serve these Spirits of the Ages does mean for individual men a sacrice; not a fatalistic acceptance of outer conditions, but the putting aside of personal aims to admit impulses of the will thatare more than personal. These may stand in the strongest contrast to the existing environment, and yet serve the real needs of the world; we can nd examples of service to the realm of the Archai in the combination of vigorous independence with patient devotion by such personalities as John the Baptist or Joan of Arc. The third petition includes both contemplation of this kind of greatness, andthe facing of those hindrances with which the following petitions are concerned in particular. BREAD The fourth petition, which seems so straightforward, is in reality the meeting-place of all the mysteries of the Prayer. It is only in appearance that the nourishment of the physical body is a simple thing. The greatest wisdom was used in the ancient world to develop the plants which could serve human nutrition in a way that the wild plants could not do. And behind every loaf of bread there is a network of rights and relationships of the most complex kind; rights over the use of land, over the use of human labour, and the control 71of money. All this is direct and visible; but every plant also draws into itself much that is invisibly present in the whole earth; the con sequences of human thoughts and feelings, the conditions of the elemental spirits. Unconsciously we eat human injustice, and the grief of the earth. Never was a human being able to be aware of all that was entailed, when he took bread into his hands, until the coming of Christ. Only He was able to raise and break the breadwith full consciousness of the Father's presence in earthly substance, and with full recognition of human guilt. Since early Christian times, there has been a strong conviction that the fourth petition of the Lord's Prayer is connected with the Eucharist. And this has been influenced to some extent by a mysterious word which we nd in the original Greek at this point, both in St. Matthew and in St. Luke, and nowhere else in the New Testament or in Greek literature. It is the word translated \" daily\", but of which the meaning in fact remains uncertain\u2014it may be \" for the coming day \", or perhaps \" that is due to us.\" Certainly there lies in it some contrast to the aspirations described in the parable of the Rich Fool (Luke 12,16), the man who planned greater barns to contain his reserves of food for his own use, for years to come, and whose soul was required of him that same night. If men are to be aware that bread comes to them from the Father, they can claim only what is needed, without excess, and for the immediate future. And they will see that the bread is rightly shared. In the Eucharist we have the archetype and the source of a true will to share the gifts of heaven among men. The words of the Lord's Prayer are placed in St. Luke's Gospel within a remarkable sequence of pictures (Luke 10, 23 to 11, 13). Before, come the story of the Good Samaritan and the account of Jesus at the house of Martha and Mary. Immediately after the Prayer, comes the parable of the Friend at Midnight. These pictures have all to do with care given by human beings for each other's physical needs. The Good Samaritan cares for the battered body of the man who fell among thieves; Martha is busy with thework entailed in hospitality; the friend when he is disturbed in bed is asked for loaves. And Jesus goes on to speak of the son who asks his father for food. But then in conclusion\u2014\"How much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?\" 'We have here a wonderful alternation between the needs of the body and the needs of the soul. Martha in her concern about bodilyneeds is forgetting that they can be served rightly only if the soul can listen to the spirit. To ask for bread is not just to claim a physical service; it is to call upon the Holy Spirit in the soul of theother. The fourth petition of the Lord's Prayer is indeed asking that humanity should not starve; but this asking implies much more \u2014^that man's social life, his economic relationships, his understand ing of soil and plant and of human nutrition, should all be blessed 72by the light of the Holy Spirit. Without this men will not really be fed; their bread will become stone. Into the fourth petition there shines from one side the glory of the Name, the Kingdom, and the Will; from the other there works the tragedy with which the rest of the Prayer has to deal. FORGIVENESS The more individualised human beings become, the more their behaviour to one another sets riddles which have to be answered. We have often the greatest difculty in understanding those people in particular whom our destiny has brought nearest to us. Few people can look back over the years without seeing that others havefelt injured or neglected by them; and that they themselves have suffered injury or neglect. How intensely grievances are reinem- bered can varv to some extenT according to fhp rnnRiituticm--oi-Ae ethereal body, by which our power of memory is sustained: but it is rare for a man not to have any sense of bitterness about the deeds of others. But when a man is confronted by his ethereal body as a whole, as happened to those who received the baptism of John, and hap pens after death, then the debts owed to him are dwarfed in con templation of the debts he owes. T owards the whole universe he is immeasurably in debt. In St. Matthew's Gospel, not long after the account of the Transguration (Chapter 18, 23), there is a parable where a servant is described who owes his King an immense debt, the equivalent in our reckoning of millions of pounds. In response to his pleading, he is forgiven; and as he goes out, he seizes a fellow-servant by the throat, and puts him in prison, for a debt of a few pounds. This parable describes the true cosmic proportions, with which the fth petition is concerned. But in ordinary life they are not easily seen; the ethereal body is settled too rmly into the physical.And yet part of this stubborn ethereal body, which is so hard to change, has a boundless capacity of mobility and freedom. It can dive down, as it were, at our bidding into any form or pattern with which the world presents us; it can make it possible for us to share the grief or joy of other beings. Something of this power shows itself already in our fantasy, our waking dreams; intensied, it can show itself in the comprehension of a destiny quite different f r o m o u r o w n . In our time, through the work of Rudolf Steiner, the mysteries of Karma, the working of destiny through repeated early lives, are becoming accessible to human understanding. We can learn how debts incurred in one life on earth can really be paid in a subse quent one. But the process of Karma, as described by Rudolf Steiner, is not a mechanical one; the grace and forgiveness of God, and the mutual love of human souls, have continually their effects within it. It is coming about in our time, as Rudolf Steiner described 73in the Karlsruhe lectures. From Jesus to Christ, and again in the Niimberg lectures, that Christ becomes manifest as Lord of Karma, enabling men to work out their personal destinies in the way thatserves best Hhe need of all humanity . TOen we refuse to forgive, we set the barrier of our minds against this work of Christ; we claim repayment in our way, in our time, instead of accenting the healing of destinies through Him. We hold on to the knots in our ethereal bodies, instead of allowing them to be loosened. When we achieve forgiveness, we are making use of the deepest essence of the ethereal body, its origin in cosmic Love. And we prepare ourselves to meet the shining stream of Light, the heavenly power of forgiveness, which awakened the soul of Paul on the road to Damascus. TEMPTATION Endless questions and uncertainties surround to-day the sixth petition. How is it possible that God should lead us into temptation? And is not temptation the common lot of everyone, which we should not seek to escape ? To begin with, it is necessary to see exactly what \"temptation\" means. The Greek word is oeirasmos. which is related to our words\" experiment\" and \" exjerience \u00bb: it means a testing, ft trying QlU. The same word is used to the disciples at the tragic moment in Geth- semane when they are asked to remain awake: \" Pray that you may not enter into temptation.\" What sort of test is it, before which the disciples may stand at that moment? It is the testing of their faith; and this is the fundamental meaning of peirasmos for the early Christians. In persecution, before the threats of the powers of this world, before destinies which seem too hard to be borne, faith is tested: and the faith, even of a Peter, can fail. Here we are concerned with the basic quality of the astral body. What are more generally described as temptations, the many wishes which beset us, have their power because of the weakness of faith. \"Your heaveidy Father (laaows that you have need of all these things \"; the astral body that is lled with faith is able to wait and trust. For what then does the sixth petition ask ? The same experi ence, which is for one human being an agonising temptation, may be for another a grief patiently accepted. The events that led up to the Crucixion deeply troubled the faith of the disciples, but there is no sign that for any moment the Mother of Jesus was shaken in this way . When human beings can see the purpose of an event ir^ the li^ht of eternity , however great their sorrow, their faith need notbe yected at alL ' It would be great presumption to believe oneself able to meet all events in this way; but we can pray for each other, that we may nd a light upon our destinies, which enables us to see enough oftheir meaning that we do not fall into despak. The Greek of the sixth petition strongly emphasises into, the direction in which the path grows continually darker. Pride inevitably leads us m this direction\u2014as Mary says: \"He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.\" The community of Christians humblyasks to be shown the way which leads into light. The words of the sixth petition may not seem to be saying this. Many would prefer it if they stood in a positive form: lead us out of temptation. But that they were originally given in the difcult form in which we know them is no accident. Through the appar ently negative words something immensely positive is being said; that the soul of man will once more nd the eternal light. The words of St. Paul, after he had long pondered the Lord's Prayer, show that this interpretation is seeking in the right direction: \"Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.\" (I Corinthians, 10, 13.) EVIL The last petition is related by Rudolf Steiner to the core of man, the \" I am.\" It is by the power of this central element within us that the other members of our being may nd their gradual puri cation; not that man's ego by itself can accomplish this, but from this source the essential decision must come. In the Gospels, the Christ asks again and again of human beings whom He is prepared to heal, for their own consent and participation, their active will to receive healing. Much is given indeed to those who receive it unconsciously, for whom others may speak; but increasingly throughall history, decisions are given into the hands of individual men. It is possible for man to choose the work of destruction, rather than to act in harmony with those beings to whom he owes his own origin. By making this choice, he gives himself into the service of spirits who have already for long ages worked as enemies of theDivine. Their intention is to make of man something utterly different from that original heavenly purpose, to which the funda mental structure of his physical body bears witness. \"The^;^\" of which the seventh petition speaks is a conscious alliance with the destroyer of manhood, the being of whom Christ says, \" ne was a murderer from the beginning.\" It may seem as if evil of this kind was very remote from ordinary humanity. But this is an illusion. Self-knowledge leads everyone to the insight that the darkest evil is latent within him, and could come to expression. The decision to follow the Christ does not in itself make this impossible; at the Last Supper, when He speaks of the betrayer, the disciples have to ask,\" Is it I ? \" 74Nevertheless, to ask for liberation from the evil is not to seek something which cannot be given on earth. The \" I\" is endangered by evil because it is incomplete; its emptinesses give the evil an opportunity. When it is truly lled to overflowing from within, the destroyer can nd in it no place. In St. John's Gospel, this is shownin the description of the beloved disciple, whose head rests on the breast of Jesus. He can ask about the betrayer, because evil has no longer any hold upon him. Through his \" I\" there streams the fulness of the spiritual Sun. T H E S P I R I T C H I L D At the end of the Lord's Prayer we are brought into a region of peace, where a great promise for the future comes close to the present. The Divine ideals of the rst three petitions are unitedin the one. the centre of our being, the \" I\" that is still a child within us, and yet makes the greatest purposes its own. In ancient pictures of the Raising of Lazarus, he is often shown wrapped like a baby in swaddling clothes, and yet standing upright.Christ has summoned him from the dark tomb, calling him by name. Lazarus is entering a new life, as one born again \"from above.\" Far more concretely than it is usually understood, the receiving of the power of Christ is a new childhood. What isachieved in us within the rst three years of life in a way that is beyond the grasp of our consciousness, when we learn to walk, to speak and to think\u2014all this is to be learned afresh, as inward spiritual powers, by the Christian soul. We use the capacities developed in childhood in a strongly per sonal way. We form our own opinions, we like to hear ourselves talk about them, we walk where we want to walk. But there comes the time when we recognise how fundamentally our thinking needs to be transformed, our own pet opinions set aside. When we try toface our tasks as Christians, we see that it is not enough to speakas we have been accustomed to do, and that our outward journey ing is empty and senseless, unless there is an inward journeying as well. And this is the good reason for nding prayer difcult. It is a right feeling that forbids us to speak in prayer just as we speak in ordinary conversation. The insistent, restless voice of our our mindshas rst to grow quiet; and to let a new voice be summoned out ofthe depths of our being. In the Gospel of St. John, Christ says tothe disciples that they are to keep His words; and the keeping that is meajnt is not just an external obedience or remembering, but an inner identication with what He has said, a learning to feel it spoken within us by the being that is far more truly ourselves thanwhat we usually caU \"I.\" When they received the Lord's Prayer the disciples were being prepared for the rebirth of the Word within them, the voice that can join without dissonance in the speech ofthe Hierarchies. T o use the Lord's Prayer is to.accustom oneself to a rhythm, which sounds for the soul in the spiritual world, in which it shares during sleep and after death. It is evident that in such prayer asking becomes something very different from simply pressing a personal need. Not that human needs have no place in the angelic conversation; they are known in their full extent. But a light falls upon them, from the other side of being. It begins to be possible for man to join with the Hierarchies in the fullment of those petitions, which come from the depths of his own heart, and yet contain the Will of God.

At its best this architecture had a classic purity; at its worst a plain sterility. This was a period of functionalism in the obvious and naive sense. But there is also a deeper form of functionalism. To take a simple example, a functional kitchen, in the supercial sense, pays attention only to efcient planning and equipping as a working space, and leaves all else as plain and negative as possible. In the deeper sense, the function of a kitchen includes satisfying the feelings of the housewife as well as her practical activity, and this may introduce materials which would otherwise be excluded\u2014 natural timber instead of plastic, decorative ceramic instead of plain tile, and so on. It is this functionalism on a feeling level, as distinct from the purely utilitarian, which distinguishes a great deal of post-wararchitecture. It is now more often accepted that buildings should express and serve their emotional as well as their practical use. This may be taken one step further. For instance, Rudolf Steiner showed how the form and material of a building could express the inner nature of what takes place within\u2014a kind of functionalism on the level of spirit. It does not exclude the other functionalisms which have been described\u2014one may say at body and soul levels\u2014but requires far greater creative and spiritual activity to achieve. Thus a railway station, to take an example,would express not only the linear planning of railway tracks and platforms, the form best suited to the quick and easy circulation of passengers and similar points of use, but also the inner spiritual nature of the experience of travel and of the engines that make it possible.Steiner took this deeper aspect of functionalism very seriously and his descriptions of his rst Goetheanum building are often from this point of view. For instance, when speaking about the shape of the inside of the auditorium and the carving of the wallsand columns, he used the analogy of the nut and its shell. Just as, he said, the shell of a nut takes on its interna! shape according to the convolutions of the kernel, so the internal shaping of his building was dictated by the inner nature, the formative forces, ofall that would take place in the building\u2014the mystery plays and the lectures. 78One nf th,- irmninitivc of the churches illustrated in \"Towards aC l i S r c i A r c h t o u r c ^ ' ' A ^ o j e a f o r S t .

The two elements of sanctuary and nave are clearly expressed on plan and elevation. But their interpenetration has been expressed with a subtlety of planes which suggests something of the mystery of this threshold and makes a unity of the building as a whole.The rst Goetheanum was a building with a purpose of a specically spiritual nature and the resultant forms can be seen (now, sadly, in photographs only, as it was burnt down in 1923). These were the forms which, as Rudolf Steiner conceived them, were right for a building of this purpose. But when it came to the boiler house for the central heating, he found it impossible to include this within the same architectural concept as the main building. He saw the function\u2014^the inner being one might almost say\u2014of heating as so different from that of imparting spiritual knowledge as to be irreconcilable within the same building\u2014^within the same architectural forms. He therefore separated the boiler equipment and put it in a building of its own; a building of unique form, but absolutely different from the architecture of the main building. It was this form that expressed\u2014Steiner considered\u2014the innner nature of what took place within a boiler house. This, of course, was a remarkable achievement: rst to know and under stand what takes place spiritually when power is produced by com b u s t i o n , t h e n t o b e a b l e t o s e e w h a t a r c h i t e c t u r a l f o r m w i l l artistically express it. Even when this has been done for us, it is difcult enough to understand it. Steiner had a similar approach to the signicance of historical styles. He particularly related this to church architecture\u2014the subject of this article\u2014and showed how the different architectural styles expressed the relationship of man, at that time and in that place, to the spiritual world, to his God or Gods.* The Greek temple Steiner describes as being like an altar, forming a unity with the whole countryside around it. It stoodthere as the \"dwelling place of the God.\" It was not to be entered any more than one enters an altar; it was the altar in the \" church \"of the countryside, a dwelling place of the God giving condence to the observers that the spirit was among them. Then the early Christian church separated the building from the countryside. It was complete in itself and the land was no longer a part of it. The spirit now came to man from the chancel where the altar stood,no longer in the everyday life of the countryside, but protected by the building and its precincts from outer activity. Steiner then sees the Gothic as bringing men within the church to an even closer connection with the spirit; the community bringsinto the sanctuary not only the personalities of its individual mem bers, but also their individual work. \"We feel,\" Steiner says, \"asif the work performed in the environment has passed into the architectural forms and rises to the spirit like a prayer, a folding of the hands.\" It was Steiner's conviction that \"a real advance in architectural conception must come to pass again in our times and that this is *See the lectures given at Dornach in June, 1914, and translated as Wavs to a New Style in Architecture (at present out of print but available in the library at Rudolf Steiner House). 79 GB\u20146(1 possible only if the nearness to the spirit which was achieved to an ever-increasing extent from the period of the Greek conception ofarchitecture onwards to that of Gothic building\u2014if this nearness is gradually transformed into a complete union with the spirit. This means that buildings which should now be dedicated to life in union with the spirit must in their very form express an inner correspondence with the spiritual.\"Rudolf Steiner attempted to express this \"inner correspondence with the spiritual\" in the rst Goetheanum, and in this context we can see the importance of separating the boiler house from themam building. If architecture is to develop in this way , the need to understand the spiritual signicance of what goes on in a building and of perceiving an appropriate architectural form for it will require an architectural sensibility of a completely new kind\u2014alevel of creative activity belonging essentially to the future but having a beginning in our own time.The Goetheanum was not a church, and a study of its form is not appropriate here. But a church is a building \"dedicated to life m union with the spirit,\" and the principle of architectural development towards a closer involvement with the spirit is veryrelevant. Do we see any sign of this in modern church architecture?There has been a great deal of church building since the war , m many countries, and it has sometimes seemed to be used by architects largely as an excuse for exuberant self-expression. A church has been regarded as a \"monumental\" building, in the sense of non-functional, and this has resulted too often in a dis regard of architectural good manners. However, inappropriate assome of these buildings may have been as chiurches, they have often produced exciting and stimulating architecture: the post-war scene would have been poorer without them. And in some cases\u2014 for example, the chapels at Ronchamp by Le Corbusier and at Massachusetts Institute of T echnology by Saarinen and Niemeyefs cathedral in Brasilia\u2014they are significant both as architecture and as churches. But it is natural that there should be a protest against the striking and spectacular for its own sake, especially where the proper functioning of the church is jeopardised. This nds ex- pres^n in the architecture of the new liturgical movement withinthe Chnstian Church. These\u2014both the movement and the archi- t^ture\u2014are described in a book.

An indication of the full signicance of the liturgicalmovement is given in the following passage; \" In fact, the whole basis of the liturgical movement has from the earliest days been doctrinal and pastoral. So far from being concerned oidy with outward observances and ceremonial frills, this movement of reform and renewal has led in the course of the last fty years -to a radical reassessment of the whole content of the Christian faith. The movement is concerned with the fundamentals of doctrine: with issues no less basic than those which were at stake in the contro versies of the sixteenth century: the resurrection and the paschal mystery as the central theme of the Christian message; the theology of the Church, the Bible and the sacraments; the activity of the Holy Spirit; the character and function of the Christian layman; and the nature of the Christian assembly as the mystery of the Church realised in one particular place and time.\" It has led to so many practical reforms, has reached out to so many points on the periphery of the Church's activity, preciselybecause it goes theologically deep. It affects our whole under standing of the Christian mystery; it touches the life of the body ofChrist at its deepest and most hidden levels. Based as it is on a far more critical appreciation both of early Christian tradition, and also of its development during the Middle Ages, than was attainable four hundred, or even, one hundred years ago, the liturgical move ment is the latest and by far the most promising attempt that has yet been made to cure a sickness which has vexed the whole body of the western Church\u2014Catholic and Protestant\u2014for many cen turies.\" Charles Davis, a Roman Catholic priest, puts his approach to church architecture in the following way (and there is a substantial measure of agreement between all the contributors on basic prin ciples): \"The obstacle to good church architecture is a wrong ideaof a church, that divorces it from its proper purpose and substitutes a borrowed sublimity for its own sufciently exalted meaning. . . . To make one's rst aim in building a church the expression, in stone, brick or concrete, of some religious theme, such as the kingship of Christ, is to make church architecture trivial becauseof social irrelevance. The architect is not there to indulge his poetic imagination, even if he nds his inspiration in the Christianfaith. He is called upon to design a buildmg to serve the particular needs of a particular social group. If his design is based on an adequate functional analysis and is directed by a genuine insight into what, after all, is a most sacred purpose, it will have of itself an appropriate religious signicance and can do without the weakening effect of a superadded symbolism. . . . But the general principle that a church exists for the liturgy is beyond douibt, andit is lamentable that it should still receive so little attention, com p a r e d w i t h t h e s u p p o s e d c l a i m s o f c o n v e n t i o n a l r e l i g i o u s f e e l i n g .\"A church is not a complicated piece of sculpture or a shrine of 81religious art, giving form to a religious message and intended tonave an impact on all, irrespective of whether they take part inChristian worship or not. A church has as denite a social purpose as a ^hool. This purpose is on a higher level; it is heavier with meaning, with intellectual and emotional potential; further, it is proper to a particular community that stands apart from other men.But it is^ none the less a clearly dened purpose that demands analysis m a detailed programme and excludes any display ofextraneous religious emotion. Since its purpose is sacred, a church must have a sacred character. Church architecture can never be e^ly equated with secular architecture; its purpose lies in alugher order , and so it makes peculiar demands on the insight andsMl df architects. But a genuine quality of sacredness will not be given to a building by adventitious religious symbolism or by a ^te rei\u00bbtition of what is popularly regarded as religious in tone,but It will come\u2014^when it does come\u2014by a working out with sym pathy and understanding of the problems involved in desisninn a building for the Christian liturgy....\"Now , a new understanding of the liturgy leads inevitably to afresh way of looking at the churches in which it is celebrated T h a t i s w h a t h a s h a p p e n e d ; a n d t h e s p e c t a c l e o f f e r e d b y o u r e x i s t i n echurches is depressing. A neglect of the liturgy and a defective understanding of it resulted in churches but imperfectly adapted tothe needs of the liturgy and, indeed, has often put many crfDstacles in the way of its proper celebration. It would be unfair to blame the architects. The fact is that, until recently, no architect would have received a sound fundamental analysis of a church on which to base his work.\" The churches reflect only too well the inadequate grasp of the hturgy that preyailed so long. So, efforts of the liturgical movementto restore a vigorous liturgical life had to include attemots to promote a new church architecture.\" As a refori^g impulse within the churches\u2014its crossing of sectarian boundaries is itself significant\u2014the liturgical movementIS of great importance. From the re-thinking of fundamentals only come\u2014the insistence that the communal celebration ofthe Eucharist is the centre of Christian activity , the \"rediscovery\" J active participation between the priest at the altarand the congregation, the position of the sermon (the \"Word\") withm the pattern of the whole\u2014this is the process of discoverinewhat the Church is. what is the \"kernel of the nut.\" The new attitude to the central liturgical act is certainly towards the closer mvolvement of man with spiritual reality , mentioned earlier as a n e c e s s i t y f o r o u r t i m e . \u00ab o \u00ab .. i.^f\u00b0 what the Church reaUy is. then theshell can be designed to suit the \"kernel.\"The main effect of this movement on the plan of the church is that the altar has a new importance. In all the churches illustrated in the book this is expressed by the altar being brought out into the same space as the congregation. In many cases it is freestanding, with the priest celebrating from behind and the congregation seated round three sides. In this connection we may remind ourselves that until the 9th century the \"basilican ordering\", with the prigst fac ing the congregation from behind the altar, was common practice.But at the same time we should ponder on the reason why it then changed. It would certainly seem a necessity to-day to bring the altar and all that goes on there \"into the open\", so that it can be experienced in the fullest possible consciousness by each individual.It is also true that Christian worship is a communal activity and that each individual must be aware that he worships with others. H^ever, this does not necessarily mean that in order toparticipate in what takes place at the altar it is helpful to meet the eyes of the congregation on the other side of the church. It is mteresting to compare this trend with the current fashion fortheatre \"in the round\"\u2014the stage brought into the auditorium, instead of behind the proscenium arch. It seems right that many of the trappings of church architecture and furnishings are discarded and that there is a new simplicity, dignity and honesty. This is all in tune with the modem need. But there is a danger that this particular manifestation, the freestanding altar, maybe as transitorya phase as the freestanding stage in the theatre. But in spite of the practical disadvantages of the freestanding altar (and that other weakness of many modem churches\u2014excessive visual exposure to the outside, whether to a forest as in Siren's delightful chapel in Finland, or to a campus as with Mies van derRohe's Chicago chapel, both illustrated in the book), this archi tecture seems to have many of the attributes, both good and bad, of the early functional architecture. Its form is derived from con siderations of tness for purpose. This goes a long way, given architectural sensibility, -towards a good building. But a church, perhaps even more than any building, should be an expression of the deeper functionalism which has been mentioned earlier. Surely we are beyond the \"plain brick boxes with no trioks\" stage\u2014a typical between-the-wars slogan, but apparently the new motto of the architects of the new liturgical movement. It is good for an architect to be given a clear brief, but that alone cannot produce great architecture. It is right no longer to hide the altar behiind the eikonostasis. But this new movement reasserts the central tmth of the mystery of the Resurrection: it does not dismiss it with rational argument. One may say. to use phrases of Steiner's, that it reinstates the \"Cosmic Christ\" after centuries of subservience to the \"historical Jesus.\" Why then should it rationalise, to such a degree, its archi tecture?There may be many reasons for this. It is partly perhaps that, difcult as it is to celebrate the Christian mystery at the altar in a way suited to modern man, it is even more difcult to bring that mystery further down into incarnation and express it in brick,concrete and timber, in stained glass, sculpture and fresco, in a modem way. For the time being it may be necessary to provide just the simple setting in which the liturgy can work. But if we accept this, it must be with the realisation that it is not the nal answer. It would seem that the liturgical movement has gone a long way in discovering the \"kernel\" of the modern church, but that the architects have hardly begun to nd the \"shell\" to suit it, in the sense of the spirit. They have so far concentrated on the physical functional, perhaps also the soul or feeling functional to a certain degree\u2014nbut hardly beyond this.The Christian Community, a Church also belonging truly to the present time, with a renewal of the sacraments, has gone deeply into the question of the right form for a modern church. Its members, like those of the new liturgical movement, seek through the Eucharist to achieve a living community of free individuals. They, too, in church planning, are faced with this vital question, ofthe position of the altar and the subtle relationship of the priest to the congregation. But being new and free of tradition, they can perhaps more easily adhere to some of the older forms and practices where these are seen to be true\u2014there is no temptation to be different for its own sake. For instance, in the new Christian Community church in West Berlin, the altar is placed within its own sanctuary, but in clear and full view of every member of the congregation. Although there should be full co-operation between priest and congregation, and both must be equally active within the ritual, there should also be recognition of the essential difference between the two activities. It is necessary to be conscious of the existence of two worlds, the material and the spiritual, and to know that the altar is the threshold between them. In the design of this church an attempt has been made, not unsuccessfully, to convey, architecturally, a feeling of these twoworlds and of the mystery that can lead across the threshold from one to the other. Without losing the unity of the whole, the essen tial duality of nave and sanctuary, and the importance of their meeting-point, are clearly expressed in this building in a subtle and satisfying way.In these alternatives\u2014the freestanding altar with the priest behmd, and the \" altar of God\" with the artistic representation of Christ behind and the priest in front\u2014<:an perhaps be seen the two lines of descent of the origin of the Eucharist. For there are two ways of regarding the altar , as the table of the Last Supper and asthe tomb of the Resurrection. From the rst point of view, one canrightly see the priest standing behind the table and welcoming the congregation which is around him to come and join in fe saCTa-mental meal. But the altar as the tomb continues the early Christian tradition, still prevalent in the Eastern Church, of Christ having revealed the form of the Eucharist during the forty days of His Resurrection. In this conception, behind the altar can stand only the resurrected Christ. There are other details of church furnishings which are\" also in question by the churches\u2014for instance, the necessity for both lectern and pulpit. These, for the reading of the Gospel and the preaching of the sermon, are traditionally kept apart. It would seem that this may not be just an arbitrary matter, but signies the real difference between the universal Word and the persoinal word. The alternatives, of delivering both from the altar or both from a pulpit/ lectern, although now adapted in some churches, would not seem so mwardly right. A further alternative, one adopted by the Christian Community, is for the Gospel to be read from the altar, emphasising its importance in the liturgy, and the sermon from the pulpit\u2014eliminating the lectern altogether. There is also the question of the exact position of the pulpit in relation to the altar\u2014of importance when the sermon is part of the Communion, service. The position of the font is another point which has been re considered in many churches. The traditional position at the west end is impracticable if the congregation for a baptism is large and the seats are xed facing the altar. The font is mow sometimes placed at the east eni in a formal relationship to altar and pulpit; it may even be made mobile and wheeled from the west to the east when needed! 'What is the answer to the problem of present-day church archi tecture? It is certain that the imitation of past styles, however watered down and \"modernised,\" is not the right answer. Nor, much as is the pleasure it gives, is the riotous exuberance of a Gaudi. Nor, much as the reason for the austerity is appreciated, is the economical \"genuine liturgical shed\" of the liturgical move ment. That is the negative side. The positive answer will come from an understanding of this situation, together with\u2014and this seems to be the most vital ingredient\u2014a deep understanding of the mysteries of Christianity in relation to the freedom of man. Architects of the future will then develop a church architecture which will be \"functional on the level of the spirit,\" the forms of which will have resulted, not simply from the external working of the liturgy, but also from an inner penetration of its essential being. 84 85Emerson, Rudolf Steiner, and the Fire in the West Virginia Moore R a l p h W A L D O E M E R S O N ' S l i f e w a s a q u i e t c o n fl a g r a t i o n .

The re was concealed. Neighbours saw only a long, lean, large-nosed Boston Yankee, looking like a benevolent eagle, who devoured literature and walked in the woods. He was walking towards his destiny. After graduating from Harvard, he followed his father into the Unitarian ministry. Then, shaken by the death of his young wife Ellen, he asked himself what he was doing in this post of \" famine \" and \"pale negations.\" Were the churches feeding man's moral nature? Very little; that seemed the terrible truth. Plagued by doubts, he resigned his pastorship of the Old North Church; and presently sailed to Europe not so much to see its sights as to meetsome of its great men. Virtue he loved, and virtue inhered in human beings. A year later, stimulated by talks with Landor, Coleridge, Wordsworth and, above all, Thomas Carlyle at Craigen- puttock in Scotland, he came back to Massachusetts, bought a house in the village of Congord, married Lydia Jackson (renamed Lidian) and, to earn a living wJiile preserving his freedom, set up as a lecturer. An outwardly uneventful but inwardly exciting life. His rst book, a 95-page anonymous Essay on Nature, was a manifesto of his essential philosophy; a kicking away of Niton's physics and Locke's psychology of sensation, indeed of the wholerationalistic, mechanistic, deterministic universe then in vogue; at o c s i n f o r t h o s e w h o w o u l d s e e G o d f a c e t o f a c e , a n d e x p e r i e n c e rst-hand the presence and power of the spirit. In consciousness, he held. \" Nature is the incarna tion of thought.\" Therefore it had something to say to man morally, and man, authentic man, each free, setf-reliant, creative individual, could learn to manifest what he was in potentiality, to change himself, to grow. The objective was wholeness. \"Thereason why the world lacks unity and lies broken and in heaps,\" says Emerson, \" is because man is disunited with himself.\" Everyone, including the scientist and the religious person, must learn to use all his faculties; use both reason and insight, perception and love, and be \"resolute to detach every object from personal relations.\" Only such a \"faithful thinker\" could do what must be done; \"ikindle science with the re of the holiest affections,\" so that God could \"go forth anew into creation.\" \"Nurtured by unfailing fountains,\" man had the ability to \"draw at his need inexhaustible power.\" The small booik had a sizeaible impact. Soon Emerson and such kindred spirits as Henry Ripley, Bronson Alcott, Theodore Parker and William Ellery Channing had formed a loose-knit group which would come to be known as the Transcendental Club. Emerson, its acknowledged spokesman, called it the \" party of the future,\" meaning of hope and moral regeneration. Meeting at irregular intervals, they talked about Plato's great thesis, mind over matter; about Oriental wisdom; about the superiority of the qualitative over the quantitative; about the blindness of materialists who think causes lie in objects, in the senses, rather than in thought, will, love, imagination, inspiration, intuition; about nature as an ascending spiral saturated with divinity; about the \"thing-in-itself\" of the Gennan idealists, andthe \" inner light\" of the Quakers; about people's need of people, and the fecundity of solitude. It was meditation in solitude that bred Emerson's Phi Beta Kappa address at Harvard in 1837, \"The American Scholar,\" inwhich he spoke of the resources, obligations and ^ory of a mind devoted to truth; and his address brfore the Divinity School of Harvard in 1838 in which, while exalting moral strivings, he shook his audience to its foundations. \"A Daniel!\" cried one man leaping to his feet. And another, \" We are all dead men.!\" But his message also stirred up stubborn opposition from dry- minded traditionalists led by the Rev. Mr. Andrews Norton, Harvard Professor of Divinity and \"pope\" of the Unitarians. Periodicals bristled. New England was raked by storm. In. 1841 Emerson, eye of the hurricane, published Essays, First Series, a consolidation of his lectures on the nature the universe and man; proving once again that there was no more fat on his mind than on his body, and that he wished to say only quintessential things. \"The simplicity of the universe is very different,\" he says,\" from the simplicity of the -machine,\" being alive, and taking its reality from the spirit. But even the material world\u2014\" shows,\" 87appearance only\u2014had its meaning; this symbol, this \"cipher of the world.\" Behind lay a vast purpose, and absolute justice. \"All things are moral.\" A perfect equity adjusts its balance in all parts.Hence reincarnation and karma; hence the \"law of compensation.\" \"Every act rewards itself. ... You cannot do wrong without suffering wrong,\" and must \"pay at the last your own debt.\" Therefore the ofucialness of freewill; Emerson stresses the will. \"He who does a good deed is instantly ennobled; he who does a mean deed is by the action itself reduced.\" And again: \"Ordeal by performance is the test of all intention.\" The scheme of thingswas hard but rewarding: a continual challenge. Be, and not seem. ... Let us . . . learn that truth alone makes richand great.... We are the photometers, we the irritable goldleaf and tinfoil that measure the accumulations of the subtle element. We know the authentic effects of the true re through every one of its million disguises. Know how? By the \"presence of the eternal in every perishing man,\" by man's highest princiiple, his true self, guarantor of his perfectibility, the means by which, gradually, his lower nature canbe puried and redeemed. \" We grant that human life is mean, but how did we nd out that it was mean ? . . . Man is a stream whose source is hidden.\" This book (along with a second series of essays, and Repre sentative Men and his poetry) was a trumpet call that roused wills and gave a sense of largeness. It quickened a counter-movement to Ameria's growing materialism. America, the far West: land where, as Altoertus Magnus once noted, earth-forces \" work upon the body as a magnet upon iron \"; where matter , so to speak, is densest, and gravity triumphant. The ancient Book of Enoch, quoted in the New T estament, tells how angels took the patriarch to the West and showed him ... a great mountain of bard rock . . . . . , three dark, but one bright and with a fountain of water in its midst. . . . And I saw a burning re that ran without ceasing. Rock: matter at its densest. Water: soul's refreshment. Fire: that of suffering, that of judgment, that of the spirit. Emerson knew this mountain, fountain and re; knew that, though materialism was not conned to America, being a world phenomenon, here the world-issue, primacy of matter or spirit, was coming to a head. His comment while speaking of heroes: \" ThereIS re enough to fuse a mountain of ore.\" And when he described another running re, he described him self: ^ware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet. Thenall things are at risk. It is as when a conflagration has broken out m a great city, and no man knows what is safe, or where it will end.Fame did not alter this dangerous man's way of life. He still gave himself in love and humility to nature, books and people.And he had a new friend, a neighbour fourteen years his junior but already showing signs of genius, Henry Thoreau, a sturdy character rapidly becoming as dear to him as his T ranscendentalists. Meanwhile he was loyal to such old friends on his Ubrary shelves as the shapers of the V edas, Kant, Fichte and Schelling) and, most import ant, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.His knowledge 5 Goethe had begun, early, when older brother William, returning from theological studies in Gemany, recommended the great German. So strong was Einerson s admira tion that he would have visited Weimar on his tnp to Europe if Goethe had not forestalled it by dying. As it was, he heard Goethep r a i s e d b y C o l e r i d g e a n d C a r l y l e . a n d o n h i s r e t u r n t o ^ e r i c a h eread\u2014in a little clearing in the pine woods by W alden Pond where the \"waterflies seemed full of happiness '\u2014^the rest of Goethe s fty-odd volumes.And felt an ever closer kinship. For Goethe, too, despised juiceless learning; Goethe, too, saw nature as descended from the highest, and art as namre transfomed from what it was to what it might be; saw everythmg ensouled: an aoostle of life. Writing at a table in the middle of hisjtbraiy, droDDinn his nne hv one to the cnmson carpet, Em^nc o u k d I t ^ k u p a t a s m a l l b r o n z e m a n t e l - ' b u s t o H j ^ t f e . T o t h i n k that, working on opposite sides of the ocean, they had Imth swung towards a new method of knowledge, one which proceeded not by abstract theorizing but by observation, meditation and, above all, a sense of responsibility to the whole. It was an unbreakable b o n d : a e s t r i p l e x . . c c . n . Emerson's allegiance to Goethe was lifelong. Near fty he wrote in his Journal: Goethe is the pivotal man of the old and new times.... If you havenot read Goethe or the Goetheans you are an old fogy , and belong with the antediluvians. A n d n o t i n g h i s c e n t u r y ' s c h i e f c u l t u r a l e v e n t s : \" G o e t h e w a s t h ecow from which all their milk was drawn. onHA comparison of the two men shows further agre^ents andsome differences. Emerson's sense of kinship was weU-founded.not only for the reasons given above but because both had an almost boundless capacity for wonder , and stood, amid partialnws, for the complete man. On the other hand, Goethe had a wider range of genius; wrote not only poetry and essays, like Emerson,but also novels, short stories, plays (including the Faust), and scientic works on such subjects as the metamorphosis of plants.human morphology and (challenging Newton) light and colour. Which is to say he had a universality not shar^ fey Emerson. But in philosophy Emerson walked unique. Here he entered a door closed to Goethe: explored (though not systematically) the problem of what constitutes the world and man, bringing up to fullconrciousness in the process (as discussed) innumerable questions having to do with the ego, the self, the eternal entelechy of man, along with related problems of the will as one of the functions ofthat higher being. \" Obey thyself.... There is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works.\" Man, to be truly man, nmst be his own taskmaster (as V ergil tells Dante to be Iking and bishop \" over his own soul). Moreover, having experienced the higher self from within,Emerson was able to see it in others, with the result that he con ceived a^ passion for mankind and would have \"died for theuniverse.\" For he believed that individuality had a purpose beyond Itself: that all men were brothers. \"The soul stipulates for no private good: that which is private I see not to be good.\" Andfurther, \"A man is born ... to suJffer for the benet of others likethe noble rock maple which . . . bleeds for the service of man.\" Now anyone familiar with Rudolf Steiner's exposition of what he calls the \"Consciousness Soul\"\u2014the level of development man kind IS just beginning to attoin, the \"kernel\" of consciousness, or soul within the soul,\" living above the sensations and passionswhile devoted to impersonal truth\u2014can see that Emerson not only speaks about but from this Consciousness Soul; that he was one ofits great pioneer representatives. 'Which poses the question of his relationship to Dr. Steiner J o r n w h e n E m e r s o n w a s f t y - e i g h t , a n d t w e n t y - o n e w h e n E m e r s o ndied in loo2). On the basis of Steiner's bond with Goethe, and Emerson's own, that question would be in order. The perfection with which EmersOT illustrates the Consciousness Soul, and the ardour withw h i c h h e w o r k e d f o r i t , h a v e m a d e t h e q u e s t i o n m o r e p r e s s i n g . Did Emerson, while looking back to Goethe consciously , look forward unconsciously to Steiner ? Perhaps the best means of throwing light on the question is a point-by-point comparison:IT iough EmcKon lived and preached the Consciousness Soul(without cdling it that), he was quite unable to do what Steinerdid: descnbe in detail man's past, present and future stages of development, thus characterising more precisely and placing the C o n s c i o u s n e s s S o u l . ^ ^ y l u c Though Emerson believed in the \"shining relations between allthings and invoked a vital universe, he could not, like Steiner , onthe basis of supersensible cognition, explain the earth's changingc o n d i t i o n s , m s p a c e a n d t i m e , i n r e l a t i o n t o s u n a n d p l a n e t s . 90Though Emerson anticipated Steiner's aflrmation of a huge intelligible pattern of history with \"subtle links\" binding the ages together, he stopped short of discussing in depth, as Steiner did,those links and their connections with the hierarchies. Though Emerson saw reincarnation as integral to the design, he was without Steiner's power to elaborate, with examples, how karma works. Though Emerson had a total respect for the sound esotericliterature within his experience, indeed laid it under contribution, and would have instantly understood Steiner's warnmg that for every one step taken in pursuit of higher knowledge, take^ree mthe perfecting of your own character,\" and though he beheved staunchly in the possibility of true vision (\"we distinguish the announcements of the soul, its manifestations of its own nature, bythe term revelation, for this communication is ^ mflux^ of me divine mind\"), citing the dfl/mon-iUuminations of Socrates, umon of Plotinus, conversion of Paul, aurora of Boehme, and other \"blastings by excess of light\"\u2014still he seems to have had o^yglimmers of certain higher faculties which Sterner deals with exhaustively.And though Emerson extolled balance to the sfaes. he did not,like Steiner, go on to call a balance between thinking, feeling and willing a prerequisite for love in Christ s sense. And so forth. Obviously there are vast differences in kind and degree. Nevertheless, when one considers Emerson's central drive, andcountless insights in harmony with Anthr^>os<^hy, it becomes strikingly clear that the relationship between Ralph Waldo Emersonand Rudolf Steiner is no casual one. Nor is the consanguinity , at whatever remove, lessened one jot by what has been called Emerson's revolt against Christianity.E^rson did not revolt against Christ, only against narrow sectarianism, against rationalism usurping the rightful place of a higher cognition, against decay and \"wasting unbelief,\" againstdenial of the stupendous truth that man has a stake m divinity. Though he did not, with Steiner, call the Event of Golgotha the hinge upon which all history swings, he recognised it as enormously consequential: and bowed before Christ, saying, \"Alone in allhistory he estimated the greatness of man.\" Speaking of the reof the spirit: Socrates believed in man's moral nature and knew and declared the fact that virtue was the supreme beauty. He was capable therefore of enthusiasm. Jesus Christ existed for it. He is its Voice to the world. Moreover, Emerson places love where Christ places it: rst. Here is the beginning of an intense little poem: 91Give all to love, Obey thy heart; Friends, kindred, days, Estate, good-fame. Plans, credit and the Muse\u2014 Nothing refuse. True, Emerson praises the ncibler pagans; in fact Plutarch became for him a kind of \"tuning-key.\" But his eye for the wisdom of the ages conrms rather than disqualies him as a Christian in a sense compatible with Steiner's teachings, for no-one has recognised more cordially than the founder of Anthroposophy the truth that some non-Christians have abounded in spiritual perception; that an elevated paganism can be more truly Christian than a pinched and bloodless \"Christianity\"; and that an earnest seeking after the truth has more value than the shuffling of warmed-over stereotypes\u2014this in line with the Book cf Revelation's message to the Laodiceans: \"So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.\" Really Emerson's discontent with historical Christianity is a species of proof that he strove towards a purer, larger, \"cosmic\" Christianity; at its threshold stood poised, expectant; ready, or almost, to step through the barrier. But in spite of evidence of a signicant tie between Emerson and Steiner, some of which has the earmarks of preparation and completion, one hesitates to call Emerson a forerunner; the word is too strong. Steiner would have taught in the same way if Emerson had never lived; and though the latter undoubtedly was a major factor in changing the spiritual climate of America in the general direction of what would later be taught as Anthroposophy , who can estimate the degree of his influence or its total results ? But something else is pertinent. T o-day most literate Americans, if asked to name the greatestwriters of the United States, would place Emerson somewhere among the rst ve: a fact of import in a country peculiarlythreatened but ipotentially blessed by its preoccupation with the deadnesses of materialism. In a 1919 lecture, \"Spiritual Emptiness and Social Life\" (printed in the 1954 Golden Blade), Dr. Steiner puts the curse-and-bless paradox in this way: We must recognise that since Che middle of the 15th century the spirit has to be brought to birth through encountering what is dead. . . . Men who are impelled to live earnestly with natural science and todiscern what is deathly, corpse-like, in it, they will make it possible for the spirft iteelf to come adive in their souls. Natural science exists far more for the, purpose of educating men than Tor communicating truths about nature . . . devoad ot smrit thniian it ig And so it was only in the recent past, in the era after Goetheanism, that the spint ghmmered forth. ...And he makes virtually the same point in the 1920 lecture cycle, \"Imperialism,\" when he explains an advantage-in-disadvantage,the \"Mystery the West.\" Because preoccupation with thinking,\" he says, the Anglo-American world isfrom a spiritual standpoint a kind of vacuum, but, thanks to this very condition, the principle of the vacuum must begin to work: namely, a vacuum invites the entrance of something new and different; in the West's case, pure spirit. It is this reversal, in America, for which Emerson stands. His efforts may appear to have failed, inasmuch as to-day philosophic Naturalism, with its denial of G<^, soul, immortalityand true freedom, dominates most American higher eduction ; and, outside the universities, materialism often seems to be on a rampage. But materialism by its nature is flamboyant and noisy ,the spirit quiet; and for those with eyes and eare lh\u00aere is ample testimony that, deep down in millions ^ Amenwns, there liw^conscious or unconscious, a erce unslaked thu-st for the spirit, a longing for transformation of the material into the moral; for ac o m m u n i t y o f s o u l s t r a n s c e n d i n g r a c e a n d p l a c e ; f o r m m e n s i t i e s :Emerson's \"perfect circle\" around which mie can always\u2014ad infinitum\u2014another. Fortunately the Emersonian stream flows on, its volume often underestnnatw. \"Against life,\" Emerson can still be heard saying, what can d e a t h d o ? \" ^ , , , .

We can leave it there. 92 93Knowing About Thinking Alan Howard Following upon the article in the Golden Blade last year\u2014\"Thinking about Knowing\"\u2014a reader sent in the following questions, which the Editors have asked me to answer: Can anyone elucidate, with concrete examples, what js meant hy 1. Pure thinking; 2. Sense-free thinking; and 3. Thinking without the instrumentality of the hrain ? Do the higher modes of cognition \u2014 Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition\u2014fall into any of these categories ? Have we to do here with different levels of reality ? To attempt to answer these questions thoroughly could lead us very much farther than I have allowed myself to go; but the following, such as it is, contains, I believe, the ^st of what is involved. As it has none the less spread itself out into a small article, for which some sort of a title seemed necessary, none other seemed so appropriate\u2014or so inevitable\u2014as what appears above! \u00bb In October, 1909, Rudolf Steiner gave a course of lectures in Berlin on \"The Christ-Impulse and the Development of the Ego- Consciousness.\" Just before these lectures Dr. Carl Unger had already spoken on \"The Ego and the Non-Ego and its Compre hension of Itself according to the Theory of Knowledge.\" Dr. Steiner referred to this lecture of U'nger*s in the opening words of his own course, saying: \". . . the way in which Dr. Unger spoke of the Ego we caU the form of Pure Thought.\" Fortunately that lecture has been preserved for us in an essay, together with two others 'by the same author, in a little book entitled Die Grundlehren des Geisteswissenschaft. An English translation exists under the title. Principles of Spiritual Science on an Epistemplogical Basis; and for anyone who does not \"disdain the application of strenuous inteUectual exertion in the effort to attain higher knowledge\" I know of no better example of Pure Thinking in the whole field of anthroposophical literature\u2014withthe exception, of course, of Steiner's own books on the subject. Of these. The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity is the supreme example. One cannot read this book without thinking; and as thebook itself\u2014at least, the first part of it\u2014is almost entirely about Thinking, one is consequently all the time thinking about Thinking.And that is Pure Thinking. What the book itself so strongly recommends\u2014the observation of Thinking\u2014is all the time beingdone through the very act of reading it; and when those \"two pillars of all man's spiritual striving \"\u2014Observation and Thinking-coincide, as they must do here, we are unquestionably in the midst of pure thought. It will follow then that \"sense-free Thinking is what Pure Thinking must also be by its very nature; and can only really be an alternative term for the same thing. For what can Thinking at rst think about but its own activity and its results, if the senses cannot or are forbidden to contribute ? . ,. , There is, however, a variant of Pure Thrnkmg for which the term \" sense-free\" might be more appropriate. This is when we think about the results of spiritual scientic research. The spiritual investigator observes spiritual facts and beings. We think aboutthem. He actually sees them; but he does so wiA organs (senses) which he cannot at rst assume us to possess. Therefore he puts his observations in the form of concepts which we think atwut. And as long as we do so, bearing in mind that we are thrnkmgabout something to which our ordinary senses have no acc^s whatsoever, then we do so with what cannot be anything else but\" sense-free \" Thinking. * T h i n k i n g i s t h e m o s t i n t i m a t e a c t i v i t y o f o u r h u m a n e x p e r i e n c e .The whole nature of ourselves as beings boimd up with t^\" naive-realistic experience of Thiniking. In the nal analysis, I am o n l y I b e c a u s e I c a n t h i n k I , a l t h o u g h m y t ^ k m g i s b y n o m e a n sconned to so narrow a eld.

Among these others is a bram. Now it is quite conceivable that aU sorts of thmgs go on in my brain when I think; but it is absolutely inconceivable that m my most direct and intimate apprehension of myself as a thmking being I should identify myself with a (to me) secondary and GB\u20147altogether unconscious activity, going on in a medium that I knowof only by repute\u2014my brain. The fact that external observation and the instruments it uses can discover all kinds of movements going on in my brain when I think, adds nothing to my experienceof Thinking in any other place than in me. I often quite involun tarily get up and walk about when I think, or scratch my head, orrub nay chin, but no one would describe these movements as Thinking\u2014I, least of all. They merely accompany Thinldng. They do not initiate it; nor do the movements which go on in my brain. Thinking must rst of all be grasped in its purely spiritual nature as something taking place in the human Ego which hasbecome conscious of itself. Whatever other relation it may have to movenaents or processes in an observable medium pertaining to the Ego, is, for that Ego, a subsidiary phenomenon. Therefore alltalk of the brain as something that thiics is simply putting the cart before the horse. / think; and because I have a brain, the spiritual nature of the world is transmitted to me in the form of thoughts. The brain is an organ of intercourse between me and the world of spirit. The spirit approaches from the one side, I from the other.W e r e - c o p i s e e a c h o t h e r i n t h o u g h t s . T h i s i s w h y S t e i n e r s o o f t e n speaks of thoughts as shadows of spiritual beings, not those beings themselves; and why he said that a lecture like Unger's referred toabove could not have been given two or three thousand years ago,for \"there would have been no human brain capable of being an instrument for translating these truths into such thoughts.\" We must make the distinction between Thinking and thoughts; and realise that in Thinking we have an activity which is not fettered to a physical organ like the brain, but which uses that organ ay a nwps for apprehending the spiritual world in thoughts.Only thus shall we be able to see how Thinking, by strengtheningits own independent activity , can become a means of direct access to the spmhial world. For if Thinking really were fettered to the \u00ab were just a function of a physical organ, thenall talk of spiritual cognition would be meaningless. This leads us directly over from Thinking to higher cognition. I apprehend myself in the rst place as I by an act of Pure Thi^ing. If I want to know more about myself and the kind ofworld I as such inhaibit, then I can only think further about it.But m so doing something else steps in which begins slowly to alter the whole character of the thinking experience. In that \"further Mnl^g ' one comes into the sphere of that special form of PureThinking known as Meditation nad Concentration; and with it thebeginning of those higher forms of cognition known as ImaginationInspiration and Intuition. It is impossible of course to add anythingto what Sterner has said about Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition; but it is possible, just because of all he has said aboutThinking, to see how they are, one might say , the logical outcome,the living spiritual developinent of what has been described. For Thinking by its own nature takes one to that liimt beyond which Thinking alone cannot go. It is that limit of which Sterner speaksin the rst of his Leading Thoughts, where he says that if we would observe how we become conscious of these linuts, we would nd inthe very consciousness of those limits the faculties to transcend t h e m . \" . . For, fundamentally, all knowledge is one; and ^ truth, no difference between esoteric knowledge and all the rest of man's knowledge and prociency.\" As human beings, \"limited\" at rst to the naturaUy endowed senses given us at birth, the world is to begin with pure picture-consciousness. W e experience a world of images--- Imagmation at a lower level of experience. GraduaUy , as our Thinkmg begms \"to weave its threads from being to bemg, speaking to us in concepts and ideas. We have, ,of experience, risen to \"Inspiration.

Xrt his is \"I nt uit ion. \" t he source of all scienUc and aesthetic creativity , on that lower level. But this is not the end of aU cognitive experience open to man.It is but the cross-over point in the lemmscate ^that ^8'^\u00ae ^I t I S b u t t h e c r o s s o v e r ^ p a r t s b u t i s \u2014 enclosed in one whole continuous line, and which, if we imagine ourselves \\ following along the outside of it in oneI part, carries us without a break into/ the inside of it on the other, and vice- versa. Similarly, so-called sensible and supersensible cognition are but two parts of one whole, in which what is inner here is outer there. What\" encloses \" the two apparently separate spheres, what is the \"one continuous line \" is pure \" spiritual activity \"; and when a man, therefore, begins to think about ThinH^g itself, he reaches that c r o s s ^ o v e r p o i n t a t w h i c h , i f h e c a n s u s t a i n h i m s e l f w i t h s u f c i e n tM M \u00ae h e m u s t u l t i m a t e l y p a s s . o v e r t o s u p e r s e n s i b l e c o g n i t i o n .F o ? ^ a t w e c a U K n o w l e d g e h e r e i s b u t a s p e c i a l c a s e o f K n o w l e d g ein general; and sense-cognhion itself is possible only as the pre requisite and presupposition for supersensible cognition.And so the question about \"different levels of reality\" really answers itself; save only (to quote Steiner*s illustration to his rst leading Thought) that what is for \"the sh that swims up to thelimits of the water, and must needs return because he lacks the physical organs to live outside this element,\" an absolute barrier,is for man a challenge and an opportunity. Though man also lacks the organs \" to live outside \" his cognitive element as yet, what he has matured in the power of intuitive thought contains within it the germs of other organs which will carry him far beyond his presentenvironment. But those organs are spiritual organs; ond only the recognition of Thinking as the preconditioning \" spiritual activity \"for them will enable him to nd in that same Thinking the possibility of \" the faculties to transcend those liinits.\" Baconian Science 'Come on!\" said Bacon, spitting on O.K.,\" I said,\" this fellow understands.\" Come, lads!

Rudolf Steiner describes the dramatic change that took place through this event; the whole spiritual and psychological life of man became altered by it, for what had once been experienced in the dark secrecy of the Mystery Schools through spiritual training, through cult andjitual, was now enacted before all men.In Christianity as Mystical Fact, Rudolf Steiner wrote in some detail of the main purpose of pre-Christian initiation, whose echo is to be found in the myths and legends of the ancient world. The training of the neophyte was to effect in him a transformation; he was to learn to become a \"different\" man. He was taught that there are different levels of Being and of understanding, and in climbing this stairwaj^ leading to spiritual wisdom and Imowledge he did not remain the same; he learnt that he must rise from the temporal to the eternal\u2014^that he must \" die and become \", he must awaken the divine within himself. Side by side with the Mystery Schools existed the religion of the people, directed by the priests. Very few of the people were chosento be neophytes of the Mysteries: much was demanded of a pupil; the dangers on the path were grave and they were recognised. But with the Mystery of Golgotha a new era opened; the Incarnate Saviour became the Hierophant and all men could participate. \" It must have weighed on the heart of Jesus like a nightmare,\" Rudolf Steiner wrote, \" that among those standing outside there may have been many unable to nd the way. He wished to lessen the gulf between those to be initiated and the * people*. Christianity was to be the means by which everyone would nd the way. If anyone is not yet ready, at least he is not cut off from the possibility of sharing, to a certain degree unconsciously, in the stream flowing through the Mysteries.\" Through faith every man could now share in the same spiritualstream and believe in die existence of the Divine, personied in the Son of Man. And by faith he could save his soul. But there remained for the Christian mystic a path of initiation whereby he could consciously perceive what is contained in the mystery of Golptha. It is this conscious sharing in the mystical content of Christianity, in the light of the evolution of the Christ Impulse, thatconstitutes the path of the initiate to-day. The concept of grace was ever-present in Steiner's teaching, and insistence on the development of Being\u2014of moral qualities-Hvhich should keep in advance of the increase in l^owledge. Though he did not minimise the value of faith, he foresaw that in the present dilemma of mankind faith itself would seek for knowledge and thebulwarks of tradition and of exoteric Christianity would not ea^ystand against the inroads of new scientic discovery , l^oteric knowledge was becoming a necessity of life, not to be reserved for the few but given to the many. But it must be couched in such 100terms by the Initiate who gave it that the normal intellect of the time could comprehend it. Spiritual knowledge for the present age, he wrote, \"must be able to justify itself before the scientic mode of thinking of the time.\" From his very early years he had been faced with the problem of relating his own natural \"clear-seeing\" of the spiritual world with the phenomena of the physical world\u2014he had sought untir ingly and in considerable loneliness of soul to justify the reality, ofhis \"world of light\" and to bring it into harmony with the world of sense. One of the rst means of justication had come to him when, as a little chorister and server in a village church, he had found through the liturgy a way of mediation. All that he received in this way had been to him a matter of \"vital happiness.\" A few years later, as an adolescent, he became deeply immersed in philosophy and in attempting to build up within himself purely objective thiniking\u2014^thinking free from any influences from the realm of feeling. A further step was made in trying to establish a harmony between such a mode of thinking and the teachings of religion. Study of the history of the Church, its symbols and its dogma, became to him a \"vital matter\", for through them he cameto realise how the human spirit can nd its way consciously into the supersensible.These early experiences were the precursors of many others of the utmost signicance in the evolution of Rudolf Steiner's life and work, prior to the writing of Christianity as Mystical Fact. During the rst years of his maturity he had had difculty in establishing a relationship to traditional mysticism. His own experience of spiritual reality gave him a certain kinship with the great mystics, yet his approach to such reality was dissin^ar. While they, for theniost part, rejected thought in favour of feeling, his constant pre occupation lay in nding the way to the goal and content of mystical experience without loss of the activity of thinking\u2014for thought itself, he had perceived, was an activity of the spirit. His book. The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, written when he was in his early thirties, expressed \" the results of spiritual observa tion according to the method of natural science.\" His many years of work spent in editing and interpreting Goethe's scientic writ ings gave him\u2014as is becoming a well-known fact\u2014much help inthe evolution of his own spiritual experience. But he was to go much further yet. Towards the end of the century he went through what he describes as a revolution in his inner life. Up to this time he had been more at home in his \" world of light\" than in the sense world. But now this became changed and his capacities for observing the sense world were vastly enhanced. He believed that the sense world had something to reveal to him which it alone could reveal. The practice of medita tion, which he had long followed, now became indispensable to his mental life and the new demands upon it. T o relate knowledge 101obtained through sense-perception to his perception of the spiritual became an exercise in which he found the whole man participated, in thinking, feeling and willing. This formed a basis for the practice of self-observation and for an ever-increasing knowledge of man and the eternal nature of the ego. The chapter in his autobiography describing this revolution is one of the most arresting in the bookfor it heralds the new epoch in his life. But before this new epQch was entered upon, Rudolf Steiner went through some very severe battles in his soul-life, lasting from the close of his work on the Goethe archives until the production of Christianity as Mystical Fact. It has been asserted that certain expositions on Christianity he gave during this time were differentin view from those he gave later. He asked, however, that it should be noted that when he used the word Christianity in these exposi tions he had in mind what he termed the \"beyond\" teaching in the creeds\u2014a teaching which refers to a world of spirit beyond the powers of man to attain without the help of revelation. To him, the idea that there were barriers between the cognitional powers of man, when they were rightly developed, and spiritual luiowledge was meaningless. Furthermore, the idea that the moral life must proceed from precepts enjoined by authority from without was in opposition to his own teaching of ethical individualism\u2014^as expressed in his Philosophy of Spiritual Activity. To him the moral life should proceed \"not by way of precepts obeyed but out of the unfolding of the human soul and spirit, wherein lives the divine.\"The real content of Christianity he was seeking he did not nd in the creeds, but it was, he says, beginning germinally to unfold within him, and during his time of testing he was able to advance further only when he brought before his soul the evolution of Christianity. After the time of testing he submerged himself in Christianity and \"in the world in which the spiritual speaksthereof\". At about the turn of the century the germ increasingly unfolded, until nally he found that the evolution of his soul rested upon the fact that he \" stood before the Mystery of Golgotha inmost inward, most earnest joy of knowledge.\" TTie time had now come when Rudolf Steiner was to lay the rst foundations of his Anthroposophy, his great\u2014perhaps unparallelled\u2014synthesis of religion, science and art of which the Mystery of Golgotha formed the centre. It is of benet to the reader of Christianity as Mystical Fact to have some inkling of how this book came into being and to realise that it is not merely one more of the many scholarly attempts to nd links between pre-Christian mysticism and the origins of Christianity, but a work arising from the spiritual experience of an Initiate, expressed in terms of dbjective thought. Rudolf Steinermade the point that he had receiv^ nothing from the ancient mys teries: \"What I possess of spiritual knowledge,\" he wrote in his autobiography, \" is entirely the result of my own researches. Whenany knowledge has come to me, then only have I set it beside whatever of the' ancient knowledge' has already been made public from any source, in order to point out the harmony in mood and, at thesame time, the advance that is possible to contemporary research.\" Though more than half a century has passed since the lectures contained in Christianity as Mystical Fact were given, the need for their teaching on the essence of Christianity has increased with the passage of the years. We are indebted to the translators and pub lisher of the new edition of the book for bringing to the English- speaking public at this time a version competently prepared and produced. It is a matter of regret, however, that the title of the book, chosen by Dr. Steiner with special care, has been abbreviated on the cloth cover to Christianity. Dr. Steiner made use of a large number of quotations from pre- Christian and early Christian literature and in this edition the best translations from sources readily available have been given. For example, we nd in the extracts from Plotinus that both StephenMcKenna and the Bohn edition have been drawn upon and in the case of a little story from the Hagigah, the text from The Soncino Talmud has been included. Brief and skilful biographical and descriptive notes on some of the gures mentioned in the text havebeen made, ranging from Aeschylus and Hippolytus to Hamack and Renan. Of special value are the reference notes to the various works of Philo of Alexandria from which Rudolf Steiner quoted m a n y p a s s a g e s .Mildred Kirkcaldy. Social Forms and Human Needs The Tension Between East and West. By Rudolf Steiner. Introduction by Owen Bareld. (Hodder & Stoughton, 21/-) O N r a i l w a y b o o k s t a l l s p a p e r b a c k s o n y o g a a b o u n d ; b i s h o p sseemingly banish God from Christian discourse. London Underground passengers are offered courses of Deep Meditation (why deep\u2014to keep up with freeze or X-rays?). Behind all thisthere broods the great armed \"peace\" that mocks former aspira tions to \" one world.\" Domestic social conflicts underline the mis understood variety of our lot. Few of the major works of Rudolf Steiner could be more appropriate to this situation than the present volume\u2014a new translation of the fourteen lectures he gave at the International Congress of the Anthroposophical Movement in Vienna in 1922. The value of the book is not as a prop to policy or in the ready display of \" answers\" to burning questions. Its purpose has a wider signicance: no less than to lift the social imagination to thelevel where insight can begin to fashion the new forms required. In addressing the large Congress audience, Steiner set himself two main tasks; to outline the evolution of human consciousness as a passage from the ancient East to modern West and to discuss theconnections between this process and the development of social structures. The rst ve lectures. Athroposophy and the Sciences, take up the rst task. The exposition leads from ancient Oriental forms of knowledge, here exemplified by yoga\u2014a method no longer appro priate\u2014^to the scientific outlook of the West, whose inner logic demands, in Steiner's argument, a further step to a science whichcan view the spirit with the same clarity and precision as man^d has learnt to apply to what is outwardly measureable. Apart, therefore, from any other consideration, this rst part is a valuable introduction to Steiner's science of the spirit, and moreover it is devoid of technical occult terms. Issued by a well-known London publisher to follow up the recent Centenary of Rudolf Steiner*s birth, time and choice could not be better met. The experience of the ancient oriental led him to regard the wofld around him as an echo of what he recognised as spirit within him. This echo he called maya\u2014illusion. But the westerner has Yds may a too: his involvement in the senses drowns his inner life, which Aen appears as a mere reflection of what is outside. His umer life is thus reduced to 'ideology\" \u2014 a reflection of outer circumstance, conditioned by economic or other factors. But theinert character of western thinking holds out the prospect of freedom. Shadows cannot compel: choice becomes possible. Against such a background Steiner describes those methods ofinner training and self-discipline by which, without sacrice of the positive achievements of the West, knowledge can be transformedinto a vital penetration \"into the external rhythm of the world,\" responding intimately to its processes. With a wry acknowledgment of the effect it may have on the susceptibilities of his audience,he characterises the artistic quality of living thinking which is capable of being developed into precise spiritual research. In the second half, Anthroposophy and Sociology , the spectrum ranges once again fronoi East to West; from a form of society ori^ally rooted in religious practice to the land where the properbusiness of its citizens is\u2014^business. Theocracy was a god-given form, received through the spiritual inspiration of those trained toexercise cultural and spiritual leadership. In the womb of theocracythe seculM State was born, and became the cockpit of right and i ^ g h t d u r i n g t h e l o n g c e n t u r i e s o f G r e e c e , R o m e a n d t h e i r m e d i e v a lafterglow. In our own time we are in labour with the birth of the economy as an autonomous sphere of activity to stand beside the pohtic^ realm of law and rights and the independent life of SDiritualand cultural endeavour. 104In clearly distinguishing these three spheres of human activity and the differing relationships they embody, Steiner saw the main hope of reconciling present social divisions. Institutions inheritedfrom the past come from instinctive sources. Commimity cannot be foimd by hanging on to or returning to forms which once had community within them. It is often forgotten that social life begins when two men meet. What relationship does their encounter embody\u2014is it instinctive, relying upon past forms, or prescribed by ideology, an abstract system? Steiner points out that, while we may rationalise our experience of each other by describing external appearances and inferring from these the existence of another self resembling our own; in fact we directly experience the other individual through an intuitive perception akin to the methods of spiritual research he has been describing. This means that if we are to avoid the pitfalls of external pro grammes and the prescriptions of ideology, the institutions required to serve human relationships must spring directly from an insight into the nature of the human being. Such relationships assume reality when they can follow the three principal needs of every man. Do we meet in freedom when the spirit is our business, in aware ness of each other's humanity when like meets like in democratic parley , in co-operation when the world's work is to be done?These relationships are daily woven in and through us: in so far as we actively distinguish them, we begin to transform the monolithic national State, whose tendency is to gather every walk of life under its wing, into a society founded on the harmonious interplay of autonomous spheres of activity . Where law and rightsare in question, democratic forms must prevail. Where the indi vidual spirit is to be cultivated, fully independent institutions are required: education may be deemed a right, but it does not then follow that the State should organise it. The emerging economic realm has yet to fashion the forms of association that will enable it properly to discharge its responsibilities without falling into individualist chaos or rigid centralism\u2014or resting in an uneasy posture facing both ways at once! Current trends in the West and in Russia throw a curious sidelight upon this last aspect. The \"capitalist\" West experiments with economic planning without so far evolving adequate forms, Russian economic planners warmly debate whether to use the capitalist criterion of the return on capital as a yardstick of efciency for economic units, instead of relying whoUy on meeting or exceeding production targets. For long ages the spiritual life of mankind was nourished from the East. The culture of the West, despite obvious divergences, is in some measure a last metamorphosis of this original source. What now wells up in Europe and the West as struggling individual will, as it emerges in democratic demands and economic thrust. 105has to be ennobled to new levels of consciousness, both individual and social. Mutual understanding between East and West awaits this transformation. Western ideology and technology are received as either very mixed blessing (\" neutralism,\" so ominously regarded in the West, appears to be an expression of this) or become the sinews of a new, materialist\" theocracy.\" Here the questions begin\u2014not only those posed by the under lying polarity of Bast and West, but by the more subtle resolutionsof it through the agency of Europe, and Middle Europe in particular. T o some comprehension of these Steiner tried to rouse his audience in Vienna in 1922, before the darkest tendencies of West and East united in Hitler's grim tyranny, and later in Owen Bareld's telling phrase from the Introduction, \"the interval between East andWest [was] reduced, in Berlin, to the thickness of a wall.\" The reader must be left to pose these questions to himself: certainly he can nd no rmer foundation than in this book upon which to build an understanding of the curious cross-currents, smouldering antagonisms and occasional happy encounters of the twentieth century.He will be aided in his exploration by an excellent Introduction, setting the occasion of the lec^res and relating them to subsequent events, a serviceable index and a fluent English translation, by Dr. B. A. Rowley, which makes the best it can of a fairly literal rendering. Perhaps the day will come when a translator will be expected to render the discoursive content of a lecture into his own, compact, English prose. John Salter. Dr. Robinson's Religion Honest to God. By John A. T. Robinson, Bishop of Woolwich. (S.C.M. Press paperback, 5/-). D r . R o b i n s o n ' s b o o k i s f a r b e t t e r t h a n t h e r a t h e r c o n f u s e d a r t i c l ein which he tried to summarise its message in the Observer last February. Without that publicity, it might not have so quicklybecome a best-seller, but it would certainly have been widely read and discussed, for it gives simple and honest expression to a way of thinking about Christianity which\u2014'both in its insights and in its limitations\u2014reflects a trend of the times. The roots of this way of thinking are in the Continental theology developed by Tillich, Bultman and Bonhoeffer (from all of whomthe Bishop quotes extensively), but in this country also it now has some influential exponents. Its essential feature is that it accepts the current scientic world-picture and asks how much of Christian ity, or of any religion, can remain valid in an atmosphere very different from that in which all religions grew up. The old conflicts 106between the ndings of science and Biblical chronology, or between the Genesis story and Darwinian evolution, are assumed to belong to the past. The conflict now is both deeper and less sharply dened: it is a conflict of credibilities. Following Bonhoeffer, the Bishop asks whether the concept of God as indicating any sort of personal Being, existing \"out there\" in the cosmos, is either credible or necessary for modern minds. Science can tell us\u2014or in time will be able to tell us\u2014all that can be reliably known about the realms of nature, and to suppose that behind nature there is any kind of \" supernature \" is to indulge in a form of mythological thinking which we ought to have left behind. So where can God still be found? In the depth of our own being. Dr. Robinson replies, quoting Tillich. And he goes on to insist that where the \" God within\" comes to active expression is above all in personal relationships, the communion of friends. One reason\u2014^I would say the fundamental reason\u2014^why this view of religion gains a widely responsive hearing to-day is that it corresponds fairly closely to the outlook which comes most naturally to the \" onlooker consciousness \", the mode of consciousness typical of our epoch, the epoch of the Consciousness Soul. T o this mode of consciousness (from which modern science has arisen) it must seem that the universe is empty of the Divine. A further effect of this stage in the evolution of consciousness is that personal relationships acquire a somewhat new character. The old distinctions of rank and class are no longer taken for granted; the uniforms that marked them tend to disappear. People no longer meet on the basis of everyone \"knowing his place\"; they tend to meet nakedly as persons; with the result that personal relationships become both more exacting and potentially more fruitful. Hence it is not surprising that many people to-day, if they accept the scientic world-picture, should nd the heart of religion in per sonal relationships, and there need be no quarrel with that emphasis in itself. In our epoch religion has to be based not on authority but on experience, and personal relationships are something that people can deeply experience and believe in, even if they believe in little else. Here, too, they experience something that should always be central for Christianity, as it was for the early Christians, who impressed the world by their life of fellowship. \" We know that wehave passed from death into life, because we love the brethren.\" ^ But an exclusive emphasis on personal relationships, and the assumption that the \" supranatural\" must be illusory\u2014this means in effect, that nature and the earth and the entire outer cosmos are to be relinquished by religion and handed over to science; a proce dure thoroughly in line with the aims of the Ahrimanic powers. Dr. Robinson quotes the New English Bible rendering of a well-known passage from Romans, VIII, 38-39, but with an 11 John, III, 14. ' 107omission indicated by dots. St. Paul's conviction, he says, is that\" there is nothing in death or life .... in the world as it is or the world as it shall be, in the forces of the universe, in heights or depths\u2014^nothing in all creation that can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" The omitted words here are \" in the realm of spirits or superhuman powers.\" Presumably they are omitted because they point to that supranatural realm which the Bishop wishes to relegate to mythology. In the Authorised Versionthe words are \" nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers \". And the Greek text makes it clear that St. Paul was here referring to members of the Hierarchies\u2014^Angeloi, Archai, Dynameis. There would seem to be no place for the Hierarchies in Dr. Robinson's religion. course, he is not alone in that. The Hierarchies, even if not dismissed as an antique superstition, are effectively absent from most modem expositions of Christianity. But his book can help one to realise what this loss means. The Hierarchies mediate between the transcendence and the immanence of the Divine. With out them, God may come to signify something so lacking in trans cendence that immanence becomes merely inwardness, hardly dis tinguishable from the best in human nature. That is the direction in which Dr. Robinson's religion leads. Or, at the opposite, Barthian, extreme, the Divine may be so lacking in inunanence that God becomes wholly transcendent, remote from and hardly approachable by sinful man. Dr. Robinson afrms with evident sincerity that he remains a faithful Christian, but he is in fact expounding an \" onlooker con sciousness \" form of religion without recognising this for what it is \u2014^not a religion that has at last emerged from the mists of myth ology and superstition into a clear rational daylight, but one thatreflects a particularly limited\u2014and in some essential respects a darkened\u2014phase in the evolution of consciousness. If this limitedkind of religion came to be generally accepted, Christianity would tend, I think, to fade into Humanism; of which Rudolf Steiner said that it emerged as an outlook only when a true picture of man had been lost. Nevertheless, Dr. Robinson has written a book which seems to me attractive, and in some respects valuable. Attractive, because it is honest and modest, written out of the heart of the author's searchings and perplexities. Valuable, because it brings out verypertinendy the ^eots which the onlooker consciousness of our epochis having on religion, and will continue to have unless the prisoners of this consciousness come to realise their situation and to wish for light. c. w.Mrs. Besant and Theosophy The Last Four Lives of Annie Besant By Arthur H. Nethercot. (Rupert Hart-Davis, 42/-.) r I E p r e f a c e t o t h i s w o r k o p e n s a s f o l l o w s : \" I n p r e s e n t i n g t h i ssecond volume of the life of Annie Besant, I should perhaps begin by apologising for its delayed appearance. Many of the reviewers of The First Five Lives of Annie Besant in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, France, Germany and India, kindly ended their reviews by expressing their keen anticipation ofthe promised quick completion of the biography. The necessity, however, of reducing the voluminous material for what might well have become two more volumes into the present more manageable single volume has somewhat postponed the projected date of publi cation.\" Next I wish to repeat my thanks to the many people all over the world who have helped me, through the contribution of inform ation, interviews, letters and criticism, to arrive at as complete a portrayal of this extraordinary, many-sided woman as is possible for a non-theosophist who did not know her personally. . . .\" As the reviewer of the book, I feel I have some advantage over its author. To some small extent, at any rate, I did know Annie Besant personally. I was there on the stage, even if nowhere near the centre of it, during one of the most spectacular of her many lives. In the second decade oi the nineteenth century I was a young man in my twenties striving valiantly to grope my way to some real grasp of the scheme of the universe. Though I was never a memberof the Theosophical Society, I was very much interested in all the stirring things that were at that time taking place in it. I was on intimate terms with my brother Peter Freeman, for 25 years Presi dent of the Welsh Branch of the Society. It is mentioned in ibis book how in the CJommittee Room of the House of Commons he presided over a meeting addressed there by Annie Besant to \" many Members of the Commons and the Lords.\" I heard Mrs. Besant lecture many times. I vividly recall one occasion (mentioned in this book) when she spoke at the City Temple in the days of the \"New Theology.\" The Rev. R. J. Campbell introduced her as \" the greatest platform orator of ourtime.\" If he had said \" the greatest woman of our time,\" that vast audience would\u2014and with some reason\u2014have been equally ready to accept his verdict. I once went to see her personally. I recollect her telling me, among other things, that she had seen a Yogi in India walk through the air over an abyss. I helped to arrange a public lecture for her in Shefeld, where I was warden of an Vocational settlement, The subject she chose for herself was \"The Reconstruction of a Shattered World.\" If I 108 109Was ver so to speak \" illusionedabout her as a thinker, this lecture went far to disillusion me. As we went by taxi from the lecture-hall to the hostel of my Settlement (where she stayed the night). I turned to her and said: \"There wasn't much Theosophy in your lecture.\" was all Theosophy .\" What I meantwas that there was not much philosophic profundity of thought. It was nothing but the supercial Socialistic sort of thing she con tributed to \"Fabian Essays in Socialism,\" along with Shaw and Webb and the rest of them. It has, however, never been held that to write a good biography it is a sine qua non to have known the subject of it.... Mr. Nether- cot has done what every good writer of a biography is called upon to do. Seeing that he is by no means a devoted admirer of his heroine, and not a member of the Theosophical Society, it is altogether admirable that he has so patiently accumulated and so well arranged the vast mass of material upon which the writing of such a life as that of Mrs. Besant\u2014or rather, as he prefers it, \" The Nine Lives of Mrs. Besant\"\u2014is perforce based. Whatever we may think about this and that in her personality and career, Annie Besant was, as Mr. Nethercot says, \"an extra ordinary woman.\" The thing that especially strikes one about her is her many-sidedness\u2014^and the phase-upon-phase in her life. T o deal so fairly, so comprehensively, so effectively with all these aspects of his subject, is unquestionably a remarkable achievement. Sub specie aternitatis, all the same, the book is a failure. . . . On p. 77 there is a paragraph devoted to Rudolf Steiner. It begins:\" Perhaps the most puzzling and provocative of the minor gures to come into Annie Besant's life at this time was that of Rudolf Steiner.\" Mr. Nethercot speaks, too, of Steiner's \" rather feminine face.\" ... By what is said\u2014and far more by what is not said in this book\u2014^I feel that Mr. Nethercot is very far from expanding to the full heights and depths and widths of his subject-matter. . . . It is an interesting task to read consecutively Annie Besant's Auto biography (dealing with the rst half of her life) and then RudolfSteiner's (dealing with the rst half of his). We get a feeling of ''thin-ness\" in the rst case and of \"thickness\" in the second. .. . Let us get at some view of what was at issue between these two personalities. The Theosophical Society was founded in 1875 by Col. Olcott and Madame Blavatsky. Its declared objects were: 1. To form a nucleus of the universal brotherhood of humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour; 2. To encourage the study of comparative religion, philosophy and science;3. To investlgaite unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man. Mrs. Besant (converted to Theosophy by reading Blavatsky's\" Secret Doctrine \") joined the Society in 1889. Madame Blavatsky was the rst President. When she died in 1891, Col. Olcott became President. On his death in 1894, Mrs. Besant became President. She remained President until her own death in 1933. Mrs. Besant had stupendous gifts. She was by no means despicable as scholar and thinker. She could speak; she could write; she could organise. She had inunense seff-condence and\" courage. She was for doing things in a big way. In her, the Theosophical Society found an arch-propagandist. Under her tremendous leadership, it looked\u2014at the turn of the century\u2014as if the Theosophical Movement might well play a large part in human affairs. (Edison became a member of the \" T.S.\" towards the end of the nineteenth century. Later on, persons of the calibre of Edward Carpenter and W. B. Yeats were very much indentied with the Theosophical outlook). Presently Mrs. Besant's Theosophy took into itself a new con tent. Depending very considerably on the clairvoyance of C. W. Leadbeater, she began to proclaim the immediate advent of a \"Supreme Teacher.\" Leadbeater had discovered a young Indian boy\u2014usually known as \"Krishnamurti.\" In some sort of way he managed to make this boy believe that he was destined to be\u2014or at any rate that he was to be the vehicle for (it was never made very clear)\u2014a World-teacher. THE World-teacher. To an audience in London (for example) Mrs. Besant on one occasion declared: \" The Supreme T eacher will again ere very long be incarnate upon earth, again made manifest living and walking among us as last He walked in Palestine.\" She brought into being an organisation called \"The Order of the Star in the East\" to prepare for His Coming. In due course she made it known that He would manifest Himself through Krishnamurti at Benares. (My brother Peter was among those who went in 1^11 from all parts of the earth to prostrate themselves). Lady Emily Lutyens was one of the most intimate and most trusted of those working with Annie Besant. In her recent book. Candles in the Sun, she describes how ill-at-ease Krishnamurti became in private in the r61e for which he had been cast. Shementions many episodes, such as the following: \"Mrs. Besant went into Krishnamurti's room as soon as they got back to the Castlea n d i n f o r m e d h i m t h a t i t w a s a p o w e r f u l b l a c k m a g i c i a n u j o m s h e knew well who had spoken through him \u2014to which Krishnamurti replied. 'If you really believe that, I will never speak again*.\"Lady Emily says in one place ; From that ume onwards, whenever Krishna said anything unacceptable. W^gwood [rae of the leading Theosophists] maintained that it was The blacks speak- ' \" ^ L y E m U y r e s i g n e d f r o m t h e S o c i e t y i n 1 9 3 0 . I n h e r \" L e t t e r GB\u20148of Resignation\" she said; \"It must be apparent to the meanest intelligence that there is a complete cleavage of thought and of action between the leaders of the Theosophical Society and the majority of its members and Krishnaji [Krishnamurti]\u2014the teacher whom they themselves proclaimed and so eagerly awaited.\" As is well-known, Krishnamurti in due course repudiated all pretensions to any such part as that for which Mrs. Besant and Charles Lead- beater had cast him. There presently appeared in the Society a volume called Man : Whence? How? Whither? We are told by the authors (Lead- beater and Besant) not only all sorts of things about personages who have been the central forces in human affairs: some of them such relatively minor beings as Julius Caesar, Lao-Tse and Plato; most of them leading members of the Theosophical Society.. .Lead- beater out of his limitless clairvoyance tells us about our planet in \"Early Times on the Moon Chain.\" We are informed: \"There is a hut in which dwells a Moon-man, his wife and children: these we know in later times under the names of Mars and Mercury, the Mahaguru (Gautama Buddha) and Surya (the Lord Maitreya, the present Bodhisattva, the supreme T eacher ^ the World). A num ber of these monkey-creatures live around the hut and give to their owners the devotion of faithful dogs; among them we notice the future to whom we may give their future names for the purpose of recognition, though they are still non-human.\" We are told that in the \"Sixth Round on the Moon Chain,\" these non-humans emerge as primitive men. \"They are living on an island and food has run short, so that in his rst fully human life, Herakles (Mrs. Besant) appears on the scene engaged in a vigorous struggle with another savage for the corpse of an eminently undesirable-looking animal.\"Leadbeater and Besant are equally at home in the future. We are told in detail how things will be on this earth 800 years from now: \" It is doubtful whether there are any books going back as far as the twentieth century.\" But \" they have copies of The Secret Doctrine.\" . . . We are also told in a section headed \"Adyar\": \"Naturally it is interesting to see what has happened by this time toour Headquarters at Adyar, and it is delightful to nd it still flourishing and on a far grander scale than in olden days. There isstill a Theosophical Society ... It has developed into a great central university .. . with subsidiary centres in various parts of the worldafliated to it. . . . The present Headquarters building is replaced by a kind of gorgeous palace ... In this great building they mark as memorials certain spots by pillars and inscriptions such as \"Here was Madame Blavatsky's room\"; \"Here such and such a book was written\"; \"Here was the original shrine-room\"; and so on. They even have statues of some of us...\" 112During the years 1902-1912, Rudolf Steiner was General Secre tary of the German Section of the Theosophical Society. Mrs. Besant during this period was in some such position as Faustus in Marlowe's play\u2014a Good Angel at one ear, a Bad Angel at the other. Had she listened to Rudolf Steiner, this mother-Theosophi- cal Society might well have been to-day an immensely powerful influence in the world. But Mrs. Besant listened to Leadbeater. In this late phase of its existence the Theosophical Society undid all that Col. Olcott and Mme. Blavatsky had built up. That which could have been a central force in human history became the laughing-stock of thinking people. The Theosophical Society itself sank into ineffectuality. Mrs. Besant ended her days in a sort of St. Helena at Adyar. Largely as a consequence of these happen ings, occultism to this day is everywhere discredited. Rudolf Steiner found himself left with the task of making on his sole responsibility a fresh attempt to give Cosmic Truth to mankind. Arnold Freeman. F r i e d r i c h G e u t e r a n d t h e C h i l d r e n Adventure in Curative Education. By Isabel Geuter. (New Knowledge Books. 12/6.) A v i v i d p o r t r a i t o f F r i e d r i c h G e u t e r e m e r g e s f r o m t h i s b o o k \u2014 ^ a n account of how the author went to work at Clent in 1936, con tinued through the difculties of the war years, and later joined with Fried in starting a new curative home for Jewish children. It is a very personal account, with the focus always on Fried and the background barely touched in, but it brings out very well thewarmth of his nature and his great intuitive gift for discerning the needs of handicapped children and for gaming their condence: He lived with his children. His rooms were in the midst of theirs, in hearing of their voices, of their laughter and tears, their squabbles and their play. He sat amongst them at mealtimes; ateithe food they ate; watched them in sleep as well as in waking. When they were very ill, he was constantly in and out of their room. The author remarks that when she began to visit ordinary centres for the mentally handicapped and to study current develop ments, she was astonished to nd that what I had accepted all these years as quite a normal way of bringing up and Mucating handicapped children was, in fact, only just becoming normal now. Turning this over in mind I realised the reason. To care for such children as they should be cared for needs large numbers of helpers. Society has to become very con scious of this before funds are readily available to provide for these numbers. But Daddy and his friends had not waited for this. By sacricing any real personal life of their own, by living simply, by ignoring pension schemes and waiving salaries, they had managed to provide the children with what is needed. 113But, the author adds, the old pioneers are dying out: Their task is completed. They have proved the rightness of their convictions and justied what they did. They have given the fruits of their work and their experience to the world. The old ideas about mentally ill children are gone because of them. But whether the Welfare State will nd the answer to the economic question involved in providing what is now recognised as the right Of our handicapped children, or whether this will always depend on private groups of people, it is hard to foresee. The book includes also an account by Fried (found among his papers after his death) of his rst meeting with Rudolf Steiner in 1919; and a series of short chapters on various practical aspects of curative education. These should be very helpful to other workers in this exacting eld. c. w.Prince Pious The Witch and the Woodpecker. By Isabel Wyatt. (The Michael Press. 61-.)

In addition to the original text, described by Dr. Steiner as \"an epitome of anthroposophical spiritual science\", this memor able publication includes the following valuable material: (1) the four Prefaces written by the author for the editions of 1909, 1913, 1920 and 1925; (2) a Note by the translators elucidating certain technical terms used in anthroposophical literature, making specic recommendations for study, and setting forth the problems and points of essential importance in all translations of Rudolf Steiner's works; (3) a long-desired Synopsis that will enable readers who are to any extent conversant with the subject-matter quickly to nd ithe passages to which they want to refer. Earlier translations of this great work are not comparable with the standard achieved in the present publication, every sentence of which is the result of careful deliberation based upon a depth of understanding which very few can claim. It is a volume indispens able to every serious student of Anthroposophy.

Mr. Harwood wrote in the Obituary notice; \"His last great work for Anthroposophy was to produce (with Mary Adams) a new translation of Occult Science. It will be a priceless legacy.\"\u2014And so indeed it is.The strained and narrow self-awareness that\" characterises modern waking life and the shallowness which underlies the brilliance of our mainly technological science have engendered a widespread feeling that both must somehow be transcended if civilisation is to survive. Many are in consequence advocating a return to ancient tradi tions of the East, embodying as these do that element of wisdom which has largely faded from the focussed knowledge of the West. But the lost wisdom can in fact be rediscovered not only in recorded traditions, where it echoes, but also in the individual soul itself, where it actually sleeps\u2014in the form of latent powers. T o awaken these powers is to resurrect rather than to resuscitate the ancient wisdom of the East. Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and its Attainment is a guide to this contemporary way of initiation, composed by one who had himself awakened those powers and who was equally well versed in the wisdom-teaching of the East and the science and philosophy of the West; and addressed to everyman, because everymail every where can begin to do the same. Originally published in book form in 1907 and since revised and reissued many times and in many tongues, it is treasured as a lifelong companion by a growing company of readers of both sexes and of all classes throughout the world.The Christian Community Press 34 Glenilla Road, London, N.W.3.

HTOIOWEN BARFIELD Wo r l d s A p a r t (A Dialogue of the 1960s) \u00a5N this too specialized age streams of thought and ideas are more and more imprisoned in watertight compartments. No man will talk his 'shop' to another who stands outside it. When it comes to rst principles, such as the nature of man himself and his universe, minds are worlds apart and never meet. Troubled by this breakdown in communications, the narrator in this new book by Owen Bareld borrows a tape-recorder and a cottage and persuades seven thinkers to share them with him for a short week-end: a physicist, a biologist, a psychiatrist, a professor of theology, a liguistic philosopher, a young rocket-research worker, and a seventh guest who does not t too readily into any one of the contemporary pigeon holes and claims to shed fresh light on them all. This is not a 'Philosphical Dialogue' in the ordinary sense, where the contrasted points of view are suavely and decorously expounded out of the mouths of two or three characterless lay-gures. Not all the participants are even interested in philosophy, and at least one of them remains convinced that there is no such thing. Personalities as well as ideas are heard to clash and (though there are also some delightful harmonies) the temperature sometimes rises rather dangerously. By the time the party breaks up the heat has been successfully dissipated and the reader is left to decide for himself whether the light remains. Owen Bareld has a high reputation as a penetrating if sometimes unconventional thinker and with Worlds Apart he once again presents an unusual challenge to his readers. 28/-.
