Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) and a coalition of LGBTQI+ and human rights-focused organizations are collaborating to help meet the immediate needs of impacted communities. Gilead has pledged up to $5 million to support a public education and vaccine hesitancy communications campaign, a public policy response, and a global outbreak emergency fund. Partners include the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD, the National Black Justice Coalition, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. NMAC will act as the policy response organizing center to help address policy issues related to HIV and monkeypox. The partners will help ensure accurate, accessible, and targeted information about monkeypox reaches LGBTQ+ people and people with HIV so they are able to make informed decisions about how to prevent and treat the virus. Gilead's emergency fund will provide grants of up to $50,000 to existing Gilead grantees working in regions with active monkeypox outbreaks to respond to this growing emergency. Funds may be used to cover expenses such as community mobilization activities specifically addressing the monkeypox outbreak in communities disproportionately impacted by HIV, operating costs related to HIV testing and service interruptions, and essential safety materials.
