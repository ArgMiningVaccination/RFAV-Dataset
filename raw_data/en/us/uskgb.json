{"title": "Sen. Lee Fights Against Biden's Vaccine Mandate", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": "Mike Lee US Senator for Utah", "date": "2022-02-01", "cleaned_text": "On September 9, 2021 President Biden [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-president-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/) that his Administration would \"require more Americans to be vaccinated.\" Since this announcement, three separate vaccine mandates have been issued. First, a [requirement](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/05/2021-23643/covid-19-vaccination-and-testing-emergency-temporary-standard) that all employers with 100 or more employees ensure that their entire workforce is either fully vaccinated or shows a negative test at least once a week by January 4, 2022. Second, a [requirement](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/05/2021-23831/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-omnibus-covid-19-health-care-staff-vaccination) that any employee of a facility that participates in Medicaid or Medicare must be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022. Lastly, a requirement that all [federal employees](https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/faq/vaccinations/) be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021 and that all [federal contractors and subcontractors](https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/Guidance%20for%20Federal%20Contractors_Safer%20Federal%20Workforce%20Task%20Force_20211110.pdf) be fully vaccinated by January 18, 2022. Senator Lee is personally vaccinated, encourages others to consider vaccination against COVID-19 with the consultation of their doctor, and views the rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccines as a miracle that safeguards the vulnerable from severe illness and hospitalization. However, these requirements as President Biden stated, \"are not about freedom or personal choice.\" Therefore, in response to these Constitutionally dubious and autocratic mandates, Senator Lee has introduced multiple pieces of legislation and promised to speak on the Senate floor to highlight the flaws and consequences of these mandates. Below you will find more information on each of those efforts. "}
