Expectant parents, their babies, and even those who will be around their babies, may need vaccines. In some cases, vaccines protect the individual who is pregnant as the changes related to pregnancy make them more susceptible to infections, but in other cases, the vaccines are meant to protect the baby. Questions sometimes relate to special circumstances, such as vaccinating after a premature birth or during breastfeeding, or they pertain to the vaccination of other children in the home. The information below addresses these issues. If you can't find the answer to your question, please email us at [vacinfo@chop.edu](mailto:vacinfo@chop.edu), so we can help you. Vaccines and pregnancy During pregnancy, two changes related to the immune system can make individuals more susceptible to certain infections: - Suppressed immune system function \u2014 Because the growing fetus is not genetically identical, the body has to undergo changes during pregnancy so that it does not \"reject\" or \"attack\" the fetus as a foreign entity. As a result, during pregnancy, the immune system is less efficient, making the individual more susceptible to infections than someone of their age who is not pregnant. - Physical changes \u2014 As the pregnancy progresses, increased fluid volume adds stress to the heart and lungs. This also makes individuals more susceptible to infections, particularly influenza and COVID-19, compared to non-pregnant people of the same age. [Read more about pregnancy and immunity in this Q&A](http://media.chop.edu/data/files/pdfs/infectious-diseaess-pregnancy-qa.pdf). Important vaccines during pregnancy [Influenza](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/influenza-vaccine). Those who will be pregnant during influenza season should receive the inactivated flu vaccine (flu shot). Pregnant people are at increased risk for influenza-related complications that require hospitalization. The influenza vaccine also protects the baby in the first few months of life before they can get vaccinated. As such, those in their third trimester during late summer or early fall should try to get vaccinated against influenza a few weeks before delivery if the vaccine for the upcoming season is available, so the baby will benefit from maternal antibodies. Those who will be pregnant during influenza season should also make sure they are immunized before influenza starts circulating in their community. [COVID-19](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/covid-19-vaccine). Individuals who are infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy are at increased risk for complications, compared with similarly aged people who are not pregnant. [Hepatitis B](/news/newborns-and-hepatitis-b-vaccine). Because many people do not know that they are infected with hepatitis B virus, and because an infant can be exposed to the virus during delivery, your obstetrician will perform a blood test to determine whether you are infected with hepatitis B. If you are, in addition to getting vaccinated shortly after birth, your baby will be given an antibody preparation to prevent them from getting the disease. [Tdap](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/diphtheria-tetanus-and-pertussis-vaccines). A dose of Tdap should be administered between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation during each pregnancy. While anytime during this window is fine, public health officials suggest getting this vaccine earlier rather than later. Those who did not receive the vaccine during pregnancy should get it immediately after giving birth. [Pneumococcal](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/pneumococcal-vaccine). Those considered high risk for pneumococcal disease should get pneumococcal vaccine if they have not had it. High-risk conditions include chronic disorders of the pulmonary system (but not asthma), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver diseases, chronic renal failure, asplenia (including sickle cell disease), immunosuppressive conditions (i.e., HIV, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin disease, generalized malignancy, or organ or bone marrow transplantation), cigarette smoking, alcoholism, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, treatment with certain medications, or cochlear implants. Talk with your doctor if you are not sure whether you are considered high risk. Vaccines to avoid during pregnancy [MMR](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/measles-mumps-and-rubella-vaccines). Live, weakened viral vaccines, including the ones for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) should generally be avoided during pregnancy due to a theoretical risk of viral replication that could affect the developing fetus. Likewise, pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after receipt of the MMR vaccine. See \"Important note\" below. [Varicella](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/varicella-vaccine)(chickenpox). As with MMR, this vaccine contains a live, weakened virus and should not be given during pregnancy. Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for at least four weeks after receipt of chickenpox vaccine. See \"Important note\" below. [HPV](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/human-papillomavirus). Those who have started the HPV vaccine series before becoming pregnant should wait until after delivery to get the remaining doses. Important note: If you inadvertently receive any of these vaccines during pregnancy, you should be aware that none have been proven to be harmful to your unborn baby. The recommendation to avoid these vaccines is theoretical. In some cases, databases are maintained by the manufacturers to track these occurrences. For example, if you receive the HPV vaccine during pregnancy, you can contact the manufacturer with questions or report the dose by calling 877-888-4231. Children in the home of someone who is pregnant Children living in the home of someone who is pregnant can receive all recommended vaccines. Are you on Pinterest? The VEC curated a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/childrensphila/vaccines-pregnant-women/) that includes a collection of VEC resources that may be of interest during pregnancy. Breastfeeding Baby Infants who are being breastfed may receive all routinely recommended vaccines for infants. Antibodies in breast milk do not interfere with any of the currently recommended vaccines. Sometimes parents wonder whether they can forego immunizations for their baby because the baby is being breastfed; however, this is not the best decision since antibodies in human breast milk bathe the intestinal surface but are not absorbed. Therefore, breast milk antibodies never enter the bloodstream where they would be needed to protect against certain diseases. Examples of these types of diseases include breastfeeding Parents who are breastfeeding can receive any vaccines they need during this time, including the COVID-19 vaccine. Although some live viral vaccines may replicate and cause viruses to be excreted in breast milk, the viruses are weakened sufficiently that they will not harm the baby. In most cases, live viral vaccines (specifically, MMR and chickenpox) are recommended prior to becoming pregnant because the diseases they prevent may be harmful to a developing fetus if infected during pregnancy. Preterm infants Any baby born before the 37th week of pregnancy is considered to be preterm. About 12% of births in the United States are preterm. Maternal antibodies Preterm babies acquire lesser quantities of antibodies through the placenta than full-term babies. Since these antibodies are present at lower levels, they do not last as long as those of full-term babies. Because preterm infants rely on their own immune systems for protection sooner than full-term babies, it is important that they receive needed vaccinations so they can protect themselves against disease. Chronologic age Vaccines should be given according to a baby's chronologic age \u2014 the time since delivery. Hepatitis B vaccine If a preterm infant is born to someone infected with [hepatitis B](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/vaccine-hepatitis-b-vaccine), they should receive the hepatitis B vaccine at or shortly after birth due to the chance of being infected during delivery. If the baby weighs less than 2,000 grams, the dose should not be counted as part of the hepatitis B series, and the baby should start the three-dose series one month after birth. If a preterm infant is born to someone known not to be infected with hepatitis B, they should get the vaccine one month after birth. Preterm babies discharged before 1 month of age may get the vaccine at discharge as long as they are considered medically stable and have been consistently gaining weight. In both cases, later doses should be given at least four weeks after the dose at 1 month. The third dose should be given at least 16 weeks after the first dose and at least eight weeks after the last dose, but not before 6 months of age. Vaccines typically administered at 2 months In addition to hepatitis B, 2-month-old babies require vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcus and rotavirus. Preterm infants should receive these vaccines at the chronologic age of 2 months, even if they are still hospitalized. These vaccines should continue to be given at the appropriate chronologic ages according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine schedule until each series is completed. Other vaccines Other vaccines should also be given according to the recommended schedule; these include vaccines for influenza, COVID-19, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and hepatitis A. Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are not recommended until 6 months of age. At 6 months of age, the baby may get the inactivated version of the influenza vaccine. Healthcare workers and family members in contact with a baby less than 6 months old should be immunized to lessen the baby's chance of being infected with these infections. Vaccines: Birth to 2 years of age For questions related to the vaccines your baby is recommended to receive in the months after birth, the following resources are available: - Informational booklets \u2014 The VEC offers two booklets, \" [Vaccines and Your Baby](http://media.chop.edu/data/files/pdfs/vaccine-education-center-vaccine-baby.pdf)\" (also available in [Spanish](https://media.chop.edu/data/files/pdfs/vaccine-education-center-vaccine-baby-spa.pdf)) and \" [Vaccine Safety and Your Child: Separating Fact from Fiction](http://media.chop.edu/data/files/pdfs/vaccine-education-center-vaccine-safety-eng.pdf)\" (also available in [Spanish](https://media.chop.edu/data/files/pdfs/vaccine-education-center-vaccine-safety-spa.pdf)) for any new parent(s) looking for more information about vaccines. - Vaccine videos \u2014 The VEC offers a variety of videos that address common vaccine-related questions. [Review this page of our website for more information.](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/resources/vaccine-videos-and-dvds) - Q&A sheets related to vaccine and vaccine safety \u2014 [These question-and-answer sheets](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/resources/vaccine-and-vaccine-safety-related-qa-sheets)address a variety of topics related to vaccines and vaccine safety in an easy-to-read format. A [series of \"Special Topics\" Q&As](/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/resources/vaccine-special-topics-online-series-qa-sheets)are also available to address additional, related concerns. Other questions you may have Can someone who had a live, weakened viral vaccine (e.g., MMR, chickenpox, nasal influenza, rotavirus, or outside of the U.S., oral polio) be near a new baby or a pregnant person? Yes. Although these vaccines contain live, weakened viruses, recently vaccinated people are not likely to spread the virus after vaccination, with a few exceptions: - If a person who got the chickenpox vaccine develops a rash, they should take precautions to ensure that the baby, or an unvaccinated pregnant person, does not come into contact with the sores as they may contain the weakened virus and could, theoretically, spread to the unprotected individual. - Weakened, live polio virus can spread following vaccination; however, the weakened virus typically does not cause disease. In most cases, when unvaccinated people come into contact with polio vaccine virus (from the oral polio vaccine, which is not given in the U.S.), they can get infected and gain immunity without experiencing illness or being vaccinated. This is called contact immunity. On rare occasions, the polio virus in the oral vaccine can revert to its natural form and cause paralytic polio. This happened to an unvaccinated individual in New York in July 2022. Because pregnant individuals typically have immunity against polio, they do not need to take special precautions. Likewise, special precautions are not typically needed for infants in the first few months of life before they are old enough to be vaccinated. However, if more cases of polio develop in the U.S., you may want to limit your baby's exposure to unvaccinated individuals who recently traveled or have been around others who recently traveled. What do I need to know about Zika virus and how to avoid it if I am pregnant? Zika virus is spread through mosquito bites. Most people who are infected do not have any symptoms and a few (about 1 in 5) will have symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain or pink eye. The most concerning aspects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy are the adverse effects on the developing fetus. Read the [Zika Virus: What you Should Know](http://media.chop.edu/data/files/pdfs/vaccine-education-center-zika-virus-qa.pdf) Q&A sheet for more information. Should medicine be given before a child gets vaccinated to prevent or control fever? Fevers are actually a sign that the immune system is responding to a challenge. If children are given fever-reducing medications before vaccinations, they may not develop a fever, but their immune response to the vaccines may also be lower.

The authors evaluated the potential association between maternal hepatitis A vaccination and maternal and infant safety outcomes in more than 1,100 women with live births over an 11-year period. Pregnancies with hepatitis A vaccine exposure were compared to those with other vaccine exposures and to those with no vaccine exposures. Approximately 70% of women received hepatitis A vaccine during the first trimester. There were no significant associations between hepatitis A vaccine exposure during pregnancy and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, caesarian-section delivery, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. There was an association between hepatitis A vaccine receipt and delivering an infant who was small for gestational age, but this was likely due to confounding factors.

Human Vaccines and Immunotherapy 2019;12:1-12 (epub ahead of print). In this randomized study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of an adjuvanted-HPV 16/18 vaccine in more than 32,000 Finnish adolescent males and females over a 6.5-year period by comparing those who received HPV vaccine to those who received hepatitis B vaccine. The HPV vaccine adjuvant was composed of monophosphoryl-lipid A plus aluminum salts. The incidence of new-onset autoimmune diseases was similar in both vaccine groups. Similarly, those receiving HPV vaccine during pregnancy did not have an increased risk for spontaneous abortion or congenital anomalies. Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, Sheth SS, Zhu J, et al. [Risk of spontaneous abortion after inadvertent human papillomavirus vaccination in pregnancy.](https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=29889760) Obstet Gynecol 2018;132(1):35-44. The authors evaluated the risk of spontaneous abortion following quadrivalent HPV vaccination given before and during pregnancy during a 7-year period. No differences in the risk of spontaneous abortion were identified when comparing those who had received vaccine 16 to 22 weeks before their last menstrual period versus those vaccinated either within 6 weeks of last menstrual period or during the first 19 weeks of pregnancy. The authors concluded that HPV vaccine did not increase the risk of spontaneous abortion in the 6 weeks preceding pregnancy or during pregnancy.

Obstet Gynecol 2017;130(3):599-608. The authors evaluated whether quadrivalent HPV vaccine administered during the periconceptional period or during pregnancy was associated with increased risks for adverse outcomes. The authors compared outcomes between those women vaccinated two weeks before or two weeks after their last menstrual period with women who were vaccinated four to 18 months before their last menstrual period. Administration of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the periconceptional period or during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, small for gestational age, chorioamnionitis, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes, or more than 50 selected major structural birth defects.

The authors evaluated the safety profile of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in seven phase III studies. Pregnancy outcomes, including those among live births through the first six weeks of life, were analyzed among nearly 3,000 pregnancies that occurred during the study period. The incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes was compared between quadrivalent HPV and 9-valent HPV vaccines. The authors found no difference in the number of fetal losses (e.g., spontaneous abortion, late fetal death, etc.), or the incidence of congenital anomalies between the groups. Additionally, the proportion of pregnancies with adverse outcome were within ranges reported in the general population. Baril L, Rosillon D, Willame C, Angelo MG, Zima J, et al.

Vaccine 2015;33:6884-6891. The authors assessed the risk of spontaneous abortion and other adverse pregnancy outcomes after inadvertent exposure to HPV-16/18 vaccine surrounding gestation during a three-year period. Investigators found no increased risk of spontaneous abortion, still birth, preterm or post-term birth, small or large for gestational age, or infant death before 12 weeks when comparing those women who became pregnant within 30 days before or 45 to 90 days after vaccine receipt versus those who became pregnant 120 days to 18 months after the last HPV vaccine dose.

The authors evaluated the association between maternal influenza vaccination during pregnancy and risk of preterm birth, small or large for gestational age, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, respiratory distress syndrome, low birth weight, and low Apgar scores during a 6-year period in more than 145,000 women among whom 64,000 were vaccinated. The authors found no association between maternal influenza vaccination during pregnancy and increased risk for adverse outcomes.

The authors examined the risks for major structural defects in infants following receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine in the first trimester during 10 influenza seasons. More than 50,000 mothers received inactivated influenza vaccine in the first trimester during the study period. The authors found no increased risk for cardiac, orofacial, respiratory, neurologic, ophthalmologic, otologic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and muscular or limb defects in the offspring of women who were vaccinated during the first trimester.

Vaccine 2017;35:3655-3660. A slight increase in the risk of chorioamnionitis in women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy was previously detected in two previous Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) evaluations. In this study, the authors investigated the clinical significance of these findings by reviewing four years of data from seven VSD sites, including more than 45,000 women vaccinated during pregnancy. An increased risk of chorioamnionitis was observed in women vaccinated during pregnancy compared to those who were not vaccinated. Despite these findings, no increased risk of clinically significant outcomes typically associated with chorioamnionitis was found in infants born to Tdap-vaccinated women, including transient tachypnea of the newborn, neonatal sepsis, neonatal pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome or newborn convulsions.

Vaccine 2016;34:142-150. In this prospective, controlled cohort study, the authors assessed the immunogenicity and safety of Tdap immunization during pregnancy. Tdap was generally well-tolerated with mild side effects resolving within 72 hours of vaccine receipt. No reported serious adverse events in the mothers were related to vaccine administration. All reported serious adverse events in infants were common conditions that occur in the neonatal/infant period and were not linked to maternal vaccination.

[Pregnancy Obstet Gynecol 2015;125(6):1433-1438. The authors retrospectively evaluated pregnancy outcomes in more than 7,100 women who had or had not received Tdap during pregnancy during a 13-month period. They found no differences in pregnancy outcomes (e.g., stillbirth, major malformations, chorioamnionitis, 5-minute Apgar score, or cord blood pH) or neonatal complications (e.g., ventilation requirement, sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, or neonatal death). Additionally, no differences in neonatal outcomes were found between women who had received at least two Tdap vaccines in the past five years with those who had received only a single dose.

They found no statistically significant differences in acute adverse events (e.g., fever, allergic reactions or local reactions) or adverse birth outcomes (e.g., preterm delivery, low birth weight, small for gestational age) among women who had received their prior tetanus-containing vaccine less than two years before and two to five years before compared with women who had received a tetanus containing vaccine more than five years earlier. No cases of anaphylaxis, Arthus reaction or Guillain-Barre Syndrome were found following vaccination. Donegan K, King B, Byran P. [Safety of pertussis vaccination in pregnant women in UK: observational study](https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4219). BMJ 2014;349:g4219. The authors conducted an observational cohort study to examine the safety of pertussis vaccination during pregnancy following administration of Repevax\u00ae, a low-dose diphtheria, acellular pertussis and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine. When compared with national historical rates, the authors found no increased risk of stillbirth, maternal or neonatal death, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, hemorrhage, fetal distress, uterine rupture, placenta or vasa previa, caesarean delivery, low birth weight, or neonatal renal failure.

Using the Vaccine Safety Datalink, the authors determined the safety of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. Vaccination was not associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes including preterm delivery, small for gestational age, or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (e.g., gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, etc.). Although Tdap vaccination during pregnancy was initially associated with a slightly increased risk of chorioamnionitis, chart reviews found that the association between Tdap vaccination at 27- and 36-week gestation was no longer significant.

JAMA 2014;311(17):1760-1769. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the authors evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap immunization during the third trimester of pregnancy. No Tdap-associated serious adverse events occurred in women or infants. There were no significant differences in the infants' gestational ages, birth weights, Apgar scores, neonatal examinations, growth, development or complications when comparing those mothers who received Tdap antepartum versus postpartum.

[Safety and immunogenicity of an acellular pertussis vaccine in premature infants](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/103/5/e60.long). Pediatrics 1999;103(5):e60. The authors prospectively evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an acellular pertussis vaccine in preterm infants compared with full-term infants at 2 months of age, followed by two additional doses at four and eight weeks after the initial dose. Immune responses to the acellular pertussis vaccine were decreased in preterm compared with term infants, but vaccine efficacy was high. Acellular pertussis vaccine was well tolerated in both groups and the incidence of systemic adverse reactions was limited to one patient in each group having a fever > 38.5C.

Vaccine 2018;36:986-996. The authors reviewed 10 clinical studies and 15 years of post-marketing safety surveillance data regarding immunization with hexavalent vaccine (DTaP/HepB/IPV/Hib) when administered alone or in combination with pneumococcal conjugate, rotavirus, and meningococcal vaccines and respiratory syncytial virus IgG to infants with a history of prematurity or low birthweight (LBW). At least 92% of infants with a history of LBW or as young as 24 weeks gestational age responded to all vaccine antigens after the three-dose vaccination series. Between 13% and 30% of medically stable infants with a history of prematurity or LBW developed apnea after vaccination, typically after the first dose. The occurrence of post-immunization cardiorespiratory events was influenced by the severity of underlying neonatal conditions, though most events resolved spontaneously or required minimal intervention. The hexavalent vaccine was well tolerated in co-administration regimens. Montague EC, Hilinski JA, decompensation infants](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20154225). Pediatrics 2016;137(5):e20154225. The authors retrospectively evaluated the infant vaccinations (DTaP, IPV, HepB, Hib, PCV, and rotavirus) and influenza vaccine to 240 premature infants born at less than 32 weeks of gestation who were immunized during their hospital stay over a 6.5-year period. Fewer than 10% of infants required increased respiratory support within 72 hours of vaccination. Two percent (2%) of infants required reintubation, all of whom had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and a birthweight of less than 650 grams (1 pound 6 ounces). An increased incidence of apnea/bradycardia/desaturation events was observed in infants with and without BPD, but no differences existed between groups. Most infants received three or more vaccines per day, though the number of vaccines administered in a day was not associated with an increase of adverse events after immunization. The authors concluded that respiratory decompensation requiring clinical intervention after immunization of preterm infants both with and without BPD was uncommon and immunization should not be delayed.

The authors retrospectively evaluated the incidence of adverse events after vaccination between the ages of 53 and 100 days in more than 13,000 infants born at 28 weeks of gestation or less and birthweight 1000 grams. More than 90% of infants received three or more vaccines. Infants who were born at 23 to 24 weeks gestation had a higher risk of sepsis evaluation and intubation after immunization. No increase in the incidence of seizures was detected. The post-immunization incidence of adverse events was similar across immunization types, including combination vaccines when compared with single-dose vaccines.

In this prospective, observational study, the safety of DTaP-IPV-Hib-HBV hexavalent vaccine was evaluated in 45 preterm newborns less than 31 weeks of gestation admitted to the NICU who received the vaccine between day of life 49 and 112. Vaccination was generally well tolerated, with 11% showing either a transient recurrence of or increase in apnea and bradycardia episodes following immunization, but intervention was limited to tactile stimulation, supplemental oxygen or bag and mask ventilation, and no patients were intubated. All patients with cardiorespiratory events had chronic diseases. The authors also specifically evaluated cardiac disturbances (QTc interval) and cerebral blood flow effects but found no differences in these parameters before and after vaccination or in those infants who experienced cardiorespiratory events.

In this retrospective study, the authors investigated the frequency of apnea, bradycardia and desaturations in approximately 250 hospitalized very preterm infants (mean gestational age 26 weeks) to determine if incidences of these events were increased following the first dose of DTP/DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine. A significant increase in the incidence of cardiorespiratory events was detected after vaccine administration compared with unvaccinated infants, though most events were clinically insignificant and the need for intervention was not different between the groups.

Pediatrics 2008;121(5):e1085-e1090. In this randomized, controlled, prospective study, the authors examined the relationship between DTaP and cardiorespiratory events in approximately 200 preterm infants (mean post-conception age of 35 weeks) at 2 months of age. Preterm infants who received DTaP at 2 months of age were not more likely to experience prolonged apnea and bradycardia in the 48-hour post-immunization period than infants who did not receive DTaP.

The authors evaluated the safety of DTaP-IPV-Hib immunization in very low birthweight preterm infants (mean gestational age 28 \u00b1 2 weeks; range 24-34 weeks) when administered prior to hospital discharge during the first two to four months of life. Nearly half of the infants had a reappearance or increase in either apnea, bradycardia, or desaturations after vaccination, though all infants returned to baseline within 48-72 hours and most events resolved spontaneously or after brief stimulation. No event resulted in a detrimental impact on the infants' clinical course, reintubation or a delay in discharge. The authors concluded that timely vaccine receipt in this fragile population is safe.

Pediatrics 2005;116(6):1292-1298. The authors prospectively evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a hexavalent DTaP/HepB/IPV/Hib vaccine in approximately 200 preterm and full-term infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Preterm and full-term infants displayed good immune responses to all antigens. Protective immune responses against Hib occurred in more than 90% of preterm infants, though these responses were less than those of term infants. An increased risk of oxygen desaturations or bradycardia was observed in preterm infants born < 28 weeks with birth weights less than or equal to 1000 grams in the 72 hours after their first dose of vaccine, and reintubation was not reported.

In this prospective, randomized study, the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of a monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was evaluated in approximately 100 children aged 6 to 23 months of age, including those born at less than 32 weeks of gestation. Regardless of gestational or postnatal age, all children developed protective immune responses after two doses, and all but one child was protected after the first dose. The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with fever recorded as the only adverse event; no differences were detected when comparing infants with differing gestational ages (< 32 weeks versus 32-36 weeks versus 37-42 weeks). Local reactions were minimal (less than 4% occurrence) and did not differ between gestational age groups, indicating the tolerability of the MF59 adjuvant. No severe adverse events occurred in any patient. Measles vaccine and prematurity McClure D, Jacobsen SJ, Klein NP, Naleway AL, Kharbanda EO, et al.

Vaccine 2019;37(1):76-79. The authors retrospectively evaluated the incidence of febrile seizures following measles vaccine at age 12 through 23 months over a 13-year period in more than 530,000 children to determine if the risk is affected by prematurity. The overall incidence of febrile seizures was low and no differences were found in the risk of febrile seizure between children born preterm versus full term.

In this prospective study, the authors compared the safety and efficacy of PCV13 age when administered with other routine vaccines (e.g., DTaP, hepatitis B, IPV, Hib, meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine) in term and preterm infants. Immune responses to PCV13 were lower in preterm infants, though the majority of subjects in both groups achieved protective antibody levels. PCV13 was well tolerated in both term and preterm infants, with the most common problem being irritability or decreased sleep in the preterm group.

Vaccine 2005;23:1703-1708. In this prospective study, the authors assessed the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of PCV7 administered at 3, 5 and 11 months of age in preterm and full-term infants. PCV7 was immunogenic in both groups when given as a three-dose series. PCV7 was generally well tolerated with irritability and drowsiness occurring regardless of gestational age.

Pediatr Infect Dis J 2002;21:182-186. In this randomized, double bind trial, more than 37,000 infants were given either PCV7 or meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine (MCV), including approximately 6,000 low birth weight or preterm infants. The vaccine was efficacious in 100% of infants. PCV7 was well tolerated by all infants, regardless of gestational age or birthweight. An increased incidence of hives was found in the low birthweight and preterm groups who received PCV compared with those who received MCV. Preterm infants receiving PCV also had an increased risk of vomiting, irritability, loss of appetite, and diarrhea compared with those receiving MCV. Rotavirus vaccine and prematurity Omenaca F, Sarlangue infants: randomized phase J 2012;31(5):487-493. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the safety and efficacy of rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix\u00ae) was evaluated in approximately 1,000 preterm infants (mean gestational age 33 weeks). Immunologic responses to the vaccine were comparable to full-term infants evaluated in previous studies. No differences in the incidence of serious adverse events were detected when comparing vaccine and placebo recipients, with the most common reported finding being fever (less than 5%). Gastroenteritis episodes were also similar between vaccine and placebo recipients. No intussusception cases were reported. Goveia MG, Rodriguez ZM, Dallas MJ, Itzler RF, Boslego (WC3) reassortant rotavirus in healthy Dis J 2007;26(12):1099-1104. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the safety and efficacy of rotavirus vaccine (Rotateq\u00ae) was evaluated in approximately 70,000 healthy infants 6-12 weeks of age, including more than 2,000 born prematurely. Rotavirus vaccine was well tolerated among preterm infants, including those born at less than 32 weeks of gestation. No differences in the incidence of serious adverse events were detected between preterm vaccine and placebo recipients. No cases of intussusception in any premature infant were found during the study. These results support vaccinating healthy premature infants on the same schedule as term infants.
