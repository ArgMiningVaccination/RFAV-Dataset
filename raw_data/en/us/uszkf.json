The most common is sexual energy, that is the desire. But we also say that we are full of energy when we desire to do things, find them easy, are less easily tired, etc. But the use is to qualify of \u00abspiritual\u00bb as an energy which entices us in the spiritual practices. Energies like the Chi or the Kundalini need a specific training to be felt, but this is still quite reachable for everybody. Another common misconception is that we can \u00abtransmute\u00bb spiritual energy in physical energy. The least we can say is that this requires \u00abmuch more training\u00bb. In a world where so many people are ignorant of spirituality, it is easy to spread such claims, for the simple purpose of selling books, or to make oneself look superior by pretending to do special things that others can't do. Energy is what makes up the Universe. Energy comes in different vibrational frequencies. The lower the vibration, the lower the level of consciousness. This energy is in all dimensions. The higher dimensions is where our higher self and intuition come from. We have known that healers can feel the energy that runs through the body along the meridians, and find discord. They can feel the energy of the person standing next to them. Psychics, channellers, miracles through healing are simply someone who is able to access higher vibrational frequencies. Here on this blue planet the vibrational level of energy is low. When we raise our consciousness by bettering ourselves through our heart chakra, we become more balanced and centered. Therefore, the energy of the heart radiates further than that of the brain. Our aura is expanded. We tend to talk more than we feel. Sometimes all the talking, especially in a spiritual way alienates more than connects people. 'Knowing' cliques, using a certain terminology separates us instead of uniting us. Everyone can feel a loving heart up to 50 feet. With an open heart chakra, others of lower frequencies can feel the love without saying a word. You will notice baby's eyes following you or animals will come close just to bath in the love and light of your aura. People will smile at you more often and those with lower vibrations won't notice you at all. Or feel better without knowing why when you smile and make eye contact. Studying and learning everything is good, but until it drops into the heart they are just words. You may go into a garden and immediately feel better because the gardener has good energy. Because they love what they do and want to express that love through their plants. Or art, music and the innocence of children. One room doesn't feel right, but another does. You are feeling the energy of that group of people or even energy left by previous occupants. Humans are so busy thinking, judging, comparing that they forget to breath and just be. Busy thinking of the past, future and forgetting the present moment. It is a daily practice. Moment to moment. I call it 'A work in progress'. n spirituality, energy is air and space. The air around us Is perceived as empty space, yet this empty space animates us in many ways. What we perceive as nothing, or empty space, gives us life. We are not separate from the air and space around us as we are made of and dependent on the same basic building blocks of life. Even though it is invisible to the eye it has as physical a form as we do. When we inhale the air around us it fills our lungs. Something that is considered nothing should not be able to fill anything. Empty space allows us motion. Motion can only exist in this empty space. We move through this emptiness at the same time it moves through us. From this symbiotic relationship we can create more energy such as heat or sound. A fire only exists when it has both a solid energy source and an empty energy source at the same time. Two separate musical notes can only be interpreted because of the space between them being played. What we perceive as nothing or empty has provided the space to create everything. As everything grows in this space it is also filled with the same essence and elements as the space. Energy comes from this emptiness and flows through everything. We often don't feel this natural flow of energy because of the mental projections of ourselves and material living. Ideas of how were supposed to be, accompanied with the desire to obtain material status has separated us from just being in harmony with this natural flow. Cheers! Energy in spiritual terms is being in harmony with this natural flow. 441 viewsView 1 upvote \u00b7 Answer "}
