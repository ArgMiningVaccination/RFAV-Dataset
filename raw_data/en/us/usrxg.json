When she's not focused on dentistry, Dr. Simpson enjoys spending time with her family including her husband, Ryan, their son, Parker, and their fur babies. She enjoys traveling and has been fortunate to visit both Nicaragua and Samoa for dental mission trips. Dr. Simpson is committed to providing comfortable, quality care to each of her patients. I am a 2015 graduate of Midwestern University in Arizona. I spent the last 4 years working in public health and recently joined Myotech. I became interested in dentistry while having orthodontic treatment in college. I attended Augustana College for my bachelor's degree and was fortunate to get to participate in a dental mission trip during my time at Augie which solidified my love of dentistry. I was recently able to do another dental mission trip to Samoa. I enjoy working on patients of all ages and truly enjoy getting to know and help my patients. When I'm not thinking about teeth, I enjoy spending time with my family. On the weekends, I can be found taking road trips with my family or making my husband help with DIY projects around our home.
