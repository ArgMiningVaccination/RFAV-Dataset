Introduction The National Population Health Survey (NPHS) is designed to collect information related to the health of the Canadian population. The first cycle of data collection began in 1994, and will continue every second year thereafter. The survey will collect not only cross-sectional information, but also data from a panel of individuals at two-year intervals. The target population of the NPHS includes household residents in all provinces, with the principal exclusion of populations on Indian Reserves, Canadian Forces Bases and some remote areas in Quebec and Ontario. Separate surveys were conducted to cover the Yukon, theNorthwest Territories and the Institutions ( long term residents of hospitals and residential carefacilities) and will be presented at a later stage. The National Population Health Survey (NPHS) was conducted by Statistics Canada in 1994- 1995. This manual has been produced to fac ilitate the manipulation of the microdata file of the survey results. Any questions about the data set or its use should be directed to: Jeanine Bustros Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada NPHS, Section floor, Coats BuildingTunney's Pasture Ottawa, Ontario 951-3285Fax: 951-4198 For support call: Maryanne Kirkpatrick (613) 951-1137NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 62. Background In the fall of 1991, the National Health Information Council (NHIC), recommended that an on- going national survey of population health be conducted. This recommendation was based on consideration of the economic and fiscal pressures on the health care system and the commensurate requirement for information with which to improve the health status of thepopulation in Canada. Existing sources of health data are unable to provide a complete pictureof the health status of the population and the myriad of factors that have an impact on health. Commencing in April 1992, Statistics Canada received funding for development of a National Population Health Survey. The survey was designed to be flexible, and to produce valid, reliableand timely data. Also, it was to be responsive to changing requirements, interests and policies. 3. Objectives The objectives of the NPHS are to: ` aid in the development of public policy by providing measures of the level, trend and distribution of the health status of the population; ` provide data for analytic studies that will assist in understanding the determinants of health; ` collect data on the economic, social, demographic, occupational and environmental correlates of health; ` increase the understanding of the relationship between health status and health care utilization, including alternative as well as traditional services; ` provide information on a panel of people who will be followed over time to reflect the dynamic process of health and illness; ` provide the provinces and territories and other clients with a health survey capacity that will permit supplementation of content or sample; ` allow the possibility of linking survey data to routinely collected administrative data such as vital statistics, environmental measures, community variables, and health services utilization. 4. Survey Content These objectives provided only a broad direction for the NPHS, particularly concerning the type of information to be collected. Therefore, survey content was selected according to the following criteria:NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 71) Information should relate to, and help monitor, the health goals and objectives of the provinces and territories. Where health goals have not been established, for example, at thenational level, policy and programs could be considered in the selection of survey content. 2) The information should not duplicate data available from other sources. 3) With a view to increasing the understanding of health and its determinants, information collected should provide new knowledge in areas that have not been adequately studied. 4) The survey should focus on behaviours or conditions amenable to prevention, treatment, or intervention. 5) The survey should collect information about conditions that impose the greatest burden, in terms of suffering or cost, on affected individuals, the general population, or the health caresystem. 6) The survey should collect information on factors related to good health, not just those related to illness. In each household, some limited information was collected from all household members and one person, aged 12 years and over, in each household was randomly selected for a more in-depth interview. Reflecting these guidelines, the questionnaire included components on health status,use of health services, risk factors and demographic and socio-economic status. For example,health status was measured through questions on self-perception of health, functional ability, chronic conditions, and activity restriction. The use of health services was measured through questions on visits to health care providers, hospital care and drug use. Behavioural risk factorsinclude smoking, alcohol use and physical activity. In addition, a special focus of the first surveywas psycho-social factors that may influence health, such as stress, self-esteem and social support. Demographic and socio-economic information included age, sex, education, ethnicity, household income and labour force status. A list of the questions asked are provided in Appendix A.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 8NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 95. Sample Design The target population of the NPHS includes household residents in all provinces, with the principal exclusion of populations on Indian Reserves, Canadian Forces Bases and some remoteareas in Quebec and Ontario. Sample design for the household component Four factors shaped the design of the household component sample: /G26the targeted national and provincial/territorial sample sizes; /G26the decision to select one member per household to make up the longitudinal panel; /G26the choice of the redesigned Labour Force Survey (LFS) as a vehicle for selecting the sample; and /G26the decision to integrate the NPHS with the National Longitudinal Survey of Children (NLSC). The first three factors resulted, respectively, in the allocation of the sample, the application of a technique (the \"rejective method,\" described later) to improve the sample's representativeness,and the selection of provincial samples outside Quebec. 5.1 Sample Allocation The NPHS was budgeted for a sample size of 19, 600 households. It was further agreed among national and provincial representatives that each province needed a minimum of1,200 households. Subject to this restriction the provincial sample sizes were obtainedby using a well known allocation scheme that balances the reliability requirements atnational and regional levels (Kish, 1988). According to this scheme the sample wasallocated proportionally to /G08(0.804W\u00b2 + 1/12\u00b2), where W is the 1991 Census proportion hh of households in province h, h=1,..,12. This allocation determined the base sample size for each province. Four provinces chose to increase their allotted sample size through thebuy-in of additional units. Within provinces the sample was initially distributed proportionally to the population size. The provincial buy-in samples and the use of a rejective method, described below,affected the sub-provincial allocations. Ontario and Manitoba's buy-in samples imposedminimum requirements by health regions, while N.B. and B.C. paid for additional samplecoverage of certain areas only. In B.C. most of the buy-in requirement was met usingtelephone interviews from a Random-Digit Dialling (RDD) sample of telephone numbers.In applying the rejective method, sample sizes were inflated by the number of householdsexpected to be screened out of the sample.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 10Table 1 below gives the sample sizes expected by province. Numbers represent in-scope private occupied dwellings before non-response, which was anticipated to be near 10%. Table 1: Sample Sizes for the NPHS Household sample sizes Province Original Buy-in To interview Screened out Total Allocation sample Nfld 1,220 1,221 23,200 3,229 26,429 (1) Excludes RDD portion. (2) RDD portion. 5.2 The Rejective Approach The survey content primarily focuses on one member in each sample household who is chosen at random to become the longitudinal panel respondent. The panelunderrepresents persons coming from large households, typically parents and children,since they have less chance of being chosen and overrepresents persons coming fromsmall households, often single people or the elderly.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 11A rejective approach has been adopted to increase the representation of parents and youths in the panel. A portion of the sample is pre-identified for screening. After theirmember roster is completed, screened households that have no member aged under 25years drop out of the survey. In order to maintain the required sample sizes, the numberof households visited in each province is increased by the anticipated number ofhouseholds screened out in this way. The rejective method with an under 25-year old rule was adopted as it performed better than other rejection rules considered. For cost and operational reasons the percentagesof screened households was usually limited to 25-30% in Ontario, 37.5-40% in urbanareas elsewhere and 25-30% in rural areas. As apartment strata had a high concentrationof small households, their sample sizes were reduced instead of applying a rejectivemethod. The rejective approach was also not applied in remote regions because of thehigh contact costs there, and its use was limited in areas where sample buy-in demandswere substantial. 5.3 Sample Selection The sample design considered for the household component of the NPHS was a stratified two-stage design. In the first stage homogeneous strata are formed and independentsamples of clusters are drawn from each stratum. In the second stage dwe lling lists are prepared for each cluster and dwe llings, or households, are selected from the lists. In all provinces except Quebec the NPHS used the multi-purpose sampling methodology developed for the redesign of the Labour Force Survey (LFS). That methodologyprovides general household surveys with clustered samples of dwellings, thus making thedesign very cost effective for the listing and collection of data. The basic LFS design is a multi-stage stratified sample of dwellings selected withinclusters. Each province is divided into three types of areas (Major Urban Centres, UrbanTowns and Rural Areas) from which separate geographic and/or socio-economic strataare formed. In most strata six clusters, usually Census Enumeration Areas (EAs), areselected with Probability Proportional to Size ( PPS). In a few cases where the population density is low an additional stage is added by first selecting 2 or 3 large Primary SamplingUnits, dividing them into clusters, and drawing a sample of six clusters from each. Thenumber six is used throughout the sample design to allow a one-sixth rotation of thesample every month for the LFS. The sample of dwellings is obtained after listing operations in sample clusters are completed. As sampling rates are predetermined there are often differences betweenanticipated and obtained sample counts. Excessive sample yields are corrected bydropping a portion of the originally selected units. This is usually done at aggregatedNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 12levels and is called sample stabilisation. Note also that sample sizes are inflated to represent dwellings rather than households as approximately 15% of the dwellings areexpected to be vacant or otherwise out-of-scope. The sample design is set up to yield about 60,000 households. Surveys needing smaller sample sizes usually \"reserve\" from 1 to 6 rotations per province, a rotation being one-sixth of the total sample. Sample stabilisation is used to maintain the sample at desiredlevels, as when two rotations are reserved but the sample size needed only represents 1.5rotations. Requirements specific to the NPHS led to two modifications to this sampling strategy. The number of \"reserves\" needed was specified at the stratum level rather than theprovincial level in order to meet the specific sub-provincial sample size requirements. Itwas also required that the number of clusters selected per stratum be a multiple of fourfor variance estimation and seasonal representativity (this allowed strata to have two ormore independent samples of four clusters each - one per collection period). As NPHSusually requested only between 2 and 6 clusters per LFS stratum, similar LFS strata weregrouped to form larger NPHS strata with the required number of sample clusters. As a result of these modifications, the NPHS sample of clusters can be considered as a stratified replicated sample where strata are groups of LFS strata and replicates aretypically independent, identically distributed samples of 4 clusters each. There wereexceptions, but they are not expected to have a significant impact on survey results. 5.4 Integration of NPHS with the National Longitudinal Survey of Children (NLSC) The National Longitudinal Survey of Children (NLSC) is a household survey which will follow a sample of about 25,000 children under 12 over time. The two surveys are integrated, meaning that common data for children are collected from both and that theNPHS children's sample will be used in NLSC estimates. In the provinces the NPHS isexpected to provide a sample of 4,500 to 5,000 children to the NLSC. To obtain this sample size NPHS households where a child is selected for the panel will have the detailed questionnaire for children administered to all children in his or her family (subject to amaximum of 4). Scheduling constraints required that children not be selected for the NPHS panel before the third survey collection period (or quarter). This distorted the seasonal representativityof children in the panel and reduced their sample size. To increase the sample yield forchildren without harming the seasonal representation of other household members in the last two quarters it was decided to reassign part of the NPHS sample from the first two quarters to these quarters. As this decision was made after the sample operationsdescribed above, the shift was applied to households within clusters rather than to entireclusters.Figure 1: Repartition of ) no Children ( III ) No Children or YouthsChild selected 2NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 13Figure 1 illustrates how the sampledistribution was revised for the integration.The square on the left represents a clusterassigned to quarter 1 or 2. That on theright represents a cluster assigned toquarter 3 or 4. Households are classifiedby type into: (I) households with children;(II) other households with youths(\"Youth\" meaning under 25 years old); and(III) households without children oryouths. The sample is divided into an\"Adult\" sample and a \"Children\" sample.In \"Adult\" sample households only personsaged 12 or older can be selected for thepanel. Panel membership is restricted tochildren in \"Children\" households. If thereare no children present, then either thehousehold is screened out or a member(non-child) is selected at random for thepanel. A quarter of the sample from quarters 1 and 2, and a half from quarters 3 and 4 are designated as \"Children\" households. \"Children\" households from quarter 1 or 2 willactually be visited in quarter 3 or 4, respectively. Outside of P.E.I. the rejective methodcan be applied strictly within the \"Children\" sample. When the screening rate is at 37.5%all \"Children\" households are screened. With lower rates some of them will not need tobe screened. A 25% screening rate is illustrated in Figure 1. All the \"Children\"households from quarters 1 and 2 and one-half of those from quarters 3 and 4 arescreened. With this method the number of non-children in the panel will be approximatelythe same in each quarter. However, there w ill be seasonal differences in sample yields within each household type. For operational reasons there are no rejections and no shifting of collection periods in LFS apartment strata, high income strata and remote regions. In P.E.I. the number ofavailable interviewers did not permit shifting the collection periods, and screeningoccurred in all quarters. The \"Children\" sample in these cases is selected strictly fromclusters in quarters 3 and 4, resulting in a seasonal distortion of the sample for non-children. A programming error also caused no 12-year old to be selected for the panelin quarters 1 and 2. Selection probabilities for 12-year old were adjusted in quarters 3and 4 to compensate this, but the result is that 12 year-old, just like children under 12, arenot represented in the panel from the first two quarters.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 145.5 Sample Design in Quebec In Quebec the NPHS sample is selected from dwellings participating in a health survey organized by Sant\u00e9 Qu\u00e9bec: the 1992-93 Enqu\u00eate sociale sampled 16,010 dwe llings using a two-stage design similar to that of the LFS. The province was divided geographically by crossing 15 Health Regions with four urbandensity classes (Montreal Census Metropolitan Area, regional capitals, small urbanagglomerations and the rural sector). In each area clusters were stratified by socio-economic characteristics and selected using a PPS sample. Selected clusters wereenumerated and random samples of their dwellings were drawn: 10 per cluster in majorcities, 20 or 30 elsewhere. Sant\u00e9 Qu\u00e9bec provided non-confidential information which allowed the classification of their sample into 4 types of households: one-member households; households withchildren; other households with youths (persons aged under 25); and the rest (more thanone member and no youth or child). A household type was determined by NPHSpersonnel for the ESS non-respondents. The NPHS sample size was first allocated among the four urban density classes. To avoid having too much sample in Montreal the allocation was proportional to /G08(2W \u00b2 + 1/4\u00b2), h where W is the population share for class h, h=1,2,3,4. In each class an attempt wash made to obtain a subsample from the ESS which, as far as the selected panel member was concerned, would be proportional to the populations for the 4 household types. This wasdone by drawing a sufficient number of households from the ESS to give the requiredyield for households with children (the most underrepresented group), and then removingexcess sample from the other three household groups. An initial sample which was almost50% higher than needed was thus selected. After removing from it 2/3 of the one-memberhouseholds, 1/2 of the other households with no youths or children, and 1/6 of householdswith youths but no children, the objective was nearly attained. Considerations for seasonal representation and variance estimation, and integration with the NLSC, affected the sub-sampling in Quebec as they did elsewhere. ESS strata werethus collapsed to allow the formation of replicates, with the clusters in each replicatecovering all four quarters (two quarters are covered per cluster in the rural and smallurban sectors as sample sizes are higher there). The sample of households with childrenwas split into an \"Adult\" sample and a \"Children\" sample by a 3:2 ratio, the terms havingthe same meaning as in other provinces. \"Children\" sample households in quarters 1 and2 were reassigned to quarters 3 and 4. As NPHS surveys the current occupants ofdwellings selected for the ESS, and changes will have occurred in some of thosedwellings, the samples of households without children for quarters 3 and 4 are also to besplit, by a 2:3 ratio, into an \"Adult\" and a \"Children\" sample.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 156. Data Collection 6.1 Questionnaire Design and Data Collection Method The NPHS questions were designed for Computer Assisted Interviewing(CAI), which meant that, as the questions were developed, the associated logical flow into and out ofthe questions were programmed. This included specifying the type of answer required,the minimum and maximum values, on-line edits associated with the question and whatto do in case of item non-response. With CAI, the interview can be monitored based on answers provided by the respondent. Some valuable controls include directing the skip patterns based on responses or fixingminimum and maximum values . On-screen prompts are shown when an invalid entry isrecorded and thus immediate feedback is given to the respondent and/or the interviewerto correct inconsistencies. Other enhancements are the automatic insertion of referenceperiods based on current dates. Prefilling of text or data based on information gatheredduring the interview allows the interviewer to proceed without having to search back atprevious answers. This type of prefill includes such things as using the correct name orgender within the questions themselves. Allowable ranges/answers based on datacollected during the interviewer can also be programmed . In other words thequestionnaire can be customized to the respondent - based on data collected at that time. 6.2 Tests A number of tests were conducted before the main survey was implemented in the field. Focus groups were held in the development stages of the questionnaires to verify various aspects of their content. The main objectives were to verify the clarity and the quality ofthe questions, respondent reactions to sections that were felt to be sensitive (mentalhealth, alcohol, etc.), and to obtain approximate times for the length of the differentsections. Two field tests were also conducted. The tests involved four of Statistics Canada's Regional Offices and interviews were carried out by experienced Labour Force Surveyinterviewers. The main objectives of the two tests were again to observe respondentreaction to the survey, to obtain estimates of time for the various sections, and to seewhat kind of response rates could be obtained. Verifying response rates was especiallyimportant in Quebec where selected respondents had participated in the Sant\u00e9 Qu\u00e9becstudy a few months before. Field operations and procedures, interviewer training, and thecomputer programme application (questionnaire on computer) were also tested. In addition to the field tests, the computer programme application was intensively testedNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 16in house to debug it and to ensure that all possible paths were being correctly followed. Computer application testing was an ongoing operation up until the start of the mainsurvey. 6.3 Interviewing Collection operations were divided in four quarters (June, August and November 1994, and March 1995) and interviews were conducted by Statistics Canada Labour ForceSurvey (LFS) interviewers, who are part-time employees hired and trained specifically tocarry out the LFS, using the computer-assisted interviewing method. All respondents were first contacted in person except for a small sample in British Columbia that was conducted by telephone using the RDD approach. Many of theinterviews,where started in person, were finished on the telephone either because theselected respondent was not available at the time of the initial visit or because the longinterview time prevented the completion of the interview in one contact. The totalinterview took an average of one hour in each household. In all dwellings, information about all household members is obtained from a knowledgeable household member - usually the person at home at the time of theinterviewer visit. Such 'proxy' reporting, which accounts for approximately 55% of theinformation collected for this part of the interview, is used to avoid the high cost andextended time requirements that would be involved in repeat visits or calls necessary toobtain information directly from each respondent. Proxy reporting was allowed for the selected respondent only for reasons of illness or incapacity. Such proxy reporting accounts for 4% of the information collected. 6.4 Supervision and Control All LFS interviewers are under the supervision of a staff of senior interviewers who are responsible for ensuring that interviewers are familiar with the concepts and proceduresof the LFS and its many supplementary surveys, and also for periodically monitoring theirinterviewers and reviewing their completed documents. The senior interviewers are, inturn, under the supervision of the LFS program managers, located in each of the eightStatistics Canada regional offices. Some households were re-contacted by Senior Interviewers by telephone after the 3rd and 4th quarters to verify the quality of work of interviewers. At the time of the re-contact,the household composition was verified and an assessment of the interviewer's work wasobtained.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 176.5 Non-Response to the NPHS Interviewers are instructed to make all reasonable attempts to obtain NPHS interviews with members of eligible households. For individuals who at first refuse to participate inthe NPHS, a letter is sent from the Regional Office to the dwelling address stressing theimportance of the survey and the household's cooperation. This is followed by a secondcall (or visit) from the interviewer. For cases in which the timing of the interviewer's call(or visit) is inconvenient, an appointment is arranged to call back at a more convenienttime. For cases in which there is no one home, numerous call backs are made. Under nocircumstances are sampled dwellings repl aced by other dwe llings for reasons of non- response. Each quarter, after all attempts to obtain interviews have been made, a small number of non-responding households remain. 6.6 Non-response follow-up Many strategies were put in place to reduce the number of non-response cases. Before interviews started, a maximum recommended assignment size by interviewer wascalculated based on test results to allow efficient follow-up of no contact cases (i.e. toavoid over burdening interviewers). Interviewer procedures included ways of reducing the number of no-contacts by making visits at various times of the day or on the way to or from other dwellings, talking toneighbours or landlords to determine who lives in the dwelling and obtain telephonenumbers, etc. Refusals were followed-up by Senior Interviewers, Project Supervisors or by other Interviewers to try to convince respondents to participate in the survey. In addition to the two official languages, the questionnaires were translated in Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Punjabee and Italian to try to reduce the number of non-interviewsdue to language problems. To maximize the response rate, a large number of non-response cases were also followed- up in subsequent quarters.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 18NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 197. Data Processing 7.1 Data Capture Because NPHS used CAI, capture was part of the data collection process. The data collected during the interview were recorded directly onto a laptop computer. Eachquestion is represented by a screen on the computer. After the answer to each questionis entered, the next question appears automatically on the screen. 7.2 Editing Some editing usually done at Head Office has been performed on-line in the (CAI) application and are performed during data collection. The editing to deal with out ofrange values and flow errors were controlled through the use of CAI. These types oferrors were controlled by CAI by not allowing invalid values to be entered as responses,and by not allowing incorrect question paths to be followed. For example, CAI ensuredthat questions that did not apply to the respondent and therefore should not have beenanswered did not have responses in them. In other situtations, warning messages wereinvoked, but no corrective action was taken if an interviewer entered contradictoryresponses between questions. Because no corrective action was taken in such instances,edits were developed to be performed after data collection at Head Office.Inconsistencies were usually corrected by setting one or both of the variables in questionto \"not stated\". No imputation was performed. 7.3 Coding Several questions allowing write-in responses had the write-in information coded into either new unique categories, or to a listed category if the write-in information duplicateda listed category. Where possible (e.g. occupation, industry, diseases), the codingfollowed either the standard classification systems as used in the Census of the Populationor in other Statistics Canada Surveys such as the Health and Activity Limitation Surveyand General Social Survey-cycle 6. 7.4 Creation of Derived Variables A number of variables on the file have been derived by using items found on the NPHS questionnaires in order to facilitate data analysis. Derived variable names generally startwith DV and are followed by characters referring to the question number or subject. Insome cases, the derived variables are straightforward and involve collapsing of categories.In other cases, several variables have been combined to create a new variable. AppendixF provides the details on how these variables were derived. NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 207.5 Weighting The principle behind estimation in a probability sample such as the NPHS is that each person in the sample \"represents\", besides himself or herself, several other persons not inthe sample. For example, in a simple random 2% sample of the population, each personin the sample represents 50 persons in the population. In the terminology used here, it canbe said that each person has a weight of 50. The weighting phase is a step which calculates, for each person, what their associated weight is. This weight appears on the microdata file, and must be used to derivemeaningful estimates from the survey. For example, if the number of individuals whosmoke daily (see question SMOK-Q2 in section 9.2) is to be estimated, it is done byselecting the records referring to those individuals in the sample having that characteristicand summing the weights entered on those records. Details of the method used to calculate these weights are presented in Chapter 11. 7.6 Suppression of Confidential Information It should be noted that the 'Public Use' microdata files described above differ in a number of important respects from the survey 'master' files held by Statistics Canada. Thesedifferences are the result of actions taken to protect the anonymity of individual surveyrespondents. Users requiring access to information excluded from the microdata files maypurchase custom tabulations. Estimates generated will be released to the user, subject tomeeting the guidelines for analysis and release outlined in Section 9 of this document.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 218. Data Quality 8.1 Response Rates The calculation of response rates for the NPHS was complicated by two factors which are unique to this survey. The first problem occurred as a result of using the rejectivemethod. Recall that a certain percentage of dwellings were designated as EFR (seeSection 5.2 for more details). Households which were ultimately rejected do notcontribute to the estimates,but are considered as household respondents since theyprovided the information that the NPHS requested. The EFR households that did notrespond are considered to be non-respondents (as are non-EFR households that did notrespond). Secondly, the integration of the NPHS with the NLSC complicated the calculation of the response rate for the selected persons. Recall that in certain pre-determined dwellings,if at least one child under twelve years old was found, then a child was the selected personand he/she was administered the NLSC questionnaire. In these cases, there was norespondent to the NPHS selected person questionnaire. For this reason, these dwellingsare considered to be out of scope for the purpose of calculating the NPHS selected personresponse rate. The following is a description of how the Household response rate and the Selected Person response rate were calculated. It should be noted that out of scope dwellings(vacant or abandoned dwe llings, dwellings under construction, or households not eligible for the sample) were not used in any of the calculations. Household response rate HH response rate = # of responding households including rejected households all in-scope households A non-rejected responding household had at least one general component questionnaire completed for a member of the household. The household response rate at the Canadalevel for the NPHS was 88.7%. At the provincial level, this rate varied from 85.2% in Ontario to 93.2% in Alberta. Selected person response rate The selected person response rate can be thought of as the number of health component questionnaires that were completed as compared to the number which should have been completed.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 22SP response rate= # of completed health component questionnaires # of persons eligible to answer the health component questionnaire where the number of persons eligible to answer the health component is equal to the number of non-rejected responding households, minus the number of dwellings where achild who was less than 12 years old was the selected person. The selected person response rate for the NPHS was 96.1% at the Canada level, and ranged from 94.7% in Nova Scotia to 97.6% in Saskatchewan. It should be noted that because of the complications described above, multiplying the two rates together gives a meaningless value. The information that is used to calculate theserates is different in each case, and therefore a combined rate cannot be determined. Relevant information for Calculation of Response Rates: Number of respondents at the household level: rejected households: child was non-respondents at at out of scope households: 4512Calculation of Household response rate:HH Rate = = 17626 = 18342NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 238.2 Survey Errors The survey produces estimates based on information collected from and about a sample of individuals. Somewhat different estimates might have been obtained if a completecensus had been taken using the same questionnaire, interviewers, supervisors, processingmethods, etc. as those actually used in the survey. The difference between the estimatesobtained from the sample and those resulting from a complete count taken under similarconditions is called the sampling error of the estimate. Errors which are not related to sampling may occur at almost every phase of a survey operation. Interviewers may misunderstand instructions, respondents may make errorsin answering questions, the answers may be incorrectly entered on the questionnaire anderrors may be introduced in the processing and tabulation of the data. These are allexamples of non-sampling errors . Over a large number of observations, randomly occurring errors will have little effect on estimates derived from the survey. However, errors occurring systematically willcontribute to biases in the survey estimates. Considerable time and effort was made toreduce non-sampling errors in the survey. Quality assurance measures were implementedat each step of the data collection and processing cycle to monitor the quality of the data.These measures included the use of highly skilled interviewers, extensive training ofinterviewers with respect to the survey procedures and questionnaire, observation ofinterviewers to detect problems on CAI questionnaire or misunderstanding of instructions,procedures to ensure that data collection errors were minimized. A major source of non-sampling errors in surveys is the effect of non-response on the survey results. The extent of non-response varies from partial non-response (failure toanswer just one or some questions) to total non-response. Partial non-response to NPHSwas basically non-existent; once the questionnaire was started, it tended to be completedwith very little non-response. Total non-response occurred because the interviewer waseither unable to contact the respondent, no member of the household was able to providethe information, or the respondent refused to participate in the survey. Total non-response was handled by adjusting the weight of households who responded to the surveyto compensate for those who did not respond. In most cases, partial non-response to the survey occurred when the respondent did not understand or misinterpreted a question, refused to answer a question, could not recallthe requested information, or could not provide non-proxy information. Since it is an unavoidable fact that estimates from a sample survey are subject to sampling error, sound statistical practice calls for researchers to provide users with some indicationof the magnitude of this sampling error. This section of the documentation outlines the.003 .24x100% /G0A1.25%NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 24measures of sampling error which Statistics Canada commonly uses and which it urges users producing estimates from this microdata file to use also. The basis for measuring the potential size of sampling errors is the standard error of the estimates derived from survey results. However, because of the large variety of estimates that can be produced from a survey, the standard error of an estimate is usually expressed relative to the estimate to which itpertains. This resulting measure, known as the coefficient of variation (C.V) of anestimate, is obtained by dividing the standard error of the estimate by the estimate itselfand is expressed as a percentage of the estimate. For example, suppose that, based upon the survey results, one estimates that 24% of Canadians aged 12 and over are daily cigarettes smokers is found to have standard errorof .003. Then the coefficient of variation of the estimate is calculated as:NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 259. Guidelines For Tabulation, Analysis And Release This section of the documentation outlines the guidelines to be adhered to by users tabulating, analyzing, publishing or otherwise releasing any data derived from the survey microdata tapes.With the aid of these guidelines, users of microdata should be able to produce figures that are inclose agreement with those produced by Statistics Canada and, at the same time, will be able todevelop currently unpublished figures in a manner consistent with these established guidelines. 9.1 Rounding Guidelines In order that estimates for publication or other release derived from these microdata tapes correspond to those produced by Statistics Canada, users are urged to adhere to thefollowing guidelines regarding the rounding of such estimates: a) Estimates in the main body of a statistical table are to be rounded to the nearest hundred units using the normal rounding technique. In normal rounding, if the first or only digit to be dropped is 0 to 4, the last digit to be retained is not changed. If the first or only digit to be dropped is 5 to 9, the last digit to be retained is raised by one.For example, in normal rounding to the nearest 100, if the last two digits are between00 and 49, they are changed to 00 and the preceding digit (the hundreds digit) is left unchanged. If the last digits are between 50 and 99 they are changed to 00 and the preceding digit is incremented by 1. b) Marginal sub-totals and totals in statistical tables are to be derived from their corresponding unrounded components and then are to be rounded themselves to the nearest 100 units using normal rounding. c) Averages, proportions, rates and percentages are to be computed from unrounded components (i.e. numerators and/or denominators) and then are to be rounded themselves to one decimal using normal rounding. In normal rounding to a singledigit, if the final or only digit to be dropped is 0 to 4, the last digit to be retained is notchanged. If the first or only digit to be dropped is 5 to 9, the last digit to be retained is increased by 1. d) Sums and differences of aggregates (or ratios) are to be derived from their corresponding unrounded components and then are to be rounded themselves to the nearest 100 units (or the nearest one decimal) using normal rounding. e) In instances where, due to technical or other limitations, a rounding technique other than normal rounding is used resulting in estimates to be published or otherwise released which differ from corresponding estimates published by Statistics Canada, users are urged to note the reason for such differences in the publication or releasedocument(s).NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 26f) Under no circumstances are unrounded estimates to be published or otherwise released by users. Unrounded estimates imply greater precision than actually exists. 9.2 Sample Weighting Guidelines for Tabulation The sample design used for the NPHS was not self-weighting. That is to say, the sampling weights are not identical for all individuals in the sample. When producingsimple estimates, including the production of ordinary statistical tables, users must applythe proper sampling weight. If proper weights are not used, the estimates derived from the microdata tapes cannot beconsidered to be representative of the survey population, and will not correspond to thoseproduced by Statistics Canada. Users should also note that some software packages may not allow the generation of estimates that exactly match those available from Statistics Canada, because of theirtreatment of the weight field. 9.2.1 Definitions of types of estimates: Categorical vs. Quantitative Before discussing how the NPHS data can be tabulated and analyzed, it is useful to describe the two main types of point estimates of population characteristicswhich can be generated from the microdata file for the National Population HealthSurvey. Categorical Estimates: Categorical estimates are estimates of the number, or percentage of the surveyed population possessing certain characteristics or falling into some defined category.The number of individuals who smoke daily is an example of such an estimate.An estimate of the number of persons possessing a certain characteristic may alsobe referred to as an estimate of an aggregate. Example of Categorical Question: SMOK-Q2: At the present do/does ... smoke cigarettes daily, ccasionally or not at all? __ Daily __ Occasionally__ Not allX/Y YNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 27Quantitative Estimates: Quantitative estimates are estimates of totals or of means, medians and other measures of central tendency of quantities based upon some or all of the membersof the surveyed population. They also specifically involve estimates of the form where is an estimate of surveyed population quantity total and is an estimateof the number of persons in the surveyed population contributing to that totalquantity. An example of a quantitative estimate is the average number of cigarettes smoked per day by individuals who smoke daily. The numerator is an estimate of the totalnumber of cigarettes smoked per day by individuals who smoke daily, and itsdenominator is an estimate of the number of individuals who smoke daily. Example of Quantitative Question : SMOK-Q4: How many cigarettes do/does you/he/she smoke each day now? |_|_| Number of Cigarettes 9.2.2 Tabulation of Categorical Estimates Estimates of the number of people with a certain characteristic can be obtained from the microdata file by summing the final weights of all records possessing thecharacteristic(s) of interest. Proportions and ratios of the form are obtainedby: a) summing the final weights of records having the characteristic of interest for the numerator ( ), b) summing the final weights of records having the characteristic of interest for the denominator ( ), then c) dividing the numerator estimate by the denominator estimate. 9.2.3 Tabulation of Quantitative Estimates Estimates of quantities can be obtained from the microdata file by multiplying the value of the variable of interest by the final weight for each record, then su mming this quantity over all records of interest. For example, to obtain an estimate of thetotal number of cigarettes smoked each day by individuals who smoke daily, multiply the value reported in question SMOK-Q4 by the final weight for therecord, then sum this value over all records with a response of 'daily' to SMOK-Q2.X/Y X YNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 28To obtain a weighted average of the form , the numerator ( ) is calculated as for a quantitative estimate and the denominator ( ) is calculated as for acategorical estimate. For example, to estimate the average number of cigarettes smoked per day by individuals who smoke daily, a) estimate the total number of cigarettes smoked per day by individuals who smoke daily as described above, b) estimate the number of individuals who smoke daily by summing the final weights of all records with a response of 'daily' to SMOK-Q2, then c) divide estimate (a) by estimate (b). 9.3 Guidelines for Statistical Analysis The National Population Health Survey is based upon a complex design, with stratification and multiple stages of selection, and unequal probabilities of selection ofrespondents. Using data from such complex surveys presents problems to analystsbecause the survey design and the selection probab ilities affect the estimation and variance calculation procedures that should be used. While many analysis procedures found in statistical packages allow weights to be used, the meaning or definition of the weight in these procedures differs from that which isappropriate in a sample survey framework, with the result that while in many cases theestimates produced by the packages are correct, the variances that are calculated arealmost meaningless. For many analysis techniques (for example linear regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance), a method exists which can make the application of standard packages moremeaningful. If the weights on the records are rescaled so that the average weight is one(1), then the results produced by the standard packages will be more reasonable; they stillwill not take into account the stratification and clustering of the sample's design, but they will take into account the unequal probab ilities of selection. The rescaling can be accomplished by using in the analysis a weight which is equal to the original weightdivided by the average of the original weights for the sampled units (people) contributingto the estimator in question. In order to provide a means of assessing the quality of tabulated estimates, Statistics Canada has produced a set of Approximate Sampling Variability Tables (commonlyreferred to as \"C.V. Tables\") for the NPHS. These tables can be used to obtainapproximate coefficients of variation for categorical-type estimates and proportions. SeeChapter 10 for more details.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 299.4 Release Guidelines Before releasing and/or publishing any estimate from these microdata tapes, users should first determine the number of sampled respondents who contribute to the calculation ofthe estimate. If this number is less than 30, the weighted estimate should not be releasedregardless of the value of the coefficient of variation for this estimate. For weightedestimates based on sample sizes of 30 or more, users should determine the coefficient ofvariation of the rounded estimate and follow the guidelines below. Sampling Variability Guidelines Type of Estimate cv (in %) Guidelines 1. Unqualified 0.0 - 16.5 Estimates can be considered for general unrestricted release. Requires no special notation. 2. Qualified 16.6 - 25.0 Estimates can be considered for general unrestricted release but should be accompanied by a warningcautioning subsequent users of the high samplingvariability associated with the estimates.

Confidential 25.1 - 33.3 Estimates can be considered for general unrestricted release only when sampling variabilities are obtainedusing an exact variance calculation procedure. Unlessexact variances are obtained, such estimates should bedeleted and replaced by dashes (---) in statisticaltables. 4.

In statistical tables, such estimates should be deleted and replaced by dashes(--) NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 30NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 3110. APPROXIMATE SAMPLING VARIABILITY TABLES In order to supply coefficients of variation which would be applicable to a wide variety ofcategorical estimates produced from this microdata file and which could be readily accessedby the user, a set of Approximate Sampling Variability Tables has been produced. These\"look-up\" tables allow the user to obtain an approximate coefficient of variation based on thesize of the estimate calculated from the survey data. The coefficients of variation (C.V) are derived using the variance formula for simple random sampling and incorporating a factor which reflects the multi-stage, clustered nature of thesample design. This factor, known as the design effect, was determined by first calculatingdesign effects for a wide range of characteristics and then choosing from among these aconservative value to be used in the look-up tables which would then apply to the entire setof characteristics. The four tables below show the design effects, sample sizes and population counts which were used to produce the four sets of Approximate Sampling Variability Tables. The four setscorrespond to both the provincial and Canada levels for both household members and selectedmembers, as well as various age groups at the Canada level for both household members andselected members.

Estimates of actual variance for specific variables may be obtained fromStatistics Canada on a cost-recovery basis. The use of actual variance estimates would allow usersto release otherwise unreleaseable estimates, i.e. estimates with coefficients of variation in the'confidential' range. Remember : If the number of observations on which an estimate is based is less than 30, the weighted estimate should not be released regardless of the value of the coefficient of variation forthis estimate. This is because the formulas used for estimating the variance do not hold true forsmall sample sizes. 10.1 How to use the C.V. tables for Categorical Estimates The following rules should enable the user to determine the approximate coefficients ofvariation from the Sampling Variability Tables for estimates of the number, proportionor percentage of the surveyed population possessing a certain characteristic and for ratiosand differences between such estimates. Rule 1: Estimates of Numbers Possessing a Characteristic (Aggregates) The coefficient of variation depends only on the size of the estimate itself. On the appropriate Sampling Variability Table, locate the estimated number in theleft-most column of the table (headed \"Numerator of Percentage\") and followthe asterisks (if any) across to the first figure encountered. This figure is theapproximate coefficient of variation./G29d/G0A(X1/G051)2/G08(X2/G052)2dX2X1 X1X2X1X2d /G29d/dNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 34Rule 2: Estimates of Proportions or Percentages Possessing a Characteristic The coefficient of variation of an estimated proportion or percentage depends on both the size of the proportion or percentage and the size of the total uponwhich the proportion or percentage is based. Estimated proportions orpercentages are relatively more reliable than the corresponding estimates ofthe numerator of the proportion or percentage, when the proportion orpercentage is based upon a sub-group of the population. This is due to thefact that the coefficients of variation of the latter type of estimates are basedon the largest entry in a row of a particular table, whereas the coefficients ofvariation of the former type of estimators are based on some entry (notnecessarily the largest) in that same row. (Note that in the tables the cv'sdecline in value reading across a row from left to right). For example, theestimated proportion of individuals who smoke daily out of those who smoke at all is more reliable than the estimated number who smoke daily. When the proportion or percentage is based upon the total population covered by each specific table, the cv of the proportion or percentage is the same asthe cv of the numerator of the proportion or percentage. In this case, Rule 1can be used. When the proportion or percentage is based upon a subset of the total population (e.g. those who smoke at all), reference should be made to theproportion or percentage (across the top of the table) and to the numeratorof the proportion or percentage (down the left side of the table). Theintersection of the appropriate row and column gives the coefficient ofvariation. Rule 3: Estimates of Differences Between Aggregates or Percentages The standard error of a difference between two estimates is approximately equal to the square root of the sum of squares of each standard errorconsidered separately. That is, the standard error of a difference ( = - )is: where is estimate 1, is estimate 2, and /G05 and /G05 are the coefficients of 12 variation of and respectively. The coefficient of variation of is given by . This formula is accurate for the difference between separate anduncorrelated characteristics, but is only approximate otherwise./G29R/G0AR DOCUMENTATION 35Rule 4: Estimates of Ratios In the case where the numerator is a subset of the denominator, the ratio should be converted to a percentage and Rule 2 applied. This would apply, for example,to the case where the denominator is the number of individuals who smoke at alland the numerator is the number of individuals who smoke daily out of those whosmoke at all. Consider the case where the numerator is not a subset of the denominator, as for example, the ratio of the number of individuals who smoke daily or occasionallyas compared to the number of individuals who do not smoke at all. The standarddeviation of the ratio of the estimates is approximately equal to the square rootof the sum of squares of each coefficient of variation considered separatelymultiplied by , where is the ratio of the estimates ( ). That is, thestandard error of a ratio is: where /G05 and /G05 are the coefficients of variation of and respectively. 12 The coefficient of variation of is given by . The formula will tend to overstate the error, if and are positively correlated andunderstate the error if and are negatively correlated. Rule 5: Estimates of Differences of Ratios In this case, Rules 3 and 4 are combined. The cv's for the two ratios are first determined using Rule 4, and then the cv of their difference is found using Rule3.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 3610.2 Examples of using the C.V. tables for Categorical Estimates The following 'real life' examples are included to assist users in applying the foregoing rules. Example 1 : Estimates of Numbers Possessing a Characteristic (Aggregates) Suppose that a user estimates that 5,958,122 individuals smoke daily in Canada. How does the user determine the coefficient of variation of this estimate? 1) Refer to the CANADA level cv table for SELECTED MEMBERS. 2) The estimated aggregate (5,958,122) does not appear in the left-hand column (the 'Numerator of Percentage' column), so it is necessary to use the figure closest to it,namely 6,000,000. 3) The coefficient of variation for an estimated aggregate (expressed as a percentage) is found by referring to the first non-asterisk entry on that row, namely, 1.6%. 4) So the approximate coefficient of variation of the estimate is 1.6%. The finding that there were 5,958,122 individuals who smoke daily is publishable with noqualifications. Example 2 : Estimates of Proportions or Percentages Possessing a Characteristic Suppose that the user estimates that 5,958,122/8,937,183=66.7% of individuals in Canada who smoke at all smoke daily. How does the user determine the coefficient of variationof this estimate? 1) Refer to the CANADA level cv table for SELECTED MEMBERS. 2) Because the estimate is a percentage which is based on a subset of the total population (i.e., individuals who smoke at all, that is to say, daily or occasionally), itis necessary to use both the percentage (66.7%) and the numerator portion of thepercentage (5,958,122) in determining the coefficient of variation. 3) The numerator, 5,958,122, does not appear in the left-hand column (the 'Numerator of Percentage' column) so it is necessary to use the figure closest to it, namely6,000,000. S imilarly, the percentage estimate does not appear as any of the column headings, so it is necessary to use the figure closest to it, 70.0%./G29d/G0A(X1/G051)2/G08(X2/G052)2 /G29d/G0A[(.48)(.019)]2/G08[(.73)(.015)]2 /G0A.014d d /G29d/dNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 374) The figure at the intersection of the row and column used, namely 1.1% is the coefficient of variation (expressed as a percentage) to be used. 5) So the approximate coefficient of variation of the estimate is 1.1%. The finding that 66.7% of individuals who smoke at all smoke daily can be published with noqualifications. Example 3 : Estimates of Differences Between Aggregates or Percentages Suppose that a user estimates that 2, 859,899/5,958,122=48% of those who smoke daily smoke 10 or more cigarettes daily (estimate 1) while 3,160,514/4,329,471=73% of thosewho smoke occasionally or not at all, but at one time smoked daily, smoked 10 or morecigarettes daily at that time (estimate 2). Note that these estimates are based on the resultsof questions SMOK-Q2, SMOK-Q4, SMOK-Q4A, SMOK-Q5 and SMOK-Q7. Howdoes the user determine the coefficient of variation of the difference between these twoestimates? 1) Using the CANADA level cv table for SELECTED MEMBERS in the same manner as described in example 2 gives the cv for estimate 1 as 1.9% (expressed as apercentage), and the cv for estimate 2 as 1.5% (expressed as a percentage). 2) Using rule 3, the standard error of a difference ( = X - X ) is: ^^ 21 where X is estimate 1, X is estimate 2, and /G05 and /G05 are the coefficients of variation^^ 12 1 2 of X and X respectively. ^^ 12 That is, the standard error of the difference d = (.73-.48) = .25 is: 3) The coefficient of variation of is given by = .014/.25 = 0.056. 4) So the approximate coefficient of variation of the difference between the estimates is 5.6% (expressed as a percentage). This estimate can be published with noqualifications./G05R/G0A /G0512/G08 /G0522 /G05R/G0A(.037)2/G08(.016)2 /G0A0.040NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 38Example 4 : Estimates of Ratios Suppose that the user estimates that 5, 958,122 individuals smoke daily, while 1,732,412 individuals smoke occasionally. The user is interested in comparing the estimate of dailyto occasional smokers in the form of a ratio. How does the user determine the coefficientof variation of this estimate? 1) First of all, this estimate is a ratio estimate, where the numerator of the estimate (= X ) is the number of individuals who smoke occasionally. The denominator of the ^ 1 estimate (= X ) is the number of individuals who smoke daily. ^ 2 2) Refer to the CANADA level cv table for SELECTED MEMBERS. 3) The numerator of this ratio estimate is 1,732,412. The figure closest to it is 1,500,000. The coefficient of variation for this estimate (expressed as a percentage) is found by referring to the first non-asterisk entry on that row, namely, 3.7%. 4) The denominator of this ratio estimate is 5,958,122. The figure closest to it is 6,000,000. The coefficient of variation for this estimate (expressed as a percentage) is found by referring to the first non-asterisk entry on that row, namely, 1.6%. 5) So the approximate coefficient of variation of the ratio estimate is given by rule 4, which is, where /G05 and /G05 are the coefficients of variation of X and X respectively.12 12^^ That is , The obtained ratio of occasional to daily smokers is 1, 732,412/5,958,122 which is 0.29:1. The coefficient of variation of this estimate is 4.0% (expressed as a percentage), whichis releasable DOCUMENTATION 3910.3 How to use the C.V. tables to obtain Confidence Limits Although coefficients of variation are widely used, a more intuitively meaningful measure of sampling error is the confidence interval of an estimate. A confidence intervalconstitutes a statement on the level of confidence that the true value for the populationlies within a specified range of values. For example a 95% confidence interval can bedescribed as follows: If sampling of the population is repeated indefinitely, each sample leading to a new confidence interval for an estimate, then in 95% of the samples the interval will cover thetrue population value. Using the standard error of an estimate, confidence intervals for estimates may be obtained under the assumption that under repeated sampling of the population, the variousestimates obtained for a population characteristic are normally distributed about the truepopulation value. Under this assumption, the chances are about 68 out of 100 that thedifference between a sample estimate and the true population value would be less thanone standard error, about 95 out of 100 that the difference would be less than twostandard errors, and about 99 out 100 that the differences would be less than threestandard errors. These different degrees of confidence are referred to as the confidencelevels. Confidence intervals for an estimate, X, are generally expressed as two numbers, one ^ below the estimate and one above the estimate, as (X-k, X+k) where k is determined^^ depending upon the level of confidence desired and the sampling error of the estimate.Confidence intervals for an estimate can be calculated directly from the Approximate Sampling Variability Tables by first determining from the appropriate table the coefficientof variation of the estimate X, and then using the following formula to convert to a ^ confidence interval CI: where /G05 is the determined coefficient of variation of X, andX^ t = 1 if a 68% confidence interval is desired t = 1.6 if a 90% confidence interval is desired t = 2 if a 95% confidence interval is desiredt = 3 if a 99% confidence interval is desired. Note : Release guidelines which apply to the estimate also apply to the confidence interval. For example, if the estimate is not releasable, then the confidence interval Example of using the C.V. tables to obtain confidence limits A 95% confidence interval for the estimated proportion of individuals who smoke daily from those who smoke at all (from example 2, section 10.2) would be calculated asfollows. X = .667 ^ t = 2 /G05 = .011 is the coefficient of variation of this estimate as determined from the tables.X CI = {.667 - (2) (.667) (.011), .667 + (2) (.667) (.011)}X CI = {.652, .682}X 10.5 How to use the C.V. tables to do a t-test Standard errors may also be used to perform hypothesis testing, a procedure for distinguishing between population parameters using sample estimates. The sampleestimates can be numbers, averages, percentages, ratios, etc. Tests may be performed atvarious levels of significance, where a level of significance is the probability of concludingthat the characteristics are different when, in fact, they are identical. Let X and X be sample estimates for 2 characteristics of interest. Let the standard error 12 on the difference X - X be /G29 .^^ 12 d If is between -2 and 2, then no conclusion about the difference between the characteristics is justified at the 5% level of significance. If however, this ratio issmaller than -2 or larger than +2, the observed difference is significant at the 0.05 level. 10.6 Example of using the C.V. tables to do a t-test Let us suppose we wish to test, at 5% level of significance, the hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of individuals who smoke daily at a rate of 10 or morecigarettes AND the proportion of those who smoke occasionally or not at all, but at onetime smoked daily at a rate of 10 or more cigarettes. From example 3, section 10.2, thestandard error of the difference between these two estimates was found to be = .014.Hence ,NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 41Since t = 13.16 is greater than 2, it must be concluded that there is a significant difference between the two estimates at the 0.05 level of significance. 10.7 Exact Variances/ Coefficients of Variation All coefficients of variation in the Approximate Sampling Variability Tables (ASV Tables) are indeed approximate and, therefore, unofficial. However, exact coefficients of variationfor specific variables may be obtained from Statistics Canada on a cost-recovery basis.The types of estimates supported include aggregates, proportions, ratios, differencesbetween aggregates, proportions or ratios, as well as more sophisticated types of analysessuch as estimates of coefficients from linear regressions and logistic regressions, amongothers. The exact coefficients of variation are obtained via an exact variance program,which uses a technique called \"jackknifing\". This technique involves dividing the recordson the microdata files into subgroups (or replicates) and determining the variation in theestimates from replicate to replicate. There are a number of reasons why a user mayrequire an exact variance. A few are given below. Firstly, if a user desires estimates at a geographic level smaller than the province (for example, at the urban/rural level), then the ASV tables provided are not adequate. Coefficients of variation of these estimates may be obtained using \"domain\" estimation techniques through the exact variance program. Secondly, should a user require more sophisticated analyses such as estimates of coefficients from linear regressions or logistic regressions, the ASV tables will not provide correct associated coefficients of variation. Although some standard statistical packagesallow sampling weights to be incorporated in the analyses, the variances that are producedoften do not take into account the stratified and clustered nature of the design properly, whereas the exact variance program would do so. Thirdly, for estimates of quantitative variables, separate tables are required to determine their sampling error. Since most of the variables for the National Population Health Survey are primarily categorical in nature, this has not been done. Thus, users wishing to obtain coefficients of variation for quantitative variables can do so through the exactvariance program. As a general rule, however, the coefficient of variation of a quantitativetotal will be larger than the coefficient of variation of the corresponding category estimate (i.e., the estimate of the number of persons contributing to the quantitative estimate). If the corresponding category estimate is not releasable, the quantitative estimate will notbe either. For example, the coefficient of variation of the estimate of the total number ofcigarettes smoked each day by individuals who smoke daily would be greater than the coefficient of variation of the corresponding estimate of the number of individuals who smoke daily. Hence if the coefficient of variation of the latter is not releasable, then thecoefficient of variation of the corresponding quantitative estimate will also not bereleasable.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 42Lastly, should a user find himself/ herself in a position where he/she can use the ASV tables, but this renders a coefficient of variation in the \"confidential\" range (25.1% -33.3%), the user should not release the associated estimate unless the coefficient ofvariation is recalculated through the exact variance program and it is found that theestimate is in fact releasable. The reason for this is that the coefficients of variationproduced by the ASV tables are based on a wide range of variables and are thereforeconsidered crude, whereas the exact variance program would give an exact coefficient ofvariation associated with the variable in question. The exact variance/ coefficient of variation program will be available in November of 1995 and any user interested in this service should contact Diane Stukel ( 613-951-2244) from the Health Statistics Methods Section within Household Survey Methods Divisionat Statistics Canada.

Weighting The household component of the National Population Health Survey has two basic designs: one for the nine provinces outside of Quebec, and one for Quebec. In the nine provinces outside ofQuebec, the NPHS uses the design of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) with many modifications,to generate a sample of its own. For this reason, the derivation of weights is tied to the weightingprocedure used for the LFS. In addition to the NPHS sample derived from the LFS design, thereis a small additional independent sample drawn in the Prince George health region of B.C. viaRandom Digit Dialling (RDD), in order to allow for the production of reliable estimates at thehealth region level. In Quebec, however, a two-phase sample design was implemented, wherethe first phase was drawn by the Enqu\u00eate Sociale et de Sant\u00e9 (ESS) in 1992-93, and the secondphase sample was drawn by the NPHS. Thus, in Quebec, the derivation of the weights is tied tothe weighting procedure used by the ESS. See the section entitled \"Sample Design\" for moredetails. In section 11.1 below, the weighting procedure for the provinces outside of Quebec isdescribed, and in section 11.2, the weighting procedure for Quebec is outlined. 11.1 Weighting Procedure for the Provinces Outside of Quebec To begin, the basic LFS weighting procedure is briefly described below, followed by the basic RDD weighting procedure. Then, a description of a number of other multiplicativeweight adjustments that are necessary in the formation of final weights is given. 11.1.1 LFS Basic Weights The LFS uses a stratified multi-stage design (mainly 2-stage, but in some cases, 3-stage). For example, in those places where a 2-stage design is used, at the first stage, clusters are selected using either probability proportional-to-size, size systematicwithout replacement (PPS systematic) sampling or randomized PPS systematicsampling or the random group method. For more information on these methods,contact Diane Stukel in the Health Statistics Methods Section within HouseholdSurvey Methods Division at Statistics Canada. An LFS \"cluster weight\" is thencalculated as the inverse probability of selecting a cluster, in accordance with the above sample selection schemes. At the second stage, dwellings are selected within sampled clusters using systematic sampling. A \"dwelling weight\" is calculated as the inverse probabilityof selecting a dwelling given that the cluster which contains it is selected.An \"LFS basic weight\" is then given by the product of the cluster weight and thedwelling weight.number of rotations in an LFS stratum used (usually6) integral number of rotations in an LFS by NPHS.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 4811.1.2 RDD Basic Weights Random Digit Dialling was implemented using the Elimination of Non-Working Banks Method, which gives rise to a stratified simple random sample (withoutreplacement) of residential telephone lines. The entire RDD sample was drawnwithin three RDD strata, which were in no way related to the strata used in theLFS design in the Prince George region. Thus, an \"RDD basic weight\" is givenby the inverse probability of selecting a residential telephone line from the list ofworking banks of numbers. 11.1.3 Further Weight Adjustments to the Basic Weights All of the weight adjustments which follow are applied to the LFS basic weight, to compensate for design features specific to the LFS. However, a few are appliedto the RDD basic weights, since they are germane to that design as well(specifically, the Multiples Weight Adjustment and the Household Non-responseWeight Adjustment). Adjustment 1: Rotation Group Weight Adjustment The full LFS sample is comprised of 6 \"rotation groups\" (although in some remote areas and apartment strata this number differs from 6). In the LFS, therotation group that has been in the sample for six months is rotated out of thesample, and a fresh rotation group is rotated in to replace it. This serves to reducethe respondent burden. The NPHS requests sample from the LFS in terms ofintegral numbers of rotation groups (between 1 and 6), although a fractionalnumber may actually be required to fulfil sample size needs. For example, theNPHS may require 2.3 rotations. It will request 3 from the LFS and later\"stabilize out\" the .7 rotations that are not needed (see Stabilization WeightAdjustment). Thus, the first multiplicative weight adjustment, which compensatesfor the integral number requested, is given by: In Winnipeg there are two instances and in Vancouver one instance where, in each case, three LFS strata were collapsed together before selecting clusters within thecollapsed strata. For these three cases, an extra adjustment is made to thecorresponding LFS basic weights to reflect the fact that clusters were selected via(randomized) PPS systematic sampling within the collapsed strata rather thanwithin the usual LFS strata.number of dwellings selected by the LFS within a cluster number of dwellings actually used by the NPHS within a cluster.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 49Adjustment 2: Cluster Growth Weight Adjustment There may be clusters which experience growth between the time when a Census enumeration of the cluster takes place and the time when the cluster is listed forthe LFS. The cluster selection probability is based on the Census enumerationfigure, which may be out of date. This has the effect that the number of dwellingsin the LFS sample increases very slightly with moderate growth in the housingstock. Substantial growth can be tolerated in an isolated cluster before theadditional sample represents a field collection problem. However, if growth takesplace in more than one cluster in an interviewer assignment, the cumulative effectof all the increases may create a workload problem. In clusters where substantialgrowth has taken place, subsampling is used as a means of keeping interviewerassignments manageable. The NPHS also institutes a similar subsampling ofclusters which have experienced moderate growth, albeit the growth is not greatenough so that the cluster is considered to be a growth cluster by the LFS. Thus,the second multiplicative weight adjustment is given by the inverse of thissubsampling ratio in clusters where subsampling has occurred for either the LFSor the NPHS. Adjustment 3: Stabilization Weight Adjustment Stabilization is a means of capping the sample size within a stabilization area to prevent the associated costs from becoming too prohibitive. A \"stabilization area\"consists of clusters in the high-income and apartment frame, and consists ofgroups of strata in the regular frame. \"Stabilization\" addresses the problem ofgrowth that occurs within a stabilization area. The growth is large enough to bea concern even after cluster growth adjustment, although no single clustercontributes to the growth substantially enough to be considered the root of theproblem. This problem is remedied through subsampling within the stabilizationarea. In addition to regular stabilization, it is at this point that the fractional partof a rotation requested of the LFS but not required by the NPHS, is \"stabilizedout\" through subsampling (see Rotation Group Weight Adjustment). Thus, thethird multiplicative weight adjustment is given by: Adjustment 4: Multiples Weight Adjustment It sometimes happens that an interviewer discovers that a listing that was thought to constitute single private occupied dwelling in fact constitutes two or moresum of weights for all sampled households in an NPHS stratum /season combination sum of weights for respondent households in an NPHS stratum /season combination.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 50private occupied dwellings. This may happen, for instance, when a basement apartment is attached to a dwelling but has its own separate entrance. In this case,since interviewing takes place in only one of the two private occupied dwe llings (selected at random), the weight associated with that dwelling is boosted up bya factor of two. Thus, the fourth multiplicative weight adjustment is given by thenumber of private occupied dwellings that the listing in question actuallyconstitutes. For most listings, this adjustment factor will be one. A similar type of weight adjustment is made separately for the RDD sample. A household that contains, say, two residential telephone lines which are both listedon the RDD frame has twice the probability of being selected as one with onesuch line. Thus, sampled households for which it is ascertained that multipletelephone lines are present within are assigned a weight adjustment equal to theinverse of the number of residential telephone lines within the household. Notethat this adjustment is the inverted version of the adjustment made for LFSmultiple dwellings. Adjustment 5: Household Non-response Weight Adjustment Despite all the attempts made by the interviewers, some non-response at the household level is inevitable. Non-response encompasses any of the followingsituations: refusal, special circumstance, language barrier, no one at home,temporarily absent or computer problem. Non-response is compensated for byproportionally adjusting the weights of responding households. This fifthadjustment is given by: Note that this adjustment is made at the NPHS stratum level for each season. Here, NPHS strata are groups of LFS strata. The adjustment was made at thislevel since it was the smallest geographic level which ensured stability (i.e.,adjustments less than or equal to 2.5). The adjustment was calculated separatelyfor each season since the non-response rate was significantly different for eachseason. Here, the first two quarters of collection constitute the summer \"season\"while the last two quarters of collection constitute the winter \"season\". For thosefew cases where the nonresponse adjustment exceeded 2.5, the adjustment wasrecalculated at the NPHS stratum level rather than at the NPHS stratum/seasonlevel. The \"weights\" referred to above are the LFS basic weight multiplied by allthe adjustments to this point (i.e., weight adjustments one through four). Theadjustment is based on the assumption that the households that were actuallyNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 51interviewed represent the characteristics of those that should have been interviewed. To the extent that this assumption is not true, the estimates aresomewhat biased. Note that some non-respondents in a given collection periodwere successfully recontacted in a later period. These cases were treated as if theyhad responded in the collection period in which they were intended to beinterviewed. Given the number of such cases, it is not expected that this will havea significant effect on seasonal data. Since the RDD sample also experiences household non-response, a separate weight adjustment is made to compensate for this, although the method ofadjustment used is almost identical to the one above. The first difference is thatthe weight adjustment is now made at the level of RDD stratum and season. Thesecond difference is that the \"weights\" referred to in the formula are now theRDD basic weights multiplied by the RDD Multiples Weight Adjustment. Adjustment 6: Rejective Method Weight Adjustment As discussed in the section entitled \"Sample Design\", in the last two quarters of data collection a portion of the sampled households are screened out or rejectedfrom the sample after determining that there are no youths or children residingwithin (i.e., no one under the age of 25). These \"rejected\" households come fromthat portion of the \"Children Sample\" that are \"screened\" for householdcomposition. This methodology was implemented to compensate for an over-representation in the sample of members of small sized households and an under-representation of members of large sized households. The latter type of householdtends to consist of parents and their children while the former type tends toconsist of single people, older people or couples without children. Since some ofthe households containing no youths or children are screened out or \"rejected\",representation in the sample of households of this type comes solely from the\"Adult Sample\" and from the non-screened portion of the \"Children Sample\".Thus, to compensate for the \"rejected\" part of the sample, the weights for thosehouseholds containing no youths or children from the \"Adult Sample\" and fromthe non-screened portion of the \"Children Sample\" are boosted by anothermultiplicative weight adjustment. This sixth adjustment is given by the inverse ofone minus the overall screening rate within a stratum. Note that in P.E.I., thisadjustment was implemented a little differently since, among other reasons, therejective method was applied in all four quarters of data collection rather that inthe last two quarters only. Also note that this adjustment was not applied inapartment strata, high income strata and remote strata, since the rejective methodwas not implemented there.sum of weights of all sampled household members in a province /G09age /G09sex category sum of weights of respondent household members in a province /G09age /G09sex category.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 5211.1.4 Further Weight Adjustments For Household Members Data from the household members questionnaire is obtained for each member of a sampled household. The associated final weight for each individual on this fileis obtained as follows. First, the LFS basic weight is multiplied by weightadjustments one through six, as well as the Household Member Non-responseWeight Adjustment given below, to form an LFS \"intermediate\" weight. Then, theRDD basic weight is multiplied by the RDD Multiples Weight Adjustment, theRDD Household Non-response Weight Adjustment, and the RDD HouseholdMember Non-response Weight Adjustment given below to form an RDD\"intermediate\" weight. The two independent samples (LFS and RDD) in thePrince George region are then combined via the \"Household Member WeightAdjustment to Combine the LFS and RDD Samples\" below, using the LFS andRDD \"intermediate\" weights as inputs. Finally, benchmarking is performed usingthe combined sample in the Prince George region and the usual LFS sampleelsewhere. Adjustment 7A: Household Member Non-response Weight Adjustment It may happen that, although a household itself is considered to be \"responding\", the household member information for some of the members within the householdis not complete. The members for which this is true are considered to behousehold member non-respondents and a weight adjustment is made toresponding members in the same age-sex group and province, to compensate. Themultiplicative adjustment is given by: The \"weights\" referred to above are the LFS basic weight multiplied by all the adjustments to this point (i.e., weight adjustments one through six). The agecategories used for each of the two sexes are: 0-11, 12-24, 25-44, 45-64, and65+. The adjustment for household member non-response coming from the RDD sample is implemented separately, although the adjustment itself is almost identicalto the one above. The first difference is that the \"weights\" referred to in theformula are the RDD basic weights multiplied by RDD weight adjustments fourand five. The second difference is that the weight adjustment is made withinage/sex categories in the Prince George region rather than within age/sexcategories in each province.population projection for a province /G09age /G09sex category sum of weights of respondent household members in a province /G09age /G09sex category.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 53Adjustment 8A: Household Member Weight Adjustment to Combine the LFS and RDD Samples Although an independent sample was drawn using the RDD technique in the Prince George region of B.C., regular LFS sampling also took place in this region.Since the two samples are independent but represent geographic areas whichoverlap, a dual frame approach was utilized to combine them. The approach usedwas applied within the entire of B.C. The method essentially consists of threemultiplicative weight adjustments. The first is applied to the \"RDD weights\"corresponding to the RDD sample falling inside the three RDD strata withinwhich RDD sampling took place. The second is applied to the \"LFS weights\"corresponding to the LFS sample also falling inside the three RDD strata. Thethird is applied to the \"LFS weights\" corresponding to the LFS sample fallingoutside the three RDD strata but within the rest of B.C. The weight adjustmentsthemselves are rather complex; for more details see Skinner, C. and Rao, J.N.K.(JASA, 1996). The \"RDD weights\" referred to above consist of the RDD basic weights multiplied by RDD weight adjustments 4, 5 and 7A. The \"LFS weights\"referred to above consist of the LFS basic weights multiplied by weightadjustments 1 through 6 as well as 7A. Adjustment 9A: Household Member Benchmarking Weight Adjustment Independent estimates in the form of population projections are available monthly for various age and sex groups by province. The population projections are basedon the most recent Census data, as well as records of births and deaths, andestimates of migration. In the final step, this auxiliary information is used totransform the weights to this point into final weights. The Household MemberBenchmarking Weight Adjustment ensures that the final weights sum to thepopulation projections mentioned above for the auxiliary variables in question,that is, for the following age categories for both males and females: 0-11, 12-24,25-44, 45-64, 65+. Thus, this multiplicative weight adjustment is given by: The \"weights\" referred to in the above equation involve both the LFS weights and the RDD weights to this point. For the LFS, this means the LFS basic weightsmultiplied by the last eight weight adjustments. For RDD, this means the RDDbasic weights multiplied by RDD weight adjustments 4, 5, 7A, and 8A. Since thedata was collected over four quarters, the population projections used in theNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 54benchmarking are an average of the projections for the four months in which the survey took place. At the last step, the final weights are formed by multiplying the\"weights\" to this point by the above Household Member Benchmarking WeightAdjustment. 11.1.5 Further Weight Adjustments For Selected Members Data from the selected member questionnaire is obtained for only one member aged 12 or more from a sampled household. The associated final weight for eachindividual on this file is obtained as follows. First, the LFS basic weight ismultiplied by weight adjustments one through six, as well as weight adjustments7B through 10B given below, to form an LFS \"intermediate\" weight. Then, theRDD basic weight is multiplied by RDD weight adjustments 4, 5, and 8B through10B given below, to form an RDD \"intermediate\" weight. The two independentsamples (LFS and RDD) in the Prince George region are then combined via the\"Selected Member Weight Adjustment to Combine the LFS and RDD Samples\"below, using the LFS and RDD \"intermediate\" weights as inputs. Finally,benchmarking is performed using the combined sample in the Prince Georgeregion and the usual LFS sample elsewhere. Adjustment 7B: NLSC Integration Weight Adjustment In the last two quarters of data collection, the NPHS selects potential respondents for both the NPHS and NLSC selected member questionnaire. In some sampledhouseholds, a maximum of 4 children (aged less than 12) are selected, but areadministered the NLSC questionnaire. Their data does not reside on the presentmicrodata file. In other households, the one respondent aged 12 or older isselected and administered the NPHS questionnaire. The data for theserespondents resides on the present microdata file. For more details on integrationwith the NLSC, see the section entitled \"Sample Design\". The respondents aged12 or more from households containing children are selected from the \"AdultSample\" only. To compensate for the fact that households containing childrencoming from the \"Children Sample\" do not contribute to the estimates forindividuals aged 12 or more, the weights for those households containing childrensampled in the last two quarters that come from the \"Adult Sample\" are boostedby the multiplicative weight adjustment given by the inverse of the proportion ofthe total sample which is assigned to the \"Adult Sample\". For those individualsaged greater than 12, one adjustment is made at the cluster level. On the otherhand, for those aged 12, a separate adjustment is made for groups of LFS strata(which usually correspond to NPHS strata), to be consistent with Adjustment 9B,which is also made at this level.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 55Adjustment 8B: Selected Member Inverse Selection Probability As mentioned above, one member aged 12 or more from each sampled household is chosen as the selected member. A weight adjustment must be made to reflectthe selection and is given by the inverse selection probability. The originalintention was that each member aged 12 or more would be selected with equalprobability given by the inverse of the number of members in the household aged12 or more. However, due to an error made in the CAPI application, no 12 yearold were selected in the first two quarters. To compensate, in the last twoquarters, instead of each member of a household being selected with the sameprobability, 12 year old were given a larger probab ility of selection. In P.E.I., 12 year old were twice as likely to be selected as any other member aged 13 or more,and elsewhere in Canada, 1.75 times as likely to be selected as any other memberaged 13 or more . This inverse selection probability was calculated for the RDD sample as well.Adjustment 9B: Twelve Year Old Weight Adjustment Due to the error mentioned above, twelve year olds were only selected in the last two quarters of data collection. In order to obtain an accurate representation oftwelve year olds, their weights had to be adjusted to account for the first twoquarters when they had no probability of being selected. This adjustment is madefor groups of LFS strata which usually correspond to NPHS strata, except for thecases of remote and high income strata. In households with children, twelve yearolds could be selected from the \"Adult Sample\" in all quarters, but were actuallyonly selected from the \"Adult Sample\" in the last two quarters. Since, within mostNPHS strata, 40% of the \"Adult Sample\" occurred in the last two quarters, theweights of twelve year olds selected in these two quarters were boosted by theinverse of this rate, or by 2.5. On the other hand, in households with youths butno children, twelve year olds could be selected from both the \"Adult Sample\" andthe \"Children Sample\". However, in the first two quarters, they were not selectedfrom the \"Adult Sample\" as they should have been. Thus, in households withyouths but no children, the weights of twelve year olds were boosted by amultiplicative factor given by the ratio of the percentage of the total sample withinan NPHS stratum where they should have been selected to the percentage of thetotal sample where they were actually selected, or by 1.6. Finally, in householdswith no youths or children, twelve year olds could never be selected, so noadjustment was made to the weights of twelve year olds in this household type.Note that the rates differ somewhat in P.E.I., apartment strata, high income strataand remote strata. sum of weights of all sampled selected members in a province /G09age /G09sex category sum of weights of respondent selected members in a province /G09age /G09sex category. population projection for a province /G09age /G09sex category sum of weights of respondent selected members in a province /G09age /G09sex category.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 56This was implemented for both the LFS and RDD samples. Adjustment 10B: Selected Member Non-response Weight Adjustment It may happen that, although a household is considered to be \"responding\", the information for the selected member of the household was not completed. Themembers for which this is true are considered to be selected member non-respondents and a weight adjustment is made to responding selected members inthe same age-sex group and province, to compensate. The multiplicativeadjustment is given by: The \"weights\" referred to above are the LFS basic weights multiplied by all the adjustments to this point (i.e., weight adjustments 1 through 6 as well as 7Bthrough 9B). The age categories used for each of the two sexes are: 12-24, 25-44,45-64, and 65+ since only those aged 12 or more are administered the selectedmember questionnaire. The adjustment for selected member non-response coming from the RDD sample is implemented separately, although the adjustment itself is almost identical to theone above. The first difference is that the \"weights\" referred to in the formula arenow the RDD basic weights multiplied by RDD weight adjustments 4, 5, 8B and9B. The second difference is that the weight adjustment is made within age/sexcategories in the Prince George region rather than within age/sex categories ineach province. Adjustment 11B: Selected Member Weight Adjustment to Combine the LFS and RDD Samples This weight adjustment is identical to the one for household members except that the \"RDD weights\" referred to consist of the RDD basic weights multiplied byRDD weight adjustments 4, 5, 8B, 9B and 10B. The \"LFS weights\" referred toconsist of the LFS basic weights multiplied by weight adjustments one throughsix, as well as the first four weight adjustments in this section. Adjustment 12B: Selected Member Benchmarking Weight Adjustment This weight adjustment is similar to the Household Member Benchmarking Weight Adjustment, and is given by:NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 57Here, the age categories used for both females and males are given by: 12-24, 25- 44, 45-64, and 65+. The \"weights\" referred to in the above equation involve both the LFS weights and the RDD weights to this point. For the LFS, this means the LFS basic weights multiplied by weight adjustments one through six as well as thefirst five weight adjustments in this section. For RDD, this means the RDD basicweights multiplied by RDD weight adjustments 4, 5, and 8B through 11B. Since the data was collected over four quarters, the population projections used in the benchmarking are an average of the projections for the four months in which thesurvey took place. At the last step, the final weights are formed by multiplying the\"weights\" to this point by the above Selected Member Benchmarking Weight Adjustment.NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 5811.2 Weighting Procedures for Quebec The National Population Health Survey used a subsample of the Enqu\u00eate sociale et de sant\u00e9 (ESS) in its design (see \"Sample Design\" section for more details). For this reason, the calculation of NPHS weights is tied to the weighting procedures used for the ESS.The following sections describe the ESS weighting procedures and the steps required toproduce weights for NPHS members. 11.2.1 ESS Weights The ESS contribution to the weights is calculated as follows:ESS Cluster Weights The ESS used a stratified multi-stage design. After several levels of stratification, clusters were selected from each stratum using probab ility proportional to size (PPS). The size measure used was the household count in the cluster based uponthe 1986 Census. An \" ESS cluster weight \" can be calculated as the inverse probability of selecting a cluster. ESS Dwelling Weights After selecting a cluster, a fixed number of dwellings were allocated to be selected from the cluster. Each dwelling in the cluster had an equal chance of beingselected. The \" ESS dwelling weight \" is then the inverse of the probability of selecting the dwelling within the cluster multiplied by the ESS cluster weight. 11.2.2 NPHS Basic Dwelling Weights There were two major steps to selecting the NPHS sample. First the subset of ESS clusters to be used in the NPHS had to be identified. Second the subset ofESS dwellings within each retained cluster had to be selected. Probability of Retaining an ESS Cluster for NPHS As ESS strata were sometimes very small, NPHS strata were defined as comprising of one or more ESS strata. A fixed number of clusters were allocatedto be retained from each NPHS stratum. In cases where the NPHS stratumconsisted of more than one ESS stratum, the allocation of clusters to ESS stratawas proportional to the number of households in each ESS stratum in order toproduce a PPS sample of clusters in each NPHS stratum. Fractional sample sizes were randomly rounded up or down to the next integer. Once the number ofNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 59clusters to be retained from an ESS stratum had been determined, each cluster within the ESS stratum had the same probability of retention in most cases. Theexceptions were clusters in which the number of dwellings grew by more than150% between the 1986 Census and the 1992-93 ESS cluster listing. Theseclusters were given a higher probability of retention (either 100% or 40% greater probability of retention). Probability of Retaining an ESS Dwelling for NPHS In clusters that were retained for the NPHS, only dwellings that were selected for ESS were eligible to be selected for NPHS. Those dwellings which were out ofscope for ESS (businesses, collectives, demolished or abandoned) had aprobability of one of being retained. From the ESS in scope dwe llings, a fixed number of dwellings within each cluster were initially retained for the NPHS. A further sub-group of these selected dwellings were dropped b ecause of their ESS household composition. The probabilities that a dwelling would be retained dueto its household composition are shown in the following table. Probability of Retaining an Initially Selected NPHS Dwelling ESS Household Composition Probability of Retention Households with children (under 12 years old) 1One person households 1/3Other households with at least one youth (aged 12-24) 5/6Other households 1/2 The \"basic dwelling weight \" is the ESS dwelling weight times the inverse of the product of the ESS cluster retention probability and the ESS dwelling retention probability. The ESS dwellingretention probability includes both the probability of a dwe lling being initially retained for NPHS and the probability of being retained due to its household composition. 11.2.3 Further Weight Adjustments to the Basic Weights Multiples Weight Adjustment Sometimes when an interviewer visited a dwelling, he/she found an extra dwe lling that was missed during cluster listing. An example of this might be a basementapartment. In this case each dwe lling is known as a multiple. When this occurred, one dwelling was selected at random and interviewed. The weight of the selected dwelling is then adjusted by a multiplicative factor equal to the number ofmultiples.NPHS count ESS count number of extra dwellings listed number of extra dwellings selected sum of weights for respondent and nonrespondent households sum of weights for respondent householdsNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 60Cluster Growth Weight Adjustment In a few cases, clusters were relisted by NPHS. If there was a growth of 15-30% between ESS counts and NPHS counts, then a multiplicative weight adjustmentof is made to each selected dwe lling within the cluster. If the growth was less than 15% then the growth is assumed to be negligible and this adjustment is set to one.For all of these dwellings, the multiples and cluster growth adjustments aremultiplied by the basic dwelling weight to give a \" preliminary weight \". If the growth was over 30% then extra dwellings were selected for NPHS from the extra dwellings listed within the cluster. For these selected extra dwe llings, the \"preliminary weight \" is the inverse of the product of the ESS cluster selection probability and NPHS cluster retention probability multiplied by and the multiples adjustments. Since none of these dwellings were interviewed by ESS, there is no way to categorize them into one of the ESS householdcomposition categories. Household Nonresponse Weight Adjustment Nonresponse is inevitable in almost all surveys and NPHS is no exception. To adjust for total nonresponding households, the following adjustment is made The weight in this case is the preliminary weight. A separate adjustment is done within a nonresponse weighting area. For the ESS in scope dwellings the nonresponse weighting areas are defined as an intersectionof an NPHS stratum and ESS household type (the four ESS householdcomposition categories described in Table 1) by quarter. If this produces a highsum of weights for respondent and nonrespondent individuals in an age /G09sex category sum of weights for respondent individuals in an age /G09sex categoryNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 61adjustment factor (greater than 2.5), then household types are systematically collapsed together until the factor is less than 2.5. For the dwellings which were added b ecause the cluster had greater than 30% growth during NPHS relisting, the weighting area consists of the added dwellingswithin the cluster by quarter. The ESS out of scope dwellings are grouped into two non-response weighting areas by quarter for non-response adjustment purposes. The first group containsall of the dwellings which had an ESS response code of 10 (demolished, v acant, abandoned). The second contains all of the dwellings which had an ESS responsecode of 18 (collective or business). Multiplying the preliminary weight by the household nonresponse weight adjustment produces the \" demographic weight \". 11.2.4 Further Weight Adjustments for Household Members A household members questionnaire is intended to be administered to every member of a selected household. Household members nonresponse occurs if onlycertain members of the household answer the household members questionnaire.A weight adjustment has to be made to account for this nonresponse, which wasnegligible. As a final step, the weights are benchmarked to age and sex populationprojections. Household Member Nonresponse Weight Adjustment This adjustment compensates for individuals within responding households (i.e. the demographic questionnaire was completed) who do not respond to thehousehold member questionnaire. The adjustment is equal to The weight in this case is the demographic weight. The age-sex categories are people aged 0-11, 12-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65 and over - males and females. Thereis one adjustment for each age-sex category within the province. Household Member Benchmarking Weight Adjustment Provincial population projections are available for various age-sex categories. Thepopulation projections for an age /G09sex category sum of weights for respondent individuals in an age /G09sex categoryNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 62weights of responding individuals are adjusted so that the sum of the weights of respondents in an age-sex category matches the projection. This is done using thefollowing multiplicative adjustment: The weight in this case is the demographic weight multiplied by the household member nonresponse weight adjustment. The age-sex categories are 0-11, 12-24,25-44, 45-64, 65 and over - males and females. Note that there are three northernhealth regions that were excluded from the ESS and hence from the NPHS. Theseregions account for approximately 0.5% of the entire in scope population for theNPHS. The population projections have been adjusted to account for the removalof these areas. Since the survey took place over four quarters, the populationprojections used in the benchmarking will be an average of the projections for thefour months in which the survey took place. The \"household member weight \" is achieved by multiplying the demographic weight by the household member nonresponse weight adjustment and thehousehold member benchmarking weight adjustment. 11.2.5 Further Weight Adjustments for Selected Members One member from each responding household is designated as the selected longitudinal member. If this person is a child under twelve years of age who livesin a \"Children\" sample dwelling (see \"Sample Design\" section for the definitionof \"Children\" sample dwelling) then all of the children in the household to amaximum of four are administered the National Longitudinal Survey of Children(NLSC) questionnaire. Otherwise the selected member (aged twelve and over) isasked an additional set of NPHS questions. Several adjustments have to be madeto account for this design and the nonresponse to this questionnaire. NLSC Integration Weight Adjustment In a \"Children\" sample household where a child is found, one child is chosen tobe the selected member for the NPHS longitudinal panel. This child, as well as allother children in the household, to a maximum of four, is administered the NLSCselected member questionnaire. This data does not preside on the presentmicrodata file. An adjustment has to be made to account for the adults and youthsin these dwellings who had no chance of being the selected member. Thisadjustment is only applied to adults and youths that are selected for thelongitudinal panel in \"Adult\" dwellings where children were found by NPHS. NPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 63The adjustment is equal to the inverse subsampling rate for the \"Adult\" sample. The adjustment depends upon which combination of the following categories thedwelling fell into 1) Did ESS find children in the dwelling? (yes or no) 2) Which ESS urban density class does the dwelling belong to? A separate adjustment is generated for dwellings where ESS found children and dwellings where ESS did not find children because the subsampling rate wasdifferent for these two categories. In the ESS Montreal and regional capitalsclasses, the adjustment is made at the cluster level while in the ESS smaller urbanagglomerations and rural sector classes, it is made at the NPHS stratum level. Foran exception to this rule see \"Twelve Year Old Weight Adjustment\" later in thissection. Selected Member Inverse Selection Probability In a dwelling belonging to the \"Children\" sample in which there were no children under the age of twelve or a dwelling belonging to the \"Adult\" sample, everymember aged 12 or more was originally intended to have an equal probability ofbeing the selected longitudinal member. However, due to a software error, twelveyear olds were not eligible to be selected in the first two quarters. To compensatefor this they were given double the probability of being selected in quarters 3 and4. A weight adjustment equal to the inverse probability of an individual within thehousehold being the selected member is applied. Twelve Year Olds Weight Adjustment In order to get an accurate representation of twelve year olds, their weight has to be increased to account for households where they were not eligible to be selectedas a result of the software error. This adjustment is equal to the inverse probabilitythat a twelve year old was eligible to be selected from a dwelling where a persontwelve or over was intended to be the longitudinal respondent. Recall that in the Montreal and regional capitals classes, clusters are only covered in one quarter. In quarters 1 and 2 a twelve year old was not eligible to beselected. Therefore, in order for the weight adjustment to account for theseineligible twelve year olds, it must be done at the NPHS stratum level rather thanthe cluster level. For consistency, both the integration and twelve year old weightadjustment are calculated at the NPHS stratum level for twelve year oldsregardless of the ESS class.sum of weights for respondent and nonrespondent individuals in an age /G09sex category sum of weights for respondent individuals in an age /G09sex category population projections for an age /G09sex category sum of weights for respondent individuals in an age /G09sex categoryNPHS PUBLIC USE MICRODATA DOCUMENTATION 64Selected Member Nonresponse Weight Adjustment This adjustment compensates for selected individuals within responding households (i.e., household for which the demographic questionnaire wascompleted) who do not respond to the selected member questionnaire. Theadjustment is equal to The weight in this case is the demographic weight multiplied by all of the previous adjustments made in the selected members weight adjustment section. The age-sexcategories are 12-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65 and over - males and females. Theadjustment is made at the provincial level. Selected Member Benchmarking Weight Adjustment The formula for this adjustment is the same as the benchmarking adjustment used for household members. The weights are the demographic weights multiplied by all of the previous adjustments made in this section including the selected member nonresponseweight adjustment. The age-sex categories are 12-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65 and over -males and females. Once again adjustments to the benchmarks have been made toaccount for the out of scope northern regions. The \"selected member weight \" is calculated by multiplying the demographic weight by all of the adjustments made in this section.Appendix A Questionnaire National Population Health Survey Content For Main Survey May 1, 19942Table of Contents H ousehold Record Variables........................................................................3 Proxy I nterview ..................................................................................6 Two-Week Disability ......................................................................6 Health Care Utilization .....................................................................6 Restriction of Activities ....................................................................9 Chronic Conditions.......................................................................10Socio-dem ographic Characteristics ..........................................................11 Country of Birth/Year of Activities .......................................................................24 I njuries ................................................................................26Stress..................................................................................28 Ongoing Problems ................................................................28 Recent Life Events ................................................................30 Childhood and adult stressors(\"traumas\") ..............................................31 W ork Stress.............................................................................32Self ealth Status............................................................................36 ingers................................................................39F eelings ........................................................................40Mem ory ........................................................................40Thinking........................................................................40Pain and Discom lberta Buy in Questions...................................................................54 Notes:.........................................................................................553Household Record Variables (To be collected at initial contact from knowledgeable person) DEMO_INT The next few questions will provide important basic information on the people in your household.DEMO_Q1 What are the names of all persons now living or staying here who have no usual place of residence elsewhere?(First and last names ) DEMO_Q2 Are there any persons away from this household attending school, visiting, travelling or in hospital who usually live here? ___ Yes (go to DEMO-Q1) ___ No DEMO_Q3 Does anyone else live at this dwelling such as young children, relatives, roomers, boarders or employees? ___ Yes (go to DEMO-Q1) ___ No DEMO_Q4 What is ...

In this section, the method to derive some of the more complex variables is described. It also describes some of the coding structures. Thedescriptions of the derived variables are in order of how they appear on file. All derived variablenames start with the letter \"DV\". In general, a derived variable was not calculated if any part of theequation was not answered (e.g. don't know, refusal, and not stated). In these cases the code assignedto the derived variable was \"not stated\". DVHHTP94 Household Type This derived variable was created to indicate the living arrangements within the household. It was based on the ages and reported relationships of each person to all others in the household. Code Description Derivation 1 Couple With Children < 25 Married or Common-Law couple with at least one partner being the parent of the dependent child. Noother relationships are allowed. 2 Couple With Children>25 Married or Common-Law couple with no dependent With or Without Other child(ren) < 25 years old.

It should be noted that the questions refer to a three- month period and this variable refers to a one-month period (The total frequency was divided by 3). A value of zero represents no physical activity lasting over 15 minutes. DVPAFQ94 Frequency of physical activities categories Based on DVMOFQ94 This variable classifies respondents based on their monthly frequency of physical activities lasting more than 15 minutes. DVPAF94 = DESCRIPTION DVMOFQ94= 1 Regular 12 or more times per month 2 Occasional 4 to 11 times per month 3 Infrequent 0 to 3 times per month 9 Not stated 99918DVDAFQ94 Participation in daily physical activities lasting over 15 minutes Based on DVMOFQ94 DVPAFQ94 = DESCRIPTION DVMOFQ94= 1 Daily 30 or more times per month 2 Not Daily Less than 30 times per month 9 Not stated 999 DVEE94 Energy Expenditure In order to derive a physical activity index, the energy expenditure (EE) of participants in their leisure activities should be estimated. EE is calculated using the frequency and time per session of thephysical activity as well as its MET value. The MET is a value of metabolic energy cost expressed as a multiple of the resting metabolic rate. Thus, an activity of 4 METS requires four times the amount of energy required when the body is at rest. Energy Expenditure values are calculated as follows: EE (kcal/kg/day) = Sum of (( N * D * METS) / 365) i i N = the number of times respondents engaged in an activity over a 12 month periodi D = the average duration in hour of the activity (AVEDUR)i METS = the energy cost of the activity expressed as kilocalories expended per kilogram of body weight per hour of activity (kcal/kg per hour)/365 (to convert yearly data into daily data) Met values tend to be expressed in three intensity levels (i.e. low, medium, high intensity). NPHS questions did not asked the respondent to specify the intensity level of their activities, therefore theMET values adopted correspond to the low intensity value of each activity. This approach is adoptedfrom the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute because individuals tend to overestimate the intensity, frequency and duration of their activities. The MET values are: Activity MET Value a- Walking for Exercise 3 b - Gardening, yard work 3 c - Swimming 3d - Bicycling 4e - Popular or social dance 319f - Exercises at home 3 g - Ice hockey 6 h - Ice skating 4 i - Downhill Skiing 4j - Running or Jogging 9.5 k - Golf 4 l - Exercise class, Aerobics 4m - Cross-Country skiing 5n - Bowling 2 o - Softball, Baseball 3 p - Tennis 4q - Weight-Training 3r - Fishing 3 s - Volleyball 5 t - Yoga or tai-chi 2Other Activities ( average of above) 4.2 Note: Since it is difficult to recode the category \"other activities\", the MET value used was the average of the listed activities. Some activities have MET values lower than the average,However, this approach is consistent with other studies, such as the Campbell's Survey and the Ontario Health Survey(OHS). DVEE94 was calculated from the responses to questions PHYS-Q1 and PHYS-Q2 as follows: Sum of non-missing ((PA_Q2*4) *AVEDUR * MET) / 365)) ii i for activities A to X (exclude V since V means none) where PA_Q2 *4 = number of times for 12 months for each activity A to Xi AVEDUR = average duration for each activity in houri MET = corresponding MET value in kcal/kg/hr AVEDUR calculation: Time spent on each occasion Average duration assigned (AVEDUR) (PHYS-Q3)201 to 15 minutes 13 min or .2167 hour 16 to 30 minutes 23 min or .3833 hour 31 to 60 minutes 45 min or .75 hourMore than an hour 60 min or 1 hour DVPAID94 Physical Activity Index Energy expenditure values used to categorize individuals were the same as those used in the OHS and in the Campbell's Survey Well-Being. Code Description 1 Active: Those who averaged 3.0+ kcal/kg/day of energy expenditure. This is approximately the amount of exercise that is required for cardiovascular health benefit. 2 Moderate Those who averaged 1.5 - 2.9 kcal/kg/day. They might experience some health benefits but little cardiovascular benefit. 3 Inactive Those with an energy expenditure below 1.5 kcal/kg/day 9 Not stated DVINJ194 Type of injury by body site This variable was derived by creating a matrix between all possible answers in question INJ-Q3 (type of injury) with all possible answers in question INJ-Q4 (body part injured). Each combination in the matrix was given a unique code, except for impossible combinations (e.g., concussion of the shoulder)which were assigned the code 996. Multiple injuries of the same type (e.g., multiple fractures) are classified to a single type of injury (e.g., Fractured Bones). Similarly, only one body site would be coded if there were injuries to manyareas within that site. For example, multiple fractures to both legs and feet would be classifiable tothe site Legs or Feet. Thus, a case of multiple fractures and burns to both legs and feet would be included in the code '27'. A case of multiple fractures and burns to both legs and feet would be included in the code '17'. The category 'Other' type of injury includes crushing, frostbite, foreign body, injuries not falling into one of the other categories, and unspecified types of injuries.21DVINJ194 Coding Structure Multiple Legs Systemic Sites or Feet EffectEyes (excl.

DVINJ294 External cause of injury by place of occurrence This variable was derived by creating a matrix between all possible answers in question INJ-Q6 (cause of injury) with all possible answers in question INJ-Q5 (place of occurrence). This first twodigit of this three digit variable indicates the external cause of the injury: the third digit indicates theplace of occurrence. A 'motor vehicle accident' is a transport accident involving most motorized vehicles, and can refer to the driver, a passenger, a motorcyclist, a pedestrian, a rider of an animal or a rider in an animal drawnvehicle. It excludes train, watercraft or airplane accidents unless a motor vehicle was involved. The 'Other' cause of injury category can include such accidents as those caused by electrical current, firearms, pedal cycles, ski-lifts, and water transport accidents not involving drowning or non-submersion.22Codes for question \"INJ-Q6\" 1 Motor vehicle accident 2 Accidental falls3 Fire, flames, and resulting fumes 4 Accidentally struck by persons or objects 5 Physical Assault6 Suicide Attempt7 Accidental Injury caused by Explosion 8 Accidental injury caused by natural and environmental factors 9 Accidental drowning or submersion 10 Accidental suffocation11 Hot (or corrosive) liquids, foods, substances 12 Accident caused by machinery 13 Accident caused by cutting and piercing instruments or objects14 Accidental poisonings 15 Other 96 Not Applicable 99 Not Stated New codes for question \"INJ-Q5\" The following numeric codes were taken from the International Classification of Diseases (9th ed.), Volume 1, page 569. It should be noted that these codes were designed to be used as 5th digits, onlywith the codes E850 - E869 and E880 - E928.

Based on CSTRESS-Q1 to Q4 and CSTRESS-Q12 to Q18 MIN=0, MAX=11 This general stress index is composed of items that are relevant to all respondents. The stressors include activity overload, financial difficulties and problems with relationships in day-to-day encounters. \"Don't know\" answers were treated as \"no\" answers. DVCSI294 Specific chronic stress index Sum of all true questions from CSTRESS-Q1 to Q8 and CSTRESS-Q10 to Q18 children: married: 13, single: 11, other: 10 This index measures the total number of stressors respondents were exposed to. The range of the final score varies as a function of the respondents' personal situation. For example, for persons married or living with a partner, items about relationship with partner are included. For persons without a partner, the index contains an item on the difficulty of finding someone compatible. Forpersons who have children, items about children become part of the index. \"Don't know\" answerswere treated as \"no\" answers. DVCSI394 Adjusted specific chronic stress index To adjust DVCSI294 according to the number of questions.DVCSI394 = (DVCSI294 * 16) / # of questions answered yes, no or don't know in DVCSI294 e.g. single with children: (DVCSI294 * 16) \u00f7 14 In this third index, the range of scores of the second index, DVCSI294 is adjusted as if all the items were relevant to each respondent. Chronic Stress Dimension Scores A number of sub-scores were derived to reflect the number of stressors respondents were exposed to in certain domains of their lives. They are based on a subset of items included in the chronic stress section of the questionnaire and their name reflects the dimension which is measured. \"Don't know\"answers were treated as \"no\" answers. on CSTRESS-Q1, Q2, Q3, Q12, Q18MIN = 0, MAX = 524DVCSI594 Financial problems Based on CSTRESS-Q4 MIN = 0, MAX = 1 DVCSI694 Relationship problems (with mate) Based on CSTRESS-Q5, Q6, Q7 MIN = 0, MAX = 3 DVCSI794 No mate Based on CSTRESS-Q8 MIN = 0, MAX = 1 DVCSI894 Child Problems (with children) Based on CSTRESS-Q10, Q11 MIN = 0, MAX = 2 DVCSI994 Environmental problems Based on CSTRESS-Q13, Q14, Q15 MIN = 0, MAX = 3 DVCSI094 Family Health Based on CSTRESS-Q16, Q17 MIN = 0, MAX = 2 Recent life events The three indices which measure recent life events are based on the number of negative events which the respondent or someone close to the respondent experienced in the last 12 months. Higher scores indicate numerous events. The analyses of McDowell, Boulet and Kristjansson guided the selection of the items which were part of a pool used in studies conducted by Blair Wheaton. DVRLI194 Recent life events score - items answered by everyone Sum of all true responses from questions answered by all respondents RECENT-Q1 to Q7, Q9MIN = 0 , MAX = 8 This index is composed of items that are relevant to all respondents. The events include physical abuse, unwanted pregnancy, abortion or miscarriage, major financial difficulties, and serious problemsat work or in school. 25DVRLI294 Recent Life events score - sum of all valid items Sum of all true responses RECENT-Q1 to Q10 Married with MAX=8 This index takes into account the roles that individuals are in. For persons married or living with a partner, the index includes an item about relationship with partner. For persons who have children,the index includes an item about children moving back home. DVRLI394 Adjusted recent life events index DVRLI394 = (DVRLI294 *10 ) / # of questions answered yes or no e.g. not marriedwithout children=(DVRLI294 \u00d7 10) \u00f7 8. MIN=0, MAX=10 The range of scores of the second index, DVELI294 is adjusted as if the ten items were relevant to all the respondents. DVTRI94 Childhood and Adult Stressors Sum of TRAUM-Q1 to Q7 MIN=0, MAX= 7 This index measures the number of traumatic events respondents have been exposed to during their childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Events included are parental divorce, a lengthy hospital stay, prolonged parental unemployment, frequent parental alcohol or drug use are. A higher score indicates more stressors. The analyses of McDowell, Boulet and Kristjansson guided the selectionof the final set of items which were part of a pool used in studies conducted by Blair Wheaton. DVWSI194 Work stress index Sum of all items in WSTRESS-Q1MIN = 0, MAX = 48 Respondents 15 and over who were currently employed were asked to evaluate their work situation. The 12-item index, based on a larger pool of items from Karasek, reflects respondents' perceptionsabout various dimensions of their work including job security, social support, monotony, physicaleffort required and extent of participation in decision-making. Higher scores indicate greater work stress. 26Respondents' answers are based on a 5 point scale. Score was reversed for question items D, E, H, and J. Strongly agree = 0 Agree = 1 Neither agree or disagree = 2 Disagree = 3Strongly disagree= 4 Work stress dimension scores The work stress items were subdivided into five dimensions. As it is the case for the overall index, answers to the items indicate respondents' perceptions about various dimensions of their work The name of each sub-scale reflects the dimension which is measured. DVWSI294 Decision Latitude - Skill discretion Based on items WSTRESS-Q1A, B, D MIN = 0, MAX = 12 DVWSI394 Decision Latitude - Decision authority Based on items WSTRESS-Q1C, I MIN = 0, MAX = 8 DVWSI494 Psychological demands Based on items WSTRESS-Q1E,F MIN = 0, MAX = 8 DVWSI594 Job insecurity Based on item WSTRESS-Q1G MIN = 0, MAX = 4 DVWSI694 Physical exertion Based on item WSTRESS-Q1H MIN = 0, MAX = 4 DVWSI794 Social support Based on items WSTRESS-Q1J, K, L MIN = 0, MAX = 1227DVESTI94 Self-esteem index Sum of all items of ESTEEM-Q1MIN = 0, MAX = 24 The self-esteem index reflects the amount of positive feelings an individual holds about his/herself. Scores on the index are based on a subset of items from the self-esteem Rosenberg scale (1969). Thesix items factored into one dimension in the factor analysis done by Pearlin and Schooler (1978). Higher scores indicate greater self-esteem. Respondents' answers are based on a 5 point scale: 0 = Strongly disagree 1 = Disagree 2 = Neither agree nor disagree3 = Agree4 = Strongly agree (Scores was reversed for item F.) DVMASI94 Mastery index Sum of all items of MAST-Q1 MIN = 0, MAX = 28 The index which measures sense of mastery is based on the work of Pearlin and Schooler (1978). It measures the extent to which individuals believe that their life-chances are under their control. Higher scores indicate superior mastery. Respondents' answers are based on a 5 point scale: 0 = Strongly agree 1 = Agree 2 = Neither agree or disagree 3 = Disagree4 = Strongly disagree (Scores were reversed for items F and G.)28DVSCI94 Sense of Coherence scale Sum of SCOH-Q1 to SCOH-Q13 The 13-item version of the sense of coherence scale developed by Antonovsky was used in the NPHS. It denotes the extent to which individuals perceive events as comprehensible, manageable andmeaningful. The concept of manageability is addressed Q12 are related to the comprehensibility dimension. Higher scores indicate a sronger sense of coherence. Score was reversed for questions SCOHQ1, Q2, Q3, Q8, Q13 DVHST94 Health Utility Index: This is a composite index based on all the questions in the Health Status Section The Health Utility IndexHIUI) is a generic health status index that is able to synthesize both quantitative and qualitative aspects of health. The system developed at McMaster University's Centrefor Health Economics and Policy Analysis, the Comprehensive Health Status Measurement System(CHSMS), provides a description of an individual's overall functional health, based on eight attributes: vision, hearing, speech, mob ility (ability to get around), dexterity (use of hands and fingers), cognition (memory and thinking), emotion (feelings), and pain and discomfort. In addition to describing functional health status levels, the CHSMS is the basis for a provisional Health Utility Index (HI). The HI is a single numerical value for any possible combination of levels of these eight self-reported health attributes. The HI maps any one of the vectors of eight healthattribute levels into a summary health value between 0 and 1. For instance, an individual who is near-sighted, yet fully healthy on the other seven attributes, receives a score of 0.95 or 95% of full health. The HUI value also embodies the views of society concerning health status. These views are termed societal preferences, since preferences about various health states are elicited from a representativesample of individuals. The specific HI calculated here is provisional. The societal preferences were derived from the small- scale Childhood Cancer Study using a precursor of the CHSMS and were adapted for use with theOntario Health Survey. Some adjustments were also made to the health attributes reported in the 14 Ontario Health Survey. Consequently, the HI results are preliminary and approximate. This versionof the CHSMS, however, was tested for consistency and was deemed to provide a realistic appraisalof individual health status. (For a detailed explanation of the calculation of the HI, refer to BerthelotJ, Roberge R, Wolfson MC.

Missing Missing Drugs and Missing Products35DVMHDS94 Distress score Sum of questions MHLTH-Q1A to MHLTH-Q1F The items and scoring used to derive the distress score are based on the work of Kessler and Mroczek (from Michigan University). The index is based on a subset of items from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The CIDI is a structure diagnostic instrument that was designed to produce diagnoses according to the definitions and criteria of both DSM-III-R and the DiagnosticCriteria for Research of the ICD-10. Higher scores indicate more distress. DVMHCH94 Chronicity of distress and impairment associated with distress Paired with the above scale are the questions MHLTH-Q1G to MHLTH-Q1I that assess chronicity of distress and impairment associated with distress. DVMHCH94 = DESCRIPTION CONDITION 1 A lot more than usual MHLTH-Q1H=1 2 Somewhat more than usual MHLTH-Q1H=2 3 A little more than usual MHLTH-Q1H=3 4 About the same as usual MHLTH-Q1G=3 5 A little less than usual MHLTH-Q1I=3 6 Somewhat less than usual MHLTH-Q1I=2 7 A lot less than usual MHLTH-Q1I=1 8 Never have had any MHLTH-Q1G=4 96 Not Applicable MHLTH-Q1G=6 99 Not stated Not stated DVSFS94 Depression Scale Based on MHLTH-Q2 to MHLTH-Q28 The items used to measure depression are based on the work of Kessler and Mroczek (from University of Michigan). They selected a subset of items from the Composite International DiagnosticInterview (CIDI) which measure major depressive episode (MDE). The CIDI is a structure diagnosticinstrument that was designed to produce diagnoses according to the definitions and criteria of both36DSM-III-R and the Diagnostic Criteria for Research of the ICD-10. The short-form of MDE which was used in the NPHS was developed to operationalize Criteria A through C of the DSM-III-R diagnosis of MDE. The diagnostic hierarchy rules defined in Criterion D (\"not superimposed onschizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or psychotic disorder NOS\") wereignored. DVPP94 Probability of caseness to respondents The probability of caseness to respondents(DVPP94) was assigned based on their short-form scores. A probability of caseness of 0 was assigned to respondents who denied the stem questions. DVPP94 was assigned as follows: D V S F S 9 4 = 01234> 4 DVPP94= 0 .05 .25 .50 .80 .90 DVSSI194 Perceived social support index Sum of all true responses from questions SOCSUP-Q3 to SOCSUP-Q6 The perceived social support index is composed of four items which reflect whether respondents feel that they have someone they can confide in, someone they can count on, someone who can give them advice and someone who makes them feel loved. A higher score indicates greater perceived social support. DVSSI294 Social involvement dimension Sum of valid answers of SOCSUP-Q2 and SOCSUP-Q2A The social involvement dimension is measured by two items which reflect the frequency of participation in associations or voluntary organizations and the frequency of attendance at religious services in the last year. Higher score indicates greater social involvement.37DVSSI394 Average frequency of contact index Based on SOCSUP-Q7A to SOCSUP-Q7H The average frequency of contact index measures the average number of contacts in the past 12 months with family members and friends who are not part of the household and with neighbours. A higher number indicates more contacts. DVSSI394 = CONTACT /NETSIZE CONTACT is an approximate value indicating the number of contacts for all categories (SOCSUP- Q7A to SOCSUP-Q7H). NETSIZE is a combined value indicating the existence of possible persons to be contacted (sum of flags indicating \"yes\" to parents, \"yes\" to grandparents, etc.). 38DVLVNG94 Living Arrangement of Selected Respondent Code Description Derivation 1 Unattached Individual Living Alone Selected respondent lives alone.
