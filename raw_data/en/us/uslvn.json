As the pandemic persists, economic growth in developing Asia is [projected to contract by 0.4% in 2020](/news/developing-asia-contract-2020-grow-2021)\u2014the first regional gross domestic product contraction since the early 1960s. Promoting safe, equitable, and effective access to vaccines is a top priority for ADB's COVID-19 response efforts. Vaccination programs can break the chain of virus transmission, save lives, and mitigate the negative economic impacts of the pandemic by restoring confidence in people's ability to work, travel, and socialize safely. The APVAX provides a comprehensive framework and resource envelope for supporting developing Asia's vaccine access, using two complementary components. The Rapid Response Component will provide timely support for critical vaccine diagnostics, procurement of vaccines, and transporting vaccines from the place of purchase to ADB's DMCs. The Project Investment Component will support investments in systems for successful distribution, delivery, and administration of vaccines along with associated investments in building capacity, community outreach, and surveillance. This may include such areas as cold-chain storage and transportation, vehicles, distribution infrastructure, processing facilities, and other physical investments. The component may also be used to develop or expand vaccine manufacturing capacity in DMCs. ADB financing for vaccines will be provided in close coordination with other development partners including the World Bank Group, World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), GAVI, and bilateral and multilateral partners. APVAX promotes safe and effective vaccines to be accessed in a fair manner. For a vaccine to be eligible for financing, it must meet one of three criteria. It must be procured via COVAX, prequalified by WHO, or authorized by a Stringent Regulatory Authority. Additional access criteria, such as a vaccination needs assessment, a vaccine allocation plan by the DMC, and a mechanism for effective coordination among development partners also help ensure that vaccine support under APVAX can be fairly and effectively implemented. ADB is also making available a $500 million Vaccine Import Facility to support the efforts of its DMCs to secure safe and effective vaccines, as well as the goods that support distribution and inoculation. The facility is part of ADB's Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program. AAA-guarantees available through the program's vaccine import facility will mitigate payment risks and facilitate import of these goods. This will employ the same eligibility criteria on vaccines as COVAX. Cofinancing with private sector partners could result in the Import Facility supporting $1 billion in vaccine and related imports within a year. In April, ADB approved a [$20 billion package](/news/adb-triples-covid-19-response-package-20-billion) to support its DMCs in addressing the impacts of the pandemic and streamlined some procedures to deliver quicker and more flexible assistance. ADB has committed $14.9 billion in loans, grants, and technical assistance, including $9.9 billion in quick-disbursing budget support from the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) and support for the private sector. In November, ADB announced [$20.3 million in additional technical assistance](/news/adb-allocates-20-million-help-developing-members-access-vaccines-covid-19) to establish systems to enable efficient and equitable distribution of vaccines across Asia and the Pacific. ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members\u201449 from the region. "}
