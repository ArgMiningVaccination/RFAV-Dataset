Respiratory problems can be as minor as the common cold or as serious as [pneumonia](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stp1540#stp1540-sec). They may affect the upper respiratory system (nose, mouth, sinuses, and throat) or the lower bronchial tubes and lungs. Upper respiratory system The upper respiratory system includes the nose, mouth, sinuses, and throat. When you have an upper respiratory infection, you may feel uncomfortable, have a stuffy nose, and sound very congested. Other symptoms include: - Pain or pressure in the face. - A runny or stuffy nose. It may lead to blocked nasal passages that cause you to breathe through your mouth. - A sore throat. - Laryngitis. - Feeling grouchy or restless, having a poor appetite, and being less active than usual. - Coughing, especially when you lie down. - Fever. Lower respiratory system The lower respiratory system includes the bronchial tubes and lungs. These types of problems are less common than ones in the upper respiratory system. But their symptoms are usually more severe. Symptoms include: - A cough that lasts through the day and night. It often brings up green, yellow, brown, or gray mucus (sputum) from the lungs. - Fever. It may be high with some infections such as pneumonia. [Difficulty breathing](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.tw9599#tw9599-sec). You may notice: - Shortness of breath. - Grunting, which is heard when you breathe out (exhale). [Wheezing](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stw5587#stw5587-sec). - Flaring the nostrils and using the neck, chest, and belly muscles to breathe. This can cause a \"sucking in\" between or under the ribs (retractions). - Chest pain with exertion or when you take a deep breath. Respiratory problems may have many causes. Viral infections Viral infections are the most common cause of upper respiratory symptoms. Symptoms often come on quickly (over hours to a day or two) without prior illness. Common viral illnesses include colds and [influenza (flu)](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sti150769#sti150769-sec). - Colds are minor upper respiratory illnesses. They usually go away without treatment. Symptoms may include a cough, a mild sore throat, nasal congestion, a runny nose or sneezing, and sometimes a fever. - Influenza (flu) symptoms are usually more severe than a cold. The key symptoms in adults are a fever and body aches. A headache, eye pain, muscle aches, and a cough are also common. Antibiotics aren't used to treat viral illnesses. They don't change the course of viral infections. Using an antibiotic when you don't need one exposes you to the risks of an [allergic reaction](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sta123211#sta123211-sec) and antibiotic side effects. These side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and yeast infections. Antibiotics also may kill helpful bacteria and encourage the growth of dangerous [antibiotic-resistant](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.std139567#std139567-sec) bacteria. Bacterial infections Bacterial infections may develop after a viral illness, such as a cold or influenza. They are less common than viral illnesses. They may affect the upper or lower respiratory system. Symptoms tend to be in one area. In the upper respiratory system, the most common sites of bacterial infections are the sinuses and throat. In the lower respiratory system, the most common site is the lungs (pneumonia). Bacterial infections are more common in people who smoke, are exposed to [secondhand smoke](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sts14447#sts14447-sec), or have chronic lung disease (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ [COPD](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stc123675#stc123675-sec)]) and other chronic medical problems. Antibiotics work well to treat most bacterial infections. Allergies Allergies, especially hay fever, are another common respiratory problem. Symptoms include sneezing, clear runny drainage from the nose and eyes, itchy eyes or nose, and stuffy (congested) ears and sinuses. The symptoms of allergies often last longer than a typical viral respiratory infection. Asthma [Asthma](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sta123346#sta123346-sec) is a chronic disease of the respiratory system. It causes [inflammation](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sti150782#sti150782-sec) and narrowing in the tubes that carry air to the lungs (bronchial tubes). The inflammation leads to [wheezing](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stw5587#stw5587-sec), trouble breathing, tightness in the chest, and a cough. Asthma often starts during childhood. It may last throughout a person's life. The cause isn't clearly known. Asthma is more common in people who also have allergies. Check Your Symptoms The medical assessment of symptoms is based on the body parts you have. - If you are transgender or nonbinary, choose the sex that matches the body parts (such as ovaries, testes, prostate, breasts, penis, or vagina) you now have in the area where you are having symptoms. - If your symptoms aren't related to those organs, you can choose the gender you identify with. - If you have some organs of both sexes, you may need to go through this triage tool twice (once as \"male\" and once as \"female\"). This will make sure that the tool asks the right questions for you. [severe allergic reaction](#tf7109)? [symptoms of a heart attack](#tf6936)?

Many things can affect how your body responds to a symptom and what kind of care you may need. These include: - Your age. Babies and older adults tend to get sicker quicker. - Your overall health. If you have a condition such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease, you may need to pay closer attention to certain symptoms and seek care sooner. - Medicines you take. Certain medicines, such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), medicines that suppress the immune system like steroids or chemotherapy, herbal remedies, or supplements can cause symptoms or make them worse. - Recent health events, such as surgery or injury. These kinds of events can cause symptoms afterwards or make them more serious. - Your health habits and lifestyle, such as eating and exercise habits, smoking, alcohol or drug use, sexual history, and travel. Try Home Treatment You have answered all the questions. Based on your answers, you may be able to take care of this problem at home. - Try home treatment to relieve the symptoms. - Call your doctor if symptoms get worse or you have any concerns (for example, if symptoms are not getting better as you would expect). You may need care sooner. If you're not sure if a fever is high, moderate, or mild, think about these issues: With a high fever: - You feel very hot. - It is likely one of the highest fevers you've ever had. High fevers are not that common, especially in adults. With a moderate fever: - You feel warm or hot. - You know you have a fever. With a mild fever: - You may feel a little warm. - You think you might have a fever, but you're not sure. Certain health conditions and medicines weaken the immune system's ability to fight off infection and illness. Some examples in adults are: - Diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and HIV/AIDS. - Long-term alcohol and drug problems. - Steroid medicines, which may be used to treat a variety of conditions. - Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer. - Other medicines used to treat autoimmune disease. - Medicines taken after organ transplant. - Not having a spleen. Symptoms of difficulty breathing can range from mild to severe. For example: - You may feel a little out of breath but still be able to talk (mild difficulty breathing), or you may be so out of breath that you cannot talk at all (severe difficulty breathing). - It may be getting hard to breathe with activity (mild difficulty breathing), or you may have to work very hard to breathe even when you're at rest (severe difficulty breathing). Severe trouble breathing means: - You cannot talk at all. - You have to work very hard to breathe. - You feel like you can't get enough air. - You do not feel alert or cannot think clearly. Moderate trouble breathing means: - It's hard to talk in full sentences. - It's hard to breathe with activity. Mild trouble breathing means: - You feel a little out of breath but can still talk. - It's becoming hard to breathe with activity. Pain in adults and older children - Severe pain (8 to 10): The pain is so bad that you can't stand it for more than a few hours, can't sleep, and can't do anything else except focus on the pain. - Moderate pain (5 to 7): The pain is bad enough to disrupt your normal activities and your sleep, but you can tolerate it for hours or days. Moderate can also mean pain that comes and goes even if it's severe when it's there. - Mild pain (1 to 4): You notice the pain, but it is not bad enough to disrupt your sleep or activities. It is easy for your diabetes to become out of control when you are sick. Because of an illness: - Your blood sugar may be too high or too low. - You may not be able take your diabetes medicine (if you are vomiting or having trouble keeping food or fluids down). - You may not know how to adjust the timing or dose of your diabetes medicine. - You may not be eating enough or drinking enough fluids. An illness plan for people with diabetes usually covers things like: - How often to test blood sugar and what the target range is. - Whether and how to adjust the dose and timing of insulin or other diabetes medicines. - What to do if you have trouble keeping food or fluids down. - When to call your doctor. The plan is designed to help keep your diabetes in control even though you are sick. When you have diabetes, even a minor illness can cause problems. Temperature varies a little depending on how you measure it. For adults and children age 12 and older, these are the ranges for high, moderate, and mild, according to how you took the temperature. Oral (by mouth) temperature - High: 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) and Mild: 100.3\u00b0F scanner is usually 0.5\u00b0F (0.3\u00b0C) to 1\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0C) lower than an oral temperature. Ear temperature - High: 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C) and Mild: 99.3\u00b0F Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) may include: - The sudden appearance of raised, red areas (hives) all over the body. - Rapid swelling of the throat, mouth, or tongue. - Trouble breathing. - Passing out (losing consciousness). Or you may feel very lightheaded or suddenly feel weak, confused, or restless. - Severe belly pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. A severe reaction can be life-threatening. If you have had a bad allergic reaction to a substance before and are exposed to it again, treat any symptoms as an emergency. Even if the symptoms are mild at first, they may quickly become very severe. Symptoms of a heart attack may include: - Chest pain or pressure, or a strange feeling in the chest. - Sweating. - Shortness of breath. - Nausea or vomiting. - Pain, pressure, or a strange feeling in the back, neck, jaw, or upper belly, or in one or both shoulders or arms. - Lightheadedness or sudden weakness. - A fast or irregular heartbeat. For men and women, the most common symptom is chest pain or pressure. But women are somewhat more likely than men to have other symptoms like shortness of breath, tiredness, nausea, and back or jaw pain. Symptoms of serious illness may include: - A severe headache. - A stiff neck. - Mental changes, such as feeling confused or much less alert. - Extreme fatigue (to the point where it's hard for you to function). - Shaking chills.

Self-Care Here are some things you can do at home to help you feel more comfortable when you have mild to moderate respiratory symptoms. - Prevent [dehydration](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.std120726#std120726-sec). - Hot fluids, such as tea or soup, may help relieve congestion in your nose and throat. - If you have a productive cough, fluids may help thin the [mucus](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.d19938916#d19938916-sec)in your lungs so your cough can clear it out. - Get extra rest. Let your symptoms be your guide. If you have a cold, you may be able to stick to your usual routine and just get some extra sleep. - Cough to clear your lungs. Let yourself cough if you have a cough that brings up mucus from the lungs. Coughing can help prevent bacterial infections. People who have chronic [bronchitis](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stb117149#stb117149-sec)or [emphysema](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.ste122068#ste122068-sec)need to cough to help clear mucus from their lungs. - Use saline (salt water). - For a sore throat, gargle at least once each hour with warm salt water. Use 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) salt mixed in 1 cup (250 mL) warm water. This can reduce swelling and discomfort. - For a stuffy nose, use [saline spray or nose drops](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sts14367#sts14367-sec)to wash out mucus and germs. - Try moist air. Try a [vaporizer or humidifier](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.zj1490#zj1490-sec)to add moisture to the room. Warm or cool mist may help relieve symptoms. Follow all cleaning instructions and precautions for the machine. - Be careful with nonprescription antihistamines, decongestants, and cough medicines. - If you use a decongestant nasal spray, don't use it longer than the label says. Overuse may lead to a [rebound effect](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.str2179#str2179-sec). This causes the mucous membranes to become more swollen than they were before you started using the spray. - If you have a dry, hacking cough that doesn't bring up any sputum, ask your doctor or pharmacist about an effective [cough suppressant medicine](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stc14131#stc14131-sec). - Nonprescription medicines may not work very well for respiratory problems. And some of these medicines can cause problems if you use too much of them. It's important to use medicines correctly. And make sure to keep them out of the reach of children to prevent accidental use. - If you use a decongestant nasal spray, don't use it longer than the label says. Overuse may lead to a - Be careful with dietary supplements. - If you decide to try a dietary supplement such as echinacea or zinc, don't take more than the maximum recommended dose. If you have another health problem or take prescription medicines, talk with your doctor before you take an alternative medicine or supplement. Using decongestants Here are some precautions to take when using decongestants. - Be safe with medicines. [Read and follow all instructions on the label](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.abl0812#abl0812-sec). - Decongestants may not be safe for young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends not using over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in children younger than age 2. The FDA also recommends avoiding these medicines for children younger than age 4. [footnote 1](#rsp11-Bib)If you use these medicines, always follow the directions about how much to use based on age and in some cases weight. Not everyone needs the same amount of medicine. - Decongestants can cause problems for people who have certain health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, glaucoma, diabetes, or an overactive thyroid. Decongestants may also interact with some drugs, such as certain antidepressants and high blood pressure medicines. Read the package carefully or ask your pharmacist or doctor to help you choose the best decongestant for you. - Drink extra fluids when you are taking cold and allergy medicines. - Don't use decongestant nasal sprays, drops, or gels more times in one day or for more days in a row than the label says. Overuse can cause [rebound congestion](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.str2179#str2179-sec). It makes your mucous membranes swell up more than before you used the spray. - If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, check with your doctor or pharmacist before using a decongestant.
