Americans lead stressful lives. Jobs, relationships, health, family obligations, community responsibilities\u2014they all take their toll. COVID-19 and everything that has come along with it has brought huge amounts of stress upon Americans. In \"Stress in America 2018,\" an annual survey by the American Psychology Association, 1 in 5 respondents reported an extreme stress level of 8, 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale. In that same group 69% of respondents reported physical or non-physical symptoms of stress, including irritability or anger, fatigue, feeling overwhelmed or changes in their sleep. We have compiled 5 Healthy Tips for Coping with Stress: - Acupuncture can be an effective tool for anxiety management, possibly by slowing the body's creation of stress hormones. Just be sure to visit a reputable clinic for the procedure, as there are needles involved. - Take breaks from the computer, especially if you are sitting through many meetings via video. Computer work is hard on your neck and shoulders and for many people financial work is the most stressful computer work of all. All this stress can lead to a sore neck, shoulders and back. Get up every 45 minutes to walk around and stretch. Take deep breaths. Keep your body relaxed so your emotions stay level. - Avoid stimulants - Stimulants like refined sugar and caffeine can cause excessive liver heat, leading to feelings of irritation and anxiety. To relieve stress, try a cup of soothing peppermint tea to get your liver qi flowing freely. - Eat bitter foods - Practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine believe that different flavors (sweet, salty, bitter, spicy and so on) act on different organs. Bitter foods primarily nourish the heart. Try to include foods such as bitter gourds, mustard leaf, kale and watercress in your diet. Rose tea is another great option, as it enriches blood and qi, soothing the nerves and improving one's mood. Add dried rose hips or rose petals to boiling water, steep for 20 minutes and drink. Feel free to add spices or honey to taste. Some chopped, fresh ginger helps to nourish heart qi. - Meditation will help you clear your head, lower your heart rate, reduce negative emotions and calm the Shen. Setting aside just a few minutes a day to clear your head and focus on deep breathing can help dispel anxiety. If you have trouble sitting still, you can try more active forms of meditation such as yoga, qigong and tai chi. Call today to schedule your acupuncture visit so we can work on your "}
