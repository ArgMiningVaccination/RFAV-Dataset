The first doctor he saw couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. So her grandfather tried another option: he rang for a Christian Science practitioner, whose role was to provide prayer, spiritual reassurance, and recommendations for scriptural study. According to Mr Vickers, soon after, he was healed. And from that point, Ms Hughes says, her grandfather became a devout Christian Scientist. He began sending his children \u2014 including her mother \u2014 to Sunday school, and when Ms Hughes was born, she too was brought up in the faith. How healing sparked a new religious movement Debates around conscientious objection to medicine and vaccination have reared their head anew in 2020 with the outbreak of COVID-19. Christian Scientists are one religious group that has [opted out of vaccination in the past](/news/2015-04-15/christian-scientists-exempt-from-new-vaccination-laws/6395480) \u2014 although those who spoke to the ABC for this story say a coronavirus vaccine will be a different matter. So why are questions of health and healing so important to Christian Science? The answer goes back to the time when the church \u2014 also known as The Church of Christ, Scientist \u2014 was founded in the 1870s by American spiritual leader Mary Baker Eddy. Aside from the Christian Bible, the church's main religious text is a book by Eddy, originally titled Science and Health. The tome explores the connection between Christian scripture, particularly the miraculous acts of Jesus, and the apparent benefits of a prayerful, mind-over-matter approach to healing. \"When sick (according to belief) you rush after drugs, search out the material so-called laws of health, and depend upon them to heal you, though you have already brought yourself into this slough of disease through just this belief,\" she wrote. Like Ronald Vickers, Eddy's belief in Christian Science stemmed from a personal experience with ill health. According to Andrew Ventimiglia, an assistant professor in mass media at Illinois State University, Eddy's \"discovery\" occurred in 1866, when she slipped on an icy sidewalk and fell, injuring her back and head. Doctors were unable to heal Eddy, but after reading a passage on Jesus's restorative powers from the New Testament, she claimed she felt a \"healing Truth\" and was able to walk again. \"From this moment, Eddy sought to share her experience and to teach others how to learn to heal the sick without medicine,\" says Dr Ventimiglia. Eddy went on to establish a new religious movement that, at the turn of the 20th century, is believed to have had 200,000 members. She also founded the Christian Science Monitor, a Pulitzer-winning newspaper \u2014 now primarily online \u2014 that, despite its name, is not a mouthpiece of the church. In the 2016 Census, 974 Australians reported their affiliation to the church, although followers says membership is far higher. The 'science' of Christian Science For Eddy, the term \"science\", when properly understood, \"refers only to the laws of God and to His government of the universe, inclusive of man\". While this may seem at odds with contemporary western notions of science, Dr Ventimiglia points out that in her lifetime, the lines between science, religion and metaphysics were blurrier. \"You have to put it into the context of the late 19th and early 20th century,\" he says. \"There was a lot of spiritual experimentation and metaphysical thinking, esoterism and mesmerism \u2014 ideas about what is the role of the mind, and the divine.\" For Edwina Aubin, who sits on the church's Committee on Publication for Northern-Eastern Australia, Christian Science \u2014 like science more broadly \u2014 is a \"body of knowledge\". \"What was that body of knowledge that Jesus knew so thoroughly that he could heal in so many different ways?\" she asks. \"That's the science, if you like: it's the spiritual laws that are underpinning the rule that God governs.\" Christian Scientists point to healings \u2014 not just physical, but also financial, psychological and emotional \u2014 as evidence these spiritual laws exist. The church's weekly periodical, the Christian Science Sentinel, features testimonies of healing, provided from members from across the globe. In sickness and in health Despite Mary Baker Eddy's early teachings that \"so-called disease is a mental, mortal fear\", many contemporary Christian Scientists embrace Western healthcare. \"This would be probably the biggest misconception, that somehow Christian Scientists aren't allowed to seek medical treatment,\" says Ms Aubin. \"They are, but they also may not [opt to receive it]. \"For our healthcare, Christian Scientists more often than not seek prayer as their means for healing. That's been reliable for many, and that's what they choose.\" Ms Hughes adds that while many members are \"used to turning to God for healing\", those who choose to see a doctor or go to hospital are not looked down upon or condemned. In 1998, Christian Scientists in Australia were given an exemption from the requirement to be vaccinated to be given access to childcare subsidies. Then Democrats senator Andrew Bartlett said he'd received many representations from Christian Scientists who believed the proposed vaccination requirement went against their religious beliefs. \"Christian Scientists operate within a different modality of health based on their religious beliefs,\" [he told the Senate](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22chamber/hansards/1998-03-31/0087%22). Christian Science was the only Australian church to have this exemption, but in 2015 it was deemed [\"no longer current or necessary\"](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/19/vaccination-crackdown-australia-announces-end-to-religious-exemptions) and removed by then social services minister Scott Morrison. Vaccination can 'show love for others' Responding to debate over whether religious groups would boycott a COVID-19 vaccine, Wendy Rogers, a professor of clinical ethics at Macquarie University, said it was risky to stigmatise or alienate faith communities who choose not to get vaccinated. \"I think we should be careful how we refer to people who choose not to avail themselves of medical interventions,\" she said [on a recent episode of the Minefield](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/theminefield/should-a-covid-19-vaccine-be-mandatory/12596122). \"Taking away people's choices in ways that then leaves them to suffer further harms, [when] they're taking on their own risk to get COVID themselves ... to further disparage and vilify them can be very dangerous. \"I think practical barriers that make it a little harder to opt out are reasonable, but we need to be very careful before we go further than that for people who've got serious conscientious objections to do with religious concerns, or to do with violations of bodily integrity.\" In any case, Ms Aubin says the church expects members to abide by national health regulations, and that includes quarantining and the potential COVID-19 vaccination. For Ms Hughes, receiving a vaccination is also in line with Christianity's Golden Rule \u2014 the principle of treating others as you want to be treated. \"If it's something that the country recommends we do, for the safety of everyone involved, then we will do it, because it is showing that love for others,\" she says.
